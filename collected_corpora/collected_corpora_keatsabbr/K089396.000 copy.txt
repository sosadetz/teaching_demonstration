causeless scrupl about thirdli it will employ your father time more suitabl to your like and mine becaus with more eas to himself for you see hi industri will can not be satisfi without do someth in the fourth place the manag of thi estat will gain him more respect and rever among the tenant and hi neighbor and yet be all in hi own way for my dear ad he you will see that it is alway one point in

will see that he will not have in those point a coadjutor that will be too hardheart for hi wish for it wa a rule my father set me and i have strictli follow that though i have a lawyer for my steward it wa rather to know how to do right thing than oppress one and longman ha so well answer thi intent that he wa alway more note for compos differ than promot lawsuit i dare say my dear father thi will be an accept employ to you on the sever account my dearest mr b wa pleas to mention and what a charm contriv is here god forev bless hi consider heart for it to make you use to him and easi to

one upon us and we have hardli time to thank him for one but a second and a third and so on to countless degre confound one and throw back one word upon one heart befor they are well form and oblig one to sit down under all with profound silenc and admir as to what you mention of the desir of cousin thoma and roger to come to live with you i endeavor to sound what our dear benefactor opinion wa he wa pleas to say i have noth to choos in thi case my dear your father is hi own master he may employ whom he pleas and if they are not want in respect to him and your mother i think as he rightli observ relationship should rather have the prefer and as he can remedi inconveni if he find ani by all mean let everi branch of your famili have reason to rejoic with him but i have thought of thi matter a good deal sinc i had the favor of your letter and i hope sinc you condescend to ask my advic you will excus me if i give it freeli yet entir submit all to your own like in the first place then i think it would be better to have ani bodi than relat and that for these reason one is apt to expect more regard from relat and they more indulg than stranger can have reason for that where there is such a differ in the expect of both it is hardli possibl but uneasi must aris that thi will subject you to bear it or to resent it and to part with them if you bear it you will know no end of imposit if you dismiss them it will cccasion ill will they will call you unkind and you them ungrat and as it may be your prosper lot will rais you envier such will be apt to believ them rather than you then the world will be inclin to think that we are croud upon a gener gentleman a numer famili of indig peopl and though they may be ever so deserv yet it will be said the girl is fill everi place with her relat and beleagu as you significantli express it a worthi gentleman and thi will be said perhap should one kindr behav ever so worthili and so in the next place one would not for their sake that thi should be done who may live with less reproach and equal benefit anywher els for i would not wish ani one of them to be lift out of hi station and made independ at mr bs expens if their industri will not do it although i would never scrupl to do ani thing reason to promot or assist that industri in the way of their call then it will possibl put other of our relat upon the same expect of live with you and thi may occas ill will among them if some be prefer to other in your favor then my dear father i apprehend that our belov and honor benefactor would be under some difficulti from hi natur polit and regard for you and me you see how kindli on all occas he treat you both not onli as the father and mother of hi pamela but as if you were hi own father and mother and if you had ani bodi as your servant there who call you cousin or grandfath or uncl he would not care when he came down to treat them on the foot of common servant though they might nevertheless think themselv honor as they would be and as i am sure i shall alway think myself with hi command and would it not if they are modest and worthi be as great a difficulti upon them to be thu distinguish as it would be to him and to me for hi sake for otherwis believ me i hope you will my dear father and mother i could sit down and rejoic with the meanest and remotest relat i have but in the world eye to everi bodi but my best of parent i must if i have ever so much reluct to it appear in a light that may not give discredit to hi choic then again as i hint you will have it in your power without the least injuri to our common benefactor to do kinder thing by ani of our relat when not with you than you can do if they live with you you may lend them a littl money to put them in a way if ani thing offer that you think will be to their advantag you can fit out my shecousin to good reput place the younger you can put to school or when fit to trade accord to their talent and so they will be of cours in a way to get an honest and credit livelihood but abov all thing one would as much discourag as one could such a proud and ambiti spirit in ani of them as should want to raze itself by favor instead of merit and thi the rather for that undoubtedli there are mani more happi person in low than in high life take number for number all the world over i am sure although four or five year of differ life had pass with me i had so much pride and pleasur in the thought of work for my live with you my dear parent if i could but get honest to you that it made my confin the more grievou to me and even if possibl aggrav the apprehens attend it but i must beg of you not to harbor a thought that these my reason proceed from the bad motiv of a heart taint with pride on it high condit inde there can be no reason for it to one who think after thi manner the greatest famili on earth have some among them who are unhappi and low in life and shall such an one reproach me with have twenti low relat becaus they have peradventur not abov five or with ten becaus they have but one or two or three or should i on the other hand be asham of relat who had done noth blameworthi and whose poverti a veri necessari state in the scale of be wa all their crime when there is hardli ani great famili but ha produc instanc of person guilti of bad action realli bad which have reduc them to a distress we never knew let the person who would reproach me with low birth which is no disgrac and what i can not help give me no caus to retort upon him low action which are a disgrac to ani station the more so the higher it is and which he can help or els i shall smile with contempt at hi empti reproach and could i be half so proud with caus as he is without glori in my advantag over him let us then my dear father and mother endeavor to judg of one anoth as god at the last day will judg of us all and then the honest peasant will stand fairer in our esteem than the guilti peer in short thi shall be my own rule everi one who act justli and honestli i will look upon as my relat whether he be so or not and the more he want my assist the more entitl to it he shall be as well as to my esteem while those who deserv it not must expect noth but compass from me and my prayer were they my brother or sister it is true had i not been poor and lowli i might not have thought thu but if it be a right way of think it is a bless that i wa so and that shall never be matter of reproach to me which one day will be matter of justif upon the whole then i should think it advis my dear father and mother to make such kind excus to the offer servic of my cousin as your better reason shall suggest to you and to do ani thing els for them of more valu as their circumst may requir or occas offer to serv them but if the employ them and have them about you will add ani one comfort to your live i give up entir my own opinion and doubt not everi thing will be thought well of that you shall think fit to do and so i conclud with assur you that i am my everdear parent your duti and happi daughter the copi of thi letter i will keep to myself till i have your answer to it that you may be under no difficulti how to act in either of the case mention in it letter v my dearest daughter how shall i do to answer as they deserv your two last letter sure no happi coupl ever had such a child as we have but it is in vain to aim at word like your word and equal in vain for us to offer to set forth the thank of our heart on the kind offic your honor husband ha given us for no reason but to favor us still more and to quiet our mind in the notion of be use to him god grant i may be abl to be so happi shall i be if i can but i see the gener drift of hi propos it is onli to make me more easi from the natur of my employ and in my mind too overloaden as i may say with benefit and at the same time to make me more respect in my new neighborhood i can onli say i most grate accept of the kind offer and sinc it will eas the worthi mr longman shall with still greater pleasur do all i can in it but i doubt i shall be want in abil i doubt i shall but i will be just and honest howev that by god grace will be within my own capac and that i hope i may answer for it is kind inde to put it in my power to do good to those who shall deserv it and i will take doubl pain to find out the true merit of such as i shall recommend to favor and that their circumst be realli such as i shall repres them but one thing my dear daughter let me desir that i may make up my account to mr longman or to hi honor himself when he shall make us so happi as to be here with us i dont know how but it will make me uneasi if i am to make up my account to you for so well known is your love to us that though you would no more do an unjust thing than by god grace we should desir you yet thi same illwil world might think it wa like make up account to one self do my dearest child get me off of thi difficulti and i can have no other for alreadi i am in hope i have hit upon a contriv to improv the estat and to better the condit of the tenant at the same time at least not to worst them and which i hope will pleas everi bodi but i will acquaint mr longman with thi and take hi advic for i will not be too troublesom either to you my dear child or to your spous if i could act so for hi interest as not to be a burden what happi creatur should we both be in our own mind we find ourselv more and more respect by everi one and so far as shall be consist with our new trust we will endeavor to deserv it that we may interest as mani as know us in our own good wish and prayer for both your happi but let me say how much convinc i am by the reason you give for not take to us ani of our relat everi one of those reason ha it forc with us how happi are we to have so prudent a daughter to advis with and i think myself oblig to promis thi that whatev i do for ani of them abov the amount of forti shill at one time i will take your direct in it that your wise hint of make everi one continu their industri and not to reli upon favor instead of merit may be follow i am sure thi is the way to make them happier as well as better men and women for as i have often thought if one were to have a hundr pound a year in good comingsin it would not do without industri and with it one may do with a quarter of it and less in short my dear child your reason are so good that i wonder they came not into my head befor and then i need not to have troubl you about the matter but yet it ran in my own thought that i could not like to be an incroach for i hate a dirti thing and in the midst of my distress never could be guilti of one thank god for it you rejoic our heart beyond express at the hope you give us of receiv letter from you nowandthen to be sure it will be the chief comfort of our live next to see you as we are put in hope we sometim shall but yet my dear child dont let us put you to inconveni neither pray dont you will have enough upon your hand without to be sure you will the workmen have made a good progress and wish for mr longman to come down as we also do you need not be afraid we should think you proud or lift up with your condit

said she thought you veri excus sinc no doubt there might be mani tender thing circumstanc as you wa which might be well enough for your parent to see but for nobodi els and relat of our side least of all whose futur intimaci and frequent visit might give occas for railleri and remark that might not be alway agreeabl i regard her apolog for you the more becaus i knew it wa a great balk to her that you did not compli with my request but now child when you know me more you will find that if i am oblig to give up one point i alway insist upon anoth as near it as i can in order to see if it be onli one thing i am to be refus or everi thing in which last case i know how to take my measur and resent now then thi is what i insist on that you correspond with me in the same manner you did with your parent and acquaint me with everi passag that is of concern to you begin with your account how you spent your time both of you when you were in kent for you must know we are all taken with your duti to your parent and the discret of the good coupl and think you have given a veri edifi exampl of filial pieti to all who shall hear your stori for if so much duti is owe to parent where noth can be

new will give us perhap a better tast of them their beauti and defect than we might have befor for we peopl of qualiti go to those place dress out and adorn in such manner outvi one anoth as if we consid ourselv as so mani part of the public entertain and are too much pleas with ourselv to be abl so to attend to what we see as to form a right judgment of it and inde we some of us behav with so much indiffer to the entertain as if we thought ourselv abov be divert by what we come to see and as if our view wa rather to trifl away our time than to improv ourselv by attend to the stori or the action see pamela i shall not make an unworthi correspond altogeth for i can get into thi grave way and moral a littl nowandthen and if you will promis to oblig me by your constant correspond in thi way and divest yourself of all restraint as if you wa write to your parent and i can tell you you will write to one who will be as candid and as favor to you as they can be then i am sure we shall

affair of salli godfrey but prythe pamela give us an account of the manner in which he did it and of thi thought upon it for that is a critic case and accord as he ha repres it so shall i know what to say of it befor you and him for i would not make mischief between you for the world thi let me tell you will be a tri part of your conduct for he love the child and will judg of you by your conduct toward it he dearli love her mother and notwithstand her fault she well deserv it for she wa a sensibl ay and a modest ladi and of an ancient and genteel famili but he wa heir to a nobl estat wa of a bold and enterpris spirit fond of intrigu dont let thi concern you you will have the greater happi and merit too if you can hold him and it is my opinion if ani bodi can you will then he did not like the young ladi mother who sought art to entrap him so that the poor girl divid between her inclin for him and her duti to her design mother gave into the plot upon him and he thought himself vile wretch as he wa for all that at liberti to set up plot against plot and the poor ladi honor wa the sacrific i hope you spoke well of her to him i hope you receiv the child kindli i hope you had
