from me of the arrang i will make under the guidanc of mr thorold for my futur life but say that they will be such as will render hi gener intent as to pecuniari matter needless i would fain explain my thought in that respect but in truth i am not abl just now some hour of reflect will be necessari to me farewel therefor dear cathcart for thi morn i shall of cours see you again in a few day cathcart assur her he would be with her again the follow friday or the interven day if he receiv ani new intellig from willoughbi she then charg him with mani kind wish and remembr to jessi who wa now he told her so confin by her grandfath that she could not get to her and then took hi leav to return to alveston and execut the wish of willoughbi by give him a minut detail of all that had pass with celestina chapter iii mr thorold who wa inform that celestina had receiv letter from willoughbi felt a true friendli impati to know their content but feel also how much hi love guest must in ani event be agit he not onli forbor to intrud upon her with ani enquiri himself but in order that she might not suffer even from the look of hi famili which he knew could not fail to express solicitud aris from less gener motiv he sent her up a note to her own apart in which he beg she would not come down to dinner to put herself through form into ani situat that might be in ani degre pain thi exempt wa particularli gratifi to her as the younger thorold wa thi day expect at dinner and wa to remain at home for some week and hi elder brother a captain in the armi who had been some time in ireland wa to meet him in the even celestina wa unfit for compani and abov all the compani of stranger and again she regret that in the first unsettl tumult of her spirit she had agre to mr thorold propos instead of go back to the lodg she had formerli inhabit she wa now howev compel to remain where she wa till she could determin with the advic of mr thorold whither to go she thought it probabl that he might wish her to remain with him but to thi except hi friendli regard for her and the advantag of be near cathcart and jessi she had no induc and wherev she wa she determin it should not be as a mere visitor for ani length of time but that she would pay for her board again the quiet and liberti of her cottag on the heath recur to her but when she enjoy that quiet her heart had not undergon those vicissitud of happi and miseri which had now she greatli fear exclud tranquil from her bosom for ever what had then afford her a speci of melancholi pleasur the distant view of a spot in alveston park would now serv onli to render her more unhappi and to encourag that tendenc to repin which her reason told her she should both on willoughbi account and her own rather resolv to conquer than endeavor to indulg she believ howev that if onc some resolut wa form as to her futur resid she should be easier herself and be better abl to satisfi willoughbi to thi subject therefor she turn her thought and examin with a heavi heart sever differ plan that offer themselv to her mind noth could be more comfortless than her reflect she wa not onli an orphan and a stranger in england but knew not whether there wa in the world ani be whose protect she had the remotest right to claim ladi molyneux had never written to her sinc their separ and even if willoughbi should approv of her again seek the protect of hi sister which she had great reason to doubt she knew not whether matilda and her husband would receiv her and from that want of heart she had too often discov in them both she could not think of make the experi she had no intimaci with ani other person for though mani of the famili she had been accustom to visit while mr willoughbi live had daughter who had cultiv an acquaint with her she had alreadi seen enough of the gener conduct of the world to know that she should now be no longer an accept guest and that an individu to whom court is made assidu while shine as an equal among fashion circl is soon forgotten or if rememb despis when those adventiti advantag surround her no longer she had heard from vavasour for willoughbi himself had alway care avoid the subject that the sudden desert of miss fitzhayman to whom willoughbi wa suppos to be so firmli engag and hi resolut of marri hi mother adopt daughter had been veri much talk of in the extens circl who were connect or acquaint with the famili she could not doubt but that their sudden separ on the veri eve of their marriag wa as gener known and had she found ani temptat to return to the societi she had quit thi pain certainti the pri curios that would be excit and the malici conjectur that would be made would effectu have counteract it toward even she found suffici courag to entreat mr thorold attent for half an hour he came to her immedi and she put into hi hand the letter she had receiv from willoughbi he read it with great attent and as it should seem with great concern and then in the express manner that wa usual with him gave it back to her without speak benevol and piti were now visibl in hi featur which were masculin strong and frequent stern but celestina wa hardli enough accustom to him to understand hi silenc complet you see dear sir said she timidli you see that willoughbi refer me to you and i would veri fain avail myself of the benefit of your advic it is alway at your servic

her mouth wa now suppli by a melancholi smile the effect of a faint effort to conceal the anguish of the heart such as she now appear howev the captain thought her veri love and montagu almost instantli forgot the nymph for whom he had been die in song all the morn and saw in the interest languor of celestina in her fade cheek and downcast eye a sentiment effect which none of the fair creatur whom he had celebr had ever so emin possess but if such were hi sentiment befor she spoke hi admir aros to extravag when after breakfast hi sister engag her in a walk in which the two

captain thorold on whom these advantag made less impress wa not quit pleas dure thi walk with the unusu talk of hi brother who gener suffer him to take the lead in convers he now attempt to put by him two or three time and to relat anecdot of peopl in high life of what gener wallac said to him at dublin castl upon hi introduct to the duchess of and of a bon mot of ladi mari marsden at supper one even but celestina who care noth about the gener the duchess or ladi mari let the convers drop without express ani pleasur in it and again lent her attent to montagu who desir her to correct hi accent while he repeat o primavera gioventu dell anno celestina modestli assur him she wa incap of correct him but he besought her so earnestli to recit the line to him that she inconsider attempt it and in the most enchant accent began o primavera gioventu dell anno bella madr di fiori derb novel e di novelli amori tu torni ben ma teco non tornano i sereni e fortunati di dell mie gioj the cruel remembr that now press upon her heart made her voic trembl and gave it addit tender she tri to recov it and go into a lower tone went on with tu torni ben tu torni ma teco altro no torna che del perduto mio

no more the young man fascin by her manner and her voic now recollect with reluct recollect that these seduc tone were drawn forth by the realiti of those suffer the poet describ he look at her in silenc and as he mark the sad and pensiv express that remain on her counten that astonish which he had hardli time to feel befor aros he thought it imposs that mr willoughbi have the power to marri such a woman and have onc form the resolut to do so should by ani persuas be divert from hi purpos and he found that in the singl hour he had been with her he admir her enough to sacrific everi thing to her were it possibl that her regard could be transfer to him the improb that it ever could struck him forcibl and render him as silent as celestina herself while the captain who had now an opportun of engross her attent ralli her on be so much affect i have no notion now said he of give way to those sort of thing i love gay and cheer poetri one is tire of weep at the fictiti miseri of fictiti person i rememb be some time ago at a convers in dublin where we talk of the fashion indiffer which everi bodi ha now for tragedi and my friend hargrav who ha written you know sever thing himself wa condemn it as the certain mark of the vitiat tast and imbecil of the age i took up the argument on the other side and ladi mari marsden thought as i did inde everi bodi present allow that it wa quit absurd to go to a play which is intend to amus and entertain onli to be made uneasi she agre with me that peopl have concern enough in real life and need not go seek it in way of divers and did her ladyship enquir montagu thorold give no other reason i think those are veri good reason repli the captain they might be so answer hi brother for a woman of fashion but i am persuad literari peopl and peopl of tast think quit otherwis and the ancient whose superior intellectu advantag are not to be disput oh prithe montagu interrupt the captain dont run us down with colleg cant i am talk of the world we live in and the opinion of peopl who live two thousand year ago are no more in question now than their dress he then went on to retail other opinion of ladi mari marsden who wa as it seem the oracl of the hour in the societi he had just left celestina heard him with appar attent but in truth without know what he said hi brother render impati by be interrupt in hi convers with her walk away and arabella who love to hear descript of fine peopl and to attend to fashion convers kept up the dialogu till the end of their walk when celestina went to her own room arabella to her dress tabl and the captain find hi mother at work in the parlour thought he had a right to ask her a few question about celestina in return for the perpetu tone of interrog she had kept up toward him ever sinc hi arriv to mr thorold the next gratif to that of ask question wa the pleasur of answer them she told her son therefor not onli all she knew but invent answer on some point which she onli guess at and he understood from her inform that celestina had been veri partial to willoughbi and so strong wa thi partial describ that he began to doubt whether the propos marriag had not been a mere finess to throw her off her guard and get her wholli into hi power and whether hi abrupt departur had not been in consequ of the success of thi disingenu but not unpreced method of proceed captain thorold had seen willoughbi frequent in hi last visit at home and knew that he had everi advantag which a fine person and engag manner could give him he wa well acquaint with the societi among which he live and had heard some of them but particularli vavasour describ as be veri gay and unprincipl he had therefor littl difficulti in suppos that willoughbi resembl those with whom he associ and that celestina had been the victim of those art which he suppos no man ever scrupl to practic where the object wa so well worth the troubl especi one so unprotect as she wa where no rigid father wa in the way to obstruct their design or chamontlik brother to aveng the wrong they might commit willoughbi now howev seem quit out of the question and he doubt not but that after a short interv given to sentiment regret on the loss of a first lover she would listen to other vow and encourag the passion which he thought it might be veri amus to entertain her with without mean howev to offer himself to fill such engag as willoughbi had broken while he medit on thi project he could not help smile at the cullibl of hi father who had thu he thought taken into hi protect and made the companion of hi wife and daughter the desert mistress of willoughbi chapter iv the follow morn cathcart wa earli at the hous of mr thorold and celestina who rose now earlier than usual to enjoy if it could be call enjoy a few hour befor she wa compel to hide her sorrow under the appear of attent to the famili she wa with met him as he came from the stabl and instead of go into the hous she desir he would walk with her
