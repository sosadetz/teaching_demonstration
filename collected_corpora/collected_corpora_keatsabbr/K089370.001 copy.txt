you have been oblig to vari some of the name of person place etc and to disguis a few of the circumst in order to avoid give offens to some person who would not choos to be point out too plainli in it though they would be glad it may do the good so laudabl intend by the public and as you have in confid submit to my opinion some of those variat i am much pleas that you have so manag the matter as to

everi headstrong libertin whose hand you reach be reclaim and everi tempt virgin who read you imit the virtu and meet the reward of the highmerit though lowdescend pamela i am sir your most obedi and faith servant j b d f to my worthi friend the editor of pamela sir i return the manuscript of pamela by the bearer which i have read with a great deal of pleasur it is written with that spirit of truth and agreeabl simplic which though much want is seldom found in those piec which are calcul for the entertain and instruct of the public it carri convict in everi part of it and the incid are so natur and interest that i have gone handinhand and sympathizd with the pretti heroin in all her suffer and been extrem anxiou for her safeti under the apprehens of the bad consequ which i expect everi page would ensu from the laudabl resist she made i have interest myself in all her scheme of escap been altern pleas and angri with her in her restraint pleas with the littl machin and contriv she set on foot for her releas and angri for suffer her fear to defeat them alway lament with a most sensibl concern the miscarriag of her hope and project in short the whole is so affect that there is no read it without uncommon concern and emot thu far onli as to the entertain it give as to instruct and moral the piec is full of both it show virtu in the strongest light and render the practic of it amiabl and love the beauti suffer keep it ever in her view without the least ostent or pride she ha it so strongli implant in her that through the whole cours of her suffer she doe not so much as hesit onc whether she shall sacrific it to liberti and ambit or not but as if there were no other way to free and save herself carri on a determin purpos to persever in her innoc and wade with it throughout all difficulti and temptat or perish under them it is an astonish matter and well worth our most seriou consider that a young beauti girl in the low scene of life and circumst in which fortun place her without the advantag of a friend capabl to reliev and protect her or ani other educ than what occur to her from her own observ and littl read in the cours of her attend on her excel mistress and benefactress could after have a tast of eas and plenti in a higher sphere of life than what she wa born and first brought up in resolv to return to her primit poverti rather than give up her innoc i say it is surpris that a young person so circumstanc could in contempt of proffer grandeur on the one side and in defianc of penuri on the other so happili and prudent conduct herself through such a seri of perplex and troubl and withstand the allur bait and almost irresist offer of a fine gentleman so univers admir and esteem for the agreeabl of hi person and good qualiti among all hi acquaint defeat all hi measur with so much address and oblig him at last to give over hi vain pursuit and sacrific hi pride and ambit to virtu and becom the protector of that innoc which he so long and so indefatig labor to supplant and all thi without ever have entertain the least previou design or thought for that purpos no art use to inflam him no coquetri practic to tempt or entic him and no pruderi or affect to tamper with hi passion but on the contrari artless and unpractis in the wile of the world all her endeavor and even all her wish tend onli to render herself as unami as she could in hi eye though at the same time she is so far from have ani avers to hi person that she seem rather prepossess in hi favor and admir hi excel whilst she condemn hi passion for her a gloriou instanc of selfdeni thu her veri repuls becam attract the more she resist the more she charm and the veri mean she use to guard her virtu the more endang it by inflam hi passion till at last by persever and a brave and resolut defens the besieg not onli obtain a gloriou victori over the besieg but took him prison too i am charm with the beauti reflect she make in the cours of her distress her soliloqui and littl reason with herself are exceed pretti and entertain she pour out all her soul in them befor her parent without disguis so that one may judg of nay almost see the inmost recess of her mind a pure clear fountain of truth and innoc a magazin of virtu and unblemish thought i can not conceiv whi you should hesit a moment as to the public of thi veri natur and uncommon piec i could wish to see it out in it own nativ simplic which will affect and pleas the reader beyond all the stroke of oratori in the world for those will but spoil it and should you permit such a murder hand to be laid upon it to gloss and ting it over with superflu and needless decor which like too much draperi in sculptur and statuari will but encumb it it may disguis the fact mar the reflect and unnatur the incid so as to be lost in a multipl of fine idl word and phrase and reduc our sterl substanc into an empti shadow or rather frenchifi our english solid into froth and whipsyllabub no let us have pamela as pamela wrote it in her own word without amput or addit produc her to us in her neat countri apparel such as she appear in on her intend departur to her parent for such best becom her innoc and beauti simplic such a dress will best edifi and entertain the flow robe of oratori may inde amus and amaz but will never strike the mind with solid attent in short sir a piec of thi kind is much want in the world which is but too much as well as too earli debauch by pernici novel i know noth entertain of that kind that one might ventur to recommend to the perus much less the imit of the youth of either sex all that i have hitherto read tend onli to corrupt their principl mislead their judgment and initi them into gallantri and loos pleasur publish then thi good thi edifi and instruct littl piec for their sake the honor of pamela sex demand pamela at your hand to show the world an heroin almost beyond exampl in an unusu scene of life whom no temptat or suffer could subdu it is a fine and gloriou origin for the fair to copi out and imit our own sex too requir it of you to free us in some measur from the imput of be incap of the impress of virtu and honor and to show the ladi that we are not inflex while they are so in short the caus of virtu call for the public of such a piec as thi oblig then sir the concurr voic of both sex and give us pamela for the benefit of mankind and as i believ it excel can not be long unknown to the world and that there will not be a famili without it so i make no doubt but everi famili that ha it will be much improv and better by it twill form the tender mind of youth for the recept and practic of virtu and honor confirm and establish those of matur year on good and steadi principl reclaim the viciou and mend the age in gener insomuch that as i doubt not pamela will becom the bright exampl and imit of all the fashion young ladi of great britain so the truli gener benefactor and reward of her exemplari virtu will be no less admir and imit among the beau mond of our own sex i am your affection friend etc introduct to the second edit the kind recept which thi piec ha met with from the public a larg impress have been carri off in less than three month deserv not onli acknowledg but that some notic should be taken of the object that have hitherto come to hand against a few passag in it that so the work may be render as unexception as possibl and of consequ the fitter to answer the gener design of it which is to promot virtu and cultiv the mind of the youth of both sex but difficulti have arisen from the differ opinion of gentlemen some of whom applaud the veri thing that other found fault with it wa thought proper to submit the whole to the judgment of a gentleman of the most distinguish tast and abil the result of which will be seen in the subsequ page we begin with the follow letter at the desir of sever gentlemen to whom on a veri particular occas it wa commun and who wish to see it prefix to the new edit it wa direct to the editor of pamela dear sir you have agreeabl deceiv me into a surpris which it will be as hard to express as the beauti of pamela though i open thi power littl piec with more expect than from common design of like promis becaus it came from your hand for my daughter yet who could have dreamt he should find under the modest disguis of a novel all the soul of religion goodbreed discret goodnatur wit fanci fine thought and moral i have done noth but read it to other and hear other again read it to me ever sinc it came into my hand and i find i am like to do noth els for i know not how long yet to come becaus if i lay the book down it come after me when it ha dwelt all day long upon the ear it take possess all night of the fanci it ha witchcraft in everi page of it but it is the witchcraft of passion and mean who is there that will not despis the fals empti pomp of the poet when he observ in thi littl unpretend mild triumph of natur the whole forc of invent and geniu creat new power of emot and transplant idea of pleasur into that unweed low garden the heart from the dri and sharp summit of reason yet i confess there is one in the world of whom i think with still greater respect than of pamela and that is of the wonder author of pamela pray who is he dear sir and where and how ha he been abl to hide hitherto such an encircl and allmast spirit he possess everi qualiti that art could have charm by yet ha lent it to and conceal it in natur the comprehens of hi imagin must be truli prodigi it ha stretch out thi diminut mere grain of mustard seed a poor girl littl innoc stori into a resembl of that heaven which the best of good book ha compar it to all the passion are hi in their most close and abstract recess and by select the most delic and yet at the same time most power of their spring therebi to act wind and manag the heart he move us everi where with the forc of a tragedi what is there throughout the whole that i do not sincer admir i admir in it the strong distinguish varieti and picturesqu glow like to life of the charact i know hear see and live among em all and if i could paint could return you their face i admir in it the nobl simplic forc apt and truth of so mani modest oeconom moral prudenti religi satir and cautionari lesson which are introduc with such season dexter and with so polish and exquisit a delicaci of express and sentiment that i am onli apprehens for the interest of virtu lest some of the finest and most touch of those eleg stroke of goodbreed generos and reflect should be lost under the too gross discern of an unfeel major of reader for whose coars howev they were kindli design as the most use and charit correct one of the bestjudgd peculiar of the plan is that these instruct be convey as in a kind of dramat represent by those beauti scene her own letter and journal who act the most move and suffer part we feel the forc in a threefold effect from the motiv the act and the consequ but what abov all i am charm with is the amiabl goodnatur of the author who i am convinc ha one of the best and most gener heart of mankind becaus mismeasur other mind by hi own he can draw everi thing to perfect but wicked i becam inextric in love with thi delight defect of hi malic for i found it owe to an excess in hi honesti onli observ sir with what virtuou reluct he compli with the demand of hi stori when he stand in need of some blameabl charact though hi judgment compel him to mark em with disagre color so that they make an odiou appear at first he can not forbear by an unexpect and gradual declin from themselv to soften and transmut all the horror conceiv for their base till we are arriv through insens stage at an inclin to forgiv it entir i must ventur to add without minc the matter what i realli believ of thi book it will live on through poster with such unbound extent of good consequ that twenti age to come may be the better and wiser for it influenc it will steal first impercept into the heart of the young and the tender where it will afterward guid and moder their reflect and resolv when grown older and so a gradual moral sunshin of unauster and compassion virtu shall break out upon the world from thi trifl for such i dare answer for the author hi modesti misguid him to think it no applaus therefor can be too high for such merit and let me abomin the contempt reserv of meanspirit men who while they but hesit their esteem with restraint can be fluent and uncheckd in their envi in an age so defici in good everi such virtu as that of thi author is a salutari angel in sodom and one who could stoop to conceal a delight he receiv from the worthi would be equal capabl of submit to an approb of the prais of the wick i wa think just now as i return from a walk in the snow on that old roman polici of exempt in favor of men who had given a few bodili children to the republ what superior distinct ought our countri to find but that polici and we are at varianc for reward of thi father of million of mind which are to owe new format to the futur effect of hi influenc upon the whole as i never met with so pleas so honest and so truli deserv a book i should never have done if i explain all my reason for admir it author if it is not a secret oblig me so far as to tell me hi name for sinc i feel him the friend of my soul it would be a kind of violat to retain him a stranger i am not abl to thank you enough for thi highli accept present and as for my daughter they have taken into their own hand the acknowledg due from their gratitud i am dear sir your etc dec abstract of a second letter from the same gentleman no sentiment which i have here or in my last express of the sweet pamela be more than the bare truth which everi man must feel who lend hi ear to the enchant prattler whi doe the author modesti mislead hi judgment to suspect the style want polish no sir there is an eas a natur air a dignifi simplic and measur full in it that resembl life outglow it he ha reconcil the pleas to the proper the thought is everywher exactli cloth by the express and becom it dress as roundli and as close as pamela her countryhabit rememb though she put it on with humbl prospect of descend to the level of her purpos it adorn her with such unpresumd increas of loveli sat with such neat proprieti of eleg neglect about her that it threw out all her charm with tenfold and resistless influenc and so dear sir it will be alway found when modest beauti seek to hide itself by cast off the pride of ornament it but display itself without a cover and so becom more distinguish by it want of draperi grow stronger from it purpos weak there were form by an anonym gentleman the follow object to some passag in the work that the style ought to be a littl rais at least so soon as pamela know the gentleman love is honor and when hi diffid is chang to eas and from about the fourth day after marriag it should be equal to the rank she is rais to and charg to fill becomingli that to avoid the idea apt to be join with the word squir the gentleman should be style sir jame or sir john etc and ladi daver in a new edit might procur for him the titl of a baronet that if the sacr name were seldom repeat it would be better for that the wise man advic is be not righteou overmuch that the penanc which pamela suffer from ladi daver might be shorten that she is too timor after own her marriag to that ladi and ought to have a littl more spirit and get away sooner out at the window or call her own servant to protect and carri her to her husband appoint that femal are too apt to be struck with imag of beauti and that the passag where the gentleman is said to span the waist of pamela with hi hand is enough to ruin a nation of women by tightlac that the word naughti had better be chang to some other as bad faulti wick vile abomin scandal which in most place would give an emphasi for which recours must otherwis be had to the innoc simplic of the writer an idea not necessari to the moral of the stori nor of advantag to the charact of the heroin that the word p foolish thing that i am had better be foolish that i am the same gentleman observ by way of postscript that joke are often more sever and do more mischief than more solid object and would have one or two passag alter to avoid give occas for the supposit of a doubl entendr particularli in two place which he mention viz p and he is pleas to take notic of sever other thing of less moment some of which are mere typograph and veri kindli express on the whole a high opinion of the perform and think it may do a great deal of good for all which as well as for hi object the editor give him veri sincer thank other are of opinion that the scene in mani place in the begin especi are too low and that the passion of ladi daver in particular are carri too high and abov natur and other have intim that pamela ought for exampl sake to have discharg mr jewk from her servic these are the most materi object that have come to hand all which are consid in the follow extract from some of the most beauti letter that have been written in ani languag the gentleman advic not to alter pamela at all wa both friendli and solidli just i run in with full sail to hi anchorag that the low scene are no more out of natur than the high passion of proud ladi daver out of natur do they say it is my astonish how men of letter can read with such absent attent they are so far from out of natur they are absolut natur herself or if they must be confess her resembl they are such a resembl at least as our true face give our face in the lookingglass i wonder inde what it is that the gentlemen who talk of low scene would desir should be understood by the epithet noth properli speak is low that suit well with the place it is rais to the passion of natur are the same in the lord and hi coachman all that make them seem differ consist in the degre in the mean and the air whereto or wherewith they indulg em if in paint distinct like these which aris but from the form of men manner drawn from birth educ and custom a writer fall short of hi charact there hi scene is a low one inde whatev high fortun it flatter but to imagin that person of rank are abov a concern for what is thought felt or act by other of their speci between whom and themselv is no differ except such as wa owe to accid is to reduc human natur to a low too low for the truth of her frailti in pamela in particular we owe all to her low it is to the docil effect of thi low of that amiabl girl in her birth her condit her hope and her vaniti in everi thing in short but her virtu that her reader are indebt for the moral reward of that virtu and if we are to look for the low among the rest of the servant less love though they are than a pamela there is someth howev so glowingli paint in the line wherebi the author ha mark their distinct someth so movingli forc in the grief at their part and joy at the happi return someth so fine at onc and so strongli and feelingli vari even in the smallest and least promis littl famili incid that i need onli appeal from the head to the heart of the objector themselv whether these are low scene to be censur and as for the opposit extrem they would quarrel with the highpassiond and untamd ladi daver i could direct em to a dozen or two of qualiti origin from whom with except perhap of her wit one would swear the author had taken her copi what a sum might these objector ensur to be paid by the husband and son of such termag hermaphrodit mind upon their make due proof that they were no longer to be found in the kingdom i know you are too just to imagin me capabl of give ani other opinion than my bestweighd and true one but becaus it is fit you should have reason in support of a judgment that can neither deserv nor expect an implicit recept i will run over the anonym letter i herewith return you and note with what light even men of goodnatur intent fall into mistak by neglect in too hasti perus which their benevol would take pleasur in blush at when they discov their weak in a cooler revis the writer of thi letter is for have the style rais after pamela advanc in her fortun but sure thi wa hasti advic becaus as the letter are writ to her parent it would have look like forget and in some sort insult the lowli of their inferior condit to have assum a new air in her languag in place of retain a steadi humil but here it must not be pass unobserv that in her report of convers that follow her marriag she doe aptli and beauti heighten her style and her phrase still return howev to her decent simplic in her address to her father and mother i am against give a gentleman who ha ennobl himself by reform hi vice and reward the worth of the friendless the unnecessari new toy of a titl it is all strong in natur as it stand in the letter and i dont see how great from titl can add like or power to the passion so complet a resembl of truth stand in need of no borrow pretens the onli of thi writer object which i think carri weight is that which advis some littl contract of the prayer and appeal to the deiti i say littl contract for they are nobli and sincer pathet and i say it onli in fear lest if fansi too long by the fashion avers to the subject mind which most want the purpos impress might hazard the loss of it benefit by pass over those piou reflect which if shorter would catch their attent certainli the gentleman object against the persecut that pamela suffer from ladi daver in respect to the relat thi madwoman bear to the brother is the rashest of all hi advic and when he think she ought rather to have assum the protect of her servant he seem unawar of the probabl consequ where there wa a puppi of qualiti in the case who had even without provoc drawn hi sword on the poor passiv pamela far from bear a thought of excit an abler resent to the danger of a quarrel with so worthless a coxcomb how charmingli natur apprehens and gener is her silenc dure the recit she make of her suffer with regard to thi masculin part of the insult as also her prevent of mr jewkess less delic blunt when she wa begin to complain of the whelp lord impertin if i were not afraid of a pun i should tell the anonym letterwrit that he made a too tightlac object where he quarrel with the spannd waist of pamela what in the name of unshapeli could he find to complain of in a beauti girl of sixteen who wa born out of germani and had not yet reach ungrasp round these are wonder sink from purpos where a man is consid such mental and passion beauti as thi gentleman profess to be touch by but when he goe on to object against the word naughti as appli in the phrase naughti master i grow mortifi in fear for our human suffici compar with our apt to blunder for here it is plain thi director of anoth discern is quit blind himself to an eleg one would have thought it imposs not to be struck by faulti wick abomin scandal which are the angri adject he prefer to that sweet one would have carri mark of her rage not afflict wherea naughti contain in one singl signific petul twenti thousand inexpress delicaci it insinu at onc all the beauti struggl between her contempt of hi purpos and tender regard for hi person her gratitud to himself and hi famili her recollect of hi superior condit there is in the eleg choic of thi halfkind halfpeevish word a neverenough to be prais speak pictur of the conflict betwixt her disdain and her rever see sir the reason i had for apprehend some danger that the refin generos in mani of the most charm of the sentiment would be lost upon the too coars concept of some for whose use the author intend them it is the same case again in foolish thing that i am which thi nice unnic gentleman would advis you to chang into foolish that i am he doe not seem to have tast the pretti contempt of herself the submiss diminut so distant from vaniti yet allay by the gentl reluct in selfcondemn and the other fine touch of natur which would all have been lost in the grave sober sound of hi dutch emend as to hi paragraph in postscript i shall say the less of it becaus the gentleman own good sens seem to confess by the place he ha chosen to rank it in that it ought to be turn out of door as too dirti for the rest of hi letter in the occas he is pleas to discov for joke i either find not that he ha ani signif at all or such vulgar coarsetast allus to loos lowlif idiom that not to understand what he mean is both the cleanliest and prudentest way of confut him and now sir you will easili gather how far i am from think it need to chang ani thing in pamela i would not scratch such a beauti face for the indi you can hardli imagin how it charm me to hear of a second edit alreadi but the news of still new upon new one will be found no subject of wonder as it is sure that no famili is without sister or brother or daughter or son who can read or want father or mother or friend who can think so equal certain it is that the train to a parcel of powder doe not run on with more natur tendenc till it set the whole heap in a blaze than that pamela enchant from famili to famili will overspread all the heart of the kingdom as to the object of those warm friend to honesti who are for have pamela dismiss mr jewk there is not one among all these benevol complain who would not discern himself to have been laudabl in the wrong were he onli to be ask thi plain question whether a step both illjudgd and unduti had not been the revers of a pamela charact two or three time over mr b had inform her that mr jewk and himself have been equal involv in one guilt she must forgiv or condemn both togeth after thi it grew manifest duti not to treat her with mark of resent and as here wa a visibl necess to appear not desir of turn her away so in point of mere moral regard to the bad woman herself it wa nobler to retain her with a prospect of correct in time her loos habit of think than by cast her off to the licenti result of her temper abandon her to temptat and danger which a virtu like pamela could not wish her expos to the manner in which thi admir gentleman give hi opinion of the piec and run through the princip charact is so masterli that the reader of pamela will be charm by it though they should suppos that hi inimit benevol ha overvalud the piec itself inspird without doubt by some skill more than human and comprehend in an humbl and seemingli artless narrat a forc that can tear up the heart string thi author ha prepar an enamour philtr for the mind which will excit such a passion for virtu as scarc to leav it in the power of the will to neglect her longinu i rememb distinguish by what mark we may know the sublim say it is chiefli from an effect that will follow the read it a delightfullyadh idea that cling fast to the memori and from which it is difficult for a man to disengag hi attent if thi is a proof of the sublim there wa never sublim so lastingli felt as in pamela not the charmer own prattl idea stuck so close to the heart of her master as the incid of her stori to the thought of a reader the author transport and transform with a power more extens than horac requir in hi poet mr b and the turn of hi passion and the soft yet strength of their amiabl object after have given us the most masterli imag of natur that ever wa paint take possess of and dwell in the memori and there too brood the kind and the credul parson williamss dove without serpentin mixtur hatch piti and affect for an honesti so sincer and so silli there too take their place all the lower support of thi beauti fabric i am sometim transform into plain goodman andrew and sometim the good woman hi wife as for old mr longman and jonathan the butler they are sure of me both in their turn now andthen i am colbrand the swiss but as broad as i stride in that charact i can never escap mr jewk who often keep me awak in the night till the ghost of ladi daver draw open the curtain scare the scarer of me and of pamela and then i take shelter with poor penit john and the rest of the men and the maid of all whom i may say with compassion marcia the youth divid their reader and thi fine writer add i am glad i made war in my last upon the notion of alter the style for have read it twice over sinc then and to audienc where the tear were applaus eloqu i could hardli here and there find a place where one word can be chang for a better there are some inde where twere possibl to leav out a few without make a breach in the build but in short the author ha put so bewitch a mixtur togeth of the rais with the natur and the soft with the strong and the eloqu that never sentiment were finer and fuller of life never ani were utter so sweetli even in what relat to the piou and frequent address to god i now retract on these two last revis the consent i half gave on a former to the anonym writer propos who advis the author to shorten those beauti whoever consid hi pamela with a view to find matter for censur is in the condit of a passion lover who break in upon hi mistress without fear or wit with intent to accus her and quarrel he came to her with piqu in hi purpos but hi heart is too hard for hi malic and he goe away more enslav for complain the follow delight stori so admir relat will give great pleasur to the reader and we take the liberti of insert it for that veri reason what a nevertob satisfi length ha thi subject alway the power of attract me into and yet befor i have done i must by your mean tell the author a stori which a judg not so skil in natur as he is might be in danger perhap of mistak for a trifl and silli one i expect it should give him the clearest convict in a case he is subject to question we have a live littl boy in the famili about seven year old but ala for him poor child quit unfriend and born to no prospect he is the son of an honest poor soldier by a wife grave unmean and innoc yet the boy see the power of connubi simplic is so pretti so genteel and gayspirit that we have made him and design him our own ever sinc he could totter and waddl the wanton rogu is half air and everi motion he act by ha a spring like pamela when she threw down the cardtabl all thi quick howev is temper by a goodnatur modesti so that the wildest of hi flight are thought rather divert than troublesom he is an hourli foundat for laughter from the top of the hous to the parlour and to borrow an attribut from the reverend mr peter though without ani note of hi music play a veri good fiddl in the famili i have told you the histori of thi tomtit of a prater becaus ever sinc my first read of pamela he put in for a right to be one of her hearer and have got half her say by heart talk in no other languag but her and what realli surpris and ha charm me into a certain foretast of her influenc he is at onc becom fond of hi book which befor he could never be brought to attend to that he may read pamela he say without stop the first discoveri we made of thi power over so unrip and unfixd an attent wa one even when i wa read her reflect at the pond to some compani the littl rampant intrud be kept out by the extent of the circl had crept under my chair and wa sit befor me on the carpet with hi head almost touch the book and hi face bow down toward the fire he had sat for some time in thi postur with a still that made us conclud him asleep when on a sudden we heard a success of heartheav sob which while he strove to conceal from our notic hi littl side swell as if they would burst with the throb restraint of hi sorrow i turn hi innoc face to look toward me but hi eye were quit lost in hi tear which run down from hi cheek in free current had form two sincer littl fountain on that part of the carpet he hung over all the ladi in compani were readi to devour him with kiss and he ha sinc becom doubli a favorit and is perhap the youngest of pamela convert the same incompar writer ha favor us with an object that is more materi than ani we have mention which can not be better state nor answer than in hi own beauti word viz an object is come into my thought which i should be glad the author would think proper to obviat in the front of the second edit there are mother or grandmoth in all famili of affluent fortun who though they may have none of ladi daverss insol will be apt to feel one of her fear that the exampl of a gentleman so amiabl as mr b may be follow by the jacki their son with too blind and unreflect a readi nor doe the answer of that gentleman to hi sister reproach come quit up to the point they will rest on for though inde it is true all the world would acquit the best gentleman in it if he marri such a waitingmaid as pamela yet there is an illdiscern partial in passion that will overthrow all the forc of that argument becaus everi belov maid will be pamela in a judgment obscur by her influenc and sinc the ground of thi fear will seem solid i dont know how to be easi till it is shown nor ought it to be left to the author modesti that they who consid hi design in that light will be found but shortsight observ request it of him then to suffer it to be told them that not a limit but gener excit to virtu wa the first and great end to hi stori and that thi excit must have been defici and veri imperfectli offer if he had not look quit as low as he could for hi exampl becaus if there had been ani degre or condit more remot from the prospect than that which he had chosen to work on that degre might have seem out of reach of the hope which it wa hi gener purpos to encourag and so he wa under an evid necess to find such a jewel in a cottag and expos too as she wa to the severest distress of fortun with parent unabl to support their own live but from the daili hard product of labor nor would it have been suffici to have place her thu low and distress if he had not also suppos her a servant and that too in some eleg famili for if she had alway remain a fellowcottag with her father it must have carri an air of romant improb to account for her polit educ if she had want those improv which she found mean to acquir in her servic it would have been veri unlik that she should have succeed so well and had destroy one great use of the stori to have allow such uncommon felic to the effect of mere person beauti and it had not been judici to have repres her as educ in a superior condit of life with the proper accomplish befor she becam reduc by misfortun and so not a servant but rather an orphan under hopeless distress becaus opportun which had made it no wonder how she came to be so winningli qualifi would have lessen her merit in be so and besid where had then been the purpos excit of person in pamela condit of life by an emul of her sweet humil modesti patienc and industri to attain some faint hope of arriv in time within view of her happi and what a delight reform should we see in all famili where the vaniti of their maid took no turn toward ambit to pleas but by such innoc measur as pamela as it is clear then the author wa under a necess to suppos her a servant he is not to be account for mistaken impress which the charm he ha given her may happen to make on wrong head or weak heart though in favor of maid the revers of her like what is it then they may say that the low and distanc of pamela condit from the gentleman who marri her propos to teach the gay world and the fortun it is thi by comparison with that infinit remot of her condit from the reward which her virtu procur her one great proof is deriv which is part of the moral of pamela that advantag from birth and distinct of fortun have no power at all when consid against those from behavior and temper of mind becaus where the last are not ad all the first will be boast in vain wherea she who possess the last find no want of the first in her influenc in that light alon let the ladi of rank look at pamela such an alarm reflect as that will at the same time that it rais the hope and ambit of the humbl correct and mortifi the disdain of the proud for it will compel them to observ and acknowledg that it is the turn of their mind not the claim of their qualiti by which and which onli women charm can be last and that while the haughti expect insepar from an elev rank serv but to multipli it complaint and afflict the condescens of accomplish humil attract piti affect and rever secur an hourli increas of felic so that the moral mean of pamela goodfortun far from tempt young gentlemen to marri such maid as are found in their famili is by teach maid to deserv to be mistress to stir up mistress to support their distinct we shall onli add that it wa intend to prefix two neat frontispiec to thi edit and to present them to the purchas of the first and one wa actual finish for that purpos but there not be time for the other from the demand for the new impress and the engrav part of that which wa done though no expens wa spare have fallen veri short of the spirit of the passag they were intend to repres the proprietor were advis to lay them asid and were the rather induc to do so from the follow observ of a most ingeni gentleman in a letter to the editor i am so jealou say he in behalf of our inward idea of pamela person that i dread ani figur pretens to resembl for it will be piti to look at an air and imagin it her that doe not

who they see love me and they stand in awe of her know her to be a gentlewoman born though she ha had misfortun i am go on again with a long letter for i love write and shall tire you but when i began i onli intend to say that i am quit fearless of ani danger now and inde can but wonder at myself though your caution to me wa your watch love that i should be so foolish as to be so uneasi as i have been for i am sure my master would not demean himself so as to think upon such a poor girl as i for my harm for such a thing would ruin hi credit as well as mine you know who to be sure may expect one of the best ladi in the land so no more at present but that i am your everduti daughter letter vi dear father and mother my master ha been veri kind sinc my last for he ha given me a suit of my late ladi cloth and half a dozen of her shift and six fine handkerchief and three of her cambrick apron and four holland one the cloth are fine silk and too rich and too good for me to be sure i wish it wa no affront to him to make money of them and send it to you it would do me more good you will be full of fear i warrant now of some design upon me till i tell you that he wa with mr jervi when he gave them me and he gave her a mort of good thing at the same time and bid her wear them in remembr of her good friend my ladi hi mother and when he gave me these fine thing he said these pamela are for you have them made fit for you when your mourn is laid by and wear them for your good mistresss sake mr jervi give you a veri good word and i would have you continu to behav as prudent as you have done hitherto and everi bodi will be your friend i wa so surpris at hi good that i could not tell what to say i curtesyd to him and to mr jervi for her good word and said i wish i might be deserv of hi favor and noth should be want in me to the best of my knowledg o how amiabl a thing is do good it is all i envi great folk for i alway thought my young master a fine gentleman as everi bodi say he is but he gave these good thing to us both with such a gracious as i thought he look like an angel mr jervi say he ask her if i kept the men at a distanc for he said i wa veri pretti and to be drawn in to have ani of them might be my ruin and make me poor and miser betim she never is want to give me a good word and took occas to launch out in my prais she say but i hope she said no more than i shall tri to deserv though i may not at present i am sure i will alway love her next to you and my dear mother so i rest your everduti daughter letter vii dear father sinc my last my master gave me more fine thing he call me up to my late ladi closer and pull out her drawer he gave me two suit of fine flander lace headcloath three pair of fine silk shoe two hardli the wors and just fit for me and the other with rich silver buckl in them for my ladi had a veri littl foot and sever ribband and topknot of all color four pair of fine white cotton stocken and three pair of fine silk one and two pair of rich stay i wa quit astonish and unabl to speak for a while but yet i wa inwardli asham to take the stocken for mr jervi wa not there if she had it would have been noth i believ i receiv them veri awkwardli for he smile at my awkward and said dont blush pamela do think i dont know pretti maid wear shoe and stocken i wa so confound at these word you might have beat me down with a feather for you must think there wa no answer to be made to thi so like a fool i wa readi to cri and went away curtesi and blush i am sure up to the ear for though there wa no harm in what he said yet i did not know how to take it but i went and told all to mr jervi who said god put it into hi heart to be good to me and i must doubl my dilig it look to her she said as if he would fit me in dress for a waitingmaid place on ladi daverss own person but still your kind fatherli caution came into my head and made all these gift noth near to me what they would have been but yet i hope there is no reason for what good could it do to him to harm such a simpl maiden as me besid to be sure no ladi would look upon him if he should so disgrac himself so i will make myself easi and inde i should never have been otherwis if you had not put it into my head for my good i know veri well but mayb without these uneasi to mingl with these benefit i might be too much puf up so i will conclud all that happen is sor our good and so god bless you my dear father and mother and i know you constantli pray for a bless upon me who am and shall alway be your duti daughter letter viii dear pamela i can not but renew my caution to you on your master kind to you and hi free express to you about the stocken yet there may not be and i hope there is not ani thing in it but when i reflect that there possibl may and that if there should no less depend upon it than my child everlast happi in thi world and the next it is enough to make one fear for you arm yourself my dear child for the worst and resolv to lose your life sooner than your virtu what though the doubt i fill you with lessen the
