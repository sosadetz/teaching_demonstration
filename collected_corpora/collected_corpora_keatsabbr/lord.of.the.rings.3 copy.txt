dream in which he had been wrap so long sinc the great ride began the dark world wa rush by and the wind sang loudli in hi ear he could see noth but the wheel star and away to hi right vast shadow against the sky where the mountain of the south march past sleepili he tri to reckon the time and stage of their journey but hi memori wa drowsi and uncertain there had been the first ride at terribl speed without a halt and then in the dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold and they had come to the silent town and the great empti hous on the hill and hardli had they reach it shelter when the wing shadow had pass over onc again and men wilt with fear but gandalf had spoken soft word to him and he had slept in a corner tire but uneasi dimli awar of come and go and of men talk and gandalf give order and then again ride ride in the night thi wa the second no the third night sinc he had look in the stone and with that hideou memori he woke fulli and shiver and the nois of the wind becam fill with menac voic a light kindl in the sky a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barrier pippin cower back afraid for a moment wonder into what dread countri gandalf wa bear him he rub hi eye and then he saw that it wa the moon rise abov the eastern shadow now almost at the full so the night wa not yet old and for hour the dark journey would go on he stir and spoke where are we gandalf he ask in the realm of gondor the wizard answer the land of anórien is still pass by there wa a silenc again for a while then what is that cri pippin suddenli clutch at gandalf cloak look fire red fire are there

fire on amon dîn and flame on eilenach and there they go speed west nardol erela minrimmon calenhad and the halifirien on the border of rohan but shadowfax paus in hi stride slow to a walk and then he lift up hi head and neigh and out of the dark the answer neigh of other hors came and present the thud of hoof wa heard and three rider swept up and pass like fli ghost in the moon and vanish into the west then shadowfax gather himself togeth and sprang away and the night flow over him like a roar wind pippin becam drowsi again and paid littl attent to gandalf tell him of the custom of gondor and how the lord of the citi had beacon built on the top of outli hill along both border of the great rang and maintain post at these point where fresh hors were alway in readi to bear hi errandrid to rohan in the north or to belfala in the south it is long sinc the beacon of the north were lit he said and in the ancient day of gondor they were not need for they had the seven stone pippin stir uneasili sleep again and do not be afraid said gandalf for you are not go like frodo to mordor but to mina tirith and there you will be as safe as you can be anywher in these day if gondor fall or the ring is taken then the shire will be no refug you do not comfort me said pippin but nonetheless sleep crept over him the last thing that he rememb befor he fell into deep dream wa a glimps of high white peak glimmer like float isl abov the cloud as they caught the light of the wester moon he wonder where frodo wa and if he wa alreadi in mordor or if he wa dead and he did not know that frodo from far away look on that same moon as it set beyond gondor ere the come of the day pippin woke to the sound of voic anoth day of hide and a night of journey had fleet by it wa twilight the cold dawn wa at hand again and chill grey mist were about them shadowfax stood steam with sweat but he held hi neck proudli and show no sign of weari mani tall men heavili cloak stood besid him and behind them in the mist loom a wall of stone partli ruinou it seem but alreadi befor the night wa pass the sound of hurri labour could be heard beat of hammer clink of trowel and the creak of wheel torch and flare glow dulli here and there in the fog gandalf wa speak to the men that bar hi way and as he listen pippin becam awar that he himself wa be discuss yea truli we know you mithrandir said the leader of the men and you know the password of the seven gate and are free to go forward but we do not know your companion what is he a dwarf out of the mountain in the north we wish for no stranger in the land at thi time unless they be mighti men of arm in whose faith and help we can trust i will vouch for him befor the seat of denethor said gandalf and as for valour that can not be comput by statur he ha pass through more battl and peril than you have ingold though you be twice hi height and he come now from the storm of isengard of which we bear tide and great weari is on him or i would wake him hi name is peregrin a veri valiant man man said ingold dubious and the other laugh man cri pippin now thoroughli rous man inde not i am a hobbit and no more valiant than i am a man save perhap now and again by necess do not let gandalf deceiv you mani a doer of great deed might say no more said ingold but what is a hobbit a halfl answer gandalf nay not the one that wa spoken of he ad see the wonder in the men face not he yet one of hi kindr ye and one who journey with him said pippin and boromir of your citi wa with us and he save me in the snow of the north and at the last he wa slain defend me from mani foe peac said gandalf the news of that grief should have been told first to the father it ha been guess alreadi said ingold for there have been strang portent here of late but pass on now quickli for the lord of mina tirith will be eager to see ani that bear the latest tide of hi son be he man or hobbit said pippin littl servic can i offer to your lord but what i can do i would do rememb boromir the brave fare you well said ingold and the men made way for shadow fax and he pass through a narrow gate in the wall may you bring good counsel to denethor in hi need and to us all mithrandir ingold cri but you come with tide of grief and danger as is your wont they say becaus i come seldom but when my help is need answer gandalf and as for counsel to you i would say that you are overl in repair the wall of the pelennor courag will now be your best defenc against the storm that is at hand – that and such hope as i bring for not all the tide that i bring are evil but leav your trowel and sharpen your sword the work will be finish ere even said ingold thi is the last portion of the wall to be put in defenc the least open to attack for it look toward our friend of rohan do you know aught of them will they answer the summon think you ye they will come but they have fought mani battl at your back thi road and no road look toward safeti ani longer be vigil but for gandalf stormcrow you would have seen a host of foe come out of anórien and no rider of rohan and you may yet fare you well and sleep not gandalf pass now into the wide land beyond the ramma echor so the men of gondor call the out wall that they had built with great labour after ithilien fell under the shadow of their enemi for ten leagu or more it ran from the mountain feet and so back again enclos in it fenc the field of the pelennor fair and fertil townland on the long slope and terrac fall to the deep level of the anduin at it furthest point from the great gate of the citi northeastward the wall wa four leagu distant and there from a frown bank it overlook the long flat besid the river and men had made it high and strong for at that point upon a wall causeway the road came in from the ford and bridg of osgiliath and pass through a guard gate between embattl tower at it nearest point the wall wa littl more than one leagu from the citi and that wa southeastward there anduin go in a wide knee about the hill of emyn arnen in south ithilien bent sharpli west and the outwal rose upon it veri brink and beneath it lay the quay and land of the harlond for craft that came upstream from the southern fief the townland were rich with wide tilth and mani orchard and homestead there were with oast and garner fold and byre and mani rill rippl through the green from the highland down to anduin yet the herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not mani and the most part of the peopl of gondor live in the seven circl of the citi or in the high vale of the mountainbord in lossarnach or further south in fair lebennin with it five swift stream there dwelt a hardi folk between the mountain and the sea they were reckon men of gondor yet their blood wa mingl and there were short and swarthi folk among them whose sire came more from the forgotten men who hous in the shadow of the hill in the dark year ere the come of the king but beyond in the great fief of belfala dwelt princ imrahil in hi castl of dol amroth by the sea and he wa of high blood and hi folk also tall men and proud with seagrey eye now after gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the sky and pippin rous himself and look up to hi left lay a sea of mist rise to a bleak shadow in the east but to hi right great mountain rear their head rang from the west to a steep and sudden end as if in the make of the land the river had burst through a great barrier carv out a mighti valley to be a land of battl and debat in time to come and there where the white mountain of ere nimrai came to their end he saw as gandalf had promis the dark mass of mount mindolluin the deep purpl shadow of it high glen and it tall face whiten in the rise day and upon it outthrust knee wa the guard citi with it seven wall of stone so strong and old that it seem to have been not build but carven by giant out of the bone of the earth even as pippin gaze in wonder the wall pass from loom grey to white blush faintli in the dawn and suddenli the sun climb over the eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that smote the face of the citi then pippin cri aloud for the tower of ecthelion stand high within the topmost wall shone out against the sky glimmer like a spike of pearl and silver tall and fair and shape and it pinnacl glitter as if it were wrought of crystal and white banner broke and flutter from the battlement in the morn breez and high and far he heard a clear ring as of silver trumpet so gandalf and peregrin rode to the great gate of the men of gondor at the rise of the sun and it iron door roll back befor them mithrandir mithrandir men cri now we know that the storm is inde nigh it is upon you said gandalf i have ridden on it wing let me pass i must come to your lord denethor while hi stewardship last whatev betid you have come to the end of the gondor that you have known let me pass then men fell back befor the command of hi voic and question him no further though they gaze in wonder at the hobbit that sat befor him and at the hors that bore him for the peopl of the citi use hors veri littl and they were seldom seen in their street save onli those ridden by the errandrid of their lord and they said sure that is one of the great steed of the king of rohan mayb the rohirrim will come soon to strengthen us but shadowfax walk proudli up the long wind road for the fashion of mina tirith wa such that it wa built on seven level each delv into the hill and about each wa set a wall and in each wall wa a gate but the gate were not set in a line the great gate in the citi wall wa at the east point of the circuit but the next face half south and the third half north and so to and fro upward so that the pave way that climb toward the citadel turn first thi way and then that across the face of the hill and each time that it pass the line of the great gate it went through an arch tunnel pierc a vast pier of rock whose huge outthrust bulk divid in two all the circl of the citi save the first for partli in the primev shape of the hill partli by the mighti craft and labour of old there stood up from the rear of the wide court behind the gate a tower bastion of stone it edg sharp as a shipkeel face east up it rose even to the level of the topmost circl and there wa crown by a battlement so that those in the citadel might like marin in a mountain ship look from it peak sheer down upon the gate seven hundr feet below the entranc to the citadel also look eastward but wa delv in the heart of the rock thenc a long lamplit slope ran up to the seventh gate thu men reach at last the high court and the place of the fountain befor the feet of the white tower tall and shape fifti fathom from it base to the pinnacl where the banner of the steward float a thousand feet abov the plain a strong citadel it wa inde and not to be taken by a host of enemi if there were ani within that could hold weapon unless some foe could come behind and scale the lower skirt of mindolluin and so come upon the narrow shoulder that join the hill of guard to the mountain mass but that shoulder which rose to the height of the fifth wall wa hedg with great rampart right up to the precipic that overhung it western end and in that space stood the hous and dome tomb of bygon king and lord for ever silent between the mountain and the tower pippin gaze in grow wonder at the great stone citi vaster and more splendid than anyth that he had dream of greater and stronger than isengard and far more beauti yet it wa in truth fall year by year into decay and alreadi it lack half the men that could have dwelt at eas there in everi street they pass some great hous or court over whose door and arch gate were carv mani fair letter of strang and ancient shape name pippin guess of great men and kindr that had onc dwelt there and yet now they were silent and no footstep rang on their wide pavement nor voic wa heard in their hall nor ani face look out from door or empti window at last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate and the warm sun that shone down beyond the river as frodo walk in the glade of ithilien glow here on the smooth wall and root pillar and the great arch with keyston carven in the like of a crown and kingli head gandalf dismount for no hors wa allow in the citadel and shadowfax suffer himself to be led away at the soft word of hi master the guard of the gate were robe in black and their helm were of strang shape highcrown with long cheekguard closefit to the face and abov the cheekguard were set the white wing of seabird but the helm gleam with a flame of silver for they were inde wrought of mithril heirloom from the glori of old day upon the black surcoat were embroid in white a tree blossom like snow beneath a silver crown and manypoint star thi wa the liveri of the heir of elendil and none wore it now in all gondor save the guard of the citadel befor the court of the fountain where the white tree onc had grown alreadi it seem that word of their come had gone befor them and at onc they were admit silent and without question quickli gandalf strode across the whitepav court a sweet fountain play there in the morn sun and a sward of bright green lay about it but in the midst droop over the pool stood a dead tree and the fall drop drip sadli from it barren and broken branch back into the clear water pippin glanc at it as he hurri after gandalf it look mourn he thought and he wonder whi the dead tree wa left in thi place where everyth els wa well tend seven star and seven stone and one white tree the word that gandalf had murmur came back into hi mind and then he found himself at the door of the great hall beneath the gleam tower and behind the wizard he pass the tall silent doorwarden and enter the cool echo shadow of the hous of stone they walk down a pave passag long and empti and as they went gandalf spoke softli to pippin be care of your word master peregrin thi is no time for hobbit pert théoden is a kindli old man denethor is of anoth sort proud and subtl a man of far greater lineag and power though he is not call a king but he will speak most to you and question you much sinc you can tell him of hi son boromir he love him greatli too much perhap and the more so becaus they were unlik but under cover of thi love he will think it easier to learn what he witch from you rather than from me do not tell him more than you need and leav quiet the matter of frodo errand i will deal with that in due time and say noth about aragorn either unless you must whi not what is wrong with strider pippin whisper he meant to come here didnt he and hell be arriv soon himself anyway mayb mayb said gandalf though if he come it is like to be in some way that no one expect not even denethor it will be better so at least he should come unherald by us gandalf halt befor a tall door of polish metal see master pippin there is no time to instruct you now in the histori of gondor though it might have been better if you had learn someth of it when you were still birdsnest and play truant in the wood of the shire do as i bid it is scarc wise when bring the news of the death of hi heir to a mighti lord to speak over much of the come of one who will if he come claim the kingship is that enough kingship said pippin amaz ye said gandalf if you have walk all these day with close ear and mind asleep wake up now he knock on the door the door open but no one could be seen to open it pippin look into a great hall it wa lit by deep window in the wide aisl at either side beyond the row of tall pillar that upheld the roof monolith of black marbl they rose to great capit carv in mani strang figur of beast and leav and far abov in shadow the wide vault gleam with dull gold inset with flow traceri of mani colour no hang nor stori web nor ani thing of woven stuff or of wood were to be seen in that long solemn hall but between the pillar there stood a silent compani of tall imag graven in cold stone suddenli pippin wa remind of the hewn rock of argonath and awe fell on him as he look down that avenu of king long dead at the far end upon a dai of mani step wa set a high throne under a canopi of marbl shape like a crown helm behind it wa carv upon the wall and set with gem an imag of a tree in flower but the throne wa empti at the foot of the dai upon the lowest step which wa broad and deep there wa a stone chair black and unadorn and on it sat an old man gaze at hi lap in hi hand wa a white rod with a golden knob he did not look up solemnli they pace the long floor toward him until they stood three pace from hi footstool then gandalf spoke hail lord and steward of mina tirith denethor son of ecthelion i am come with counsel and tide in thi dark hour then the old man look up pippin saw hi carven face with it proud bone and skin like ivori and the long curv nose between the dark deep eye and he wa remind not so much of boromir as of aragorn dark inde is the hour said the old man and at such time you are wont to come mithrandir but though all the sign forebod that the doom of gondor is draw nigh less now to me is that dark than my own dark it ha been told to me that you bring with you one who saw my son die is thi he it is said gandalf one of the twain the other is with théoden of rohan and may come hereaft halfl they are as you see yet thi is not he of whom the omen spoke yet a halfl still said denethor grimli and littl love do i bear the name sinc those accurs word came to troubl our counsel and drew away my son on the wild errand to hi death my boromir now we have need of you faramir should have gone in hi stead he would have gone said gandalf be not unjust in your grief boromir claim the errand and would not suffer ani other to have it he wa a master man and one to take what he desir i journey far with him and learn much of hi mood but you speak of hi death you have had news of that ere we came i have receiv thi said denethor and lay down hi rod he lift from hi lap the thing that he had been gaze at in each hand he held up one half of a great horn cloven through the middl a wildox horn bound with silver that is the horn that boromir alway wore cri pippin verili said denethor and in my turn i bore it and so did each eldest son of our hous far back into the vanish year befor the fail of the king sinc vorondil father of mardil hunt the wild kine of araw in the far field of rhûn i heard it blow dim upon the northern march thirteen day ago and the river brought it to me broken it will wind no more he paus and there wa a heavi silenc suddenli he turn hi black glanc upon pippin what say you to that halfl thirteen thirteen day falter pippin ye i think that would be so ye i stood besid him as he blew the horn but no help came onli more orc so said denethor look keenli at pippin face you were there tell me more whi did no help come and how did you escap and yet he did not so mighti a man as he wa and onli orc to withstand him pippin flush and forgot hi fear the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow he said and boromir wa pierc by mani when last i saw him he sank besid a tree and pluck a blackfeath shaft from hi side then i swoon and wa made captiv i saw him no more and know no more but i honour hi memori for he wa veri valiant he die to save us my kinsman meriadoc and myself waylaid in the wood by the soldieri of the dark lord and though he fell and fail my gratitud is none the less then pippin look the old man in the eye for pride stir strang within him still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voic littl servic no doubt will so great a lord of men think to find in a hobbit a halfl from the northern shire yet such as it is i will offer it in payment of my debt twitch asid hi grey cloak pippin drew forth hi small sword and laid it at denethor feet a pale smile like a gleam of cold sun on a winter even pass over the old man face but he bent hi head and held out hi hand lay the shard of the horn asid give me the weapon he said pippin lift it and present the hilt to him whenc came thi said denethor mani mani year lie on it sure thi is a blade wrought by our own kindr in the north in the deep past it came out of the mound that lie on the border of my countri said pippin but onli evil wight dwell there now and i will not willingli tell more of them i see that strang tale are woven about you said denethor and onc again it is shown that look may beli the man – or the halfl i accept your servic for you are not daunt by word and you have courteou speech strang though the sound of it may be to us in the south and we shall have need of all folk of courtesi be they great or small in the day to come swear to me now take the hilt said gandalf and speak after the lord if you are resolv on thi i am said pippin the old man laid the sword along hi lap and pippin put hi hand to the hilt and said slowli after denethor here do i swear fealti and servic to gondor and to the lord and steward of the realm to speak and to be silent to do and to let be to come and to go in need or plenti in peac or war in live or die from thi hour henceforth until my lord releas me or death take me or the world end so say i peregrin son of paladin of the shire of the halfl and thi do i hear denethor son of ecthelion lord of gondor steward of the high king and i will not forget it nor fail to reward that which is given fealti with love valour with honour oathbreak with vengeanc then pippin receiv back hi sword and put it in it sheath and now said denethor my first command to you speak and be not silent tell me your full tale and see that you recal all that you can of boromir my son sit now and begin as he spoke he struck a small silver gong that stood near hi footstool and at onc servant came forward pippin saw then that they had been stand in alcov on either side of the door unseen as he and gandalf enter bring wine and food and seat for the guest said denethor and see that none troubl us for one hour it is all that i have to spare for there is much els to heed he said to gandalf much of more import it may seem and yet to me less press but mayb we can speak again at the end of the day and earlier it is to be hope said gandalf for i have not ridden hither from isengard one hundr and fifti leagu with the speed of wind onli to bring you one small warrior howev courteou is it naught to you that théoden ha fought a great battl and that isengard is overthrown and that i have broken the staff of saruman it is much to me but i know alreadi suffici of these deed for my own counsel against the menac of the east he turn hi dark eye on gandalf and now pippin saw a like between the two and he felt the strain between them almost as if he saw a line of smoulder fire drawn from eye to eye that might suddenli burst into flame denethor look inde much more like a great wizard than gandalf did more kingli beauti and power and older yet by a sens other than sight pippin perceiv that gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom and a majesti that wa veil and he wa older far older how much older he wonder and then he thought how odd it wa that he had never thought about it befor treebeard had said someth about wizard but even then he had not thought of gandalf as one of them what wa gandalf in what far time and place did he come into the world and when would he leav it and then hi muse broke off and he saw that denethor and gandalf still look each other in the eye as if read the other mind but it wa denethor who first withdrew hi gaze yea he said for though the stone be lost they say still the lord of gondor have keener sight than lesser men and mani messag come to them but sit now then men came bear a chair and a low stool and one brought a salver with a silver flagon and cup and white cake pippin sat down but he could not take hi eye from the old lord wa it so or had he onli imagin it that as he spoke of the stone a sudden gleam of hi eye had glanc upon pippin face now tell me your tale my lieg said denethor half kindli half mockingli for the word of one whom my son so befriend will be welcom inde pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the pierc eye of the lord of gondor stab ever and anon by hi shrewd question and all the while consciou of gandalf at hi side watch and listen and so pippin felt hold in check a rise wrath and impati when the hour wa over and denethor again rang the gong pippin felt worn out it can not be more than nine oclock he thought i could now eat three breakfast on end lead the lord mithrandir to the hous prepar for him said denethor and hi companion may lodg with him for the present if he will but be it known that i have now sworn him to my servic and he shall be known as peregrin son of paladin and taught the lesser password send word to the captain that they shall wait on me here as soon as may be after the third hour ha rung and you my lord mithrandir shall come too as and when you will none shall hinder your come to me at ani time save onli in my brief hour of sleep let your wrath at an old man folli run off and then return to my comfort folli said gandalf nay my lord when you are a dotard you will die you can use even your grief as a cloak do you think that i do not understand your purpos in question for an hour one who know the least while i sit by if you understand it then be content return denethor pride would be folli that disdain help and counsel at need but you deal out such gift accord to your own design yet the lord of gondor is not to be made the tool of other men purpos howev worthi and to him there is no purpos higher in the world as it now stand than the good of gondor and the rule of gondor my lord is mine and no other man unless the king should come again unless the king should come again said gandalf well my lord steward it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event which few now look to see in that task you shall have all the aid that you are pleas to ask for but i will say thi the rule of no realm is mine neither of gondor nor ani other great or small but all worthi thing that are in peril as the world now stand those are my care and for my part i shall not wholli fail of my task though gondor should perish if anyth pass through thi night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in day to come for i also am a steward did you not know and with that he turn and strode from the hall with pippin run at hi side gandalf did not look at pippin or speak a word to him as they went their guid brought them from the door of the hall and then led them across the court of the fountain into a lane between tall build of stone after sever turn they came to a hous close to the wall of the citadel upon the north side not far from the shoulder that link the hill with the mountain within upon the first floor abov the street up a wide carven stair he show them to a fair room light and airi with goodli hang of dull gold sheen unfigur it wa spare furnish have but a small tabl two chair and a bench but at either side there were curtain alcov and wellclad bed within with vessel and basin for wash there were three high narrow window that look northward over the great curv of anduin still shroud in mist toward the emyn muil and rauro far away pippin had to climb on the bench to look out over the deep stone sill are you angri with me gandalf he said as their guid went out and close the door i did the best i could you did inde said gandalf laugh suddenli and he came and stood besid pippin put hi arm about the hobbit shoulder and gaze out of the window pippin glanc in some wonder at the face now close besid hi own for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merri yet in the wizard face he saw at first onli line of care and sorrow though as he look more intent he perceiv that under all there wa a great joy a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laugh were it to gush forth inde you did your best said the wizard and i hope that it may be long befor you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such terribl old men still the lord of gondor learn more from you than you may have guess pippin you could not hide the fact that boromir did not lead the compani from moria and that there wa one among you of high honour who wa come to mina tirith and that he had a famou sword men think much about the stori of old day in gondor and denethor ha given long thought to the rhyme and to the word isildur bane sinc boromir went away he is not as other men of thi time pippin and whatev be hi descent from father to son by some chanc the blood of westerness run nearli true in him as it doe in hi other son faramir and yet did not in boromir whom he love best he ha long sight he can perceiv if he bend hi will thither much of what is pass in the mind of men even of those that dwell far off it is difficult to deceiv him and danger to tri rememb that for you are now sworn to hi servic i do not know what put it into your head or your heart to do that but it wa well done i did not hinder it for gener deed should not be check by cold counsel it touch hi heart as well may i say it as pleas hi humour and at least you are free now to move about as you will in mina tirith – when you are not on duti for there is anoth side to it you are at hi command and he will not forget be wari still he fell silent and sigh well no need to brood on what tomorrow may bring for one thing tomorrow will be certain to bring wors than today for mani day to come and there is noth more that i can do to help it the board is set and the piec are move one piec that i greatli desir to find is faramir now the heir of denethor i do not think that he is in the citi but i have had no time to gather news i must go pippin i must go to thi lord council and learn what i can but the enemi ha the move and he is about to open hi full game and pawn are like to see as much of it as ani peregrin son of paladin soldier of gondor sharpen your blade gandalf went to the door and there he turn i am in hast pippin he said do me a favour when you go out even befor you rest if you are not too weari go and find shadowfax and see how he is hous these peopl are kindli to beast for they are a good and wise folk but they have less skill with hors than some with that gandalf went out and as he did so there came the note of a clear sweet bell ring in a tower of the citadel three stroke it rang like silver in the air and ceas the third hour from the rise of the sun after a minut pippin went to the door and down the stair and look about the street the sun wa now shine warm and bright and the tower and tall hous cast long clearcut shadow westward high in the blue air mount mindolluin lift it white helm and snowi cloak arm men went to and fro in the way of the citi as if go at the strike of the hour to chang of post and duti nine oclock wed call it in the shire said pippin aloud to himself just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring sunshin and how i should like breakfast do these peopl ever have it or is it over and when do they have dinner and where present he notic a man clad in black and white come along the narrow street from the centr of the citadel toward him pippin felt lone and made up hi mind to speak as the man pass but he had no need the man came straight up to him you are peregrin the halfl he said i am told that you have been sworn to the servic of the lord and of the citi welcom he held out hi hand and pippin took it i am name beregond son of baranor i have no duti thi morn and i have been sent to you to teach you the password and to tell you some of the mani thing that no doubt you will wish to know and for my part i would learn of you also for never befor have we seen a halfl in thi land and though we have heard rumour of them littl is said of them in ani tale that we know moreov you are a friend of mithrandir do you know him well well said pippin i have known of him all my short life as you might say and late i have travel far with him but there is much to read in that book and i can not claim to have seen more than a page or two yet perhap i know him as well as ani but a few aragorn wa the onli one of our compani i think who realli knew him aragorn said beregond who is he oh stammer pippin he wa a man who went about with us i think he is in rohan now you have been in rohan i hear there is much that i would ask you of that land also for we put much of what littl hope we have in it peopl but i am forget my errand which wa first to answer what you would ask what would you know master peregrin er well said pippin if i may ventur to say so rather a burn question in my mind at present is well what about breakfast and all that i mean what are the mealtim if you understand me and where is the diningroom if there is one and the inn i look but never a one could i see as we rode up though i had been born up by the hope of a draught of ale as soon as we came to the home of wise and courtli men beregond look at him grave an old campaign i see he said they say that men who go war afield look ever to the next hope of food and of drink though i am not a travel man myself then you have not yet eaten today well ye to speak in courtesi ye said pippin but no more than a cup of wine and a white cake or two by the kind of your lord but he rack me for it with an hour of question and that is hungri work beregond laugh at the tabl small men may do the greater deed we say but you have broken your fast as well as ani man in the citadel and with greater honour thi is a fortress and a tower of guard and is now in postur of war we rise ere the sun and take a morsel in the grey light and go to our duti at the open hour but do not despair he laugh again see the dismay in pippin face those who have had heavi duti take somewhat to refresh their strength in the midmorn then there is the nuncheon at noon or after as duti allow and men gather for the daymeal and such mirth as there still may be about the hour of sunset come we will walk a littl and then go find us some refresh and eat and drink on the battlement and survey the fair morn one moment said pippin blush greed or hunger by your courtesi put it out of my mind but gandalf mithrandir as you call him ask me to see to hi hors – shadowfax a great steed of rohan and the appl of the king eye i am told though he ha given him to mithrandir for hi servic i think hi new master love the beast better than he love mani men and if hi good will is of ani valu to thi citi you will treat shadowfax with all honour with greater kind than you have treat thi hobbit if it is possibl hobbit said beregond that is what we call ourselv said pippin i am glad to learn it said beregond for now i may say that strang accent do not mar fair speech and hobbit are a fairspoken folk but come you shall make me acquaint with thi good hors i love beast and we see them seldom in thi stoni citi for my peopl came from the mountainval and befor that from ithilien but fear not the visit shall be short a mere call of courtesi and we will go thenc to the butteri pippin found that shadowfax had been well hous and tend for in the sixth circl outsid the wall of the citadel there were some fair stabl where a few swift hors were kept hard by the lodg of the errandrid of the lord messeng alway readi to go at the urgent command of denethor or hi chief captain but now all the hors and the rider were out and away shadowfax whinni as pippin enter the stabl and turn hi head good morn said pippin gandalf will come as soon as he may he is busi but he send greet and i am to see that all is well with you and you rest i hope after your long labour shadowfax toss hi head and stamp but he allow beregond to handl hi head gentli and stroke hi great flank he look as if he were spoil for a race and not newli come from a great journey said beregond how strong and proud he is where is hi har it should be rich and fair none is rich and fair enough for him said pippin he will have none if he will consent to bear you bear you he doe and if not well no bit bridl whip or thong will tame him farewel shadowfax have patienc battl is come shadowfax lift up hi head and neigh so that the stabl shook and they cover their ear then they took their leav see that the manger wa well fill and now for our manger said beregond and he led pippin back to the citadel and so to a door in the north side of the great tower there they went down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamp there were hatch in the wall at the side and one of these wa open thi is the storehous and butteri of my compani of the guard said beregond greet targon he call through the hatch it is earli yet but here is a newcom that the lord ha taken into hi servic he ha ridden long and far with a tight belt and ha had sore labour thi morn and he is hungri give us what you have they got there bread and butter and chees and appl the last of the winter store wrinkl but sound and sweet and a leather flagon of newdrawn ale and wooden platter and cup they put all into a wicker basket and climb back into the sun and beregond brought pippin to a place at the east end of the great outthrust battlement where there wa an embrasur in the wall with a stone seat beneath the sill from there they could look out on the morn over the world they ate and drank and they talk now of gondor and it way and custom now of the shire and the strang countri that pippin had seen and ever as they talk beregond wa more amaz and look with greater wonder at the hobbit swing hi short leg as he sat on the seat or stand tipto upon it to peer over the sill at the land below i will not hide from you master peregrin said beregond that to us you look almost as one of our children a lad of nine summer or so and yet you have endur peril and seen marvel that few of our greybeard could boast of i thought it wa the whim of our lord to take him a nobl page after the manner of the king of old they say but i see that it is not so and you must pardon my foolish i do said pippin though you are not far wrong i am still littl more than a boy in the reckon of my own peopl and it will be four year yet befor i come of age as we say in the shire but do not bother about me come and look and tell me what i can see the sun wa now climb and the mist in the vale below had been drawn up the last of them were float away just overhead as wisp of white cloud born on the stiffen breez from the east that wa now flap and tug the flag and white standard of the citadel away down in the valleybottom five leagu or so as the eye leap the great river could now be seen grey and glitter come out of the northwest and bend in a mighti sweep south and west again till it wa lost to view in a haze and shimmer far beyond which lay the sea fifti leagu away pippin could see all the pelennor laid out befor him dot into the distanc with farmstead and littl wall barn and byre but nowher could he see ani kine or other beast mani road and track cross the green field and there wa much come and go wain move in line toward the great gate and other pass out now and again a horseman would ride up and leap from the saddl and hasten into the citi but most of the traffic went out along the chief highway and that turn south and then bend swifter than the river skirt the hill and pass soon from sight it wa wide and wellpav and along it eastern edg ran a broad green ridingtrack and beyond that a wall on the ride horsemen gallop to and fro but all the street seem to be choke with great cover wain go south but soon pippin saw that all wa in fact wellord the wain were move in three line one swifter drawn by hors anoth slower great waggon with fair hous of mani colour drawn by oxen and along the west rim of the road mani smaller cart haul by trudg men that is the road to the vale of tumladen and lossarnach and the mountainvillag and then on to lebennin said beregond there go the last of the wain that bear away to refug the age the children and the women that must go with them they must all be gone from the gate and the road clear for a leagu befor noon that wa the order it is a sad necess he sigh few mayb of those now sunder will meet again and there were alway too few children in thi citi but now there are nonesav some young lad that will not depart and may find some task to do my own son is one of them they fell silent for a while pippin gaze anxious eastward as if at ani moment he might see thousand of orc pour over the field what can i see there he ask point down to the middl of the great curv of the anduin is that anoth citi or what is it it wa a citi said beregond the chief citi of gondor of which thi wa onli a fortress for that is the ruin of osgiliath on either side of anduin which our enemi took and burn long ago yet we won it back in the day of the youth of denethor not to dwell in but to hold as an outpost and to rebuild the bridg for the passag of our arm and then came the fell rider out of mina morgul the black rider said pippin open hi eye and they were wide and dark with an old fear reawaken ye they were black said beregond and i see that you know someth of them though you have not spoken of them in ani of your tale i know of them said pippin softli but i will not speak of them now so near so near he broke off and lift hi eye abov the river and it seem to him that all he could see wa a vast and threaten shadow perhap it wa mountain loom on the verg of sight their jag edg soften by wellnigh twenti leagu of misti air perhap it wa but a cloudwal and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom but even as he look it seem to hi eye that the gloom wa grow and gather veri slowli slowli rise to smother the region of the sun so near to mordor said beregond quietli ye there it lie we seldom name it but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow sometim it seem fainter and more distant sometim nearer and darker it is grow and darken now and therefor our fear and disquiet grow too and the fell rider less than a year ago they won back the cross and mani of our best men were slain boromir it wa that drove the enemi at last back from thi western shore and we hold still the near half of osgiliath for a littl while but we await now a new onslaught there mayb the chief onslaught of the war that come when said pippin have you a guess for i saw the beacon last night and the errandrid and gandalf said that it wa a sign that war had begun he seem in a desper hurri but now everyth seem to have slow up again onli becaus everyth is now readi said beregond it is but the deep breath befor the plung but whi were the beacon lit last night it is overl to send for aid when you are alreadi besieg answer beregond but i do not know the counsel of the lord and hi captain they have mani way of gather news and the lord denethor is unlik other men he see far some say that as he sit alon in hi high chamber in the tower at night and bend hi thought thi way and that he can read somewhat of the futur and that he will at time search even the mind of the enemi wrestl with him and so it is that he is old worn befor hi time but howev that may be my lord faramir is abroad beyond the river on some peril errand and he may have sent tide but if you would know what i think set the beacon ablaz it wa the news that came yesterev out of lebennin there is a great fleet draw near to the mouth of anduin man by the corsair of umbar in the south they have long ceas to fear the might of gondor and they have alli them with the enemi and now make a heavi stroke in hi caus for thi attack will draw off much of the help that we look to have from lebennin and belfala where folk are hardi and numer all the more do our thought go north to rohan and the more glad are we for these tide of victori that you bring and yet – he paus and stood up and look round north east and south – the do at isengard should warn us that we are caught now in a great net and strategi thi is no longer a bicker at the ford raid from ithilien and from anórien ambush and pillag thi is a great war longplan and we are but one piec in it whatev pride may say thing move in the far east beyond the inland sea it is report and north in mirkwood and beyond and south in harad and now all realm shall be put to the test to stand or fall – under the shadow yet master peregrin we have thi honour ever we bear the brunt of the chief hatr of the dark lord for that hatr come down out of the depth of time and over the deep of the sea here will the hammerstrok fall hardest and for that reason mithrandir came hither in such hast for if we fall who shall stand and master peregrin do you see ani hope that we shall stand pippin did not answer he look at the great wall and the tower and brave banner and the sun in the high sky and then at the gather gloom in the east and he thought of the long finger of that shadow of the orc in the wood and the mountain the treason of isengard the bird of evil eye and the black rider even in the lane of the shire – and of the wing terror the nazgûl he shudder and hope seem to wither and even at that moment the sun for a second falter and wa obscur as though a dark wing had pass across it almost beyond hear he thought he caught high and far up in the heaven a cri faint but heartquel cruel and cold he blanch and cower against the wall what wa that ask beregond you also felt someth ye mutter pippin it is the sign of our fall and the shadow of doom a fell rider of the air ye the shadow of doom said beregond i fear that mina tirith shall fall night come the veri warmth of my blood seem stolen away for a time they sat togeth with bow head and did not speak then suddenli pippin look up and saw that the sun wa still shine and the banner still stream in the breez he shook himself it is pass he said no my heart will not yet despair gandalf fell and ha return and is with us we may stand if onli on one leg or at least be left still upon our knee rightli said cri beregond rise and stride to and fro nay though all thing must come utterli to an end in time gondor shall not perish yet not though the wall be taken by a reckless foe that will build a hill of carrion befor them there are still other fast and secret way of escap into the mountain hope and memori shall live still in some hidden valley where the grass is green all the same i wish it wa over for good or ill said pippin i am no warrior at all and dislik ani thought of battl but wait on the edg of one that i cant escap is worst of all what a long day it seem alreadi i should be happier if we were not oblig to stand and watch make no move strike nowher first no stroke would have been struck in rohan i think but for gandalf ah there you lay your finger on the sore that mani feel said beregond but thing may chang when faramir return he is bold more bold than mani deem for in these day men are slow to believ that a captain can be wise and learn in the scroll of lore and song as he is and yet a man of hardihood and swift judgement in the field but such is faramir less reckless and eager than boromir but not less resolut yet what inde can he do we can not assault the mountain of – of yonder realm our reach is shorten and we can not strike till some foe come within it then our hand must be heavi he smote the hilt of hi sword pippin look at him tall and proud and nobl as all the men that he had yet seen in that land and with a glitter in hi eye as he thought of the battl ala my own hand feel as light as a feather he thought but he said noth a pawn did gandalf say perhap but on the wrong chessboard so they talk until the sun reach it height and suddenli the noonbel were rung and there wa a stir in the citadel for all save the watchmen were go to their meal will you come with me said beregond you may join my mess for thi day i do not know to what compani you will be assign or the lord may hold you at hi own command but you will be welcom and it will be well to meet as mani men as you may while there is yet time i shall be glad to come said pippin i am lone to tell you the truth i left my best friend behind in rohan and i have had no one to talk to or jest with perhap i could realli join your compani are you the captain if so you could take me on or speak for me nay nay beregond laugh i am no captain neither offic nor rank nor lordship have i be but a plain man of arm of the third compani of the citadel yet master peregrin to be onli a man of arm of the guard of the tower of gondor is held worthi in the citi and such men have honour in the land then it is far beyond me said pippin take me back to our room and if gandalf is not there i will go where you like – as your guest gandalf wa not in the lodg and had sent no messag so pippin went with beregond and wa made known to the men of the third compani and it seem that beregond got as much honour from it as hi guest for pippin wa veri welcom there had alreadi been much talk in the citadel about mithrandir companion and hi long closet with the lord and rumour declar that a princ of the halfl had come out of the north to offer allegi to gondor and five thousand sword and some said that when the rider came from rohan each would bring behind him a halfl warrior small mayb but doughti though pippin had regret to destroy thi hope tale he could not be rid of hi new rank onli fit men thought to one befriend by boromir and honour by the lord denethor and they thank him for come among them and hung on hi word and stori of the outland and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish inde hi onli troubl wa to be wari accord to the counsel of gandalf and not to let hi tongu wag freeli after the manner of a hobbit among friend at length beregond rose farewel for thi time he said i have duti now till sundown as have all the other here i think but if you are lone as you say mayb you would like a merri guid about the citi my son would go with you gladli a good lad i may say if that pleas you go down to the lowest circl and ask for the old guesthous in the rath celerdain the lampwright street you will find him there with other lad that are remain in the citi there may be thing worth see down at the great gate ere the close he went out and soon after all the other follow the day wa still fine though it wa grow hazi and it wa hot for march even so far southward pippin felt sleepi but the lodg seem cheerless and he decid to go down and explor the citi he took a few morsel that he had save to shadowfax and they were gracious accept though the hors seem to have no lack then he walk on down mani wind way peopl stare much as he pass to hi face men were grave courteou salut him after the manner of gondor with bow head and hand upon the breast but behind him he heard mani call as those out of door cri to other within to come and see the princ of the halfl the companion of mithrandir mani use some other tongu than the common speech but it wa not long befor he learn at least what wa meant by ernil i pheriannath and knew that hi titl had gone down befor him into the citi he came at last by arch street and mani fair alley and pavement to the lowest and widest circl and there he wa direct to the lampwright street a broad way run toward the great gate in it he found the old guesthous a larg build of grey weather stone with two wing run back from the street and between them a narrow greensward behind which wa the manywindow hous front along it whole width by a pillar porch and a flight of step down on to the grass boy were play among the pillar the onli children that pippin had seen in mina tirith and he stop to look at them present one of them caught sight of him and with a shout he sprang across the grass and came into the street follow by sever other there he stood in front of pippin look him up and down greet said the lad where do you come from you are a stranger in the citi i wa said pippin but they say i have becom a man of gondor oh come said the lad then we are all men here but how old are you and what is your name i am ten year alreadi and shall soon be five feet i am taller than you but then my father is a guard one of the tallest what is your father which question shall i answer first said pippin my father farm the land round whitwel near tuckborough in the shire i am nearli twentynin so i pass you there though i am but four feet and not like to grow ani more save sideway twentynin said the lad and whistl whi you are quit old as old as my uncl iorla still he ad hope i wager i could stand you on your head or lay you on your back mayb you could if i let you said pippin with a laugh and mayb i could do the same to you we know some wrestl trick in my littl countri where let me tell you i am consid uncommonli larg and strong and i have never allow anyon to stand me on my head so if it came to a trial and noth els would serv i might have to kill you for when you are older you will learn that folk are not alway what they seem and though you may have taken me for a soft strangerlad and easi prey let me warn you i am not i am a halfl hard bold and wick pippin pull such a grim face that the boy step back a pace but at onc he return with clench fist and the light of battl in hi eye no pippin laugh dont believ what stranger say of themselv either i am not a fighter but it would be polit in ani case for the challeng to say who he is the boy drew himself up proudli i am bergil son of beregond of the guard he said so i thought said pippin for you look like your father i know him and he sent me to find you then whi did you not say so at onc said bergil and suddenli a look of dismay came over hi face do not tell me that he ha chang hi mind and will send me away with the maiden but no the last wain have gone hi messag is less bad than that if not good said pippin he say that if you would prefer it to stand me on my head you might show me round the citi for a while and cheer my loneli i can tell you some tale of far countri in return bergil clap hi hand and laugh with relief all is well he cri come then we were soon go to the gate to look on we will go now what is happen there the captain of the outland are expect up the south road ere sundown come with us and you will see bergil prove a good comrad the best compani pippin had had sinc he part from merri and soon they were laugh and talk gaili as they went about the street heedless of the mani glanc that men gave them befor long they found themselv in a throng go toward the great gate there pippin went up much in the esteem of bergil for when he spoke hi name and the password the guard salut him and let him pass through and what wa more he allow him to take hi companion with him that is good said bergil we boy are no longer allow to pass the gate without an elder now we shall see better beyond the gate there wa a crowd of men along the verg of the road and of the great pave space into which all the way to mina tirith ran all eye were turn southward and soon a murmur rose there is dust away there they are come pippin and bergil edg their way forward to the front of the crowd and wait horn sound at some distanc and the nois of cheer roll toward them like a gather wind then there wa a loud trumpetblast and all about them peopl were shout forlong forlong pippin heard men call what do they say he ask forlong ha come bergil answer old forlong the fat the lord of lossarnach that is where my grandsir

black fleet they are spare onli a tith of their strength still everi littl is a gain and so the compani came and were hail and cheer and pass through the gate men of the outland march to defend the citi of gondor in a dark hour but alway too few alway less than hope look for or need ask the men of ringló vale behind the son of their lord dervorin stride on foot three hundr from the upland of

alreadi the close hour wa draw nigh and the red sun had gone behind mindolluin shadow came down on the citi pippin look up and it seem to him that the sky had grown ashengrey as if a vast dust and smoke hung abov them and light came dulli through it but in the west the die sun had set all the fume on fire and now mindolluin stood black against a burn smoulder fleck with ember so end a fair day
