their dispos and onli wait for the honor of their command and they saunter about in a careless indol manner as if with a view to keep us in suspens i dont speak of thi in regard to miss mirvan and myself onli but to the ladi in gener and i thought it so provok that i determin in my own mind that far from humour such air i would rather not danc at all than with ani one who should seem to think me readi to accept the first partner who would condescend to take me not long after a young man who had for some time look at us with a kind of neglig impertin advanc on tipto toward me he had a set smile on hi face and hi dress wa so foppish that i realli believ he even wish to be stare at and yet he wa veri ugli bow almost to the ground with a sort of swing and wave hi hand with the greatest conceit after a short and silli paus he said madam may i presum and stop offer to take my hand i drew it back but could scarc forbear laugh allow me madam continu he affectedli break off everi half moment the honor and happi if i am not so unhappi as to address you too late to have the happi and honor again he would have taken my hand but bow my head i beg to be excus and turn to miss mirvan to

should relent and then utter some ridicul speech of sorrow and disappoint though hi face still wore the same invari smile he retreat it so happen as we have sinc recollect that dure thi littl dialogu mr mirvan wa convers with the ladi of the hous and veri soon after anoth gentleman who seem about sixandtwenti year old gayli but not soppishli dress and inde extrem handsom with an air of mix polit and gallantri desir to know if i wa engag or would honor him with my hand so he wa pleas to say though i am sure i know not what honor he could receiv from me but these sort of express i find are use as word of cours without ani distinct of person or studi of proprieti well i bow and i am sure i color for inde i wa frighten at the thought of danc befor so mani peopl all stranger and which wa wors with a stranger howev that wa unavoid for though i look round the room sever time i could not see one person that i knew and so he took my hand and led me to join in the danc the minuet were over befor we arriv for we were kept late by the millin make us wait for our thing he seem veri desir of enter into convers with me but i wa seiz with such a panic that i could hardli speak a word and noth but the shame of so soon chang my mind prevent my return to my seat and declin to danc at all he appear to be surpris at my terror which i believ wa but too appar howev he ask no question though i fear he must think it veri odd for i did not choos to tell him it wa owe to my never befor danc but with a schoolgirl hi convers wa sensibl and spirit hi air and address were open and nobl hi manner gentl attent and infinit engag hi person is all eleg and hi counten the most anim and express i have ever seen in a short time we were join by miss mirvan who stood next coupl to us but how wa i startl when she whisper me that my partner wa a nobleman thi gave me a new alarm how will he be provok thought i when he find what a simpl rustic he ha honor with hi choic one whose ignor of the world make her perpetu fear do someth wrong that he should be so much my superior everi way quit disconcert me and you will suppos my spirit were not much rais when i heard a ladi in pass us say thi is the most difficult danc i ever saw o dear then cri maria to her partner with your leav i will sit down till the next so will i too then cri i for i am sure i can hardli stand but you must speak to your partner first answer she for he had turn asid to talk with some gentlemen howev i had not suffici courag to address him and so away we all three tript and seat ourselv at anoth end of the room but unfortun for me miss mirvan soon after suffer herself to be prevail upon to attempt the danc and just as she rose to go she cri my dear yonder is your partner lord orvil walk about the room in search of you dont leav me then dear girl cri i but she wa oblig to go and then i wa more uneasi than ever i would have given the world to have seen mr mirvan and beg of her to make my apolog for what thought i can i possibl say for myself in excus for run away he must either conclud me a fool or half mad for ani one brought up in the great world and accustom to it way can have no idea of such sort of fear as mine i wa in the utmost confus when i observ that he wa everi where seek me with appar perplex and surpris but when at last i saw him move toward the place where i sat i wa readi to sink with shame and distress i found it absolut imposs to keep my seat becaus i could not think of a word to say for myself and so i rose and walk hastili toward the cardroom resolv to stay with mr mirvan the rest of the even and not to danc at all but befor i could find her lord orvil saw and approach me he beg to know if i wa not well you may easili imagin how much i wa confus i made no answer but hung my head like a fool and look on my fan he then with an air the most respect seriou ask if he had been so unhappi as to offend me no inde cri i and then in hope of chang the discours and prevent hi further inquiri i desir to know if he had seen the young ladi who had been convers with me no but would i honor him with my command to see for her o by no mean wa there ani other person with whom i wish to speak i said no befor i knew i had answer at all should he have the pleasur of bring me ani refresh i bow almost involuntarili and away he flew i wa quit asham at be so troublesom and so much abov myself as these seem air made me appear but inde i wa too much confus to think or act with ani consist if he had not been swift as lightn i dont know whether i should not have stolen away again but he return in a moment when i had drank a glass of lemonad he hope he said that i would again honor him with my hand as a new danc wa just begun i had not the presenc of mind to say a singl word and so i let him onc more lead me to the place i had left shock to find how silli how childish a part i had act my former fear of danc befor such a compani and with such a partner return more forcibl than ever i suppos he perceiv my uneasi for he entreat me to sit down again if danc wa disagre to me but i wa quit satisfi with the folli i had alreadi shown and therefor declin hi offer though i wa realli scarc abl to stand under such consciou disadvantag you may easili imagin my dear sir how ill i acquit myself but though i both expect and deserv to find him veri much mortifi and displeas at hi ill fortun in the choic he had made yet to my veri great relief he appear to be even content and veri much assist and encourag me these peopl in high life have too much presenc of mind i believ to seem disconcert or out of humor howev they may feel for had i been the person of the most consequ in the room i could not have met with more attent and respect when the danc wa over see me still veri much slurri he led me to a seat say that he would not suffer me to fatigu myself from polit and then if my capac or even if my spirit had been better in how anim a convers might i have been engag it wa then that i saw the rank of lord orvil wa hi least recommend hi understand and hi manner be far more distinguish hi remark upon the compani in gener were so apt so just so live i am almost surpris myself that they did not reanim me but inde i wa too well convinc of the ridicul part i had myself play befor so nice an observ to be abl to enjoy hi pleasantri so selfcompass gave me feel for other yet i had not the courag to attempt either to defend them or to ralli in my turn but listen to him in silent embarrass when he found thi he chang the subject and talk of public place and public perform but he soon discov that i wa total ignor of them he then veri ingeni turn the discours to the amus and occup of the countri it now struck me that he wa resolv to tri whether or not i wa capabl of talk upon ani subject thi put so great a constraint upon my thought that i wa unabl to go further than a monosyl and not even so far when i could possibl avoid it we were sit in thi manner he convers with all gaieti i look down with all foolish when that fop who had first ask me to danc with a most ridicul solemn approach and after a profound bow or two said i humbl beg pardon madam and of you too my lord for break in upon such agreeabl convers which must doubtless be much more delect than what i have the honor to offer but i interrupt him i blush for my folli with laugh yet i could not help it for ad to the man state foppish and he actual took snuff between everi three word when i look round at lord orvil i saw such extrem surpris in hi face the caus of which appear so absurd that i could not for my life preserv my graviti i had not laugh befor from the time i had left miss mirvan and i had much better have cri then lord orvil actual stare at me the beau i know not hi name look quit enrag refrain madam said he with an import air a few moment refrain i have but a sentenc to troubl you with may i know to what accid i must attribut not have the honor of your hand accid sir

consid the improprieti of refus one partner and afterward accept anoth i wa thunderstruck at the recollect but while these thought were rush into my head lord orvil with some warmth said thi ladi sir is incap of merit such an accus the creatur for i am veri angri with him made a low bow and with a grin the most malici i ever saw my lord said he far be it from me to accus the ladi for have the discern to distinguish and prefer the superior attract of your lordship again he bow and walk off wa ever ani thing so provok i wa readi to die with shame what a coxcomb exclaim lord orvil while i without know what i did rose hastili and move off i can not imagin cri i where mr mirvan ha hid herself give me leav to see answer he i bow and sat down again not dare to meet hi eye for what must he think of me between my blunder and the suppos prefer he return in a moment and told me that mr mirvan wa at card but would be glad to see me and i went immedi there wa but one chair vacant so to my great relief lord orvil present left us i then told mr mirvan my disast and she goodnaturedli blame herself for not have better instruct me but said she had taken it for grant that i must know such

and i am sure i color we soon walk on not like our situat howev he did not follow us and when we past by the orchestra again he wa gone afterward in the cours of the even we met him sever time but he wa alway with some parti and never spoke to us though whenev he chanc to meet my eye he condescend to bow i can not but be hurt at the opinion he entertain of me it is true my own behavior incur it yet is himself the most agreeabl and seemingli the most amiabl man in the world and therefor it is that i am griev to be thought ill of by him for of whose esteem ought we to be ambiti if not of those who most merit our own but it is too late to reflect upon thi now well i can not help it howev i think i have done with assembl thi morn wa destin for see sight auction curiou shop and so forth but my head ach and i wa not in a humor to be amus and so i made them go without me though veri unwillingli they are all kind and now i am sorri i did not accompani them for i know not what to do with myself i had resolv not to go to the play tonight but i believ i shall in short i hardli care whether i do or not i thought i had done wrong mr mirvan and maria have been half the town over and so entertain while i like a fool stay at home to do noth and at an auction in pall mall who should they meet but lord orvil he sat next to mr mirvan and they talk a great deal togeth but she gave me no account of

introduct for he ha realli shock me i do not like him he seem to be surli vulgar and disagre almost the same moment that maria wa present to him he began some rude jest upon the bad shape of her nose and call her a tall illform thing she bore it with the utmost goodhumour but that kind and sweettemp woman mr mirvan deserv a better lot i am amaz she would marri him for my own part i have been so shi that i have hardli spoken to him or he to me i can not imagin whi the famili wa so rejoic at hi return if he had spent hi whole life abroad i should have suppos they might rather have been thank than sorrow howev i hope they do not think so ill of him as i do at least i am sure they have too much prudenc to make it known saturday night we have been to the opera and i am still more pleas than i wa on tuesday i could have thought myself in paradis but for the continu talk of the compani around me we sat in the pit where everi bodi wa dress in so high a style that if i had been less delight with the perform my eye would have found me suffici entertain from look at the ladi i wa veri glad i did not sit next the captain for he could not bear the music or singer and wa extrem gross in hi observ on both when the opera wa over we went into a place call the coffeeroom where ladi as well as gentlemen assembl there are all sort of refresh and the compani walk about and chat with the same eas and freedom as in a privat room on monday we go to a ridotto and on wednesday we return to howard grove the captain say he will not stay here to be smoke with filth ani longer but have been seven year smoke with a burn sun he will retir to the countri and sink into a fairweath chap adieu my dear sir letter xiii evelina in continu tuesday april my dear sir we came home from the ridotto so late or rather so earli that it wa not possibl for me to write inde we did not go you will be frighten to hear it till past eleven oclock but nobodi doe a terribl revers of the order of natur we sleep with

accord to the resolut i had form howev maria laugh me out of my scrupl and so onc again i went to an assembl miss mirvan danc a minuet but i had not the courag to follow her exampl in our walk i saw lord orvil he wa quit alon but did not observ us yet as he seem of no parti i thought it wa not imposs that he might join us and though i did not wish much to danc at all yet as i wa more acquaint with him than with ani other person in the room i must own i could not help think it would be infinit more desir to danc again with him than with an entir stranger to be sure after all that had pass it wa veri ridicul to suppos it even probabl that lord orvil would again honor me with hi choic yet i am compel to confess my absurd by way of explain what follow miss mirvan wa soon engag and present after a veri fashion gaylook man who seem about year of age address himself to me and beg to have the honor of danc with me now maria partner wa a gentleman of mr mirvan acquaint for she had told us it wa highli improp for young women to danc with stranger at ani public assembl
