instanc of mr bs polit tender to me that no new one would be requir at my hand and when i said he wa alway most complais befor compani i littl expect that such an infer would be drawn from my word as would tend to question the uniform of hi behavior to me when there were no wit to it but i am glad you give me an opportun to clear up all your doubt on thi subject to begin then you first desir an instanc where mr b ha born with some infirm of mine next that in complais to my will he ha reced from hi own and lastli whether he break not into my retir unceremoni and without apolog or concern make no differ between the field or the stud and my chamber or closet i know not my dear miss what the distanc is at which the polit ladi and those of rank think it proper to endeavor to keep their husband but i will give you byandbi the subject of one convers onli which will answer all you mean as i apprehend and at the same time acquaint you with the notion and behavior of us both with respect to thi distanc and my retir and then leav you to judg as you think fit as to the first hi bear with my infirm he is daili give instanc of hi good to me on thi head and i am asham to say that of late i give him so much occas for them as i do but he see my apprehens at time though i endeavor to conceal it and no husband wa ever so sooth and so indulg as mr b he give me the best advic as to my maladi if i may call it one treat me with redoubl tender talk to me upon the subject i most delight to dwell upon as of my worthi parent what they are do at thi time and at that of our intend journey to london of the divers of the town of miss darnford compani and when he goe abroad send up my good mr jervi to me becaus i should not be alon at other time take me abroad with him bring thi neighbor and that neighbor to visit me and carri me to visit them talk of our journey to kent and into lincolnshir and to my ladi daverss to bath to tunbridg and i can not tell whither when the apprehend time shall be over in fine my dear miss darnford you can not imagin one half of hi tender good and polit to me inde you can not then as to what you call respect he watch everi motion of my eye everi turn of my counten seldom give hi opinion upon subject that he kindli imagin within my capac till he ha heard mine and i have the less fear of fall into mean complianc becaus hi generos is my guardian and never fail to exalt me more than i can debas myself or than it is possibl i can deserv then he hardli ever goe out to ani distanc but he bring me some pretti present that he think will be grate to me when at home is seldom out of my compani delight to teach me french and italian and read me piec of manuscript poetri in sever of the modern tongu for he speak them all explain to me everi thing i understand not delight to answer all my question and to encourag my inquisit and curios tri to give me a notion of pictur and medal and read me lectur upon them for he ha a fine collect of both and everi now and then will have it that he ha been improv by my question and observ what say you to these thing my dear miss do they come up to your first question or do they not or is not what i have said a full answer were i to say no more to all your inquiri can there be ani such thing as undu complianc to such an husband on my side think you and when i have charm to sleep by my grate duti that watch dragon prerog as ladi daver in one of her letter call it and am resolv not to awak it if i can help it by the least disoblig or wil pervers act what have i to apprehend from it o my dear miss i am thoroughli convinc that half the misunderstand among marri peopl are owe to trifl to petti distinct to mere word and littl captiou folli to overween or unguard petul and who would forego the solid satisfact of life for the sake of triumph in such poor content if one could triumph are such foibl as these to be dignifi by the name of inclin and humor which to be given up would be make such a sacrific as shall render the marri life littl desir to free and gener mind but say not my dear miss to free and gener mind for everi high spirit deserv not those epithet nor think what i say a partial in behalf of my own conduct and an argument for tame of spirit and such an one as would lick the dust for let me tell you my dear friend that dearli as i love and honor my mr b if he were to requir of me ani thing that i thought it wa my duti not to compli with i should be the unhappiest creatur in the world becaus i am sure i should withstand hi will and desir him to excus my complianc but then i would reserv my strength for these greater point and would never disput with him the smaller although they were not entir to my like and thi would give both forc and merit to the opposit when i found it necessari but to contest everi littl point where noth but one stubborn will wa in the question what an inexcus pervers would that be how readi to enter the list against an husband would it make one appear to him and where besid is the merit of oblig were we onli to yield to what will oblig ourselv but you next requir of me an instanc where in complais to my will he ha reced from hi own i dont know miss what to say to thi when mr b is all tender and indulg as i have said and requir of me noth that i can have a materi object to ought i not to oblig him can i have a will that is not hi or would it be excus if i had all littl matter as i have said i cheer give up great one have not yet occur between us and i hope never will one point inde i have some apprehens may happen and that to be plain with you is we have had a debat or two on the subject which i maintain of a mother duti to nurs her own child and i am sorri to say it he seem more determin than i wish he were against it i hope it will not proceed so far as to awaken the sleep dragon i mention prerog by name but i doubt i can not give up thi point veri contentedli but as to lesser point had i been a duchess born i think i would not have contest them with my husband upon the whole of thi question then i have realli had no will of my own to contend for so gener is mr b and so observ and so grate have i thought it my duti to be yet i could give you mani respect instanc too of hi reced when he ha desir to see what i have been write and i have told him to whom and beg to be excus one such nstanc i can give sinc i began thi letter thi is it i put it in my bosom when he came up he saw me do so are you write my dear what i must not see i am write to miss darnford sir and she beg you might not at present thi augment my curios pamela what can two such ladi write that i may not see if you will not be displeas sir i had rather you would not becaus miss desir you may not see her letter nor thi my answer till the latter is in her hand then i will not return mr b will thi instanc my dear miss come up to your demand for one where he reced from hi own will in complais to mine but now as to what both our notion and our practic are on the articl of my retir and whether he break in upon them unceremoni and without apolog let the convers i promis inform you which began on the follow occas mr b rode out earli one morn within a few day past and did not return till the afternoon an absenc i had not been use to of late and breakfast and dine without him be also a new thing to me i had such an impati to see him have expect him at dinner that i wa forc to retir to my closet to tri to divert it off by write and the gloomi conclus of my last wa then the subject he return about four oclock and inde did not tarri to chang hi ridingdress as your polit my dear friend would perhap have expect but came directli up to me with an impati to see me equal to my own when he wa told upon inquiri that i wa in my closet i heard hi welcom step as he came upstair which gener after a longer absenc than i expect ha such an effect upon my fond heart that it give a respons throb for everi step he take toward me and beat quicker and faster as he come nearer and nearer till tap my breast i say to it sometim lie still busi fool as thou art can thou not forbear let thi discern lord see thi nonsens emot i love to indulg thee in them myself it is true but then let nobodi els observ them for gener as thi master is thou may not perhap meet with such favor interpret as thou deservest when thou art alway flutter thu as he approach and playest off all thi littl joy frolick into the glow cheek and brighten eye of thi mistress which make her look as if she were consciou of some misdemeanour when all the time it is noth in the world but grate joy and a love so innoc that the purest mind might own it thi littl flutter and chide of the busi simpleton made me meet him but at the closetdoor instead of the entranc of my chamber as sometim i do so my dear love how do you fold hi kind arm about me and salut me with ardour whenev i have been but a few hour from you my impati to see my belov will not permit me to stand upon the formal of a messag to know how you are engag but i break in upon you even in my ridingdress as you see dear sir you are veri oblig but i have no notion of mere formal of thi kind how unpolit thi my dear miss in your friend in a marri state sinc it is imposs a virtuou wife can be employ about ani thing that her husband may not know and so need not fear surpris i am glad to hear you say thi my pamela for i have alway thought the extraordinari civil and distanc of thi kind which i have observ among sever person of rank altogeth unaccount for if they are exact by the ladi i should suspect she had reserv which she herself believ i could not approv of if not exact but practic of choic by the gentleman it carri with it in my opinion a fals air of polit littl less than affront to the ladi and dishonor to himself for doe it not look as if he suppos and allow that probabl she might be so employ that it wa necessari to appris her of hi visit left he should make discoveri not to her credit or hi own one would not sir for i thought hi conclus too sever make such a harsh supposit as thi neither for there are littl delicaci and moment of retir no doubt in which a modest ladi would be glad to be indulg by the tenderest husband it may be so in an earli matrimoni befor the ladi confid in the honor and discret of the man she ha chosen ha disengag her from her bridal reserv bridal reserv dear sir permit me to give it as my humbl opinion that a wife behavior ought to be as pure and as circumspect in degre as that of a bride or even of a maiden ladi be her confid in her husband honor and discret ever so great for inde i think a gross or a careless demeanor littl becom that modesti which is the peculiar excel and distinct of our sex you account veri well my dear by what you now say for your own overnic behavior as i have sometim thought it but are we not all apt to argu for a practic we make our own becaus we do make it our own rather than from the reason of the thing i hope sir that is not the present case with me for permit me to say that an overfre or neglig behavior in a ladi in the marri state must be a mark of disrespect to her consort and would show as if she wa veri littl solicit about what appear she made in hi eye and must not thi beget in him a slight opinion of her and her sex too as if suppos the gentleman had been a free liver she would convinc him there wa no other differ in the sex but as they were within or without the pale licens by the law or act in defianc of it i understand the forc of your argument pamela but you wa go to say someth more onli sir permit me to add that when in my particular case you injoin me to appear befor you alway see vol ii p dress even in the earli part of the day it would be wrong if i wa less regard of my behavior and action than of my appear i believ you are right my dear if a precis or unnecessari scrupul be avoid and where all is unaffect easi and natur as in my pamela for i have seen marri ladi both in england and franc who have kept a husband at greater distanc than they have exact from some of hi sex who have been more entitl to hi resent than to hi wife intimaci but to wave a subject in which as i can with pleasur say neither of us have much concern tell me my dearest how you were employ befor i came up here are pen and ink here too is paper but it is as spotless as your mind to whom wa you direct your favor now may i not know your subject mr hs letter wa a part of it and so i had put it by at hi approach and not choos he should see that i am write repli i to miss darnford but i think you must not ask me to see what i have written thi time i put it asid that you should not when i heard your welcom step the subject is our part with our nobl guest and a littl of my apprehens on an occas upon which our sex may write to one anoth but for some of the reason we have been mention gentlemen should not desir to see then i will not my dearest love so here miss is anoth instanc i could give you an hundr such of hi reced from hi own will in complais to mine onli continu he let me warn you against too much apprehens for your own sake as well as mine for such a mind as my pamela i can not permit to be habitu overcloud and yet there now hang upon your brow an overthought which you must not indulg inde sir i wa a littl too thought from my subject befor you came but your presenc like the sun ha dissip the mist that hung upon my mind see you not and i press hi hand with my lip they are all gone alreadi smile upon him with a delight unfeign not quit my oblig charmer and therefor if you have no object i will chang my dress and attend you in the chariot for an hour or two whither you pleas that not one shadow may remain visibl in thi dear face and then he salut me with ardour whither you pleas sir a littl air with you will be highli agreeabl to me the dear oblig went and chang hi dress in an instant and he led me to the chariot with hi usual tender polit and we had a charm air of sever mile return quit happi cheer and delight with each other convers without call in upon ani of our good neighbor for what need of that my dear miss when we could be the best compani in the world to each other now miss do these instanc come up to your question do they or do they not if you think not i could give you our convers in the chariot for i wrote it down at my first leisur so highli wa i delight with it for the subject wa my dearest parent a subject start by himself becaus he knew it would oblig me but be tire with write i may reserv it till have the pleasur of see you if you think it worth ask for and so i will hasten to a conclus of thi long letter you will perceiv my dear miss by what i have written in what sens it may be justli said that mr b is most complais to me befor compani perhap polit as you say to do credit to hi own gener choic but that he is more tender yea respect tender for that is the word with you and not less polit to me in our retir hour you will have no doubt from what i have relat and could further relat if it wa necessari for everi day produc instanc equal to what i have given you then my dear miss let me say to you what i could not so freeli say to ani other young ladi that i never could have hope i should be so happi as i am in other particular from a gentleman who ha given himself the liberti mr b ha done for i never hear from him in compani or when alon the least shock express or such frothi jest as tend to convey impur idea to the most apprehens mind there is inde the less wonder in thi and that we can glori in a true conjug chastiti as i have the vaniti to think hi love as well as my own is the love of the mind rather than that of person and our tenderest and most affect moment are those which lift us up abov sens and all that sens can imagin but thi is a subject too delic to be dwelt upon even to you and you will better comprehend all i mean when your pure mind meet with a gentleman of exalt sens like mr b whom if you find not so good as you wish your exampl will make so permit me to add for the sake of you my dear parent as well as for those of my muchrespect friend who have join in the kind caution you give me my dear miss against get into too thought and gloomi a way that there is no great fear that i should continu long in it when i have so kind and so gener a comfort as mr b for at hi presenc all my fear apprehens are dissip and vanish like a morn dream and depend upon it that so sure as the day succe to the night so sure will my mind while capabl of the least sens of gratitud be illumin the moment he shine out upon me let it be ever so overcast in hi absenc through imaginari doubt and apprehend evil i have onli further to add for my comfort that next thursday sevnnight if noth hinder we are to set out for london and whi do you think i say for my comfort onli that i shall then soon have the opportun to assur you person as you give me hope how much i am my dear miss darnford your truli affection pb i will show you when i see you the convers you requir about the young ladi letter iii my dear miss one more letter and i have done for a great while becaus i hope your presenc will put an

from letter written formerli to my dear parent an see vol ii p account of my former dairyhous visit and what the peopl were and whom i saw there and although i besought you to keep that affair to yourself as too touch a point to the reput of my mr b to be known but to you onli and even to destroy it when you had perus it yet i make no doubt you rememb the stori and so i need not repeat ani

attend by the governesss daughter a discreet young gentlewoman as soon as i step out missran into my arm with great eager and i as tenderli embrac her and lead her into the parlour ask her abund of

some few alter to make thing still more commodi he ha furnish me out a littl pretti librari and ha allot me veri conveni apart besid and the furnitur of everi place is rich as befit the mind and fortun of the gener owner but i shall not offer at particular becaus we hope to have the honor of a visit from my good lord and your ladyship befor the winter weather set in to make the road too dirti and deep but it is proper to mention that the hous is so larg that we make a great number of bed the more conveni to receiv the honor your ladyship and my lord and mr bs other friend will do us i have not yet been at ani of the public divers mr b ha carri me by gentl turn out of hi workmen way ten mile round thi overgrown capit and through the princip of it numer street the villag that lie spangl about thi vast circumfer as well on the other side the nobl thame which i had befor a notion of from sir john denbam celebr cooper hill as well as on the middlesex side are beauti both by build and situat beyond what i could conceiv and sever of them seem larger than mani of our countri town of note but it would be impertin to troubl your ladyship with these matter who are no stranger to what is worthi of notic in london but i wa surpris when mr b observ to me that thi whole counti and the two citi of london and westminst are repres by no more than eight member of parliament when so mani borough town in england are inferior to the meanest villag about london i am in daili expect of the arriv of miss darnford and then i shall wish accompani by a young ladi of so polit a tast to see a good play mr b ha alreadi shown me the operahous and the two play hous though silent as i may say that as he wa pleas to observ they should not be new to me and that the sight might not take off my attent to the perform when i went to the play so that i can conceiv a toler notion of everi thing from the disposit of the seat the box the galleri the pit the music the scene and the stage and so shall have no occas to gaze about me like a countri novic wherebi i might attract a notic that i should not with either for my own credit or your dear brother honor i have had a pleasur which i wish for and had not in bedfordshir and that is that on sunday i wa at church without gape crowd to attend us and wish too loud for my own yet i wa more gaze at and so wa mr b than i expect consid there were so mani welldressd gentri and some nobil there and they stard as much as ani bodi but will not do so i hope when we ceas to be a novelti we have alreadi had sever visitor to welcom mr b to town and to congratul him on hi marriag but some no doubt to see and to find fault with hi rustic for it is imposs you know madam that a gentleman so distinguish by hi merit and fortun should have taken a step of such consequ to himself and famili and not be known by everi bodi so to have done sir thoma atkyn is in town and ha taken apart in the newbuilt state pile of edific call hanoversquar and he brought with him a younger brother of mr arthur who it seem is a merchant lord f ha been to pay hi respect to mr b likewis whose schoolfellow he wa eaton the littl time mr b wa there hi lordship promis that hi ladi shall make me a visit and accompani me to the opera as soon as we are fulli settl a gentleman of the templ mr turner by name and mr fanshaw of greysinn both lawyer and of mr bs former acquaint veri sprightli and modish gentlemen have also welcom us to town and made mr b abund of gay compliment on my account to my face all in the common frothi run they may be polit gentlemen but i can not say i overmuch like them there is someth so forward so opinion so seemingli insens of rebuk either from within or without and yet not promis to avoid deserv one occasion that i could as liev wish mr b and they would not renew their former acquaint i am veri bold your ladyship will say but you command me to write freeli yet i would not he thought to be uneasi with regard to your dear brother moral from these gentlemen for oh madam i am a bless creatur and am hourli happier and happier in the confid i have as to that particular but i imagin they will forc themselv upon him more than he himself may wish or would permit were the acquaint now to begin for they are not of hi turn of mind as it seem to me be by a sentenc or two that drop from them veri free and veri frothi in their convers and by their laugh at what they say themselv take that for wit which will not stand the test if i may be allow to say so but they have heard no doubt what a charact mr bs good to me ha lift into notic and they think themselv warrant to say ani thing befor hi countri girl he wa pleas to ask me when they were gone how i like hi two lawyer and said they were person of famili and fortun i am glad of it sir said i for their own sake then you dont approv of them pamela they are your friend sir and i can not have ani dislik to them they say good thing sometim return he i dont doubt it sir but you say good thing alway it is happi for me my dear you think so but tell me what think you of em i shall be better abl sir to answer your question if i see them a second time but we form notion of person at first sight sometim my dear and you are seldom mistaken in your i onli think sir that they have neither of them ani diffid but their profess perhap may set them abov that they dont practic my dear their fortun requir it not of them and they are too studiou of their pleasur to give themselv ani troubl they are not oblig to take they seem to me sir to be qualifi for prastic they would make great figur at the bar i fansi whi so becaus sir they seem if i must speak gentlemen of great elocut how do you discov that my dear onli that they seem prepar to think well of what they shall say themselv and lightli of what other peopl say or may think of them that inde my dear is the necessari charact of a public speaker be he lawyer or what he will the man who can not doubt himself and can judg contempt of hi auditor never fail to speak with selfapplaus at least but you will pardon me good sir for speak my mind so freeli and so earli of these your friend i never my love ask you a question i wish you not to answer and alway expect your answer should be without reserv for mani time i may ask your opinion as a correct or a confirm of my own judgment how kind how indulg wa thi my good ladi but you know how gener your dear brother treat me on all occas and thi make me so bold as i often am it may be necessari my dear ladi to give you an account of our visitor in order to make the futur part of my write the more intellig becaus what i may have to write may turn sometim upon the compani we see for which reason i shall also just mention sir georg stuart a scottish gentleman with whom mr b came acquaint in hi travel who seem to be a polit and mr b say is a learn man and a virtuoso he and a nephew of hi of the same name a bash gentleman and who for that reason i imagin ha a merit that lie deeper than a first observ can reach are just gone from us and were receiv with so much civil by mr b as intitl them to my respect regard thu madam do i run on in a manner without materi and onli to show you the pleasur i take in obey you i hope my good lord daver continu in health and me in hi favor which i valu extrem as well as your ladyship mr h i hope likewis enjoy hi health but let me not forget my particular and thank respect to the countess for her ladyship favor and good to me which i shall ever place next in my grate esteem to the honor i have receiv from your ladyship on so mani occas and which bind me to be with the greatest respect my dear ladi your faith and oblig servant p b letter vi my dear father and mother i write to you both at thi time for your advic in a particular case that is the onli one that i have had or i hope ever shall have with my dear benefactor by way of disput and as he is pleas to insist upon hi way and it is a point of conscienc with me i must resolv i think to be determin by your joint advic and if my father and mother and husband are of one opinion i must yield up my own thi is the subject i think a mother ought if she can to be the nurs to her own children mr b say he will not permit it it is the first will not i have heard from him or given occas for and i tell him that as it is a point of conscienc with me i hope he will indulg me but the dear gentleman ha an odd way of argu that sometim puzzl me he pretend to answer me from scriptur but i have some doubt of hi exposit and he give me leav to write to you though yet he will not promis to be determin by your opinion if they are not the same with hi own and i say to him is thi fair my dearest mr b is it he ha got the dean opinion with him for our debat began befor we came to town but then he would not let me state the case but did it himself and yet it is but an half opinion as i may say neither for it is that if the husband is set upon it it is a wife duti to obey but i can not see how that is for if it be the natur duti of a mother it is a divin duti and how can a husband have power to discharg a divin duti as great as a wife oblig is to obey her husband which is i own one indispens of the marriag contract it ought not to interfer with what one take to be a superior duti and must not one be one own judg of action by which we must stand or fall i will tell you my plea i say that where a mother is unhealthi subject to commun distemp as scrophul or scorbut or consumpt disord which have infect the blood or lung or where they have not plenti of nourish for the child as i have heard is the case of some that in these case a dispens lie of cours but where there is good health free spirit and plenti nourish i think it an indispens duti for thi wa the custom of old of all the good wive we read of in scriptur then the nourish of the mother must be most natur to the child then a nurs may have a bad husband may have distemp may have privat vice as to liquor etc may be careless and a selflov while a mother prefer the health of her child to her own privat satisfact or appetit a nurs may be of a sordid natur and when i have heard mr b so satir on lord and gentlemen in coachbox whi may not chariti make one think that the ladi of the famili wa innoc of sordid and unpardon crime imput by sever judg and that the child when grown up owe it tast to the coachbox to it nurs be the coachman wife or the wife of one of like degre who may not have a mind or qualiti abov that degre for as the blood and spirit are augment with the child growth by the food it take in a sordid natur may as well be commun from a sound woman as bad health by an unsound as i should imagin then the child by the design of natur gener bring it nourish into the world with it and art must be use as i presum to dri up the fountain of such it nourish and is not thi quit unnatur and is not what is unnatur sin then i have late read my circumst have made me curiou on thi subject that a newborn child ha in it littl bowel a pitchi substanc that want to be purg off and when it is not occas those gripe and convuls which destroy so mani miser infant even as one find by the weekli bill here in town more than half of those who die in infanc wherea natur ha design it seem a cure for thi in the purg qualiti and fine thin blueness given to the first milk which in three week or a month or may be less carri off that pitchi substanc and give freedom and eas to the bowel of babi a qualiti which not be in staler milk the poor child often fall a sacrific to thi neglig or inattent and the mother pain and hazard are all cast away and her grief at lose the dear infant are much greater than her joy at it birth when all the danger wa over then dear sir said i there is anoth point respect the health of our sex great hurt to one constitut may aris from too frequent be in thi circumst and for my own part you have made me so happi that i can not help be covet of life if i may so say but the sin dear sir the sin of commit that task to other which is so right to be perform by one self if one ha health and strength to perform it is the chief thing with me and you know sir that even a husband will is not suffici to excus one from a natur or divin oblig these were my plea among other and thi is hi answer for he wa so good to give it me in write as to what you alleg my dear of old custom time and fashion are much chang if you tell me of sarah or rachel or rebekah or leah nurs their own children i can answer that the one drew water at a well for her father flock anoth knead cake and bake them on the hearth for her guest anoth person dress savouri meat for her husband and all of them perform the common offic of the household and when our modern ladi are will to follow such exampl in everi thing their plea ought to be allow in thi as to the matter of sordid natur we read that there were among jacob twelv son bad as well as good natur though born of and nurs by the same mother reuben particularli commit an unpardon crime you are too well read in scripturehistori to need be told what it wa two other were murder treacher murder in cold blood and how did all their heart burn with sordid and unbrotherli envi against their father favorit son then it requir but the more care in find out a wholesom woman who ha an honest and goodnatur husband and let me tell you pamela that the best natur and the best constitut though your case is an except are not alway to be met with in highlif and the less perhap becaus they dont exercis themselv as the patriarch nurs you hint at use to do inde i have seen spirit in some of the highborn of your sex that one would not wish to be propag but contrarili if there be so much in the natur of the nourish i should think it matter of prudenc that the child should have ani other nurs than it mother as to the nurs privat vice with regard to liquor distemp etc thi will be answer by what i have hint of the greater care to be taken in the choic of the nurs and i am so well pleas with your apprehens of thi natur that it is a moral secur to me that you will make a proper choic and i shall be entir easi in commit thi provinc to so prudent and discreet a wife i allow that there is a great deal in what you say as to the pitchi substanc in newborn children and i think it veri proper that the child should have the first milk but can not such a nurs be found as may answer thi intent if she can not i will provid you deal by me with your usual sincer and not make scrupl against a recommend on purpos to carri your own point permit you to be your own nurs for one month or so if by the opinion of proper judg it be found necessari but then as i know the pretti wiredraw way of your sex you must not so much as ask to go farther for i shall not care to have my rest disturb and it may not be quit so well perhap to lay us under the necess of separ bed besid my fond for your person grace and the laudabl and i will say honest pleasur i take in that easi genteel form which everi bodi admir in you at first sight oblig me to declar that i can by no mean consent to sacrific these to the careless into which i have seen veri nice ladi sink when they becam nurs moreov my chief delight in you is for the beauti of your mind and unequal as they are in my opinion you have still a geniu capabl of great improv and i shall not care when i want to hear my pamela read her french and latin lesson which i take so much delight to teach her and to endeavor to improv myself from her virtu and pieti at the same time to seek my belov in the nurseri or to permit her to be engross by those babi offic which will better befit weaker mind no my dear you must allow me to look upon you as my scholar in one sens as my companion in anoth and as my instructress in a third you know i am not govern by the worst motiv i am half overcom by your virtu and you must take care that you leav not your work halfdon but i can not help look upon the nurs offic as an offic beneath my pamela let it have your inspect your direct and your sole attent if you pleas when i am abroad but when i am at home even a son and heir so jealou am i of your affect shall not be my rival in them nor will i have my rest broken in upon by your servant bring to you as you onc propos your dear littleon at time perhap as unsuit to my repos and your own as to the child necess for i have no notion of stifl even a cri by cram it littl stomach when that veri cri shall perhap be necessari for exercis to it lung and to open it littl organ you have been often somewhat uneasi when i have talk for argument sake in favor of polygami but when you mention the design of natur and form from thenc your notion of duti on thi subject what will you say if i could from your veri argument of thi kind plead for that practic and bring all your good patriarch folk on my side on whom you lay such stress in one instanc for exampl my dear suppos i put you in mind that while rachel wa give her littleon all her attent as a good nurs the worthi patriarch had sever other wive dont be shock my dearest love the law of one own countri are a suffici object to me against polygami at least i will not think of ani more wive till you convinc me by your adher to the exampl given you by the patriarch wive that i ought to follow those of the patriarch husband so here is that nasti word polygami again mr b know i had rather he should mention ani thing than that but be so good as to mind hi next argument he is pleas to entertain veri high notion though he put them not in practic and inde i think it my duti to avoid give him occas for it of the prerogativeof a husband upon my word he sometim for argument sake make a bodi think a wife should not have the least will of her own he set up a dispens power in short although he know that that doctrin onc cost a princ hi crown and thu proceed with hi answer to my plea he argu the chief thing that stick with you my dear pamela is that you think it unnatur in a mother not to be a nurs to her own child if she can and what is unnatur you say is a sin now my dear although your practic be so unexception you seem not to have a right notion of the obedi which a wife natur owe as well as voluntarili vow to a husband will in all law thing you will say but suppos my dear you were to make a solemn vow either as a singl woman or as a wife to do ani thing that you had a natur power to do no doubt you would think yourself under an oblig to perform it let the consequ be what it would but to show you who are so learn in the old law of how littl forc even the vow of your sex are and how much you are under the control of our read the follow vers in number xxx if a man vow a vow unto the lord or swear an oath to bind hi soul with a bond he shall not break hi word he shall do accord to all that proce out of hi mouth the reason of thi is he is sole and independ and master of hi own will and action but what follow if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord and bind herself by a bond be in her father hous in her youth and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she ha bound her soul and her father shall hold hi peac at her then all her vow shall stand and everi bond wherewith she ha bound her soul shall stand but if her father disallow her in the day that he hear not ani of her vow or of her bond wherewith she ha bound her soul shall stand and the lord shall forgiv her becaus her father disallow her the veri same thing is with equal strength express in the vers immedi follow in relat to a husband allow or disallow hi wife vow nor is it distinguish at all whether the vow be just or unjust and it is worthi of observ too that the law of england in consider of the obedi a wife owe to a husband will acquit a woman of certain crime for which they will punish a man with death what i have mention therefor show how much the daughter is under the absolut control of her father and the wife of her husband so that you see my dear even in such a strong point as solemn vow to the lord the wife may be absolv by the husband from the perform of it and by the way thi is no bad piec of inform to young ladi who are urg by their design lover to enter into vow and contract in their favor not one of which you see is of forc unless the father and by the same rule those who have author over her and stand in the father place approv and confirm it if thi therefor be the case in so solemn a point sure an husband may take upon himself to dispens with such a suppos oblig as that which you seem so loath to give up even although you had made a vow that you would nurs your own child and the rather if the principl an husband act upon is laudabl a desir to continu hi affection and faith regard to hi wife to preserv in her as long as may be preserv those grace and those delicaci of person which he admir in her and which it is imposs a thorough nurs should keep up and as moreov in your case her time may be employ to so much greater improv to her own mind and her husband moral while he can look upon her in a light abov that of an insipid prattl nurs who must becom a fool and a babi herself befor she can be complet in the charact into which you my dear want to dwindl some gentlemen may be fond of have their ladi undertak thi provinc and veri good reason may be assign for such their fond but it suit not me at all and yet no man would be thought to have a greater affect for children than myself or be more desir to do them justic for i think everi one should look forward to poster with a prefer but if my pamela can be better impoyd if the offic can be equal well perform if your direct and superintend
