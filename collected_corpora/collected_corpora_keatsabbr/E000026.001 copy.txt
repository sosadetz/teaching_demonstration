that my father wa sincer in hi disdain of vengeanc further on describ hi polit feel she say that on the subject of the union in parliamentari phrase he had not then been abl to make up hi mind she describ with some pride hi first speech in the irish hous at two oclock in the morn when the weari member were scarc awak to hear it and when some of the outstretch member were arous by their

give mani reason in favour of what appear to be the advantag of the union he unexpectedli gave hi vote against it becaus he said he had been convinc by what he had heard one night that the union wa decidedli against the wish of the major of men of sens and properti in the nation he ad and sure mr edgeworth opinion should go for someth still that if he should be convinc that the opinion of the countri chang hi vote would be in it favour hi biograph tell us that mr edgeworth wa much compliment on hi speech by both side by those for whom he vote and also by those who found that the best argument on the other side of the question had been undoubtedli made by him it is a somewhat complic statement and state of feel to follow to the faith daughter noth is imposs where her father is concern thi vote i believ cost mr edgeworth hi peerag when it wa known that he had vote against the union he becam suddenli the idol of those who would previous have stone him say hi devot biograph it

poor thadi say and have better than fifteen hundr a year land estat look down upon honest thadi but i wash my hand of hi do and as i have live so will i die true and loyal to the famili the famili of rackrent is i am proud to say one of the most ancient in the kingdom and then he give the histori of the rackrent begin with sir patrick who could sit out the best man in ireland let alon the three kingdom itself and who fit up the chickenhous to accommod hi friend when they honour him unexpectedli with their compani there wa such a fine whillaluh at sir patrick funer you might have heard it to the farthest end of the counti and happi the man who could get but a sight of the hears then came sir murtagh who use to boast that he had a lawsuit for everi letter in the alphabet he dug up a fairymount against my advic say thadi and had no luck afterward sir murtagh in hi passion broke a bloodvessel and all the law in the land could do noth in that case my ladi had a fine jointur settl upon her and took herself away to the great joy of the tenantri i never said anyth one way or the other say thadi whilst she wa part of the famili but got up to see her go at three oclock in the morn it a fine morn honest thadi say she goodby to ye and into the carriag she step without a word more good or bad or even halfacrown but i made my bow and stood to see her safe out of sight for the sake of the famili how marvel vivid it all is everi word tell as the gener pass befor us the veri spirit of romant irish fidel is incarn in thadi jason quirk repres the felin element which also belong to our extraordinari celtic race the littl volum contain the histori of a nation it is a masterpiec which miss edgeworth ha never surpass it is almost provok to have so mani detail of other and less interest stori such as earli lesson a knapsack the prussian vase etc and to hear so littl of these two book by which she will be best rememb author prefac the prevail tast of the public for anecdot ha been censur and ridicul by critic who aspir to the charact of superior wisdom but if we consid it in a proper point of view thi tast is an incontest proof of the good sens and profoundli philosoph temper of the present time of the number who studi or at least who read histori how few deriv ani advantag from their labour the hero of histori are so deck out by the fine fanci of the profess historian they talk in such measur prose and act from such sublim or such diabol motiv that few have suffici tast wicked or heroism to sympathis in their fate besid there is much uncertainti even in the best authent ancient or modern histori and that love of truth which in some mind is innat and immut necessarili lead to a love of secret memoir and privat anecdot we can not judg either of the feel or of the charact of men with perfect accuraci from their action or their appear in public it is from their careless convers their halffinish sentenc that we may hope with the greatest probabl of success to discov their real charact the life of a great or of a littl man written by himself the familiar letter the diari of ani individu publish by hi friend or by hi enemi after hi deceas are esteem import literari curios we are sure justifi in thi eager desir to collect the most minut fact rel to the domest live not onli of the great and good but even of the worthless and insignific sinc it is onli by a comparison of their actual happi or miseri in the privaci of domest life that we can form a just estim of the real reward of virtu or the real punish of vice that the great are not as happi as they seem that the extern circumst of fortun and rank do not constitut felic is assert by everi moralist the historian can seldom consist with hi digniti paus to illustr thi truth it is therefor to the biograph we must have recours after we have beheld splendid charact play their part on the great theatr of the world with all the advantag of stage effect and decor we anxious beg to be admit behind the scene that we may take a nearer view of the actor and actress some may perhap imagin that the valu of biographi depend upon the judgment and tast of the biograph but on the contrari it may be maintain that the merit of a biograph are invers as the extent of hi intellectu power and of hi literari talent a plain unvarnish tale is prefer to the most highli ornament narr where we see that a man ha the power we may natur suspect that he ha the will to deceiv us and those who are use to literari manufactur know how much is often sacrif to the round of a period or the point of an antithesi that the ignor may have their prejudic as well as the learn can not be disput but we see and despis vulgar error we never bow to the author of him who ha no great name to sanction hi absurd the partial which blind a biograph to the defect of hi hero in proport as it is gross ceas to be danger but if it be conceal by the appear of candour which men of great abil best know how to assum it endang our judgment sometim and sometim our moral if her grace the duchess of newcastl instead of pen her lord elabor eulogium had undertaken to write the life of savag we should not have been in ani danger of mistak an idl ungrat libertin for a man of geniu and virtu the talent of a biograph are often fatal to hi reader for these reason the public often judici counten those who without sagac to discrimin charact without eleg of style to reliev the tedious of narr without enlarg of mind to draw ani conclus from the fact they relat simpli pour forth anecdot and retail convers with all the minut prolix of a gossip in a countri town the author of the follow memoir ha upon these ground fair claim to the public favour and attent he wa an illiter old steward whose partial to the famili in which he wa bred and born must be obviou to the reader he tell the histori of the rackrent famili in hi vernacular idiom and in the full confid that sir patrick sir murtagh sir kit and sir condi rackrent affair will be as interest to all the world as they were to himself those who were acquaint with the manner of a certain class of the gentri of ireland some year ago will want no evid of the truth of honest thadi narr to those who are total unacquaint with ireland the follow memoir will perhap be scarc intellig or probabl they may appear perfectli incred for the inform of the ignor english reader a few note have been subjoin by the editor and he had it onc in contempl to translat the languag of thadi into plain english but thadi idiom is incap of translat and besid the authent of hi stori would have been more expos to doubt if it were not told in hi own characterist manner sever year ago he relat to the editor the histori of the rackrent famili and it wa with some difficulti that he wa persuad to have it commit to write howev hi feel for the honour of the famili as he express himself prevail over hi habitu lazi and he at length complet the narr which is now laid befor the public the editor hope hi reader will observ that these are tale of other time that the manner depict in the follow page are not those of the present age the race of the rackrent ha long sinc been extinct in ireland and the drunken sir patrick the litigi sir murtagh the fight sir kit and the slovenli sir condi are charact which could no more be met with at present in ireland than squir western or parson trullib in england there is a time when individu can bear to be ralli for their past folli and absurd after they have acquir new habit and a new conscious nation as well as individu gradual lose attach to their ident and the present gener is amus rather than offend by the ridicul that is thrown upon it ancestor probabl we shall soon have it in our power in a hundr instanc to verifi the truth of these observ when ireland lose her ident by an union with great britain she will look back with a smile of goodhumour complac on the sir kit and sir condi of her former exist castl rackrent monday morn see glossari have out of friendship for the famili upon whose estat prais be heaven i and mine have live rentfre time out of mind voluntarili undertaken to publish the memoir of the rackrent famili i think it my duti to say a few word in the first place concern myself my real name is thadi quirk though in the famili i have alway been known by no other than honest thadi afterward in the time of sir murtagh deceas i rememb to hear them call me old thadi and now ive come to poor thadi for i wear a long greatcoat winter and summer which is veri handi as i never put my arm into the sleev they are as good as new though come holantid next ive had it these seven year it hold on by a singl button round my neck cloak fashion the cloak or mantl as describ by thadi is of high antiqu spenser in hi view of the state of ireland prove that it is not as some have imagin peculiarli deriv from the scythian but that most nation of the world ancient use the mantl for the jew use it as you may read of eliass mantl etc the chalde also use it as you may read in diodoru the egyptian likewis use it as you may read in herodotu and may be gather by the descript of berenic in the greek commentari upon callimachu the greek also use it ancient as appear by venuss mantl line with star though afterward they chang the form thereof into their cloak call pallai as some of the irish also use and the ancient latin and roman use it as you may read in virgil who wa a great antiquari that evand when aenea came to him at hi feast did entertain and feast him sit on the ground and lie on mantl insomuch that he useth the veri word mantil for a mantl humi mantilia sternunt so that it seemeth that the mantl wa a gener habit to most nation and not proper to the scythian onli spenser knew the conveni of the said mantl as hous bed and cloth iren becaus the commod doth not countervail the discommod for the inconveni which therebi do aris are much more mani for it is a fit hous for an outlaw a meet bed for a rebel and an apt cloak for a thief first the outlaw be for hi mani crime and villani banish from the town and hous of honest men and wander in wast place far from

hi bed yea and almost hi household stuff to look at me you would hardli think poor thadi wa the father of attorney quirk he is a high gentleman and never mind what poor thadi say and have better than fifteen hundr a year land estat look down upon honest thadi but i wash my hand of hi do and as i have live so will i die true and loyal to the famili the famili of the rackrent is i am proud to say
