such intrus if frequent would have made me veri miser thi citi as i have alreadi observ carri on a great trade wirh the indian who barter furr for blanket osnaburgh shirt gun hatchet knive kettl powder and shot and mani other articl here the treati and other transact between us and the iroquoi indian are negoci and everi third year the governor of newyork come here to meet them and renew the allianc thi nation or rather combin of five nation unit by an ancient and inviol leagu among themselv are the oldest the most steadi and most effectu alli we have found among the indian by their unanim firm militari skill and polici they have rais themselv to be the most formid power in all america they have reduc a great number of other nation under their dominion and a territori twice as larg as the kingdom of franc the five nation of the iroquoi compos the most celebr commonwealth of indian in america the nation of america are at a great distanc from each other with a vast desert frontier and hid in the bosom of hideou and almost boundless forest the mohawk a tribe of the iroquoi who dwell nearest our settlement are convert to christian and consequ in some degre civil the govern pay a clergyman who offici in their chapel which wa built for them by queen ann who likewis present them with a fine set of alterpl and other decor for it there is a fort here call by the name of a former governor in which there is a small garrison command by a lieuten who may be reliev everi year but the present offic mr butler either becaus he is fond of command or the emolu aris from it petit to be continu in it and ha actual live there ten year the indian love him and have present him with land to a consider valu they have been equal gener to their spiritu pastor who is likewis a great favorit with them it is these mohawk who come amongst us so frequent at albani though convert to our faith they preserv most of their ancient custom religion seem to have but littl influenc upon their conduct and manner their virtu are their own their vice often copi from their enlighten alli the indian are tall their limb strait and well proport their bodi are strong but of a speci of strength it is said rather fit for much hardship than to continu long at ani servil work by which they are quickli consum their head are flatten by art their featur are regular but their counten fierc they have long black lank hair no beard their skin a reddish brown a color admir among them and improv by the constant use of bearsgreas and paint the whole fashion of their live is of a piec hardi poor and squalid and their educ from their infanc is sole direct to fit their bodi for thi mode of life and to form their mind to a capac of endur and inflict the greatest evil their onli occup are war and hunt agricultur is left to the women for merchandis they have the greatest contempt when their hunt season is past the fatigu of which they suffer with much patienc and in which they exert great ingenu they pass the rest of their time in an entir indol sleep half the day in their hut and observ no bound in eat drink they were not addict to have no spiritu liquor among them but sinc they have acquir thi tast it ha given a spur to their industri and enjoy to their repos thi is the princip end of all their treati with us and from thi they suffer inexpress calam for have onc begun to drink they observ no measur but continu a success of drunken as long as the mean of procur liquor last even the mohawk christian are guilti of thi excess and when intox are capabl of commit the greatest cruelti they are grave even to sad in their deport upon ani seriou occas observ of those in compani and respect to the old their temper cool and deliber never in hast to speak befor they have well consid the matter and are sure the person who spoke befor them ha finish all he had to say they express great contempt for the vivac of the european who interrupt each other and frequent speak all togeth the tone of their voic is soft and agreeabl that of the women i am told is wonder sweet and harmoni all i have told you of the indian and much more that i have yet to tell you you must not imagin is the result of my own observ for which i have had but few opportun yet but the substanc of some convers with a veri sensibl man whom mr nevil met with at the colonel and introduc to my acquaint he came to america mere to gratifi a curios which ha carri him over half the world i believ and is but late return from oswego a factori on the lake ontario which is at a great distanc from henc we have a fort there by which most of the indian pass in their way to montreal in thi wild region inhabit onli by savag did mr euston pass a whole year the offic who command the detach sent thither to reliev the small garrison be hi friend he accompani him in hi tediou march and came back with him when he also wa reliev in hi turn it seem to me surpris that a man form by natur and enabl by fortun to enjoy all the eleg of life could voluntari wast so great a part of hi time among a race of be in appear so truli wretch he smile at the compass mix with horror which i testifi for their condit and combat my notion in a manner so new and amus that i can not forbear give you a specimen of some of hi argument which he told me were all drawn from the celebr abb reynal it is in the natur of man say that sensibl and eleg writer pursu he that we must look for hi mean of happi what doe he want to be as happi as he can be present subsist and if he think of futur the hope and certainti of enjoy that bless the savag who ha not been driven into nor confin within the frigid zone by civil societi is not in want of thi first of necessari if he lay in no store it is becaus the earth and the sea are reservoir alway open to suppli hi want fish and game are to be had all the year and will suppli the want of fertil in the dead season the savag inde say the eleg writer whose word i quot ha no hous well secur from the access of extern air or commodi fireplac but hi furr answer all the purpos of the roof the garment and the stove he work but for hi own occas sleep when he is weari and is a stranger to watch and restless night war is a matter of choic to him danger like labor is a condit of hi natur not a profess annex to hi birth a nation duti not a domest servitud the savag is seriou but not melancholi hi counten seldom bear the impress of those passion and disord that leav such shock and fatal trait on our he can not seel the want of what he doe not desir nor can he desir what he is ignor of most of the convenl of life are remedi for evil he doe not feel he seldom experi ani of that weari that aris from unsatisfi desir or that empti and uneasi of mind that is the offspr of prejudic and vaniti in a word the savag is subject to none but natur evil my philosoph observ i listen to him with pleasur went on with hi quotat what greater happi than thi say the abb doe the civil man enjoy hi food is more wholesom and delic than that of the savag he ha softer cloth and a habit better secur against the inclem of the weather but should he live under a govern where tyranni must be endur under the name of author to what outrag is not the civil man expos if he is possess of ani properti he know not how far he may call it hi own when he must divid the produc between the courtier who may attack hi estat the lawyer who must be paid for teach him how to preserv it the soldier who may lay it wast and the collector who come to levi unlimit tax it must be confess thi pictur though a littl overcharg is not ill drawn mr nevil listen with great pleasur to thi gentleman account of the custom and manner of the american nation he is so fond of chang of scene and of vari hi mode of life that i should not be surpris to find him envi mr butler situat and solicit to have hi turn in that command in order to enjoy the new and untri pleasur of an abod on the lake ontario the ladi of the fort have had full employ for some week past in receiv the visit of all the dutch famili who have pretens to the honor of be receiv there their manner their dress their convers are so strang so uncouth so rude familiar that i am not surpris at the disgust they creat mr bellenden who is perfectli well bred and who rank polit i believ amongst the cardin virtu conceal with the utmost caution her dislik of these strang visit and the less they seem entitl to her delic attent she is the more assidu in practic them as if she hope to civil them by exampl meantim they stare and are confound when she address them and either do not answer at all or in a manner so rude and strang that she blush is confus and silent miss bellenden seldom speak but her look express a contempt of her compani which her mother often check by a signific glanc as for clara she continu to be extrem busi with her knot appar to prevent the ludicr idea that are excit in her mind from appear in her counten but the arch of her stolen glanc do not escap the notic of her mamma who seem extrem apprehens lest the young ladi should fail in ani articl of polit to her unpolish guest mr benson understand the dutch languag suffici to enabl her to keep up a littl convers with these ladi which is a great relief to mr bellenden and equal pleasur to them who although they can all speak english yet are veri shi in convers in that languag so that they discours chiefli with each other my rank not give me the privileg of be as slow in return their visit as mr bellenden mr benson and i have alreadi paid our respect to sever of the chief famili here we were entertain in a veri hospit manner which it seem is the custom of the place for immedi after the tea equipag wa remov a larg tabl wa brought out and cover with a damask tabl cloth exquisit white and fine upon thi tabl were place sever sort of cake and teabread with pat of the most delic butter plate of hungbeef and ham shave extrem fine wet and dri sweetmeat everi kind of fruit in season pistacchio and other nut all readi crack with an instrument for that purpos the liquor were cider mead and madeira wine all these thing were serv in the finest china and glass and if we did not eat heartili it wa not for want of exampl for our good host show as keen an appetit for thi their third meal sinc the morn as if they had not till then broke their fast our thin european regal of a dish of tea and a slice of cake must have appear veri parsimoni to person accustom to such plenti afternoon collat and i resolv when i wa visit next by my new friend i would endeavor to treat them in their own way but mr bellenden wa total against compli with thi custom not from an overattent to economi for she is hospit in the highest degre but becaus it seem a great offens to delicaci and against everi rule of decorum to turn a visit into a coars substanti meal thi ladi is inde not onli hospit but ha a tast for expens which in some measur defeat the purpos for which the colonel her husband left hi nativ countri at an age somewhat advanc to pass the remaind of hi day in america that he might save fortun for hi children the distinguish rank the colonel hold in thi provinc oblig him to observ certain form which inde includ a consider expens but which is made much more consider by the high notion mr bellenden entertain of what hi station requir of him on all public day it is usual for the mayor the aldermen and the princip inhabit of the citi to appear at the fort in their best dress to compliment the command on these occas not onli cake and wine are by mr bellenden order hand about in great plenti but there is alway a ball at night and an eleg supper for a select parti besid thi her tabl is open to all stranger of ani fashion who visit albani and there is now a greater resort than ever drawn by the beauti of the young ladi and the hospit and eleg manner of the command and hi ladi it is chiefli of such stranger that the assembl mr bellenden hold everi fortnight is compos for except the offic and their wive and two or three of the most polish person son in the place none of the inhabit are either qualifi or inde desir to assist at these entertain the colonel alway keep hi laudabl purpos in view would willingli draw hi expens within a narrow circl that is such as he think mere ostentati but whatev hi rank realli requir he willingli assent to and to the call of generos and benevol he attend with unrestrain liber one instanc i must give you my dear maria of thi worthi man human and great of soul soon after hi arriv here hi first lieuten who held the command dure hi absenc present him a list of men in hi own compani who be on account of their age and infirm judg wholli unfit for the easiest duti were order home to be receiv into chelsea hospit the colonel hear that some of these soldier were near an hundr year of age desir to see them particularli accordingli they were all present to him in the great hall where the ladi of the fort myself and some other compani were assembl to view them of thi vener group the youngest wa eightytwo year old sever were an hundr and one wa an hundr and ten here wa a strong proof of the good of the climat and it is said and experi ha prove it true that the european who come hither young gener live to a veri great age these old men look surprisingli healthi but they seem discont and even sad the colonel after convers with each of them a few moment at length observ the melancholi air of their counten and ask them the caus one of the oldest then came forward
