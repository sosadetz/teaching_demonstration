caus of the wealth of nation introduct and plan of the work the annual labor of everi nation is the fund which origin suppli it with all the necessari and conveni of life which it annual consum and which consist alway either in the immedi produc of that labor or in what is purchas with that produc from other nation accord therefor as thi produc or what is purchas with it bear a greater or smaller proport to the number of those who are to consum it the nation will be better or wors suppli with all the necessari and conveni for which it ha occas but thi proport must in everi nation be regul by two differ circumst first by the skill dexter and judgment with which labor is gener appli in it and secondli by the proport between the number of those who are employ in use labor and that of those who are not so employ whatev be the soil climat or extent of territori of ani particular nation the abund or scanti of it annual suppli must in that particular situat depend upon those two circumst the abund or scanti of thi suppli too seem to depend more upon the former of those two circumst than upon the latter among the savag nation of hunter and fisher everi individu who is abl to work is more or less employ in use labor and endeavor to provid as well as he can the necessari and conveni of life for himself and such of hi famili or tribe as are either too old or too young or too infirm to go a hunt and fish such nation howev are so miser poor that from mere want they are frequent reduc or at least think themselv reduc to the necess sometim of directli destroy and sometim of abandon their infant their old peopl and those afflict with linger diseas to perish with hunger or to be devour by wild beast among civil and thrive nation on the contrari though a great number of peopl do not labor at all mani of whom confum the produc of ten time frequent of a hundr time more labor than the greater part of those who work yet the produc of the whole labor of the societi is so great that all are often abundantli suppli and a workman even of the lowest and poorest order if he is frugal and industri may enjoy a greater share of the necessari and conveni of life than it is possibl for ani savag to acquir the caus of thi improv in the product power of labor and the order accord to which it produc is natur distribut among the differ rank and condit of men in the societi make the subject of the first book of thi inquiri whatev be the actual state of the skill dexter and judgment with which labor is appli in ani nation the abund or scanti of it annual suppli must depend dure the continu of that state upon the proport between the number of those who are annual employ in use labor and that of those who are not so employ the number of use and product labor it will hereaft appear is everi where in proport to the quantiti of capit stock which is employ in set them to work and to the particular way in which it is so employ the second book therefor treat of the natur of capit stock of the manner in which it is gradual accumul and of the differ quantiti of labor which it put into motion accord to the differ way in which it is employ nation toler well advanc as to skill dexter and judgment in the applic of labor have follow veri differ plan in the gener conduct or direct of it and those plan have not all been equal favor to the great of it produc the polici of some nation ha given extraordinari encourag to the industri of the countri that of other to the industri of town scarc ani nation ha dealt equal and imparti with everi sort of industri sinc the downfal of the roman empir the polici of europ ha been more favor to art manufactur and commerc the industri of town than to agricultur the industri of the countri the circumst which seem to have introduc and establish thi polici are explain in the third book though those differ plan were perhap first introduc by the privat interest and prejudic of particular order of men without ani regard to or foresight of their consequ upon the gener welfar of the societi yet they have given occas to veri differ theori of polit economi of which some magnifi the import of that industri which is carri on in town other of that which is carri on in the countri those theori have had a consider influenc not onli upon the opinion of men of learn but upon the public conduct of princ and sovereign state i have endeavor in the fourth book to explain as fulli and distinctli as i can those differ theori and the princip effect which they have produc in differ age and nation in what ha consist the revenu of the great bodi of the peopl or what is the natur of those fund which in differ age and nation have suppli their annual consumpt is treat of in these four first book the fifth and last book treat of the revenu of the sovereign or commonwealth in thi book i have endeavor to show first what are the necessari expens of the sovereign or commonwealth which of those expens ought to be defray by the gener contribut of the whole societi and which of them by that of some particular part onli or of some particular member of the societi secondli what are the differ method in which the whole societi may be made to contribut toward defray the expens incumb on the whole societi and what are the princip advantag and inconveni of each of those method and thirdli and lastli what are the reason and caus which have induc almost all modern govern to mortgag some part of thi revenu or to contract debt and what have been the effect of those debt upon the real wealth the annual produc of the land and labor of the societi book i of the caus of improv in the product power of labor and of the order accord to which it produc is natur distribut among the differ rank of the peopl chap i of the divis of labor the greatest improv in the product power of labor and the greater part of the skill dexter and judgment with which it is ani where direct or appli seem to have been the effect of the divis of labor the effect of the divis of labor in the gener busi of societi will be more easili understood by consid in what manner it oper in some particular manufactur it is commonli suppos to be carri furthest in some veri trifl one not perhap that it realli is carri further in them than in other of more import but in those trifl manufactur which are destin to suppli the small want of but a small number of peopl the whole number of workmen must necessarili be small and those employ in everi differ branch of the work can often be collect into the same workhous and place at onc under the view of the spectat in those great manufactur on the contrari which are destin to suppli the great want of the great bodi of the peopl everi differ branch of the work employ so great a number of workmen that it is imposs to collect them all into the same workhous we can seldom see more at one time than those employ in one singl branch though in them therefor the work may realli be divid into a much greater number of part than in those of a more trifl natur the divis is not near so obviou and ha accordingli been much less observ to take an exampl therefor from a veri trifl manufactur but one in which the divis of labor ha been veri often taken notic of the trade of the pinmak a workman not educ to thi busi which the divis of labor ha render a distinct trade nor acquaint with the use of the machineri employ in it to the invent of which the same divis of labor ha probabl given occas could scarc perhap with hi utmost industri make one pin in a day and certainli could not make twenti but in the way in which thi busi is now carri on not onli the whole work is a peculiar trade but it is divid into a number of branch of which the greater part are likewis peculiar trade one man draw out the wire anoth straight it a third cut it a fourth point it a fifth grind it at the top for receiv the head to make the head requir two or three distinct oper to put it on is a peculiar busi to whiten the pin is anoth it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper and the import busi of make a pin is in thi manner divid into about eighteen distinct oper which in some manufactori are all perform by distinct hand though in other the same man will sometim perform two or three of them i have seen a small manufactori of thi kind where ten men onli were employ and where some of them consequ perform two or three distinct oper but though they were veri poor and therefor but indiffer accommod with the necessari machineri they could when they exert themselv make among them about twelv pound of pin in a day there are in a pound upward of four thousand pin of a middl size those ten person therefor could make among them upward of fortyeight thousand pin in a day each person therefor make a tenth part of fortyeight thousand pin might be consid as make four thousand eight hundr pin in a day but if they had all wrought separ and independ and without ani of them have been educ to thi peculiar busi they certainli could not each of them have made twenti perhap not one pin in a day that is certainli not the two hundr and fortieth perhap not the four thousand eight hundredth part of what they are at present capabl of perform in consequ of a proper divis and combin of their differ oper in everi other art and manufactur the effect of the divis of labor are similar to what they are in thi veri trifl one though in mani of them the labor can neither be so much subdivid nor reduc to so great a simplic of oper the divis of labor howev so far as it can be introduc occas in everi art a proportion increas of the product power of labor the separ of differ trade and employ from one anoth seem to have taken place in consequ of thi advantag thi separ too is gener carri furthest in those countri which enjoy the highest degre of industri and improv what is the work of one man in a rude state of societi be gener that of sever in an improv one in everi improv societi the farmer is gener noth but a farmer the manufactur noth but a manufactur the labor too which is necessari to produc ani one complet manufactur is almost alway divid among a great number of hand how mani differ trade are employ in each branch of the linen and woollen manufactur from the grower of the flax and the wool to the bleacher and smoother of the linen or to the dyer and dresser of the cloth the natur of agricultur inde doe not admit of so mani subdivis of labor nor of so complet a separ of one busi from anoth as manufactur it is imposs to separ so entir the busi of the grazier from that of the cornfarm as the trade of the carpent is commonli separ from that of the smith the spinner is almost alway a distinct person from the weaver but the ploughman the harrow the sower of the seed and the reaper of the corn are often the same the occas for those differ sort of labor return with the differ season of the year it is imposs that one man should be constantli employ in ani one of them thi imposs of make so complet and entir a separ of all the differ branch of labor employ in agricultur is perhap the reason whi the improv of the product power of labor in thi art doe not alway keep pace with their improv in manufactur the most opul nation inde gener excel all their neighbor in agricultur as well as in manufactur but they are commonli more distinguish by their superior in the latter than in the former their land are in gener better cultiv and have more labor and expens bestow upon them produc more in proport to the extent and natur fertil of the ground but the superior of produc is seldom much more than in proport to the superior of labor and expens in agricultur the labor of the rich countri is not alway much more product than that of the poor or at least it is never so much more product as it commonli is in manufactur the corn of the rich countri therefor will not alway in the same degre of good come cheaper to market than that of the poor the corn of poland in the same degre of good is as cheap as that of franc notwithstand the superior opul and improv of the latter countri the corn of franc is in the corn provinc fulli as good and in most year nearli about the same price with the corn of england though in opul and improv franc is perhap inferior to england the land of england howev are better cultiv than those of franc and the land of franc are said to be much better cultiv than those of poland but though the poor countri notwithstand the inferior of it cultiv can in some measur rival the rich in the cheap and good of it corn it can pretend to no such competit in it manufactur at least if those manufactur suit the soil climat and situat of the rich countri the silk of franc are better and cheaper than those of england becaus the silk manufactur doe not suit the climat of england but the hardwar and the coars woollen of england are beyond all comparison superior to those of franc and much cheaper too in the same degre of good in poland there are said to be scarc ani manufactur of ani kind a few of those coarser household manufactur except without which no countri can well subsist thi great increas of the quantiti of work which the same number of peopl are capabl of perform in consequ of the divis of labor is owe to three differ circumst first to the increas of dexter in everi particular workman secondli to the save of the time which is commonli lost in pass from one speci of work to anoth and lastli to the invent of a great number of machin which facilit and abridg labor and enabl one man to do the work of mani first the improv of the dexter of the workman necessarili increas the quantiti of the work he can perform and the divis of labor by reduc everi man busi to some one simpl oper and by make thi oper the sole employ of hi life necessarili increas veri much the dexter of the workman a common smith who though accustom to handl the hammer ha never been use to make nail if upon some particular occas he is oblig to attempt it will scarc i am assur be abl to make abov two or three hundr nail in a day and those too veri bad one a smith who ha been accustom to make nail but whose sole or princip busi ha not been that of a nailer can seldom with hi utmost dilig make more than eight hundr or a thousand nail in a day i have seen sever boy under twenti year of age who had never exercis ani other trade but that of make nail and who when they exert themselv could make each of them upward of two thousand three hundr nail in a day the make of a nail howev is by no mean one of the simplest oper the same person blow the bellow stir or mend the fire as there is occas heat the iron and forg everi part of the nail in forg the head too he is oblig to chang hi tool the differ oper into which the make of a pin or of a metal button is subdivid are all of them much more simpl and the dexter of the person of whose life it ha been the sole busi to perform them is usual much greater the rapid with which some of the oper of those manufactur are perform exce what the human hand could by those who had never seen them be suppos capabl of acquir secondli the advantag which is gain by save the time commonli lost in pass from one sort of work to anoth is much greater than we should at first view be apt to imagin it it is imposs to pass veri quickli from one kind of work to anoth that is carri on in a differ place and with quit differ tool a countri weaver who cultiv a small farm must lose a good deal of time in pass from hi loom to the field and from the field to hi loom when the two trade can be carri on in the same workhous the loss of time is no doubt much less it is even in thi case howev veri consider a man commonli saunter a littl in turn hi hand from one sort of employ to anoth when he first begin the new work he is seldom veri keen and hearti hi mind as they say doe not go to it and for some time he rather trifl than appli to good purpos the habit of saunter and of indol careless applic which is natur or rather necessarili acquir by everi countri workman who is oblig to chang hi work and hi tool everi half hour and to appli hi hand in twenti differ way almost everi day of hi life render him almost alway sloth and lazi and incap of ani vigor applic even on the most press occas independ therefor of hi defici in point of dexter thi caus alon must alway reduc consider the quantiti of work which he is capabl of perform thirdli and lastli everi bodi must be sensibl how much labor is facilit and abridg by the applic of proper machineri it is unnecessari to give ani exampl i shall therefor onli observ that the invent of all those machin by which labor is so much facilit and abridg seem to have been origin owe to the divis of labor men are much more like to discov easier and readier method of attain ani object when the whole attent of their mind is direct toward that singl object than when it is dissip among a great varieti of thing but in consequ of the divis of labor the whole of everi man attent come natur to be direct toward some one veri simpl object it is natur to be expect therefor that some one or other of those who are employ in each particular branch of labor should soon find out easier and readier method of perform their own particular work wherev the natur of it admit of such improv a great part of the machin employ in those manufactur in which labor is most subdivid were origin the invent of common workmen who be each of them employ in some veri simpl oper natur turn their thought toward find out easier and readier method of perform it whoever ha been much accustom to visit such manufactur must frequent have been shown veri pretti machin which were the invent of common workmen in order to facilit and quicken their own particular part of the work in the first fireengin a boy wa constantli employ to open and shut altern the commun between the boiler and the cylind accord as the piston either ascend or descend one of those boy who love to play with hi companion observ that by tie a string from the handl of the valv which open thi commun to anoth part of the machin the valv would open and shut without hi assist and leav him at liberti to divert himself with hi playfellow one of the greatest improv that ha been made upon thi machin sinc it wa first invent wa in thi manner the discoveri of a boy who want to save hi own labor all the improv in machineri howev have by no mean been the invent of those who had occas to use the machin mani improv have been made by the ingenu of the maker of the machin when to make them becam the busi of a peculiar trade and some by that of those who are call philosoph or men of specul whose trade it is not to do ani thing but to observ everi thing and who upon that account are often capabl of combin togeth the power of the most distant and dissimilar object in the progress of societi philosophi or specul becom like everi other employ the princip or sole trade and occup of a particular class of citizen like everi other employ too it is subdivid into a great number of differ branch each of which afford occup to a peculiar tribe or class of philosoph and thi subdivis of employ in philosophi as well as in everi other busi improv dexter and save time each individu becom more expert in hi own peculiar branch more work is done upon the whole and the quantiti of scienc is consider increas by it it is the great multipl of the product of all the differ art in consequ of the divis of labor which occas in a well govern societi that univers opul which extend itself to the lowest rank of the peopl everi workman ha a great quantiti of hi own work to dispos of beyond what he himself ha occas for and everi other workman be exactli in the same situat he is enabl to exchang a great quantiti of hi own good for a great quantiti or what come to the same thing for the price of a great quantiti of their he suppli them abundantli with what they have occas for and they accommod him as ampli with what he ha occas for and a gener plenti diffus itself through all the differ rank of the societi observ the accommod of the most common artific or daylabour in a civil and thrive countri and you will perceiv that the number of peopl of whose industri a part though but a small part ha been employ in procur him thi accommod exce all comput the woollen coat for exampl which cover the daylabour as coars and rough as it may appear is the produc of the joint labor of a great multitud of workmen the shepherd the sorter of the wool the woolcomb or carder the dyer the scribbler the spinner the weaver the fuller the dresser with mani other must all join their differ art in order to complet even thi home product how mani merchant and carrier besid must have been employ in transport the materi from some of those workmen to other who often live in a veri distant part of the countri how much commerc and navig in particular how mani shipbuild sailor sailmak ropemak must have been employ in order to bring togeth the differ drug made use of by the dyer which often come from the remotest corner of the world what a varieti of labor too is necessari in order to produc the tool of the meanest of those workmen to say noth of such complic machin as the ship of the sailor the mill of the fuller or even the loom of the weaver let us consid onli what a varieti of labor is requisit in order to form that veri simpl machin the shear with which the shepherd clip the wool the miner the builder of the furnac for smelt the ore the feller of the timber the burner of the charcoal to be made use of in the smelt hous the brickmak the bricklay the workmen who attend the furnac the millwright the forger the smith must all of them join their differ art in order to produc them were we to examin in the same manner all the differ part of hi dress and household furnitur the coars linen shirt which he wear next hi skin the shoe which cover hi feet the bed which he lie on and all the differ part which compos it the kitchen grate at which he prepar hi victual the coal which he make use of for that purpos dug from the bowel of the earth and brought to him perhap by a long sea and a long land carriag all the other utensil of hi kitchen all the furnitur of hi tabl the knive and fork the earthen or pewter plate upon which he serv up and divid hi victual the differ hand employ in prepar hi bread and hi beer the glass window which let in the heat and the light and keep out the wind and the rain with all the knowledg and art requisit for prepar that beauti and happi invent without which these northern part of the world could scarc have afford a veri comfort habit togeth with the tool of all the differ workmen employ in produc those differ conveni if we examin i say all these thing and consid what a varieti of labor is employ about each of them we shall be sensibl that without the assist and cooper of mani thousand the veri meanest person in a civil countri could not be provid even accord to what we veri fals imagin the easi and simpl manner in which he is commonli accommod compar inde with the more extravag luxuri of the great hi accommod must no doubt appear extrem simpl and easi and yet it may be true perhap that the accommod of an european princ doe not alway so much exceed that of an industri and frugal peasant as the accommod of the latter exce that of mani an african king the absolut master of the live and liberti of ten thousand nake savag chap ii of the principl which give occas to the divis of labor thi divis of labor from which so mani advantag are deriv is not origin the effect of ani human wisdom which forese and intend that gener opul to which it give occas it is the necessari though veri slow and gradual consequ of a certain propens in human natur which ha in view no such extens util the propens to truck barter and exchang one thing for anoth whether thi propens be one of those origin principl in human natur of which no further account can be given or whether as seem more probabl it be the necessari consequ of the faculti of reason and speech it belong not to our present subject to enquir it is common to all men and to be found in no other race of anim which seem to know neither thi nor ani other speci of contract two greyhound in run down the same hare have sometim the appear of act in some sort of concert each turn her toward hi companion or endeavor to intercept her when hi companion turn her toward himself thi howev is not the effect of ani contract but of the accident concurr of their passion in the same object at that particular time nobodi ever saw a dog make a fair and deliber exchang of one bone for anoth with anoth dog nobodi ever saw one anim by it gestur and natur cri signifi to anoth thi is mine that your i am will to give thi for that when an anim want to obtain someth either of a man or of anoth anim it ha no other mean of persuas but to gain the favor of those whose servic it requir a puppi fawn upon it dam and a spaniel endeavor by a thousand attract to engag the attent of it master who is at dinner when it want to be fed by him man sometim use the same art with hi brethren and when he ha no other mean of engag them to act accord to hi inclin endeavor by everi servil and fawn attent to obtain their good will he ha not time howev to do thi upon everi occas in civil societi he stand at all time in need of the cooper and assist of great multitud while hi whole life is scarc suffici to gain the friendship of a few person in almost everi other race of anim each individu when it is grown up to matur is entir independ and in it natur state ha occas for the assist of no other live creatur but man ha almost constant occas for the help of hi brethren and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevol onli he will be more like to prevail if he can interest their selflov in hi favor and show them that it is for their own advantag to do for him what he requir of them whoever offer to anoth a bargain of ani kind propos to do thi give me that which i want and you shall have thi which you want is the mean of everi such offer and it is in thi manner that we obtain from one anoth the far greater part of those good offic which we stand in need of it is not from the benevol of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own interest we address ourselv not to their human but to their selflov and never talk to them of our own necess but of their advantag nobodi but a beggar choos to depend chiefli upon the benevol of hi fellow citizen even a beggar doe not depend upon it entir the chariti of well dispos peopl inde suppli him with the whole fund of hi subsist

other old cloth which suit him better or for lodg or for food or for money with which he can buy either food cloth or lodg as he ha occas as it is by treati by barter and by purchas that we obtain from one anoth the greater part of those mutual good offic which we stand in need of so it is thi same truck disposit which origin give occas to the divis of labor in a tribe of hunter or shepherd a particular person make bow and arrow for exampl with more readi and dexter than ani other he frequent exchang them for cattl or for venison with hi companion and he find at last that he can in thi manner get more cattl and venison than if he himself went to the field to catch them from a regard to hi own interest therefor the make of bow and arrow grow to be hi chief busi and he becom a sort of armour anoth excel in make the frame and cover of their littl hut or moveabl hous he is accustom to be of use in thi way to hi neighbor who reward him in the same manner with cattl and with venison till at last he find it hi interest to dedic himself entir to thi employ and to becom a sort of housecarpent in the same manner a third becom a smith or a brazier a fourth a tanner or dresser of hide or skin the princip part of the cloth of savag and thu the certainti of be abl to exchang all that surplu part of the produc of hi own labor which is over and abov hi own consumpt for such part of the produc of other men labor as he may have occas for encourag everi man to appli himself to a particular occup and to cultiv and bring to perfect whatev talent or geniu he may possess for that particular speci of busi the differ of natur talent in differ men is in realiti much less than we are awar of and the veri differ geniu which appear to distinguish men of differ profess when grown up to matur is not upon mani occas so much the caus as the effect of the divis of labor the differ between the most dissimilar charact between a philosoph and a common street porter for exampl seem to aris not so much from natur as from habit custom and educ when they came into the world and for the first six or eight year of their exist they were perhap veri much alik and neither their parent nor playfellow could perceiv ani remark differ about that age or soon after they come to be employ in veri differ occup the differ of talent come then to be taken notic of and widen by degre till at last the vaniti of the philosoph is will to acknowledg scarc ani resembl but without the disposit to truck barter and exchang everi man must have procur to himself everi necessari and conveni of life which he want all must have had the same duti to perform and the same work to do and there could have been no such differ of employ as could alon give occas to ani great differ of talent as it is thi disposit which form that differ of talent so remark among men of differ profess so it is thi same disposit which render that differ use mani tribe of anim acknowledg to be all of the same speci deriv from natur a much more remark distinct of geniu than what anteced to custom and educ appear to take place among men by natur a philosoph is not in geniu and disposit half so differ from a street porter as a mastiff is from a greyhound or a greyhound from a spaniel or thi last from a shepherd dog those differ tribe of anim howev though all of the same speci are of scarc ani use to one anoth the strength of the mastiff is not in the least support either by the swift of the greyhound or by the sagac of the spaniel or by the docil of the shepherd dog the effect of those differ genius and talent for want of the power or disposit to barter and exchang can not be brought into a common stock and do not in the least contribut to the better accommod and conveni of the speci each anim is still oblig to support and defend itself separ and independantli and deriv no sort of advantag from that varieti of talent with which natur ha distinguish it fellow among men on the contrari the most dissimilar genius are of use to one anoth the differ produc of their respect talent by the gener disposit to truck barter and exchang be brought as it were into a common stock where everi man may purchas whatev part of the produc of other men talent he ha occas for chap iii that the divis of labor is limit by the extent of the market as it is the power of exchang that give occas to the divis of labor so the extent of thi divis must alway be limit by the extent of that power or in other word by the extent of the market when the market is veri small no person can have ani encourag to dedic himself entir to one employ for want of the power to exchang all that surplu part of the produc of hi own labor which is over and abov hi own consumpt for such part of the produc of other men labor as he ha occas for there are some sort of industri even of the lowest kind which can be carri on no where but in a great town a porter for exampl can find employ and subsist in no other place a villag is by much too narrow a sphere for him even an ordinari market town is scarc larg enough to afford him constant occup in the lone hous and veri small villag which are scatter about in so desert a countri as the highland of scotland everi farmer must be butcher baker and brewer for hi own famili in such situat we can scarc expect to find even a smith a carpent or a mason within less than twenti mile of anoth of the same trade the scatter famili that live at eight or ten mile distanc from the nearest of them must learn to perform themselv a great number of littl piec of work for which in more popul countri they would call in the assist of those workmen countri workmen are almost everi where oblig to appli themselv to all the differ branch of industri that have so much affin to one anoth as to be employ about the same sort of materi a countri carpent deal in everi sort of work that is made of wood a countri smith in everi sort of work that is made of iron the former is not onli a carpent but a joiner a cabinetmak and even a carver in wood as well as a wheelwright a ploughwright a cart and wagon maker the employ of the latter are still more variou it is imposs there should be such a trade as even that of a nailer in the remot and inland part of the highland of scotland such a workman at the rate of a thousand nail a day and three hundr work day in the year will make three hundr thousand nail in the year but in such a situat it would be imposs to dispos of one thousand that is of one day work in the year as by mean of watercarriag a more extens market is open to everi sort of industri than what landcarriag alon can afford it so it is upon the sea coast and along the bank of navig river that industri of everi kind natur begin to subdivid and improv itself and it is frequent not till a long time after that those improv extend themselv to the inland part of the countri a broadwheel wagon attend by two men and drawn by eight hors in about six week time carri and bring back between london and edinburgh near four ton weight of good in about the same time a ship navig by six or eight men and sail between the port of london and leith frequent carri and bring back two hundr ton weight of good six or eight men therefor by the help of watercarriag can carri and bring back in the same time the same quantiti of good between london and edinburgh as fifti broadwheel wagon attend by a hundr men and drawn by four hundr hors upon two hundr ton of good therefor carri by the cheapest landcarriag from london to edinburgh there must be charg the mainten of a hundr men for three week and both the mainten and what is nearli equal to the mainten the wear and tear of four hundr hors as well as of fifti great wagon wherea upon the same quantiti of good carri by water there is to be charg onli the mainten of six or eight men and the wear and tear of a ship of two hundr ton burden togeth with the valu of the superior risk or the differ of the insur between land and watercarriag were there no other commun between those two place therefor but by landcarriag as no good could be transport from the one to the other except such whose price wa veri consider in proport to their weight they could carri on but a small part of that commerc which is at present carri on between them and consequ could give but a small part of that encourag which they at present mutual afford to each other industri there could be littl or no commerc of ani kind between the distant part of the world what good could bear the expens of landcarriag between london and calcutta or if there wa ani so preciou as to be abl to support thi expens with what safeti could they be transport through the territori of so mani barbar nation those two citi howev at present carri on togeth a veri consider commerc and by mutual afford a market give a good deal of encourag to each other industri sinc such therefor are the advantag of water carriag it is natur that the first improv of art and industri should be made where thi conveni open the whole world for a market to the produc of everi sort of labor and that they should alway be much later in extend themselv into the inland part of the countri the inland part of the countri can for a long time have no other market for the greater part of their good but the countri which lie round about them and separ them from the sea coast and the great navig river the extent of their market therefor must for a long time be in proport to the rich and popul of that countri and consequ their improv must alway be posterior to the improv of that countri in our north american coloni the plantat have constantli follow either the sea coast or the bank of the navig river and have scarc ani where extend themselv to ani consider distanc from both the nation that accord to the best authent histori appear to have been first civil were those that dwelt round the coast of the mediterranean sea that sea by far the greatest inlet that is known in the world have no tide nor consequ ani wave except such as are caus by the wind onli wa by the smooth of it surfac as well as by the multitud of it island and the proxim of it neighbor shore extrem favor to the infant navig of the world when from their ignor of the compass men were afraid to quit the view of the coast and from the imperfect of the art of shipbuild to abandon themselv to the boister wave of the ocean to pass beyond the pillar of hercul that is to sail out of the streight of gibraltar wa in the ancient world long consid as a most wonder and danger exploit of navig it wa late befor even the phenician and carthaginian the most skil navig and shipbuild of those old time attempt it and they were for a long time the onli nation that did attempt it of all the countri on the coast of the mediterranean sea egypt seem to have been the first in which either agricultur or manufactur were cultiv and improv to ani consider degre upper egypt extend itself no where abov a few mile from the nile and in lower egypt that great river break itself into mani differ canal which with the assist of a littl art soem to have afford a commun by water carriag not onli between all the great town but between all the consider villag and even to mani farm hous in the countri nearli in the same manner as the rhine and the maes do in holland at present the extent and easi of thi inland navig wa probabl one of the princip caus of the earli improv of egypt the improv in agricultur and manufactur seem likewis to have been of veri great antiqu in the provinc of bengal in the east indi and in some of the eastern provinc of china though the great extent of thi antiqu is not authent by ani histori of whose author we in thi part of the world are well assur in bengal the gang and sever other great river break themselv into mani canal in the same manner as the nile doe in egypt in the eastern provinc of china too sever great river form by their differ branch a multitud of canal and by commun with one anoth afford an inland navig much more extens than that either of the nile or the gang or perhap than both of them put togeth it is remark that neither the ancient egyptian nor the indian nor the chines encourag foreign commerc but seem all to have deriv their great opul from thi inland navig all the inland part of africa and all that part of asia which lie ani consider way north of the euxin and caspian sea the ancient scythia the modern tartari and siberia seem in all age of the world to have been in the same barbar and uncivil state in which we find them at present the sea of tartari is the frozen ocean which admit of no navig and though some of the greatest river in the world run through that countri they are at too great a distanc from one anoth to carri commerc and commun through the greater part of it there are in africa none of those great inlet such as the baltic and adriat sea in europ the mediterranean and euxin sea in both europ and asia and the gulph of arabia persia india bengal and siam in asia to carri maritim commerc into the interior part of that great contin and the great river of africa are at too great a distanc from one anoth to give occas to ani consider inland navig the commerc besid which ani nation can carri on by mean of a river which doe not break itself into ani great number of branch or canal and which run into anoth territori befor it reach the sea can never be veri consider becaus it is alway in the power of the nation who possess that other territori to obstruct the commun between the upper countri and the sea the navig of the danub is of veri littl use to the differ state of bavaria austria and hungari in comparison of what it would be if ani one of them possess the whole of it cours till it fall into the black sea chap iv of the origin and use of money when the divis of labor ha been onc thoroughli establish it is but a veri small part of a man want which the produc of hi own labor can suppli he suppli the far greater part of them by exchang that surplu part of the produc of hi own labor which is over and abov hi own consumpt for such part of the produc of other men labor as he ha occas for everi man thu live by exchang or becom in some measur a merchant and the societi itself grow to be what is properli a commerci societi but when the divis of labor first began to take place thi power of exchang must frequent have been veri much clog and embarrass in it oper one man we shall suppos ha more of a certain commod than he himself ha occas for while anoth ha less the former consequ would be glad to dispos of and the latter to purchas a part of thi superflu but if thi latter should chanc to have noth that the former stand in need of no exchang can be made between them the butcher ha more meat in hi shop than he himself can consum and the brewer and the baker would each of them be will to purchas a part of it but they have noth to offer in exchang except the differ product of their respect trade and the butcher is alreadi provid with all the bread and beer which he ha immedi occas for no exchang can in thi case be made between them he can not be their merchant nor they hi custom and they are all of them thu mutual less servic to one anoth in order to avoid the inconveni of such situat everi prudent man in everi period of societi after the first establish of the divis of labor must natur have endeavor to manag hi affair in such a manner as to have at all time by him besid the peculiar produc of hi own industri a certain quantiti of some one commod or other such as he imagin few peopl would be like to refus in exchang for the produc of their industri mani differ commod it is probabl were success both thought of and employ for thi purpos in the rude age of societi cattl are said to have been the common instrument of commerc and though they must have been a most inconveni one yet in old time we find thing were frequent valu accord to the number of cattl which had been given in exchang for them the armor of diom say homer cost onli nine oxen but that of glaucu cost a hundr oxen salt is said to be the common instrument of commerc and exchang in abyssmia a speci of shell in some part of the coast of india dri cod at newfoundland tobacco in virginia sugar in some of our west india coloni hide or dress leather in some other countri and there is at thi day a villag in scotland where it is not uncommon i am told for a workman to carri nail instead of money to the baker shop or the alehous in all countri howev men seem at last to have been determin by irresist reason to give the prefer for thi employ to metal abov everi other commod metal can not onli be kept with as littl loss as ani other commod scarc ani thing be less perish than they are but they can likewis without ani loss be divid into ani number of part as by fusion those part can easili be reunit again a qualiti which no other equal durabl commod possess and which more than ani other qualiti render them fit to be the instrument of commerc and circul the man who want to buy salt for exampl and had noth but cattl to give in exchang for it must have been oblig to buy salt to the valu of a whole ox or a whole sheep at a time he could seldom buy less than thi becaus what he wa to give for it could seldom be divid without loss and if he had a mind to buy more he must for the same reason have been oblig to buy doubl or tripl the quantiti the valu to wit of two or three oxen or of two or three sheep if on the contrari instead of sheep or oxen he had metal to give in exchang for it he could easili proport the quantiti of the metal to the precis quantiti of the commod which he had immedi occas for differ metal have been made use of by differ nation for thi purpos iron wa the common instrument of commerc among the ancient spartan copper among the ancient roman and gold and silver among all rich and commerci nation those metal seem origin to have been made use of for thi purpos in rude bar without ani stamp or coinag thu we are told by plini upon the author of one remeu an ancient author that till the time of serviu tulliu the roman had no coin money but made use of unstamp bar of copper to purchas whatev they had occas for these rude bar therefor perform at thi time the function of money the use of metal in thi rude state wa attend with two veri consider inconveni first with the troubl of weigh them and secondli with the troubl of assay them in the preciou metal where a small differ in the quantiti make a great differ in the valu even the busi of weigh with proper exact requir at least veri accur weight and scale the weigh of gold in particular is an oper of some niceti in the coarser metal inde where a small error would be of littl consequ less accuraci would no doubt be necessari yet we should find it excess troublesom if everi time a poor man had occas either to buy or sell a farth worth of good he wa oblig to weigh the farth the oper of assay is still more difficult still more tediou and unless a part of the metal is fairli melt in the crucibl with proper dissolv ani conclus that can be drawn from it is extrem uncertain befor the institut of coin money howev unless they went through thi tediou and difficult oper peopl must alway have been liabl to the grossest fraud and imposit and instead of a pound weight of pure silver or pure copper might receiv in exchang for their good an adulter composit of the coarsest and cheapest materi which had howev in their outward appear been made to resembl those metal to prevent such abus to facilit exchang and therebi to encourag all sort of industri and commerc it ha been found necessari in all countri that have made ani consider advanc toward improv to affix a public stamp upon certain quantiti of such particular metal as were in those countri commonli made use of to purchas good henc the origin of coin money and of those public offic call mint institut exactli of the same natur with those of the aulnag and stampmast of woollen and linen cloth all of them are equal meant to ascertain by mean of a public stamp the quantiti and uniform good of those differ commod when brought to market the first public stamp of thi kind that were affix to the current metal seem in mani case to have been intend to ascertain what it wa both most difficult and most import to ascertain the good or fine of the metal and to have resembl the sterl mark which is at present affix to plate and bar of silver or the spanish mark which is sometim affix to ingot of gold and which be struck onli upon one side of the piec and not cover the whole surfac ascertain the fine but not the weight of the metal abraham weigh to ephron the four hundr shekel of silver which he had agre to pay for the field of machpelah they are said howev to be the current money of the merchant and yet are receiv by weight and not by tale in the same manner as ingot of gold and bar of silver are at present the revenu of the ancient saxon king of england are said to have been paid not in money but in kind that is in victual and provis of all sort william the conqueror introduc the custom of pay them in money thi money howev wa for a long time receiv at the exchequ by weight and not by tale the inconveni and difficulti of weigh those metal with exact gave occas to the institut of coin of which the stamp cover entir both side of the piec and sometim the edg too wa suppos to ascertain not onli the fine but the weight of the metal such coin therefor were receiv by tale as at present without the troubl of weigh the denomin of those coin seem origin to have express the weight or quantiti of metal contain in them in the time of serviu tulliu who first coin money at rome the roman as or pondo contain a roman pound of good copper it wa divid in the same manner as our troy pound into twelv ounc each of which contain a real ounc of good copper the english pound sterl in the time of edward i contain a pound tower weight of silver of a known fine the tower pound seem to have been someth more than the roman pound and someth less than the troy pound thi last wa not introduc into the mint of england till the th of henri viii the french livr contain in the time of charlemagn a pound troy weight of silver of a known fine the fair of troy in champaign wa at that time frequent by all the nation of europ and the weight and measur of so famou a market were gener known and esteem the scot money pound contain from the time of alexand the first to that of robert bruce a pound of silver of the same weight and fine with the english pound sterl english french and scot penni too contain all of them origin a real pennyweight of silver the twentieth part of an ounc and the two hundr and fortieth part of a pound the shill too seem origin to have been the denomin of a weight when wheat is at twelv shill the quarter say an ancient statut of henri iii then wastel bread of a farth shall weigh eleven shill and four penc the proport howev between the shill and either the penni on the one hand or the pound on the other seem not to have been so constant and uniform as that between the penni and the pound dure the first race of the king of franc the french sou or shill appear upon differ occas to have contain five twelv twenti forti and fortyeight penni among the ancient saxon a shill appear at one time to have contain onli five penni and it is not improb that it may have been as variabl among them as among their neighbor the ancient frank from the time of charlemagn among the french and from that of william the conqueror among the english the proport between the pound the shill and the penni seem to have been uniformli the same as at present though the valu of each ha been veri differ for in everi countri of the world i believ the avaric and injustic of princ and sovereign state abus the confid of their subject have by degre diminish the real quantiti of metal which had been origin contain in their coin the roman as in the latter age of the republ wa reduc to the twenti fourth part of it origin valu and instead of weigh a pound came to weigh onli half an ounc the english pound and penni contain at present about a third onli the scot pound and penni about a thirtysixth and the french pound and penni about a sixtysixth part of their origin valu by mean of those oper the princ and sovereign state which perform them were enabl in appear to pay their debt and to fulfil their engag with a smaller quantiti of silver than would otherwis have been requisit it wa inde in appear onli for their creditor were realli defraud of a part of what wa due to them all other debtor in the state were allow the same privileg and might pay with the same nomin sum of the new and debas coin whatev they had borrow in the old such oper therefor have alway prove favor to the debtor and ruinou to the creditor and have sometim produc a greater and more univers revolut in the fortun of privat person than could have been occas by a veri great public calam it is in thi manner that money ha becom in all civil nation the univers instrument of commerc by the intervent of which good of all kind are bought and sold or exchang for one anoth what are the rule which men natur observ in exchang them either for money or for one anoth i shall now proceed to examin these rule determin what may be call the rel or exchang valu of good the word valu it is to be observ ha two differ mean and sometim express the util of some particular object and sometim the power of purchas other good which the possess of that object convey the one may be call valu in use the other valu in exchang the thing which have the greatest valu in use have frequent littl or no valu in exchang and on the contrari those which have the greatest valu in exchang have frequent littl or no valu in use noth is more use than water but it will purchas scarc ani thing scarc ani thing can be had in exchang for it a diamond on the contrari ha scarc ani valu in use but a veri great quantiti of other good may frequent be had in exchang for it in order to investig the principl which regul the exchang valu of commod i shall endeavor to show first what is the real measur of thi exchang valu or wherein consist the real price of all commod secondli what are the differ part of which thi real price is compos or made up and lastli what are the differ circumst which sometim rais some or all of these differ part of price abov and sometim sink them below their natur or ordinari rate or what are the caus which sometim hinder the market price that is the actual price of commod from coincid exactli with what may be call their natur price i shall endeavor to explain as fulli and distinctli as i can those three subject in the three follow chapter for which i must veri earnestli entreat both the patienc and attent of the reader hi patienc in order to examin a detail which may perhap in some place appear unnecessarili tediou and hi attent in order to understand what may perhap after the fullest explic which i am capabl of give of it appear still in some degre obscur i am alway will to run some hazard of be tediou in order to be sure that i am perspicu and after take the utmost pain that i can to be perspicu some obscur may still appear to remain upon a subject which is in it own natur extrem abstract chap v of the real and nomin price of commod or of their price in labor and their price in money everi man is rich or poor accord to the degre in which he can afford to enjoy the necessari conveni and amus of human life but after the divis of labor ha onc thoroughli taken place it is but a veri small part of these with which a man own labor can suppli him the far greater part of them he must deriv from the labor of other peopl and he must be rich or poor accord to the quantiti of that labor which he can command or which he can afford to purchas the valu of ani commod therefor to the person who possess it and who mean not to use or consum it himself but to exchang it for other commod is equal to the quantiti of labor which it enabl him to purchas or command labor therefor is the real measur of the exchang valu of all commod the real price of everi thing what everi thing realli cost to the man who want to acquir it is the toil and troubl of acquir it what everi thing is realli worth to the man who ha acquir it and who want to dispos of it or exchang it for someth els is the toil and troubl which it can save to himself and which it can impos upon other peopl what is bought with money or with good is purchas by labor as much as what we acquir by the toil of our own bodi that money or those good inde save us thi toil they contain the valu of a certain quantiti of labor which we exchang for what is suppos at the time to contain the valu of an equal quantiti labor wa the first price the origin purchas money that wa paid for all thing it wa not by gold or by silver but by labor that all the wealth of the world wa origin purchas and it valu to those who possess it and who want to exchang it for some new product is precis equal to the quantiti of labor which it can enabl them to purchas or command but though labor be the real measur of the exchang valu of all commod it is not that by which their valu is commonli estim it is often difficult to ascertain the proport between two differ quantiti of labor the time spent in two differ sort of work will not alway alon determin thi proport the differ degre of hardship endur and of ingenu exercis must likewis be taken into account there may be more labor in an hour hard work than in two hour easi busi or in an hour applic to a trade which it cost ten year labor to learn than in a month industri at an ordinari and obviou employ but it is not easi to find ani accur measur either of hardship or ingenu in exchang inde the differ product of differ sort of labor for one anoth some allow is commonli made for both it is adjust howev not by ani accur measur but by the higgl and bargain of the market accord to that sort of rough equal which though not exact is suffici for carri on the busi of common life everi commod besid is more frequent exchang for and therebi compar with other commod than with labor it is more natur therefor to estim it exchang valu by the quantiti of some other commod than by that of the labor which it can purchas the greater part of peopl too understand better what is meant by a quantiti of a particular commod than by a quantiti of labor the one is a plain palpabl object the other an abstract notion which though it can be made suffici intellig is not altogeth so natur and obviou but when barter ceas and money ha becom the common instrument of commerc everi particular commod is more frequent exchang for money than for ani other commod the butcher seldom carri hi beef or hi mutton to the baker or the brewer in order to exchang them for bread or for beer but he carri them to the market where he exchang them for money and afterward exchang that money for bread and for beer the quantiti of money which he get for them regul too the quantiti of bread and beer which he can afterward purchas it is more natur and obviou to him therefor to estim their valu by the quantiti of money the commod for which he immedi exchang them than by that of bread and beer the commod for which he can exchang them onli by the intervent of anoth commod and rather to say that hi butcher meat is worth threepenc or fourpenc a pound than that it is worth three or four pound of bread or three or four quart of small beer henc it come to pass that the exchang valu of everi commod is more frequent estim by the quantiti of money than by the quantiti either of labor or of ani other commod which can be had in exchang for it gold and silver howev like everi other commod vari in their valu are sometim cheaper and sometim dearer sometim of easier and sometim of more difficult purchas the quantiti of labor which ani particular quantiti of them can purchas or command or the quantiti of other good which it will exchang for depend alway upon the fertil or barren of the mine which happen to be known about the time when such exchang are made the discoveri of the abund mine of america reduc in the sixteenth centuri the valu of gold and silver in europ to about a third of what it had been befor as it cost less labor to bring those metal from the mine to the market so when they were brought there they could purchas or command less labor and thi revolut in their valu though perhap the greatest is by no mean the onli one of which histori give some account but as a measur of quantiti such as the natur foot fathom or hand which is continu vari in it own quantiti can never be an accur measur of the quantiti of other thing so a commod which is itself continu vari in it own valu can never be an accur measur of the valu of other commod equal quantiti of labor must at all time and place be of equal valu to the labour he must alway lay down the same portion of hi eas hi liberti and hi happi the price which he pay must alway be the same whatev may be the quantiti of good which he receiv in return for it of these inde it may sometim purchas a greater and sometim a smaller quantiti but it is their valu which vari not that of the labor which purchas them at all time and place that is dear which it is difficult to come at or which it cost much labor to acquir and that cheap which is to be had easili or with veri littl labor labor alon therefor never vari in it own valu is alon the ultim
