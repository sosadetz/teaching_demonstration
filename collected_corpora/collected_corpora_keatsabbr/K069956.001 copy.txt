these threw over it a kind of popular and chivalr splendor that dazzl while it warm no less dare and heroic john wa more method more correct more deliber and he often retain hi skill of no less import in contest than ardour even when hi antagonist had lost all scienc in a storm of the passion their person howev were uniformli in keep with their disposit they were both the favorit of natur yet even

of a moment their persever in case of doubt or difficulti wa so determin that neither the most harden guilt nor the most consciou innoc could endur their scrutini on the contrari henri appear to compass everi thing by a glanc and the object under their ray frequent suffer as much from the intoler bright of their flash which wa sudden and impetu as from the more slow and immitig look of hi brother the separ mark also extend to languag accent and effect love and piti breath in the voic of henri in compass he wept himself and other wept with him nor did mirth even bestow on him a smile or

light easi and full of fire and sometim anticip sentiment more weighti and profound these were set off by an ingenu feel of diffid which now paint hi cheek with the bloom of the rose and now with more

such author express so firm and sens so unobstruct perhap he deem it unnecessari to court the attent he knew he could command the live volum of natur even from hi earliest youth had been hi princip studi and the knowledg which is thenc deriv to the mind wa alon thought worthi of hi contempl wherea henri wa impati of toil and seem to mount on the pinion of the eagl to escap from everi task impos john rare condescend to trifl while henri had the happi art of render everi trifl interest whatsoev he touch though dull and drossi befor acquir by the alchemi of geniu some shine qualiti with regard to the second brother although hi share in that part of the famili transact design to form the follow histori wa onli occasion he wa in some import instanc so interwoven with hi rel that a neglect of

between both hi eye vari in color as in express from those alreadi describ they had not the search power of john nor the brillianc of henri but were a pair of gray full set use honest optic not destitut of mean hi complexion wa neither so fair as henri nor so dark as john and hi disposit wa a just and not seldom a necessari equipois between the excess of henri natur sensibl and john artifici govern of himself natur had form hi mind as she had model hi person in the middl way between the fratern extrem a mediocr which howev humbl had it use in the famili sometim check the impetu effus of henri sometim attemp the saturnin habit of john in short a veri proper middl man to be place between two such extrem yet the wide divers of life could scarc furnish a circumst in which their mode of conduct were similar even when their motiv were the same their characterist began to show themselv in the most earli and continu to the latest period from the former we will select an almost infantin occurr becaus it ascertain their indel point the soft excess of henri the moder of jame and the energi of john in the cold season a poor blackbird had taken shelter in sir armin greenhous anim by the genial heat it wa bask upon an orangetre and warm out of the cold remembr of time and place stretch out it wing in a kind of summer languor over the branch and had begun to pour a seminot of gratitud and joy henri hastili yet on tipto ran round to shut the window at which it had enter first close the door i have wish for a blackbird i know not how long whisper he and it will be quit a chariti to give that poor fellow good winter quarter in the castl i own it is almost a piti to disturb him now he seem so comfort but if he knew how veri kindli i would use him he would come a volunt into my chamber veri kind to be sure said john to make him a slave for life to my thought he had better choos hi own lodg though the best to be had were in a barn or in a hollow tree and get an independ warm here in the hothous when he find an opportun than be a prison in the best room of the castl nay in the king palac so be advis brother and let him alon john softli open part of the window nearest the bird no i will tell you how it shall be observ littl jame give the bird fair play leav the window open and let harri tri hi fortun if the bird suffer himself to be caught when the path of freedom is befor hi eye whi it will be hi own affair you know but the act of catch him at all is arbitrari said john sturdili throw hi hat at the orang and other exot plant that grew in the direct of the tree where the blackbird had been perch not at all brother cri henri when it is onli to convey him to a better place run as he spoke after the object of hi wish almost with the swift of it own wing john kept alway behind in the hope of point it flight to the window and jame stood imparti in the middl unless he step on one side or the other to maintain fair deal the blackbird mean time alarm by all parti flew irregularli from shrub to shrub from window to window sometim beat it breast against one object sometim strike it wing or beak against anoth often be in the veri path of liberti and as often driven out of it at length it sank exhaust to the ground and wa taken up almost without an effort to flutter by henri whose littl heart palpit like it own hi ardent eye quick breath lip and high color cheek spoke hi triumph yet amidst hi exult he forgot not merci the fairest laurel of the conqueror is human and the veri instinct of henri were human he smooth the ruffl plume of hi captiv pour over it everi assur of protect press it glossi pinion on hi cheek detain it with a soft trembl hand and at length put it lightli held into hi bosom ran with it to hi chamber he ha fairli won the bird brother said jame follow certainli repli john with a dissatisfi tone noth can be fairer than to run down a poor terrifi littl wretch who ha no power to resist then seiz and drag it to prison it struggl for freedom till it wa almost gasp for breath and i am asham that i suffer ani thing to prevent my take part with the unprotect in the caus of liberti but thi i suppos you and my brother would call foul play just as you have style hi theft a kind ye the kind of a christian robber who steal the innoc savag from hi nativ land and cover him with chain dread the loss of hi treasur henri guard it with a miser care kept it conceal in hi own room but treat it with the utmost indulg be at onc it nurs and companion and suffer no hand but hi own to feed it ala it droop said it protector bring it down one day into an apart where hi brother were sit what can be done for it jame question he with tear in hi eye let it go interpos john it pine for the friend from whose societi it ha been ravish it languish for freedom let it go and it will soon recov perhap answer jame it onli want more air your chamber may be too confin suppos then continu he will to compromis betwixt liberti and slaveri you were to tie a silken string round it leg and lead it now and then about the garden i propos an improv on that idea said john clip one of it wing and as you persist in refus it it right to fli in the air let it have the run of the garden that on the south side of the castl you know is wall round and it can not walk off he reconcil henri to thi measur by tell him that it would produc mani good end besid restor the blackbird health and give it a relish of it former enjoy amongst other thing he assur him that it would recov it spirit which would enabl it to whistl back it lost friend and relat henri could not resist thi the idea of give joy to other wa a joy to hi own heart the action by which it wa bestow could alon surpass it in effect the bird wa all the better for it liberti it hop peck twitter and daili appear to gain new visitor there wa in the wall garden a shed where it nestl toward even but henri with soft step would take care while it repos to strew food on the ground below so that it alway found breakfast readi in the morn nor wa dinner or supper provis forgotten so that what it pick up in the garden wa mere amus to relish exercis the kindheart henri wa perfectli satisfi with thi plan john wa onli half satisfi jame prudent suggest give the grow wing anoth cut henri agre for hi favorit could now take half the garden at a low flight though not top the wall wait a littl longer said john he is so tame and so well pleas with hi present usag that perhap he will inde be a volunt amongst us and there will be a thousand time the gratif in have hi societi with hi own consent but if he should leav me said henri have confid in him think how delight it is to have friendship as a free will offer i should hate ani thing i forc to stay with me as much as it could hate me can a jail bird love the jailor i have a good mind to trust it observ henri but i sometim think it look up at the wall veri sli that is noth but a way they have with them said john laugh what is your opinion jame question henri there can be i should think but one opinion about that repli jame take out a littl pair of scissar o he alway wa for cut out just like a girl but act a more liber part my brother said john henri wa overrul the feather grew and the blackbird flew away henri accus john defend jame mediat the grate bird howev staid in the neighborhood sang better look happier henri wa therefor reconcil to hi loss and john wa at length content he wa inde nearer the age of mingl reflect with sensat be six year older than jame who wa henri senior onli by eighteen month but these trait of childhood remain fix as life advanc john determin to invest reason with the honor of that sovereignti which the moralist have assign her and which can bear no rival near her throne the passion said he should be treat as good or disloy subject the first with indulg the last with rigor so will i govern them jame wa nearli of the same way of think except that he wa dispos to a more equal distribut both of punish and reward but henri gener felt more than he reason yet of the majesti and prerog of the ration power he had idea even more sublim than either of hi brother but a more ardent tempera and a fanci more vivid made it more difficult to keep the passion within the line of their privileg my dear harri quoth john you do not think enough my dear john i suppos my think time is not yet come but it appear to me at present that if you would not suffer your thought to be such spi upon your feel you would be sometim a much happier boy repli henri much often the revers i believ resum john but should i be wiser and better for my part observ jame who wa stand between them and take a hand of each if we could alway be as near one anoth as we are now we should get on brave chapter iii such were the son of sir armin and ladi fitzorton and when these young men might be suppos to have gain some acquaint with themselv and with that would most contribut to their happi their father conven them to meet in that apart of the castl which had alway been sacr to piou medit or parent counsel the brother be assembl he address them thu dear veri dear object of my equal affect you have now had time to cultiv that self knowledg which may assift you in choos the path in which ye may go with the most honor to yourselv and profit to other a life of idl is useless at best and of what it is at worst i would not wish to give your pure mind ani idea select then some object which may keep in virtuou and wholesom occup your mind and bodi i am awar that thi import matter ha been defer beyond the usual date at which it becom a subject of arrang betwixt parent and their children but i think it is gener brought into discuss too earli how can a just notion of human conduct be acquir befor the human charact is in some measur form and until natur ha had uncontrol opportun to point out her bia i desir to make silent observ on that bia as public or privat occurr call it forth that when it becam a decid and import question if i thought of your choic less favor than you did i might offer such reason as would satisfi your mind that my object were ground not on patern tyranni but fatherli love perhap i am by thi delay compet to answer my own question even as you would answer it there can be littl doubt i think that you my eldest hope and bless will decid for the senatori charact which is highli favor to your argument power and no way inconsist with the profound research of a philosoph mind your wish jame i can see will take an activ part in the administr of public justic and you may in due time unit the senat with the legisl there is an equanim and pois in your disposit which in both these high offic is of the last import and my henri elect will probabl be that of hi happi father becaus without ani in fringement of the pastor which i am convinc will be consid as the primari duti he may cultiv the muse and she is not more the adorn of social life than the handmaid of religion when under the direct of that awe power tell me then dearest honor of my life if in these conjectur i have anticip your wish john and jame repli in the affirm henri stifl a sigh in a cough but hi assent wa includ noth then remain but to gratifi them continu the vener man hi voic attun and hi look soften to hi express and may ye in all good thing be thu unanim your elect made you will with gener puriti of life connect and improv the particular qualif which are requisit and it will be my delight care to give them effect but there is anoth topic i mean that of your patrimoni fortun in the distribut of thi i should by some parent be thought as much to oppos the opinion and practic of the world as in have consult you on the choic of life i mean with respect to date of consult and of distribut yet noth can be more certain than that one principl govern me in both for as i think young peopl are call upon to fix their profess much too earli i am of opinion likewis that the knowledg and adjust of their inherit exclus of what may be deriv from such profess come to them too late when youth are realli capabl of select the grand object of their futur pursuit as member of the commun the degre of judgment which render them compet to thi fit them to be trust with the secret of their inherit unless inde filial profligaci ha made patern confid imprud but in my blef case where the unsulli blossom give promis of the fairest fruit in due feason and ha grown into no wanton luxuri by the warmest influenc of parent sun you see my henri i like you consid poetic imageri sometim an auxiliari to the display of truth i can have noth to fear ah no from divid amongst you my littl store in possess and preacquaint you with those in expect i have everi thing to hope the young men took their eye from their father and look at each other it might perhap be good polici in parent to make their children not onli wish the extens of their live on motiv of natur affect but on those of worldli interest and it seem to me there is noth tend so much to i will not say forget of the parent tie for that is a most tremend extrem but to seduc the heart most sacr comfort human speak to an act of mere duti as a sordid attent to what may be gain by a parent death it may forc the best children to grow indiffer about the life of him who gave life to them and it undoubtedli make children of less happi disposit much wors for as kind beget affect there can be littl doubt that rigor if it can not extinguish the sentiment of natur affect impair it pleasur and obstruct it energi that it may still be the heartfelt wish of my dear boy that their fond father age as he is should yet live to see their happi i will tomorrow present a statement of our mutual properti i say mutual becaus i have invari consid it as held onli in trust for them and their belov mother and though there have been some entangl i hope to prove i have been a faith famili steward and inde my children that is the onli charact in which it should be a father ambit to appear for one of you continu he look at henri will i trust ascend the summit of fortun but equal in the affect of my natur your patrimoni right are
