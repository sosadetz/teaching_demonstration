selfinterest motiv at bottom when i hear such a piec of work made about sentiment and so mani profess of disinterest friendship i think besid sinc matter were so far advanc that mr hindon and myself might have been sooner made acquaint with a love affair that wa go on under our own roof i plead fanni diffid as an apolog but my excus wa in fact extrem lame and wa not easili admit mr hindon could with difficulti prevail on herself to pardon the disrespect but thi stori had gone in all point so contrari to her plan and wish that i could forgiv a littl ill humor occas by chagrin and found it not

wa like so littl to redound to the honor of hi famili and expect everi moment when the subject should be introduc but most care did he guard against everi topic that could lead to thi point which he evid avoid with the most sedul precaut yet hi manner possess that insinu attent and hi voic that win soft which seem to impli the utmost satisfact in my compani and which bestow on hi a charm that may be felt sophia ala too acut but which can not be delin the interest eleg of hi address is inde so uncommonli engag that i think it must be wholli imposs even for a stranger to behold him enter without pleasur or see him depart without experienc regret it is not alon that he is perfectli well bred and intellig for from moder part polish by educ and knowledg of the world thi may be expect and uncharacterist of the english nation as the refin of good breed is suppos to be i have seen sinc my resid here more than one person to whom i think that panegyr is justli due but mr roatsley mind
