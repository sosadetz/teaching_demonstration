around the trunk for the rest but noth more remain of hi godfath last gift except powder glass which clung to the deepest layer of debri like glitter grit harri sat up and examin the jag piec on which he had cut himself see noth but hi own bright green eye reflect back at him then he place the fragment on top of that morn daili prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempt to stem the sudden upsurg of bitter memori the stab of regret and of long the discoveri of the broken mirror had occas by attack the rest of the rubbish in the trunk it took anoth hour to empti it complet throw away the useless item and sort the remaind in pile accord to whether or not he would need them from now on hi school and quidditch robe cauldron parchment quill and most of hi textbook were pile in a corner to be left behind he wonder what hi aunt and uncl would do with them burn them in the dead of night probabl as if they were evid of some dread crime hi muggl cloth invis cloak potionmak kit certain book the photograph album hagrid had onc given him a stack of letter and hi wand had been repack into an old rucksack in a front pocket were the maraud map and the locket with the note sign rab insid it the locket wa accord thi place of honor not becaus it wa valuabl in all usual sens it wa worthless but becaus of what it had cost to attain it thi left a sizabl stack of newspap sit on hi desk besid hi snowi owl hedwig one for each of the day harri had spent at privet drive thi summer he got up off the floor stretch and move across to hi desk hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through newspap throw them into the rubbish pile one by one the owl wa asleep or els fake she wa angri with harri about the limit amount of time she wa allow out of her cage at the moment as he near the bottom of the pile of newspap harri slow down search for one particular issu that he knew had arriv shortli after he had return to privet drive for the summer he rememb that there had been a small mention on the front about the resign of chariti burbag the muggl studi teacher at hogwart at last he found it turn to page ten he sank into hi desk chair and reread the articl he had been look for albu dumbledor rememb by elphia doge i met albu dumbledor at the age of eleven on our first day at hogwart our mutual attract wa undoubtedli due to the fact that we both felt ourselv to be outsid i had contract dragon pox shortli befor arriv at school and while i wa no longer contagi my pockmark visag and greenish hue did not encourag mani to approach me for hi part albu had arriv at hogwart under the burden of unwant notorieti scarc a year previous hi father perciv had been convict of a savag and wellpublic attack upon three young muggl albu never attempt to deni that hi father who wa to die in azkaban had commit thi crime on the contrari when i pluck up courag to ask him he assur me that he knew hi father to be guilti beyond that dumbledor refus to speak of the sad busi though mani attempt to make him do so some inde were dispos to prais hi father action and assum that albu too wa a mugglehat they could not have been more mistaken as anybodi who knew albu would attest he never reveal the remotest antimuggl tendenc inde hi determin support for muggl right gain him mani enemi in subsequ year in a matter of month howev albuss own fame had begun to eclips that of hi father by the end of hi first year he would never again be known as the son of a mugglehat but as noth more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school those of us who were privileg to be hi friend benefit from hi exampl not to mention hi help and encourag with which he wa alway gener he confess to me later in life that he knew even then that hi greatest pleasur lay in teach he not onli won everi prize of note that the school offer he wa soon in regular correspond with the most notabl magic name of the day includ nicola flamel the celebr alchemist bathilda bagshot the note historian and adalbert waffl the magic theoretician sever of hi paper found their way into learn public such as transfigur today challeng in charm and the practic potion dumbledor futur career seem like to be meteor and the onli question that remain wa when he would becom minist of magic though it wa often predict in later year that he wa on the point of take the job howev he never had ministeri ambit three year after we had start at hogwart albuss brother aberforth arriv at school they were not alik aberforth wa never bookish and unlik albu prefer to settl argument by duel rather than through reason discuss howev it is quit wrong to suggest as some have that the brother were not friend they rub along as comfort as two such differ boy could do in fair to aberforth it must be admit that live in albuss shadow can not have been an altogeth comfort experi be continu outshon wa an occup hazard of be hi friend and can not have been ani more pleasur as a brother when albu and i left hogwart we intend to take the thentradit tour of the world togeth visit and observ foreign wizard befor pursu our separ career howev tragedi interven on the veri eve of our trip albuss mother kendra die leav albu the head and sole breadwinn of the famili i postpon my departur long enough to pay my respect at kendra funer then left for what wa now to be a solitari journey with a younger brother and sister to care for and littl gold left to them there could no longer be ani question of albu accompani me that wa the period of our live when we had least contact i wrote to albu describ perhap insensit the wonder of my journey from narrow escap from chimaera in greec to the experi of the egyptian alchemist hi letter told me littl of hi daytoday life which i guess to be frustratingli dull for such a brilliant wizard immers in my own experi it wa with horror that i heard toward the end of my year travel that anoth tragedi had struck the dumbledor the death of hi sister ariana though ariana had been in poor health for a long time the blow come so soon after the loss of their mother had a profound effect on both of her brother all those closest to albu and i count myself one of that lucki number agre that ariana death and albuss feel of person respons for it though of cours he wa guiltless left their mark upon him forevermor i return home to find a young man who had experienc a much older person suffer albu wa more reserv than befor and much less lightheart to add to hi miseri the loss of ariana had led not to a renew close between albu and aberforth but to an estrang in time thi would lift in later year they reestablish if not a close relationship then certainli a cordial one howev he rare spoke of hi parent or of ariana from then on and hi friend learn not to mention them other quill will describ the triumph of the follow year dumbledor innumer contribut to the store of wizard knowledg includ hi discoveri of the twelv use of dragon blood will benefit gener to come as will the wisdom he display in the mani judgment while chief warlock of the wizengamot they say still that no wizard duel ever match that between dumbledor and grindelwald in those who wit it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watch these two extraordinari wizard to battl dumbledor triumph and it consequ for the wizard world are consid a turn point in magic histori to match the introduct of the intern statut of secreci or the downfal of hewhomustnotbenam albu dumbledor wa never proud or vain he could find someth to valu in anyon howev appar insignific or wretch and i believ that hi earli loss endow him with great human and sympathi i shall miss hi friendship more than i can say but my loss is noth compar to the wizard world that he wa the most inspir and best love of all hogwart headmast can not be in question he die as he live work alway for the greater good and to hi last hour as will to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he wa on the day i met him harri finish read but continu to gaze at the pictur accompani the obituari dumbledor wa wear hi familiar kindli smile but as he peer over the top of hi halfmoon spectacl he gave the impress even in newsprint of xray harri whose sad mingl with a sens of humili he had thought he knew dumbledor quit well but ever sinc read thi obituari he had been forc to recogn that he had bare known him at all never onc had he imagin dumbledor childhood or youth it wa as though he had sprung into be as harri had known him vener and silverhair and old the idea of a teenag dumbledor wa simpli odd like tri to imagin a stupid hermion or a friendli blastend skrewt he had never thought to ask dumbledor about hi past no doubt it would have felt strang impertin even but after all it had been common knowledg that dumbledor had taken part in that legendari duel with grindelwald and harri had not thought to ask dumbledor what that had been like nor about ani of hi other famou achiev no they had alway discuss harri harri past harri futur harri plan and it seem to harri now despit the fact that hi futur wa so danger and so uncertain that he had miss irreplac opportun when he had fail to ask dumbledor more about himself even though the onli person question he had ever ask hi headmast wa also the onli one he suspect that dumbledor had not answer honestli what do you see when you look in the mirror i i see myself hold a pair of thick woolen sock after sever minut thought harri tore the obituari out of the prophet fold it care and tuck it insid the first volum of practic defens magic and it use against the dark art then he threw the rest of the newspap onto the rubbish pile and turn to face the room it wa much tidier the onli thing left out of place were today daili prophet still lie on the bed and on top of it the piec of broken mirror harri move across the room slid the mirror fragment off today prophet and unfold the newspap he had mere glanc at the headlin when he had taken the rolledup paper from the deliveri owl earli that morn and thrown it asid after note that it said noth about voldemort harri wa sure that the ministri wa lean on the prophet to suppress news about voldemort it wa onli now therefor that he saw what he had miss across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headlin wa set over a pictur of dumbledor stride along look harri dumbledor the truth at last come next week the shock stori of the flaw geniu consid by mani to be the greatest wizard of hi gener stripe away the popular imag of seren silverbeard wisdom rita skeeter reveal the disturb childhood the lawless youth the lifelong feud and the guilti secret that dumbledor carri to hi grave whi wa the man tip to be the minist of magic content to remain a mere headmast what wa the real purpos of the secret organ known as the order of the phoenix how did dumbledor realli meet hi end the answer to these and mani more question are explor in the explos new biographi the life and lie of albu dumbledor by rita skeeter exclus interview by berri braithwait page insid harri rip open the paper and found page thirteen the articl wa top with a pictur show anoth familiar face a woman wear jewel glass with elabor curl blond hair her teeth bare in what wa clearli suppos to be a win smile wiggl her finger up at him do hi best to ignor thi nauseat imag harri read on in person rita skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famous feroci quillportrait might suggest greet me in the hallway of her cozi home she lead me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea a slice of pound cake and it goe without say a steam vat of freshest gossip well of cours dumbledor is a biograph dream say skeeter such a long full life im sure my book will be the first of veri veri mani skeeter wa certainli quick off the mark her ninehundredpag book wa complet in a mere four week after dumbledor mysteri death in june i ask her how she manag thi superfast feat oh when youv been a journalist as long as i have work to a deadlin is second natur i knew that the wizard world wa clamor for the full stori and i want to be the first to meet that need i mention the recent wide public remark of elphia doge special advisor to the wizengamot and longstand friend of albu dumbledor that skeeter book contain less fact than a chocol frog card skeeter throw back her head and laugh darl dodgi i rememb interview him a few year back about merpeopl right bless him complet gaga seem to think we were sit at the bottom of lake windermer kept tell me to watch out for trout and yet elphia doge accus of inaccuraci have been echo in mani place doe skeeter realli feel that four short week have been enough to gain a full pictur of dumbledor long and extraordinari life oh my dear beam skeeter rap me affection across the knuckl you know as well as i do how much inform can be gener by a fat bag of galleon a refus to hear the word no and a nice sharp quickquot quill peopl were queu to dish the dirt on dumbledor anyway not everyon thought he wa so wonder you know he trod on an aw lot of import toe but old dodgi doge can get off hi high hippogriff becaus ive had access to a sourc most journalist would swap their wand for one who ha never spoken in public befor and who wa close to dumbledor dure the most turbul and disturb phase of hi youth the advanc public for skeeter biographi ha certainli suggest that there will be shock in store for those who believ dumbledor to have led a blameless life what were the biggest surpris she uncov i ask now come off it betti im not give away all the highlight befor anybodi bought the book laugh skeeter but i can promis that anybodi who still think dumbledor wa white as hi beard is in for a rude awaken let just say that nobodi hear him rage against youknowwho would have dream that he dabbl in the dark art himself in hi youth and for a wizard who spent hi later year plead for toler he wasnt exactli broadmind when he wa younger ye albu dumbledor had an extrem murki past not to mention that veri fishi famili which he work so hard to keep hush up i ask whether skeeter is refer to dumbledor brother aberforth whose convict by the wizengamot for misus of magic caus a minor scandal fifteen year ago oh aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap laugh skeeter no no im talk about much wors than a brother with a fond for fiddl about with goat wors even than the mugglemaim father dumbledor couldnt keep either of them quiet anyway they were both charg by the wizengamot no it the mother and the sister that intrigu me and a littl dig uncov a posit nest of nasti but as i say youll have to wait for chapter nine to twelv for full detail all i can say now is it no wonder dumbledor never talk about how hi nose got broken famili skeleton notwithstand doe skeeter deni the brillianc that led to dumbledor mani magic discoveri he had brain she conced although mani now question whether he could realli take full credit for all of hi suppos achiev as i reveal in chapter sixteen ivor dillonsbi claim he had alreadi discov eight use of dragon blood when dumbledor borrow hi paper but the import of some of dumbledor achiev can not i ventur be deni what of hi famou defeat of grindelwald oh now im glad you mention grindelwald say skeeter with such a tantal smile im afraid those who go dewyey over dumbledor spectacular victori must brace themselv for a bombshel or perhap a dungbomb veri dirti busi inde all ill say is dont be so sure that there realli wa a spectacular duel of legend after theyv read my book peopl may be forc to conclud that grindelwald simpli conjur a white handkerchief from the end of hi wand and came quietli skeeter refus to give ani more away on thi intrigu subject so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedli fascin her reader more than ani other oh ye say skeeter nod briskli i devot an entir chapter to the whole potterdumbledor relationship it been call unhealthi even sinist again your reader will have to buy my book for the whole stori but there is no question that dumbledor took an unnatur interest in potter from the word go whether that wa realli in the boy best interest
