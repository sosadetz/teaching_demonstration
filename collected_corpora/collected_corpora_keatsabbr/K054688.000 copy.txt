under the direct of cook decr the castl of otranto a stori translat by william marshal gent from the origin italian of onuphrio muralto canon of the church of st nichola at otranto london print for tho lownd in fleet street mdcclxv the translat prefac the follow work wa found in the librari of an ancient cathol famili in the north of england it wa print at napl in the black letter in the year how much sooner it wa written doe not appear the princip incid are such as were believ in the darkest age of christian but the languag and conduct have noth that savour of barbar the style is the purest italian if the stori wa written near the time when it is suppos to have happen it must have been between the era of the first crusad and the date of the last or not long afterward there is no other circumst in the work that can lead us to guess at the period in which the scene is laid the name of the actor are evid fictiti and probabl disguis on purpos yet the spanish name of the domest seem to indic that thi work wa not compos until the establish of the arragonian king in napl had made spanish appel familiar in that countri the beauti of the diction and the zeal of the author moder howev by singular judgment concur to make me think that the date of the composit wa littl anteced to that of the impress letter were then in their most flourish state in itali and contribut to dispel the empir of superstit at that time so forcibl attack by the reform it is not unlik that an art priest might endeavor to turn their own arm on the innov and might avail himself of hi abil as an author to confirm the populac in their ancient error and superstit if thi wa hi view he ha certainli act with signal address such a work as the follow would enslav a hundr vulgar mind beyond half the book of controversi that have been written from the day of luther to the present hour thi solut of the author motiv is howev offer as a mere conjectur whatev hi view were or whatev effect the execut of them might have hi work can onli be laid befor the public at present as a matter of entertain even as such some apolog for it is necessari miracl vision necrom dream and other preternatur event are explod now even from romanc that wa not the case when our author wrote much less when the stori itself is suppos to have happen belief in everi kind of prodigi wa so establish in those dark age that an author would not be faith to the manner of the time who should omit all mention of them he is not bound to believ them himself but he must repres hi actor as believ them if thi air of the miracul is excus the reader will find noth els unworthi of hi perus allow the possibl of the fact and all the actor comport themselv as person would do in their situat there is no bombast no simil flower digress or unnecessari descript everi thing tend directli to the catastroph never is the reader attent relax the rule of the drama are almost observ throughout the conduct of the piec the charact are well drawn and still better maintain terror the author princip engin prevent the stori from ever languish and it is so often contrast by piti that the mind is kept up in a constant vicissitud of interest passion some person may perhap think the charact of the domest too littl seriou for the gener cast of the stori but besid their opposit to the princip personag the art of the author is veri observ in hi conduct of the subaltern they discov mani passag essenti to the stori which could not be well brought to light but by their naivet and simplic in particular the womanish terror and foibl of bianca in the last chapter conduc essenti toward advanc the catastroph it is natur for a translat to be prejud in favor of hi adopt work more imparti reader may not be so much struck with the beauti of thi piec as i wa yet i am not blind to my author defect i could wish he had ground hi plan on a more use moral than thi that the sin of father are visit on their children to the third and fourth gener i doubt whether in hi time ani more than at present ambit curb it appetit of dominion from the dread of so remot a punish and yet thi moral is weaken by that less direct insinu that even such anathema may be divert by devot to st nichola here the interest of the monk plainli get the better of the judgment of the author howev with all it fault i have no doubt but the english reader will be pleas with a sight of thi perform the pieti that reign throughout the lesson of virtu that are inculc and the rigid puriti of the sentiment exempt thi work from the censur to which romanc are but too liabl should it meet with the success i hope for i may be encourag to reprint the origin italian though it will tend to depreci my own labor our languag fall far short of the charm of the italian both for varieti and harmoni the latter is peculiarli excel for simpl narr it is difficult in english to relat without fall too low or rise too high a fault obvious occas by the littl care taken to speak pure languag in common convers everi italian or frenchman of ani rank piqu himself on speak hi own tongu correctli and with choic i can not flatter myself with have done justic to my author in thi respect hi style is as eleg as hi conduct of the passion is masterli it is piti that he did not appli hi talent to what they were evid proper for the theater i will detain the reader no longer but to make one short remark though the machineri is invent and the name of the actor imaginari i can not but believ that the groundwork of the stori is found on truth the scene is undoubtedli laid in some real castl the author seem frequent without design to describ particular part the chamber say he on the right hand the door on the left hand the distanc from the chapel to conrad s apart these and other passag are strong presumpt that the author had some certain build in hi eye curiou person who have leisur to employ in such research may possibl discov in the italian writer the foundat on which our author ha built if a catastroph at all resembl that which he describ is believ to have given rise to thi work it will contribut to interest the reader and will make the castl of otranto a still more move stori the castl of otranto a stori etc chapter i manfr princ of otranto had one son and one daughter the latter a most beauti virgin age eighteen wa call matilda conrad the son wa three year younger a

repres the danger of marri their onli son so earli consid hi great youth and greater infirm but she never receiv ani other answer than reflect on her own steril who had given him but one heir hi tenant and subject were less cautiou in their discours they attribut thi hasti wed to the princ dread of see accomplish an ancient propheci which wa said to have pronounc that the castl and lordship of otranto should pass from the present famili whenev the real owner should be grown too larg to inhabit it it wa difficult to make ani sens of thi propheci and still less easi to conceiv what it had to do with the marriag in question yet these mysteri or contradict did not make the populac adher the less to their opinion young conrad birthday wa fix for hi espous the compani wa assembl in the

helmet the helmet in the mean time some of the compani had run into the court from whenc wa heard a confus nois of shriek horror and surpris manfr who began to be alarm at not see hi son went himself to get inform of what occas thi strang confus matilda remain endeavor to assist her mother and isabella staid for the same purpos and to avoid show ani impati for the bridegroom for whom in truth she

some of the vulgar spectat had run to the great church which stood near the castl and came back openmouth declar that the helmet wa miss from alfonso statu manfr at thi news grew perfectli frantic and as if he sought a subject on which to vent the tempest within him he rush again on the young peasant cri villain monster sorcer it is thou have done thi it is thou have slain my son the mob who want some object within the scope of their capac on whom they might discharg their bewild reason caught the word from the mouth of their lord and reeccho ay ay it is he it is he he ha stolen the helmet from good alfonso tomb and dash out the brain of our young princ with it never reflect how enorm the disproport wa between the marbl helmet that had been in the church and that of steel befor their
