matter of state if you care to be entertaind awhil with a sort of idl thought such as pretend onli to amus and have no relat to busi or affair you may cast your eye slightli on what you have befor you and if there be ani thing invit you may read it over at your leisur shaftesburi it ha been an establishd custom for poet at the entranc of their work to address themselv to some muse and thi practic of the antient ha gaind so much reput that even in our day we find it almost constantli imit i can not but fansi howev that thi imit which pass so current with other judgment must at some time or other have stuck a littl with your lordship who is usd to examin thing by a better standard than that of fashion or the common tast you must certainli have observd our poet under a remark constraint when obligd to assum thi charact and you have wonderd perhap whi that air of enthusiasm which fit so grace with an antient shoud be so spiritless and aukard in a modern but as to thi doubt your lordship woud have soon resolvd yourself and it coud onli serv to bring across you a reflect you have often made on mani occas besid that truth is the most power thing in the world sinc even fiction itself must be governd by it and can onli pleas by it resembl the appear of realiti is necessari to make ani passion agreeabl repres and to be abl to move other we must first be movd ourselv or at least seem to be so upon some probabl ground now what possibl shaftesburi is there that a modern who is known never to have worshipd apollo or ownd ani such deiti as the muse shoud persuad us to enter into hi pretend devot and move us by hi feignd zeal in a religion out of date but as for the antient ti known they derivd both their religion and politi from the muse art how natur therefor must it have appeard in ani but especi a poet of those time to address himself in raptur of devot to those acknowledgd patro of wit and scienc here the poet might with probabl feign an extasi tho he realli felt none and suppos it to have been mere affect it woud look howev like someth natur and coud not fail of pleas but perhap my lord there wa a further mysteri in the case men your lordship know are wonder happi in a faculti of deceiv themselv whenev they set heartili about it and a veri small foundat of ani passion will serv us not onli to act it well but even to work ourselv into it beyond our own reach thu by a littl affect in lovematt and with the help of a romanc or novel a boy of fifteen or a grave man of fifti may be sure to grow a veri natur coxcomb and feel the bell passion in good earnest a man of toler goodnatur who happen to be a shaftesburi littl piqud may by improv hi resent becom a veri furi for reveng even a good christian who woud need be overgood and think he can never believ enough may by a small inclin well improvd extend hi faith so larg as to comprehend in it not onli all scriptur and tradit miracl but a solid system of oldwiv stori were it need i coud put your lordship in mind of an emin learn and truli christian prelat you onc knew who coud have given you a full account of hi belief in fairi and thi methink may serv to make appear how far an antient poet faith might possibl have been raisd togeth with hi imagin but we christian who have such ampl faith ourselv will allow noth to poor heathen they must be infidel in everi sens we will not allow em to believ so much as their own religion which we cri is too absurd to have been credit by ani besid the mere vulgar but if a reverend christian prelat may be so great a volunt in faith as beyond the ordinari prescript of the catholick church to believ in fairi whi may not a heathen poet in the ordinari way of hi religion be allowd to believ in muse for these your lordship know were so mani divin person in the heathen creed shaftesburi and were essenti in their system of theolog the goddess had their templ and worship the same as the other deiti and to disbeliev the holi nine or their apollo wa the same as to deni jove himself and must have been esteemd equal profan and atheist by the gener of sober men now what a mighti advantag must it have been to an antient poet to be thu orthodox and by the help of hi educ and a goodwil into the bargain to work himself up to the belief of a divin presenc and heavenli inspir it wa never sure the busi of poet in those day to call revel in question when it evid made so well for their art on the contrari they coud not fail to anim their faith as much as possibl when by a singl act of it well inforcd they coud rais themselv into such angel compani how much the imagin of such a presenc must exalt a geniu we may observ mere from the influenc which an ordinari presenc ha over men our modern wit are more or less raisd by the opinion they have of their compani and the idea they form to themselv of the person to whom they make their address a common actor of the stage will inform us how much a full audienc of the better sort exalt him abov the common shaftesburi pitch and you my lord who are the noblest actor and of the noblest part assignd to ani mortal on thi earthli stage when you are act for liberti and mankind doe not the publick presenc that of your friend and the wellwish to your caus add someth to your thought and geniu or is that sublim of reason and that power of eloqu which you discov in publick no more than what you are equal master of in privat and can command at ani time alon or with indiffer compani or in ani easi or cool hour thi inde were more godlik but ordinari human i think reach not so high for my own part my lord i have realli so much need of some consider presenc or compani to rais my thought on ani occas that when alon i must endeavour by strength of fanci to suppli thi want and in default of a muse must inquir out some great man of a more than ordinari geniu whose imagind presenc may inspir me with more than what i feel at ordinari hour and thu my lord have i chosen to address myself to your lordship tho without subscrib my name allow you as a stranger the full liberti of read no more than what you may have a fansi for but reserv to myself the privileg of imagin you shaftesburi read all with particular notic as a friend and one whom i may justifi treat with the intimaci and freedom which follow sect section ii if the know well how to expos ani infirm or vice were a suffici secur for the virtu which is contrari how excel an age might we be presumd to live in never wa there in our nation a time known when folli and extravag of everi kind were more sharpli inspect or more wittili ridiculd and one might hope at least from thi good symptom that our age wa in no declin state sinc whatev our distemp are we stand so well affect to our remedi to bear the be told of fault is in privat person the best token of amend ti seldom that a publick is thu disposd for where jealousi of state or the ill live of the great peopl or ani other caus is power enough to restrain the freedom of censur in ani part it in effect destroy the benefit of it in the whole there can be no imparti and free censur of manner where ani peculiar custom or nation opinion is set apart and not onli exempt from critic but even flatterd with the highest art ti onli in a free nation such as our that impostur ha no privileg and shaftesburi that neither the credit of a court the power of a nobil nor the awe of a church can give her protect or hinder her from be arraignd in everi shape and appear ti true thi liberti may seem to run too far we may perhap be said to make ill use of itâ€”so everi one will say when he himself is touchd and hi opinion freeli examind but who shall be judg of what may be freeli examind and what may not where liberti may be usd and where it may not what remedi shall we prescrib to thi in gener can there be a better than from that liberti itself which is complaind of if men are viciou petul or abus the magistr may correct them but if they reason ill ti reason still must teach em to do better just of thought and style refin in manner good breed and polit of everi kind can come onli from the trial and experi of what is best let but the search go freeli on and the right measur of everi thing will soon be found whatev humour ha got the start if it be unnatur it can not hold and the ridicul if ill placd at first will certainli fall at last where it deserv i have often wonderd to see men of sens so mightili alarmd at the approach of ani thing like ridicul on certain sub shaftesburi ject as if they mistrust their own judgment for what ridicul can lie against reason or how can ani one of the least just of thought endur a ridicul wrong placd noth is more ridicul than thi itself the vulgar inde may swallow ani sordid jest ani mere drolleri or buffooneri but it must be a finer and truer wit which take with the men of sens and breed how come it to pass then that we appear such coward in reason and are so afraid to stand the test of ridiculeâ€”o say we the subject are too graveâ€”perhap so but let us see first whether they are realli grave or no for in the manner we may conceiv em they may peradventur be veri grave and weighti in our imagin but veri ridicul and impertin in their own natur graviti is of the veri essenc of impostur it doe not onli make us mistak other thing but is apt perpetu almost to mistak itself for even in common behaviour how hard is it for the grave charact to keep long out of the limit of the formal one we can never be too grave if we can be assurd we are realli what we suppos and we can never too much honour or rever ani thing for grave if we are assurd the thing is grave as we apprehend it the main point is to know alway true graviti from the fals and thi can onli be by carri the rule shaftesburi constantli with us and freeli appli it not onli to the thing about us but to ourselv for if unhappili we lose the measur in ourselv we shall soon lose it in everi thing besid now what rule or measur is there in the world except in the consid of the real temper of thing to find which are truli seriou and which ridicul and how can thi be done unless by appli the ridicul to see whether it will bear but if we fear to appli thi rule in ani thing what secur can we have against the impostur of formal in all thing we have allowd ourselv to be formalist in one point and the same formal may rule us as it pleas in all other ti not in everi disposit that we are capacit to judg of thing we must beforehand judg of our own temper and accordingli of other thing which fall under our judgment but we must never more pretend to judg of thing or of our own temper in judg them when we have given up our preliminari right of judgment and under a presumpt of graviti have allowd ourselv to be most ridicul and to admir profoundli the most ridicul thing in natur at least for ought we know for have resolvd never to tri we can never be sure shaftesburi a jest often decid weighti matter better and more forcibl than can asper thi my lord i may safe aver is so true in itself and so well known for truth by the cun formalist of the age that they can better bear to have their impostur raild at with all the bitter and vehem imagin than to have them touchd ever so gentli in thi other way they know veri well that as mode and fashion so opinion tho ever so ridicul are kept up by solemn and that those formal notion which grew up probabl in an ill mood and have been conceivd in sober sad are never to be removd but in a sober kind of chear and by a more easi and pleasant way of thought there is a melancholi which accompani all enthusiasm be it love or religion for there are enthusiasm in both noth can put a stop to the grow mischief of either till the melancholi be removd and the mind at liberti to hear what can be said against the ridicul of an extrem in either way it wa heretofor the wisdom of some wise nation to let peopl be fool as much as they pleasd and never to punish shaftesburi serious what deservd onli to be laughd at and wa after all best curd by that innoc remedi there are certain humour in mankind which of necess must have vent the human mind and bodi are both of em natur subject to commot and as there are strang ferment in the blood which in mani bodi occas an extraordinari discharg so in reason too there are heterogen particl which must be thrown off by ferment shoud physician endeavour absolut to allay those ferment of the bodi and strike in the humour which discov themselv in such erupt they might instead of make a cure bid fair perhap to rais a plagu and turn a springagu or an autumnsurfeit into an epidem malign fever they are certainli as ill physician in the bodypolitick who woud need be tamper with these mental erupt and under the speciou pretenc of heal thi itch of superstit and save soul from the contagion of enthusiasm shoud set all natur in an uproar and turn a few innoc carbuncl into an inflamm and mortal gangren we read in histori that pan when he accompanyd bacchu in an expedit to the indi found mean to strike a shaftesburi terror thro a host of enemi by the help of a small compani whose clamor he managd to good advantag among the echo rock and cavern of a woodi vale the hoars bellow of the cave joind to the hideou aspect of such dark and desart place raisd such a horror in the enemi that in thi state their imagin helpd em to hear voic and doubtless to see form too which were more than human whilst the uncertainti of what they feard made their fear yet greater and spread it faster by implicit look than ani narrat coud convey it and thi wa what in aftertim men calld a panick the stori inde give a good hint of the natur of thi passion which can hardli be without some mixtur of enthusiasm and horror of a superstiti kind one may with good reason call everi passion panick which is raisd in a â€ multitud and conveyd by aspect or as it were by contact or sympathi thu popular furi may be calld panick when the rage of the peopl as we have sometim known ha put them beyond themselv especi where â€ religion ha had to do and in thi state their veri look are infecti the furi fli from face to face and the diseas is no sooner seen than caught they who in a better situa shaftesburi tion of mind have beheld a multitud under the power of thi passion have ownd that they saw in the counten of men someth more ghastli and terribl than at other time is expressd on the most passion occas such forc ha societi in ill as well as in good passion and so much stronger ani affect is for be social and commun thu my lord there are mani panick in mankind besid mere that of fear and thu is religion also panick when enthusiasm of ani kind get up as oft on melancholi occas it will for vapour natur rise and in bad time especi when the spirit of men are low as either in publick calam or dure the unwholesom of air or diet or when convuls happen in natur storm earthquak or other amaz prodigi at thi season the panick must need run high and the magistr of necess give way to it for to appli a seriou remedi and bring the sword or fasc as a cure must make the case more melancholi and increas the veri caus of the distemp to forbid men natur fear and to endeavour the overpow them by other fear must need be a most unnatur me shaftesburi thod the magistr if he be ani artist shoud have a gentler hand and instead of caustick incis and amput shoud be use the softest balm and with a kind sympathi enter into the concern of the peopl and take as it were their passion upon him shoud when he ha soothd and satisfyd it endeavour by chear way to divert and heal it thi wa antient polici and henc as a notabl â€ author of our nation express it ti necessari a peopl shoud have a publick lead in religion for to deni the magistr a worship or take away a nation church is as mere enthusiasm as the notion which set up persecut for whi shoud there not be publick walk as well as privat garden whi not publick librari as well as privat educ and hometutor but to prescrib bound to fanci and specul to regul men apprehens and religi belief or fear to suppress by violenc the natur passion of enthusiasm or to endeavour to ascertain it or reduc it to one speci or bring it under ani one modif is in truth no better sens nor deserv a better charact than what the comedian declar of the like project in the affair of loveâ€” shaftesburi you will manag it no better than if you undertook to be ration insan not onli the visionari and enthusiast of all kind were toler your lordship know by the antient but on the other side philosophi had as free a cours and wa permit as a ballanc against superstit and whilst some sect such as the pythagorean and latter platonick joind in with the superstit and enthusiasm of the time the epicurean the academick and other were allowd to use all the forc of wit and railleri against it and thu matter were happili balancd reason had fair play learn and scienc flourishd wonder wa the harmoni and temper which aros from all these contrarieti thu superstit and enthusiasm were mildli treat and be let alon they never ragd to that degre as to occas bloodsh war persecut and devast in the world but a new sort of polici which extend itself to anoth world and consid the futur live and happi of men rather than the present ha made us leap the bound of natur human and out of a supernatur chariti ha taught us the way of plagu one anoth most devoutli it ha raisd an â€ antipathi which no tempor interest coud ever do and entaild shaftesburi upon us a mutual hatr to all etern and now uniform in opinion a hope project is lookd on as the onli expedi against thi evil the save of soul is now the heroick passion of exalt spirit and is becom in a manner the chief care of the magistr and the veri end of govern itself if magistraci shoud vouchsaf to interpos thu much in other scienc i am afraid we shoud have as bad logick as bad mathematick and in everi kind as bad philosophi as we often have divin in countri where a precis orthodoxi is settl by law ti a hard matter for a govern to settl wit if it doe but keep us sober and honest ti like we shall have as much abil in our spiritu as in our tempor affair and if we can but be trust we shall have wit enough to save ourselv when no prejudic lie in the way but if honesti and wit be insuffici for thi save work ti in vain for the magistr to meddl with it sinc if he be ever so virtuou or wise he may be as soon mistaken as anoth man i am sure the onli way to save men sens or preserv wit at all in the world is to give liberti to wit now wit can never have it liberti where the freedom of railleri is taken away for against seriou extravag and splene shaftesburi tick humour there is no other remedi than thi we have inde full power over all other modif of spleen we may treat other enthusiasm as we pleas we may ridicul love or gallantri or knighterrantri to the utmost and we find that in these latter day of wit the humour of thi kind which wa onc so preval is pretti well declind the crusad the rescu of holi land and such devout gallantri are in less request than formerli but if someth of thi milit religion someth of thi soulrescu spirit and sainterrantri prevail still we need not wonder when we consid in how solemn a manner we treat thi distemp and how preposter we go about to cure enthusiasm i can hardli forbear fansi that if we had a sort of inquisit or formal court of judicatur with grave offic and judg erect to restrain poetic licenc and in gener to suppress that fanci and humour of versif but in particular that most extravag passion of love as it is set out by poet in it heathenish dress of venuss and cupid if the poet as ringlead and teacher of thi heresi were under grievou penalti forbid to enchant the shaftesburi peopl by their vein of rhyme and if the peopl on the other side were under proportion penalti forbid to hearken to ani such charm or lend their attent to ani lovetal so much as in a play a novel or a ballad we might perhap see a new arcadia aris out of thi heavi persecut old peopl and young would be seizd with a versifi spirit we shoud have fieldconventicl of lover and poet forest woud be filld with romantick shepherd and shepherdess and rock resound with echo of hymn and prais offerd to the power of love we might inde have a fair chanc by thi manag to bring back the whole train of heathen god and set our cold northern island burn with as mani altar to venu and apollo as were formerli in cypru delo or ani of those warmer grecian climat sect section iii but my lord you may perhap wonder that have been drawn into such a seriou subject as religion i shoud forget my self so far as to give way to railleri and humour i must own my lord ti not mere thro chanc that thi ha happend to say truth i hardli care so much as to think on thi subject much shaftesburi less to write on it without endeavour to put my self in as good humour as is possibl peopl inde who can endur no middl temper but are all air and humour know littl of the doubt and scrupl of religion and are safe from ani immedi influenc of devout melancholi or enthusiasm which requir more deliber and thought practic to fix itself in a temper and grow habitu but be the habit what it will to be deliverd of it at so sad a cost as inconsider or mad is what i woud never wish to be my lot i had rather stand all adventur with religion than endeavour to get rid of the thought of it by divers all i contend for is to think of it in a right humour and that thi goe more than halfway toward think rightli of it is what i shall endeavour to demonstr good humour is not onli the best secur against enthusiasm but the best foundat of pieti and true religion for if right thought and worthi apprehens of the suprem be are fundament to all true worship and ador ti more than probabl that we shall never miscarri in thi respect except thro ill humour onli noth besid ill humour either natur or forcd can bring a man to think serious that the shaftesburi world is governd by ani devilish or malici power i veri much question whether ani thing besid ill humour can be the caus of atheism for there are so mani argument to persuad a man in humour that in the main all thing are kindli and well disposd that one woud think it imposs for him to be so far out of conceit with affair as to imagin they all ran at adventur and that the world as vener and wise a face as it carryd had neither sens nor mean in it thi howev i am persuad of that noth besid ill humour can give us dread or ill thought of a suprem manag noth can persuad us of sullen or sour in such a be besid the actual forefeel of somewhat of thi kind within ourselv and if we are afraid of bring good humour into religion or think with freedom and pleasant on such a subject as god ti becaus we conceiv the subject so like ourselv and can hardli have a notion of majesti and great without stateli and moros accompani it thi howev is the just revers of that charact which we own to be most divin good when we see it as we sometim do in men of highest power among us if they pass for truli good we dare treat them freeli and are sure they will shaftesburi not be displeasd with thi liberti they are doubli gainer by thi good of their for the more they are searchd into and familiarli examind the more their worth appear and the discover charmd with hi success esteem and love more than ever when he ha provd thi addit bounti in hi superior and reflect on that candor and generos he ha experiencd your lordship know more perhap of thi mysteri than anyon how els shoud you have been so belovd in power and out of power so adherd to and still more belovd thank heaven there are even in our own age some such exampl in former age there have been mani such we have known mighti princ and even emperor of the world who coud bear unconcernedli not onli the free censur of their action but the most spite reproach and calumni even to their face some perhap may wish there had never been such exampl found in heathen but more especi that the occas had never been given by christian twa more the misfortun inde of mankind in gener than of christian in particular that some of the earlier roman emperor were such monster of tyranni and began a persecut not on religi men mere but on all who were shaftesburi suspect of worth or virtu what coud have been a higher honour or advantag to christian than to be persecut by a nero but better princ who came after were persuad to remit these sever cours ti true the magistr might possibl have been surprizd with the new of a notion which he might pretend perhap did not onli destroy the sacred of hi power but treat him and all men as profan impiou and damnd who enterd not into certain particular mode of worship of which there had been formerli so mani thousand institut all of em compat and sociabl till that time howev such wa the wisdom of some succeed ministri that the edg of persecut wa much abat and even that princ who wa esteemd the greatest enemi of the christian sect and who himself had been educ in it wa a great restrain of persecut and woud allow of noth further than a resumpt of churchland and publick school without ani attempt on the good or person even of those who brand the statereligion and made a merit of affront the publick worship ti well we have the author of a sacr author in our religion to assur us shaftesburi that the spirit of love and human is abov that of martyr otherwis one might be a littl scandalizd perhap at the histori of mani of our primit confessor and martyr even accord to our own account there is hardli now in the world so good a christian if thi be inde the mark of a good one who if he happend to live at constantinopl or elsewher under the protect of the turk would think it fit or decent to give ani disturb to their mosqueworship and as good protest my lord as you and i are we shoud consid him as littl better than a rank enthusiast who out of hatr to the romish idolatri shoud in time of high mass where mass perhap wa by law establishd interrupt the priest with clamor or fall foul on hi imag and relick there are some it seem of our good brethren the french protest late come among us who are mightili taken with thi primit way they have set afoot the spirit of martyrdom to a wonder in their own countri and they long to be tri it here if we will give em leav and afford em the occas that is to say if we will onli do em the favour to hang or imprison em if we shaftesburi will onli be so oblig as to break their bone for em after their countryfashion blow up their zeal and stir afresh the coal of persecut but no such grace can they hitherto obtain of us so hardheart we are that notwithstand their own mob are will to bestow kind blow upon em and fairli stone em now and then in the open street tho the priest of their own nation woud gladli give em their desird disciplin and are earnest to light their probationari fire for em we english men who are master in our own countri will not suffer the enthusiast to be thu usd nor can we be supposd to act thu in envi to their phenixsect which it seem ha risen out of the flame and woud willingli grow to be a new church by the same manner of propag as the oldon whose seed wa truli said to be from the blood of the martyr but how barbar still and more than heathenishli cruel are we toler english men for not content to deni these prophesi enthusiast the honour of a persecut we have deliverd em over to the cruellest contempt in the world i am told for certain that they are at thi veri time the subject of a shaftesburi choic droll or puppetshow at bartlemyfair there doubtless their strang voic and involuntari agit are admir well act by the motion of wire and inspir of pipe for the bodi of the prophet in their state of propheci be not in their own power but as they say themselv mere passiv organ actuat by an exterior forc have noth natur or resembl real life in ani of their sound or motion so that how aukardli soever a puppetshow may imit other action it must need repres thi passion to the life and whilst bartlemyfair is in possess of thi privileg i dare stand secur to our nation church that no sect of enthusiast no new vender of propheci or miracl shall ever get the start or put her to the troubl of tri her strength with em in ani case happi it wa for us that when poperi had got possess smithfield wa usd in a more tragic way mani of our first reform ti feard were littl better than enthusiast and god know whether a warmth of thi kind did not consider help us in throw off that spiritu tyranni so that had not the priest as is usual preferd the love of blood to all other passion they might in a merrier way perhap have evad the greatest shaftesburi forc of our reform spirit i never heard that the antient heathen were so well advisd in their ill purpos of suppress the christian religion in it first rise as to make use at ani time of thi bartlemyfair method but thi i am persuad of that had the truth of the gospel been ani way surmount they woud have bid much fairer for the silenc it if they had chosen to bring our primit founder upon the stage in a pleasant way than that of bearskin and pitchbarrel the jew were natur a veri cloudi peopl and woud endur littl railleri in ani thing much less in what belongd to ani religi doctrin or opinion religion wa lookd upon with a sullen eye and hang wa the onli remedi they coud prescrib for ani thing which lookd like set up a new revel the sovereign argument wa crucifi crucifi but with all their malic and inveteraci to our saviour and hi apostl after him had they but taken the fanci to act such puppetshow in hi contempt as at thi hour the papist are act in hi honour i am apt to think shaftesburi they might possibl have done our religion more harm than by all their other way of sever i believ our great and learn apostl found â€ less advantag from the easi treatment of hi athenian antagonist than from the surli and curst spirit of the most persecut jewish citi he made less improv of the candor and civil of hi roman judg than of the zeal of the synagogu and vehem of hi nation priest tho when i consid thi apostl as appear either befor the witti athenian or befor a roman court of judicatur in the presenc of their great men and ladi and see how handsomli he accommod himself to the apprehens and temper of those polit peopl i do not find that he declin the way of wit or good humour but without suspicion of hi caus is will gener to commit it to thi proof and tri it against the sharp of ani ridicul which might be offerd but tho the jew were never pleasd to tri their wit or malic thi way against shaftesburi our saviour or hi apostl the irreligi part of the heathen had tryd it long befor against the best doctrin and best charact of men which had ever arisen amongst em nor did thi prove in the end an injuri but on the contrari the highest advantag to those veri charact and doctrin which have stood the proof were found so solid and just the divinest man who had ever appeard in the heathen world wa in the height of witti time and by the wittiest of all poet most abomin ridiculd in a whole comedi writ and act on purpos but so far wa thi from sink hi reput or suppress hi philosophi that they each increasd the more for it and he appar grew to be more the envi of other teacher he wa not onli content to be ridiculd but that he might help the poet as much as possibl he present himself openli in the theater that hi real figur which wa no advantag one might be compard with that which the witti poet had brought as hi repres on the stage such wa hi good humour nor coud there be in the world a greater testimoni of the invinc good of the man or a greater demonstr that there wa no impostur either in hi charact or opinion for that impostur shoud dare sustain the encount of a grave enemi is shaftesburi no wonder a solemn attack she know is not of such danger to her there is noth she abhor or dread like pleasant and good humour sect section iv in short my lord the melancholi way of treat religion is that which accord to my apprehens render it so tragic and is the occas of it act in realiti such dismal tragedi in the world and my notion is that provid we treat religion with good manner we can never use too much good humour or examin it with too much freedom and familiar for if it be genuin and sincer it will not onli stand the proof but thrive and gain advantag from henc if it be spuriou or mixd with ani impostur it will be detect and exposd the melancholi way in which we have been taught religion make us unapt to think of it in good humour ti in advers chiefli or in ill health under afflict or disturb of mind or discomposur of temper that we have recours to it tho in realiti we are never so unfit to think of it as at such a heavi and dark hour we can never be fit to contempl ani thing abov us when shaftesburi we are in no condit to look into ourselv and calmli examin the temper of our own mind and passion for then it is we see wrath and furi and reveng and terror in the deiti when we are full of disturb and fear within and have by suffer and anxieti lost so much of the natur calm and easi of our temper we must not onli be in ordinari good humour but in the best of humour and in the sweetest kindest disposit of our live to understand well what true good is and what those attribut impli which we ascrib with such applaus and honour to the deiti we shall then be abl to see best whether those form of justic those degre of punish that temper of resent and those measur of offenc and indign which we vulgarli suppos in god are sutabl to those origin idea of good which the same divin be or natur under him ha implant in us and which we must necessarili presuppos in order to give him prais or honour in ani kind thi my lord is the secur against all superstit to rememb that there is noth in god but what is godlik and that he is either not at all or truli and perfectli good but when we are afraid to use our reason shaftesburi freeli even on that veri question whether he realli be or not we then actual presum him bad and flatli contradict that pretend charact of good and great whilst we discov thi mistrust of hi temper and fear hi anger and resent in the case of thi freedom of inquiri we have a notabl instanc of thi freedom in one of our sacr author as patient as job is said to be it can not be deni that he make bold enough with god and take hi provid roundli to task hi friend inde plead hard with him and use all argument right or wrong to patch up object and set the affair of provid upon an equal foot they make a merit of say all the good they can of god at the veri stretch of their reason and sometim quit beyond it but thi in job opinion is flatter god accept of god person and even mock him and no wonder for what merit can there be in believ god or hi provid upon frivol and weak ground what virtu in assum an opinion contrari to the appear of thing and resolv to hear noth which may be said against it excel charact of the god of truth that he shoud be offend at us for have refusd shaftesburi to put the lye upon our understand as much as in us lay and be satisfyd with us for have believd at a ventur and against our reason what might have been the greatest falshood in the world for ani thing we coud bring as a proof or evid to the contrari it is imposs that ani besid an illnaturd man can wish against the be of a god for thi is wish against the publick and even against one privat good too if rightli understood but if a man ha not ani such illwil to stifl hi belief he must have sure an unhappi opinion of god and believ him not so good by far as he know himself to be if he imagin that an imparti use of hi reason in ani matter of specul whatsoev can make him run ani risk hereaft and that a mean denial of hi reason and an affect of belief in ani point too hard for hi understand can intitl him to ani favour in anoth world thi is be sycoph in religion mere parasit of devot ti use god as the crafti â€ beggar use those they address to when they are ignor of their qualiti the novic amongst em may innoc come out perhap with a good sir or a good forsooth but with the old stager no matter whom they meet in a coach ti shaftesburi alway good your honour or good your lordship or your ladyship for if there shoud be realli a lord in the case we shoud be undon say they for want of give the titl but if the parti shoud be no lord there woud be no offenc it woud not be ill taken and thu it is in religion we are highli concernd how to beg right and think all depend upon hit the titl and make a good guess ti the most beggarli refug imagin which is so mightili cryd up and stand as a great maxim with mani abl men that they shoud strive to have faith and believ to the utmost becaus if after all there be noth in the matter there will be no harm in be thu deceivd but if there be ani thing it will be fatal for them not to have believd to the full but they are so far mistaken that whilst they have thi thought ti certain they can never believ either to their satisfact and happi in thi world or with ani advantag of recommend to anoth for besid that our reason which know the cheat will never rest thorowli satisfyd on such a bottom but turn us often adrift and toss us in a sea of doubt and perplex we can not but actual grow wors in our religion and entertain a wors opinion still of a suprem shaftesburi deiti whilst our belief is found on so injuri a thought of him to love the publick to studi univers good and to promot the interest of the whole world as far as lie within our power is sure the height of good and make that temper which we call divin in thi temper my lord for sure you shoud know it well ti natur for us to wish that other shoud partak with us by be convincd of the sincer of our exampl ti natur for us to wish our merit shoud be known particularli if it be our fortun to have servd a nation as a good minist or as some princ or father of a countri to have renderd happi a consider part of mankind under our care but if it happend that of thi number there shoud be some so ignorantli bred and of so remot a provinc as to have lain out of the hear of our name and action or hear of em shoud be so puzzld with odd and contrari stori told up and down concern us that they knew not what to think whether there were realli in the world ani such person as ourself shoud we not in good truth be ridicul to take offenc at thi and shoud we not pass for extravagantli moros and illhumourd if instead of treat the matter in railleri we shoud think in earnest shaftesburi of reveng ourselv on the offend parti who out of their rustick ignor ill judgment or incredul had detract from our renown how shall we say then doe it realli deserv prais to be thu concernd about it is the do good for glori sake so divin a thing or is it not divin to do good even where it may be thought inglori even to the ingrat and to those who are wholli insens of the good they receiv how come it then that what is so divin in us shoud lose it charact in the divin be and that accord as the deiti is repres to us he shoud more resembl the weak womanish and impot part of our natur than the gener manli and divin sect section v one woud think my lord it were in realiti no hard thing to know our own weak at first sight and distinguish the featur of human frailti with which we are so well acquaint one woud think it were easi to understand that provoc and offenc anger reveng jealousi in point of honour or power love of fame glori and the like belong onli to limit be shaftesburi ing and are necessarili exclud a be which is perfect and univers but if we have never settl with ourselv ani notion of what is moral excel or if we can not trust to that reason which tell us that noth besid what is so can have place in the deiti we can neither trust to ani thing which other relat of him or which he himself reveal to us we must be satisfyd beforehand that he is good and can not deceiv us without thi there can be no real religi faith or confid now if there be realli someth previou to revel some anteced demonstr of reason to assur us that god is and withal that he is so good as not to deceiv us the same reason if we will trust to it will demonstr to us that god is so good as to exceed the veri best of us in good and after thi manner we can have no dread or suspicion to render us uneasi for it is malic onli and not good which can make us afraid there is an odd way of reason but in certain distemp of mind veri sovereign to those who can appli it and it is thi there can be no malic but where interest are opposd a univers be can have no interest opposit and therefor can have no malic if there be a gener mind shaftesburi it can have no particular interest but the gener good or good of the whole and it own privat good must of necess be one and the same it can intend noth besid nor aim at ani thing beyond nor be provokd to ani thing contrari so that we have onli to consid whether there be realli such a thing as a mind which ha relat to the whole or not for if unhappili there be no mind we may comfort our selv howev that natur ha no malic if there be realli a mind we may rest satisfyd that it is the bestnaturd one in the world the last case one woud imagin shoud be the most comfort and the notion of a common parent less fright than that of forlorn natur and a fatherless world tho as religion stand amongst us there are mani good peopl who woud have less fear in be thu exposd and woud be easier perhap in their mind if they were assurd they had onli mere chanc to trust to for no bodi trembl to think there shoud be no god but rather that there shoud be one thi howev woud be otherwis if deiti were thought as kindli of as human and we coud be persuad to believ that if there realli wa a god the highest good must of necess belong to him without ani of shaftesburi those defect of passion those mean and imperfect which we acknowledg such in ourselv which as good men we endeavour all we can to be superior to and which we find we everi day conquer as we grow better methink my lord it woud be well for us if befor we ascend into the higher region of divin we woud vouchsaf to descend a littl into ourselv and bestow some poor thought upon plain honest moral when we had onc lookd into ourselv and distinguishd well the natur of our own affect we shoud probabl be fitter judg of the divin of a charact and discern better what affect were sutabl or unsut to a perfect be we might then understand how to love and prais when we had acquird some consist notion of what wa laudabl or love otherwis we might chanc to do god littl honour when we intend him the most for ti hard to imagin what honour can aris to the deiti shaftesburi from the prais of creatur who are unabl to discern what is praiseworthi or excel in their own kind if a musician were cryd up to the sky by a certain set of peopl who had no ear in musick he woud sure be put to the blush and coud hardli with a good counten accept the benevol of hi auditor till they had acquird a more compet apprehens of him and coud by their own sens find out someth realli good in hi perform till thi were brought about there woud be littl glori in the case and the musician tho ever so vain woud have littl reason to be content they who affect prais the most had rather not be taken notic of than be impertin applaud i know not how it come about that he who is ever said to do good the most disinterestedli shoud be thought desir of be praisd so lavishli and be supposd to set so high a rate upon so cheap and low a thing as ignor commend and forcd applaus ti not the same with good as with other qualiti which we may understand veri well and yet not possess we may have an excel ear in musick shaftesburi without be abl to perform in ani kind we may judg well of poetri without be poet or possess the least of a poetick vein but we can have no toler notion of good without be toler good so that if the prais of a divin be be so great a part of hi worship we shoud methink learn good were it for noth els than that we might learn in some toler manner how to prais for the prais of good from an unsound hollow heart must certainli make the greatest disson in the world sect section vi other reason my lord there are whi thi plain homespun philosophi of look into ourselv may do us wondrou servic in rectifi our error in religion for there is a sort of enthusiasm of second hand and when men find no origin commot in themselv no prepossess panick which bewitch em they are apt still by the testimoni of other to be imposd on and led credul into the belief of mani fals miracl and thi habit may make em variabl and of a veri inconst faith easi to be carryd away with everi wind of doctrin and addict to everi upstart sect or superstit but the knowledg of our passion in their veri shaftesburi seed the measur well the growth and progress of enthusiasm and the judg rightli of it natur forc and what command it ha over our veri sens may teach us to oppos more success those delus which come armd with the speciou pretext of moral certainti and matter of fact the new prophesi sect i made mention of abov pretend it seem among mani other miracl to have had a most signal one act premedit and with warn befor mani hundr of peopl who actual give testimoni to the truth of it but i woud onli ask whether there were present among those hundr ani one person who have never been of their sect or addict to their way will give the same testimoni with them i must not be content to ask whether such a one had been wholli free of that particular enthusiasm but whether befor that time he wa esteemd of so sound a judgment and clear a head as to be wholli free of melancholi and in all likelihood incap of all enthusiasm besid for otherwis the panick may have been caught the evid of the sens lost as in a dream and the imagin so inflamd as in a moment to shaftesburi have burnt up everi particl of judgment and reason the combust matter lie prepard within and readi to take fire at a spark but chiefli in a multitud seizd with the same spirit no wonder if the blaze rise so of a sudden when innumer eye glow with the passion and heav breast are labour with inspir when not the aspect onli but the veri breath and exhal of men are infecti and the inspir diseas impart itself by insens transpir i am not a divin good enough to resolv what spirit that wa which provd so catch among the antient prophet that even the profan â€ saul wa taken by it but i learn from holi scriptur that there wa the â€ evil as well as the good spirit of propheci and i find by present experi as well as by all histori sacr and profan that the oper of thi spirit is everi where the same as to the bodili organ a gentleman who ha writ late in defenc of revivd propheci and ha sinc fallen himself into the prophetick extasi tell us that the antient prophet had the spirit of god upon them under extasi with diver strang gestur shaftesburi of bodi denomin them madmen or enthusiast as appear evid say he in the instanc of balaam saul david ezekiel daniel c and he proce to justifi thi by the practic of the apostolick time and by the regul which the â€¡apostl himself appli to these seemingli irregular gift so frequent and ordinari as our author pretend in the primit church on the first rise and spread of christian but i leav it to him to make the resembl as well as he can between hi own and the apostolick way i onli know that the symptom he describ and which himself poor gentleman labour under are as heathenish as he can possibl pretend them to be christian and when i saw him late under an agit as they call it utter propheci in a pompou latin style of which out of hi extasi it seem he is wholli incap it brought into my mind the latin poet descript of the sibyl whose agoni were so perfectli like these immedi her face chang her colour fli her hair fall in disord her breast heav and her heart swell with mad passion greater her statur seem shaftesburi and her voic not mortal for she is breath upon by the god now immin and again present after the prophetess rage monstrous in the cave seek to cast from her breast the mighti god so much the more he compel the rabid mouth rule the wild heart and mould her by hi forc which is the veri style of our experiencd author for the inspird say he undergo a probat wherein the spirit by frequent agit form the organ ordinarili for a month or two befor utter the roman historian speak of a most horribl enthusiasm which broke out in rome long befor hi day describ thi spirit of propheci men vaticin as if out of their mind with fanat convuls of the bodi the detest thing which are further relat of these enthusiast i woud not willingli transcrib but the senat mild decre in so execr a case i cant omit copi be satisfyd that tho your lordship ha read it befor now you can read it again and again with admir as to the futur the senat enact that if ani one should believ that such a cult wa shaftesburi religi necessari to him and that he could not without irreligion and impieti forego it he should inform the praetor of the citi who should consult the senat if with not less than a hundr present the senat should give permiss the rite might be perform but there should not be more than five assist at the sacrific nor should there be ani common fund nor ani master of the rite nor ani priest so necessari it is to give way to thi distemp of enthusiasm that even that philosoph who bent the whole forc of hi philosophi against superstit appear to have left room for visionari fanci and to have indirectli toler enthusiasm for it is hard to imagin that one who had so littl religi faith as epicuru shoud have so vulgar a credul as to believ those account of armi and castl in the air and such visionari phaenomena yet he allow them and then think to solv em by hi effluvia and aerial lookingglass and i know not what other stuff which hi latin poet howev set off beauti as he doe all mani simulacra of thing thin manifold in number and form wander about in all manner of way which when in the air they meet easili conjoin shaftesburi like cobweb or goldleaf thu we see centaur and limb of scylla and shape of dog like cerberu and the phantasm of those pass away whose bone the earth enfold sinc everywher float simulacra of everi kind partli those spontan shape by the air within itself partli those thrown off by variou thing twa a sign thi philosoph believd there wa a good stock of visionari spirit origin in human natur he wa so satisfyd that men were inclind to see vision that rather than they shoud go without he chose to make em to their hand notwithstand he denyd the principl of religion to be natur he wa forcd tacitli to allow there wa a wondrou disposit in mankind toward supernatur object and that if these idea were vain they were yet in a manner innat or such as men were realli born to and coud hardli by ani mean avoid from which concess a divin methink might rais a good argument against him for the truth as well as the use of religion but so it is shaftesburi whether the matter of apparit be true or fals the symptom are the same and the passion of equal forc in the person who is visionstruck the lymphatici of the latin were the nympholepti of the greek they were person said to have seen some speci of divin as either some rural deiti or nymph which threw them into such transport as overcam their reason the extasi expressd themselv outwardli in quak trembl toss of the head and limb agit and as livi call them fanat throw or convuls extemporari prayer propheci sing and the like all nation have their lymphatick of some kind or anoth and all church heathen as well as christian have had their complaint against fanatic one woud think the antient imagind thi diseas had some relat to that which they calld hydrophobi whether the antient lymphatick had ani way like that of bite to commun the rage of their distemp i cant so posit determin but certain fanatick there have been sinc the time of the antient who have had a most prosper faculti of commun the appetit of the teeth for sinc first the snappish spirit got up in religion all sect have been at it as the say is tooth and nail shaftesburi and are never better pleasd than in worri one anoth without merci so far inde the innoc kind of fanatic extend itself that when the parti is struck by the apparit there follow alway an itch of impart it and kindl the same fire in other breast for thu poet are fanatick too and thu horac either is or feign himself lymphatick and shew what an effect the vision of the nymph and bacchu had on him bacchu have i seen in faroff stoni place teach hi song aftercom believ me and the nymph con them eva my heart trembl with the stillfelt fear and wildli madden lymphatur in a breast fill with bacchu the accept read is laetatur exult lymphaturâ€”â€”â€”â€”â€”a heinsiu read no poet as i venturd to say at first to your lordship can do ani thing great in hi own way without the imagin or supposit of a divin presenc which may rais him to some degre of thi passion we are speak of even the cold shaftesburi lucretiu â€ make use of inspir when he write against it and is forcd to rais an apparit of natur in a divin form to anim and conduct him in hi veri work of degrad natur and despoil her of all her seem wisdom and divin â€¡ nutrient venu who under the glide sign of heaven fillest with life the shipbear sea and the fruit land sinc thou alon rulest the natur of thing nor without thee ariseth aught to the holi frontier of light nor groweth anyth joyou or meet for love thee would i have for helper in frame the song i seek to build for thi our son of the memmian line sect section vii the onli thing my lord i woud infer from all thi is that enthusiasm is wonder power and extens that it is a matter of nice judgment and the hardest thing in the world to know fulli and distinctli sinc even atheism is not exempt from it for as some have well remarkd there have been enthusiast atheist nor can divin in shaftesburi spirat by it outward mark be easili distinguishd from it for inspir is a real feel of the divin presenc and enthusiasm a fals one but the passion they rais is much alik for when the mind is taken up in vision and fix it view either on ani real object or mere specter of divin when it see or think it see ani thing prodigi and more than human it horror delight confus fear admir or whatev passion belong to it or is uppermost on thi occas will have someth vast imman and as painter say beyond life and thi is what gave occas to the name of fanatic as it wa usd by the antient in it origin sens for an apparit transport the mind someth there will be of extravag and furi when the idea or imag receivd are too big for the narrow human vessel to contain so that inspir may be justli calld divin enthusiasm for the word itself signifi divin presenc and wa made use of by the philosoph whom the earliest christian father calld divin to express whatev wa sublim in human passionsâ€  thi shaftesburi wa the spirit he allot to hero statesmen poet orat musician and even philosoph themselv nor can we of our own accord forbear ascrib to a nobl enthusiasm whatev is greatli performd by ani of these so that almost all of us know someth of thi principl but to know it as we shoud do and discern it in it sever kind both in ourselv and other thi is the great work and by thi mean alon we can hope to avoid delus for to judg the spirit whether they are of god we must anteced judg our own spirit whether it be of reason and sound sens whether it be fit to judg at all by be sedat cool and imparti free of everi biass passion everi giddi vapor or melancholi fume thi is the first knowledg and previou judgment to understand ourselv and know what spirit we are of afterward we may judg the spirit in other consid what their person merit is and shaftesburi prove the valid of their testimoni by the solid of their brain by thi mean we may prepar ourselv with some antidot against enthusiasm and thi is what i have dard affirm is best performd by keep to good humour for otherwis the remedi itself may turn to the diseas and now my lord have after all in some measur justifyd enthusiasm and ownd the word if i appear extravag in address to you after the manner i have done you must allow me to plead an impuls you must suppos me as with truth you may most passion your and with that kind which is natur to you on other occas you must toler your enthusiastick friend who except onli in the case of thi overforward zeal must ever appear with the highest

thi case may be lookd upon as a piec of selfish we may be chargd perhap with wil ignor and blind idolatri for have taken opinion upon trust and consecr in ourselv certain idolnot which we will never

those princip light or natur medium by which thing are to be viewd in order to a thorow recognit is ridicul itself or that manner of proof by which we discern whatev is liabl to just railleri in ani

deni other the freedom of thi appeal whilst they are free to censur like other men and in their gravest argument make no scrupl to ask is it not ridicul of thi affair therefor i design you shoud know fulli what my sentiment are and by thi mean you will be abl to judg of me whether i wa sincer the other day in the defenc of railleri and can continu still to plead for those ingeni friend of our who

affair of whatev kind when the spirit of curios woud forc a discoveri of more truth than can conveni be told for we can never do more injuri to truth than by discov too much of it on some occas ti the same with understand as with eye to such a certain size and make just so much light is necessari and no more whatev is beyond bring dark and confus shaftesburi ti real human and kind to hide strong truth from tender eye and to do thi by a pleasant amus is easier and civil than by a harsh denial or remark reserv but to go about industri to confound men in a mysteri manner and to make advantag or draw pleasur from that perplex they are thrown into by such uncertain talk is as unhandsom in a way of railleri as when done with the greatest serious or in the most solemn way of deceit it may be necessari as well now as heretofor for wise men to speak in parabl and with a doubl mean that the enemi may be amusd and they onli who have ear to hear may hear but ti certainli a mean impot and dull sort of wit which amus all alik and leav the most sensibl man and even a friend equal in doubt and at a loss to understand what one real mind is upon ani subject thi is that gross sort of railleri which is so offens in good compani and inde there is as much differ between one sort and anoth as between fairdeal and hypocrisi or between the genteelest wit and the most scurril buffooneri but by freedom of convers thi illiber kind of wit will lose shaftesburi it credit for wit is it own remedi liberti and commerc bring it to it true standard the onli danger is the lay an embargo the same thing happen here as in the case of trade imposit and restrict reduc it to a low ebb noth is so advantag to it as a freeport we have seen in our own time the declin and ruin of a fals sort of wit which so much delight our ancestor that their poem and play as well as sermon were full of it all humour had someth of the quibbl the veri languag of the court wa pun but ti now banishd the town and all good compani there are onli some few footstep of it in the countri and it seem at last confind to the nurseri of youth as the chief entertain of pedant and their pupil and thu in other respect wit will mend upon our hand and humour will refin itself if we take care not to tamper with it and bring it under constraint by sever usag and rigor prescript all polit is owe to liberti we polish one

have the practic yet everyon think himself wellbr and the formallest pedant imagin he can railli with a good grace and humour i have known some of those grave gentlemen undertak to correct an author for defend the use of railleri who at the same time have upon everi turn made use of that weapon tho they were natur so veri aukard at it and thi i believ may be observd in the case of mani zealot who have taken upon em to answer our modern freewrit the tragic gentlemen with the grim aspect and mein of true inquisitor have but an ill grace when they vouchsaf to quit their auster and be jocos and pleasant with an adversari whom they woud chuse to treat in a veri differ manner for to do em justic had they their will i doubt not but their conduct and mein woud be pretti much of apiec they woud in all probabl soon quit their farc and make a thorow tragedi but shaftesburi at present there is noth so ridicul as thi janusfac of writer who with one counten forc a smile and with anoth show noth

their controversi write they are no more master of graviti than they are of good humour the first alway run into harsh sever and the latter into an aukard buffooneri and thu between anger and pleasur
