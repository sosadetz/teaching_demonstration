to remark that willoughbi knew not a syllabl of what he wa say and the latter had realli acquir such a habit of inattent to those subject about which hi uncl parad that he not unfrequ had in appear assent to plan rel to hi fortun and hi resid after hi marriag when in realiti he had not on the discours to which he seem to listen form ani one idea a few day onli pass in thi manner after the return of the castlenorth to england befor the extrem pain he felt the second time of see celestina in public made him sensibl of hi inabl to continu long in thi undecid and wretch state from mere acquiesc in miseri or rather from an hope to escap from it by detect ladi castlenorth scheme he had becom insens more deepli entangl in them and he now began to accus himself of veri unjustifi conduct sinc not all the distress circumst of hi fortun not the certainti of celestina be lost to him nor the pleasur of save hi patern estat and particularli alveston which after celestina had alway been hi first object could on a strict examin of hi own heart lead him to form a seriou wish of becom the husband of miss fitzhayman and he wa consciou that everi part of hi behavior that had rais contrari expect wa owe rather to hi despair of obtain one woman than to hi wish of be unit to anoth hi mind wa now in such a state of continu debat and perplex that noth had the power a moment to amus or pleas him hi sister without an heart herself had no notion of the corros sensat that prey on hi hi health though far from be restor wa such as no longer offer her ani prospect of becom the heiress to what famili

and her daughter wa long sinc loft in the more inveter dislik she had conceiv against celestina sinc she had been so much seen in good compani in london and so much celebr for her beauti she alway therefor affect to consid hi marriag with miss fitzhayman as a settl thing and from the moment of the castlenorth return to england she join with more zeal than her selfish indol usual permit her to feel for ani thing in promot it thu beset by hi famili and on the other hand harrass by the increas clamour of hi creditor who offer him onli the fad altern of fell alveston and whose impati wa foment by the art manag of ladi castlenorth willoughbi for some littl time linger and hesit now thought that he ought to marri when such advantag were to be acquir by it now recoil from the dread idea of pass hi life with a woman who wa indiffer to him and whom he doubt whether he could ever learn to love even in the symptom of her regard for him which were unequivoc enough there wa someth which rather disgust than flatter him and when he thought how differ were their mind their timper and their pursuit no earthli consider seem to have suffici weight with him to make him resolv on put on a yoke so uneasi to hi imagin the repeat sight of celestina made all hi wound bleed afresh he found that neither the suspicion of their relationship or what he thought the certainti of her alien from him were strong enough to counteract the effect of the long root affect he felt for her but he believ that if those suspicion onc amount to a certainti if onc he wa thoroughli convinc celestina wa hi sister he should learn to conquer everi other sentiment in regard to her but what he might with honor indulg for thi reason and becaus he found some satisfact in the delay thi journey would give him a pretens for and thought that mere chang of place would afford him some relief he determin to set out in search of that servant hannah bisco to whom he had obtain a direct in itali and whom he had been detain from visit partli by hi ill state of health and partli by the artific of ladi molyneux after she and ladi castlenorth had met howev her opposit to thi journey wa withdrawn and he set out on horseback attend onli by hi old servant farnham intend to reach the villag to which he wa direct and which wa on the border of lancashir by easi journi miss fitzhayman to whom he had said that everi consider urg him to a complet develop of the mysteri now that it seem to be in hi power saw him depart with an appear of reluct but willoughbi had seen her ever sinc her arriv in england make parti for public place without him if he happen not to be abl or dispos to go and found that dure hi absenc she would proceed in the same cours of amus and that she and her mother would find no inconveni for want of an escort as they had brought over with them an irish offic who had been in the servic of franc with whom ladi castlenorth had contract an intimaci a few year befor in itali which in their last journey to the contin had been renew and increas in consequ of which captain cavanaugh had accompani them to london where he had apart in the hous and wa becom one of the famili at all place of public resort he attend on ladi castlenorth sat by her at the upper end of the tabl to carv for her and act as a sort of gentleman usher to the mother while he treat the daughter with the most profound rever and respect thi gentleman wa three or four and thirti hi face wa handsom and hi figur though larg uncommonli fine he had seen a great deal of servic and of the world spoke all european languag except english well and with all the anim of a frenchman had enough of the nation charact still about him to mark him for an irishman he wa inde suffici proud of hi countri and piqu himself on be descend from the king of leinster and lord castlenorth to whom he contriv to render himself agreeabl by a patient attent to long stori by hi knowledg of genealog by pick up for him old book of heraldri and understand the differ between a pale lozengi and a pale engrail term use in heraldri and affix some import to the enquiri whether one of the quarter of the arm of fitzhayman should in strict be on field argent a boar head coup gule or coup or term use in heraldri lord castlenorth among other doubt on thi and equal import subject with which he amus himself sometim consid whether the genealog of captain cavanaugh might not be trace back in ireland a gener or two beyond hi own in normandi a circumst which excit hi respect and gave in hi opinion weight and valu to those qualiti by which the captain contriv to render himself throughout the famili so veri accept willoughbi had seen him with them onc or twice abroad but had not then particularli notic him among that crowd of all nation and descript which ladi castlenorth contriv to collect around her there he now saw him not without a slight degre of surpris domest in the famili but hi whole attent seem to be given to the elder member of it and he hardli ever spoke to miss fitzhayman who when willoughbi one day took occas to remark that he wa on a foot of greater intimaci than formerli answer with someth like a careless sneer oh you know that cavanaugh ha long been my mother great favorit in the societi of london howev thi intimaci becam the subject of some malici comment and ladi molyneux who seldom let ani thing of that sort escap her could not forbear indulg herself in some remark on ladi castlenorth friendship even befor her brother who gave howev so littl attent to what he heard that befor he reach the end of hi first day journey he had forgot that such a person as the captain exist as he would probabl have forgotten ladi castlenorth herself had not the purpos of hi present journey and all the transact of the last twelv month of hi life brought her and the consequ of those transact too forcibl to hi memori while willoughbi wa thu on hi journey the disquiet and unhappi of celestina though she wa compel to appear to conquer them were but littl abat noth in the opinion of ladi horatia contribut so much to wean the mind from indulg sorrow or encourag weak as varieti of compani and continu dissip and in these notwithstand her reluct celestina wa continu engag she now more than ever regret that she had relinquish that plan of life which she had fix upon when first left by the death of mr willoughbi to seek a new one the quiet farm hous in devonshir where cathcatt and jessi live the tender attent she should be there sure to meet with the not unpleas melancholi of mr elphinston and the perfect seclus she might there enjoy from a world where noth gave her ani real pleasur were idea which were now alway return to her mind with new power there she thought her sad heart might be laid open to the piti sympathi of her first and most belov friend and find some satisfact amidst it is own disappoint in wit the happi of that friend to which she had been so greatli instrument and there she might wander whole day among the field and cops indulg herself in repeat the name of willoughbi in think of him in read again those book they had read togeth paint the plant he admir and compos melancholi vers which abov everi other occup sooth her mind but when she had repres to herself all the mourn pleasur she should in such a situat enjoy and half determin to gratifi herself the ingratitud of which she should be guilti toward ladi horatia destroy her resolv and ala she recollect too that at the farm of jessi she saw from almost everi field and from some of the window of the hous alveston park where miss fitzhayman would soon be mistress the sight she thought she could not bear and her mind turn with terror from the idea of it there were also veri strong object against

declar repeat so strongli serv but to inflam those passion which celestina hope it would repress and piqu hi pride without destroy what he call love he walk backward and forward in the room a moment or two and seem to be reason with that extravag warmth of temper she had complain of but hi eye and hi manner express plainli what he forbor to utter after a while he appear to have conquer the inclin he felt to give way to the rage that possess him and sit down by her he soften hi voic as much as he could though it trembl through the varieti of emot he felt and endeavor to speak calmli while he said celestina if thi be realli the case if i may ventur to believ you you will not sure refus to satisfi me a littl farther i am not a vain coxcomb but i know that neither my figur or my understand

as would inevit make me unhappi and know that it would be extrem folli were ani advantag which affluenc can offer to induc me to risk it my moral cri vavasour again my moral and pray what part of what you are pleas to call my moral is it that give you so much offens all answer she your manner of life your attach your connect which you have just acknowledg you could not without hesit and reluct quit

afraid recov if her ill is occas by her fear of lose you sir said celestina remov at onc the caus of it by think of me no more if you love her as much as you express sure thi can not be difficult and whi feel thi attach to a person whom you think so deserv of it should you contrari to the dictat of reason pursu one who never can return the good opinion you entertain of her becaus of my moral ridicul cant and falsehood dont i know that women all like the veri libertin they are pleas outwardli to condemn dont i know that the proudest the most prudish among ye are flatter by the attent of those men who are call the greatest rake and that if ani queer fellow set up to be a moral man ye all laugh at and despis him thi sort of stuff about moral you have learn i suppos either from old parson thorold or thi good motherli gentlewoman you live with but you who have so much sens can not serious persist in such methodist cant and as to ani object about emili dont mistak me mr vavasour i made no mention of her in the way of object well then cri he interrupt her as to my moral in everi other respect they are realli exemplari i play compar veri littl i dont drink a fifth part so much as half the peopl i live with and i reckon myself upon the whole a veri orderli sober fellow by comparison onli said celestina half smile at hi way of make out the account aye by comparison everi thing in thi world is you know good or bad onli by comparison come come celestina i wa will enough to allow for your prepossess in favor of georg willoughbi but to ani other i can not i will not submit nor will i allow ani thing to thi damn pruderi i know myself worthi of you highli as i think of you ye i deserv you if it be onli for my persev love and by all that is good i will not be deni you realli will sir repli celestina who more and more distress by hi persever desir to put an end to it for ever if possibl you realli will for i protest to you that i never can give ani other answer than i have alreadi given and i beg i entreat that you will desist from a pursuit that can produc for you onli mortif may perdit seiz me if i do return he with renew vehem no if i perish in the attempt i will persever he wa proceed in thi strain when ladi horatia sent to let celestina know she wait for her to go out and she took the opportun of hasten away glad to be reliev from a convers so distress while vavasour find all attempt to detain her ineffectu left the hous in one of those paroxysm of passion which disappoint from hi have never been use to submit to it alway produc chapter ii it would be difficult to say whether willoughbi wander and solitari among the remot villag of yorkshir or celestina surround in london by what the world call pleasur and amus wa the most intern wretch celestina last dialogu with vavasour had convinc her that willoughbi no longer thought of her even with that degre of friendship and tender which he had so often assur her noth should destroy he wa gone out of town mere to prepar for hi marriag and gone without deign either to see her or answer the letter she had written to him there wa in such conduct so much unkind and inhuman that she began to hope her reflect on it would by degre abat the anguish she now felt and she listen to ladi horatia who continu spoke of it as an unequivoc proof of willoughbi want of an heart capabl of a gener and steadi attach to montagu thorold howev who now again return to town after an absenc on busi of some littl time she could not listen with so much complac as her friend wish and she repeatedli told him that the greatest oblig he could confer upon her would be to desist from talk to her of love the certainti howev there now seem to be that willoughbi no longer consid himself as interest about her her posit reject of mr vavasour and the encourag given him by ladi horatia to persever brought him continu to the hous where their morn parti of read recommenc and whenev they went out of an even montagu thorold wa their attend thu drink intox draught of love and indulg hope that it would final be success willoughbi now found without difficulti the person he sought and whether it wa that she had her lesson more complet or wa permit to speak plainer of what she knew she answer all hi enquiri in such a way as serv to perplex but not entir to affirm the question whether celestina wa hi mother daughter the woman wa in her mind and idea one of the lowest of the vulgar yet her simplic seem to be affect and all the proof which had been talk of did not amount to her declar that she wa present at the birth of celestina or could produc ani posit evid of it she spoke princip to the time when she said the littl girl wa at nurs at kensington of which she relat a great mani particular that stagger willoughbi more than ever without convinc him yet all the woman said though it wa consist had the air of have been learn by rote and there wa about her a sort of guard cun which seem to have been acquir or at least improv by long practic willoughbi attempt to discov whether she had not receiv money from ladi castlenorth and to find what were her present mean of subsist but for these enquiri also she seem prepar and gave at least a plausibl account of a legaci left her by a great uncl that enabl her to live without servitud in her nativ countri where she board with a relat and affect great pieti and sanctiti she bless god she said that she scorn for the lucr of gain to beli ani one dead or aliv much more her good mistress who wa gone but truth wa truth and she hope by the help of god alway to speak it plain and direct without fee or reward and as for ladi castlenorth ad she whom your honor think ha paid me for speak of thi thing pray consid your honor wherein it could be use to my ladi to put me upon say a falsiti if i wa base enough to take money of my ladi for it which to be certain i never did for what would that be as your honor well know but sell my immort soul and what good as i may say would all the gold and diamond in the world do me if my preciou soul wa to perish becaus of them thi cant to which willoughbi listen with continu patienc made him hope that he should in some instanc or other detect her of inconsist but though he saw her repeatedli and set farnham to watch her still more narrowli and to talk the matter over with her as if in confid she wa alway so guard that no contradict could be discov and after wait near a week at the villag willoughbi wa compel to give up everi idea of certainli come at the truth and to return toward london without be posit sure that celestina wa so nearli relat to him yet forc to allow that he could not in contradict to all he had heard of a child nurs in secret at kensington bring ani sort of evid on which he ought to reli that she wa not so sick at heart and feel too sensibl that all hi futur life must be unhappi hi mind sunk in total despond too certain it wa that under such circumst he could not think of marri celestina yet he wa unhappili consciou that he could not bear to think of her marri anoth it wa in vain he accus himself of someth wors than folli the moment hi mind dwelt on that subject he found that folli irresist and while he determin that one of the first thing he would do on hi return should be to make a provis for celestina out of hi remain fortun he sicken in recollect that such a provis would probabl but facilit her marriag with montagu thorold and of montagu thorold he could not think with patienc of hi own situat in regard to the famili of fitzhayman he thought with equal bitter he wa but too consciou that to obtain the inform he want from hannah bisco which he had flatter himself would turn out veri differ he had renew hi attend at the hous of hi uncl and act disingenu and unlik himself howev indiffer or avers he wa to hi cousin hi honor forbad him ani longer to trifl with those sentiment which she evid entertain in hi favor what then should he do thi question came continu befor him and wa continu debat without hi be abl to form ani resolut on which he could for a moment rest without pain he sometim thought that sinc in lose the onli woman whom he could love he had lost all that could render hi life happi it wa immateri what becam of him and that sinc he must be miser it might as well be in follow as in fli from what he still thought wa in some degre a duti complet the engag he had made to hi mother on her death bed in do thi he should gratifi all hi surviv relat and retriev hi estat which he must otherwis sell as the mortgag upon it were rapidli devour it and to do thi wa as he sometim tri to persuad himself to pay a debt he owe hi ancestor he had been educ by hi mother in high idea of the consequ and respect not onli of her famili but of that of hi father but of these prejudic hi natur good sens had suffer veri littl to remain so that if he now endeavor to recal them in support of those argument which he ran over in favor of hi marriag hi understand immedi revolt against them i shall notonli retriev said he but augment my fortun not onli save alveston but add to my present estat the famili possess of my mother which will otherwis becom the properti of stranger the honor too so long inherit by her ancestor will be mine he frequent made effort to fix hi mind on these advantag but the moment he began serious to investig
