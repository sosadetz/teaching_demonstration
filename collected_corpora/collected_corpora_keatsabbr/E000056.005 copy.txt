constitut improprieti in their take ani posit agenc in the work the answer given wa that the resolut of congress in febi had recommend the convent as the best mean of obtain a firm nation govern that as the power of the convent were defin by their commiss in nearli the same term with the power of congress given by the confeder on the subject of alter congress were not more restrain from acced to the new plan than the convent were from propos it if the plan wa within the power of the convent it wa within those of congress if beyond those power the same necess which justifi the convent would justifi congress and a failur of congress to concur in what wa done would impli either that the convent had done wrong in exceed their power or that the govern propos wa in itself liabl to insuper object that such an infer would be the more natur as congress had never scrupl to recommend measur foreign to their constitut function whenev the public good seem to requir it and had in sever instanc particularli in the establish of the new western govern exercis assum power of a veri high delic natur under motiv infinit less urgent than the present state of our affair if ani faith were due to the

contend that congress had an undoubt right to insert amend and that it wa their duti to make use of it in a case where the essenti guard of liberti had been omit on the other side the right of congress wa not deni but the inexpedi of exert it wa urg on the follow grounds— that everi circumst indic that the introduct of congress as a parti to the reform wa intend by the state mere as a matter of form and respect that it wa evid from the contradictori object which had been express by the differ member who had animadvert on the plan that a discuss of it merit would consum much time without produc agreement even among it adversari that it wa clearli the intent of the state that the plan to be propos should be the act of the convent with the assent of congress which could not be the case if alter were made the convent be no longer in exist to adopt them that as the act of the convent when alter would instantli becom the mere act of congress and must be propos by them as such and of cours be address to the legislatur not convent of the state and requir the ratif of thirteen instead of nine state and as the unalt act would go forth to the state directli from the convent under the auspic of that body—som state might ratifi the one some the other of the plan and confus disappoint be the least evil that would ensu these difficulti which at one time threaten a seriou

with which is a copi of col mason object to the work of the convent as he persist in the temper which produc hi dissent it is no small satisfact to find him reduc to such distress for a proper gloss on it for no other consider sure could have led him to dwell on an object which he acknowledg to have been in some degre remov by the convent themselves—on the paltri right of the senat to propos alter in money bills—on the appoint of the vice presid presid of the senat instead of make the presid of the senat the vice presid which seem to be the alternative—and on the possibl that congress may misconstru their power betray their trust so far as to grant monopoli in trade c— if i do not forget too some of hi other reason were either not at all or veri faintli urg at the time when alon they ought to have been urg such as the power of the senat in the case of treati of impeach and their durat in offic with respect to the latter point i recollect well that he more than onc disclaim opposit to it my memori fail me also if he did not acquiesc in if not vote for the term allow for the further import of slave and the prohibit of duti on export by the state what he mean by the danger tendenc of the judiciari i am at some loss to comprehend it wa never intend nor can it be suppos that in ordinari case the inferior tribun will not have final jurisdict in order to prevent the evil of which he complain the great mass of suit in everi state lie between citizen citizen and relat to matter not of feder cogniz notwithstand the stress laid on the necess of a council to the presid i strongli suspect tho i wa a friend to the thing that if such an one as col mason propos had been establish and the power of the senat in appoint to offic transfer to it that as great a clamour would have been heard from some quarter which in gener echo hi object what can he mean by say that the common law is not secur by the new constitut though it ha been adopt by the state constitut the common law is noth more than the unwritten law and is left by all constitut equal liabl to legisl alter i am not sure that ani notic is particularli taken of it in the constitut of the state if there is noth more is provid than a gener declar that it shall continu along with other branch of law to be in forc till legal chang the constitut of virga drawn up by col mason himself is absolut silent on the subject an ordin pass dure the same session declar the common law as heretofor all statut of prior date to the of jame i to be still the law of the land mere to obviat pretext that the separ from g britain

the convent have done if they had in gener term declar the common law to be in forc they would have broken in upon the legal code of everi state in the most materi point they wd have done more they would have brought over from g b a thousand heterogen antirepublican doctrin and even the ecclesiast hierarchi itself for that is a part of the common law if they had undertaken a discrimin they would have form a digest of law instead of a constitut thi object sure wa not brought forward in the convent or it wd have been place in such a light that a repetit of it out of door would scarc have been hazard were it allow the weight which col m may suppos it deserv it would remain to be decid whether it be candid to arraign the convent for omiss which were never suggest to them—or prudent to vindic the dissent by reason which either were not previous thought of or must have been wil conceal but i am run into a comment as prolix as it is out of place i find by a letter from the chancellor mr

seven year for exampl with a subsequ perpetu inelig or a short term with a capac to be reelect should be fix in favor of the first opinion were urg the danger of a gradual degeneraci of reelect from time to time into first a life and then a hereditari tenur and the favor effect of an incapac to be reappoint on the independ exercis of the execut author on the other side it wa contend that the prospect of necessari degrad would discourag the most dignifi charact from aspir to the offic would take away the princip motiv to ye faith discharg of it duties—th hope of be reward with a reappoint would stimul ambit to violent effort for hold over the constitut term—and instead of produc an independ administr and a firmer defenc of the constitut right of the depart would render the offic more indiffer to the import of a place which he would soon be oblig to quit forev and more readi to yield to the encroachmt of the legislatur of which he might again be a member the question concern the degre of power turn chiefli on the appoint to offic and the controul on the legislatur an absolut appoint to all offices—to some offices—to no offic form the scale of opinion on the first point on the

on the subject such a check on the state appear to me necessari to prevent encroach on the gener author to prevent instabl and injustic in the legisl of the state without such a check in the whole over the part our system involv the evil of imperia in imperio if a compleat supremaci somewher is not necessari in everi societi a controul power at least is so by which the gener author may be defend against encroach of the subordin author and by which the latter may be restrain from encroach on each other if the supremaci of the british parliament is not necessari as ha been contend for the harmoni of that empir it is evid i think that without the royal neg or some equival controul the uniti of the system would be destroy the want of some such provis seem to have been mortal to the antient confederaci and to be the diseas of the modern of the lycian confederaci littl is known that of the amphyct is well known to have been render of littl use whilst it last and in the end to have been destroy by the predomin of the local over the feder author the same observ may be made on the author of polybiu with regard to the achæan leagu the helvet system scarc amount to a confederaci and is disguish by too mani peculiar to be a ground of comparison the case of the unit netherland is in point the author of a stadthold the influenc of a stand armi the common interest in the conquer possess the pressur of surround danger the guarante of foreign power are not suffici to secur the author and interest of the gener agst the antifeder tendenc of the provinci sovereignti the german

formid nation have been found unabl either to maintain the subordin of the member or to prevent their mutual contest encroach still more to the purpos is our own experi both dure the war and sinc the peac encroach of the state on the gener author sacrific of nation to local interest interfer of the measur of differ state form a great part of the histori of our polit system it may be said that the new constitut is found on differ principl and will have a differ oper i admit the differ to be materi it present the aspect rather of a feudal system of republ if such a phrase may be use than of a confederaci of independ state and what ha been the progress and event of the feudal constitut in all of them a continu struggl between the head and the inferior member until a final victori ha been gain in some instanc by one in other by the other of them in one respect inde there is a remark varianc between the two case in the feudal system the sovereign though limit wa independ and have no particular sympathi of interest with the great baron hi ambit had as full play as their in the mutual project of usurp in the american constitut the gener author will be deriv entir from the subordin author the senat will repres the state in their polit capac the other hous will repres the peopl of the state in their individu capactildey the former will be account to their constitu at moder the latter at short period the presid also deriv hi appoint from the state and is period account to them thi depend of the gener on the local author seem effectu to guard the latter against ani danger encroach of the former whilst the latter within their respect limit will be continu sensibl of the abridg of their power and be stimul by ambit to resum the surrend portion of it we find the repres of counti and corpor in the legislatur of the state much more dispos to sacrific the aggreg interest and even author to the local view of their constitu than the latter to the former i mean not by these remark to insinu that an esprit de corp will not exist in the nation govern or that opportun may not occur of extend it jurisdict in some point i mean onli that the danger of encroach is much greater from the other side and that the imposs of divid power of legisl in such a manner as to be free from differ construct by differ interest or even from ambigu in the judgment of the imparti requir some such expedi as i contend for mani illustr might be given of thi imposs how long ha it taken to fix and how imperfectli is yet fix the legisl power of corpor though that power is subordin in the most compleat manner the line of distinct between the power of regul trade and that of draw revenu from it which wa onc consid the barrier of our liberti wa found on fair discuss to be absolut undefin no distinct seem to be more obviou than that between spiritu and tempor matter yet wherev they have been made object of legisl they have clash and contend with each other till one or the other ha gain the supremaci even the boundari between the execut legisl judiciari power though in gener so strongli mark in themselv consist in mani instanc of mere shade of differ it may be said that the judici author under our new system will keep the state within their proper limit and suppli the place of a neg on their law the answer is that it is more conveni to prevent the passag of a law than to declar it void after it is pass that thi will be particularli the case where the law aggriev individu who may be unabl to support an appeal agst a state to the suprem judiciari that a state which would violat the legisl right of the union would not be veri readi to obey a judici decre in support of them and that a recurr to forc which in the event of disobedi would be necessari is an evil which the new constitut meant to exclud as far as possibl a constitut neg on the law of the state seem equal necessari to secur individu agst encroach on their right the mutabl of the law of the state is found to be a seriou evil the injustic of them ha been so frequent and so flagrant as to alarm the most stedfast friend of republican i am persuad i do not err in say that the evil issu from these sourc contribut more to that uneasi which produc the convent and prepar the public mind for a gener reform than those which accru to our nation charact and interest from the inadequaci of the confeder to it immedi object a reform therefor which doe not make provis for privat right must be materi defect the restraint agst paper emiss and violat of contract are not suffici suppos them to be effectu as far as they go they are short of the mark injustic may be effect by such an infinitud of legisl expedi that where the disposit exist it can onli be controul by some provis which reach all case whatsoev the partial provis made suppos the disposit which will evad it it may be ask how privat right will be more secur under the guardianship of the gener govern than under the state govern sinc they are both found on the republican principl which refer the ultim decis to the will of the major and are distinguish rather by the extent within which they will oper than by ani materi differ in their structur a full discuss of thi question would if i mistak not unfold the true principl of republican govern and prove in contradict to the concurr opinion of the theoret writer that thi form of govern in order to effect it purpos must oper not within a small but an extens sphere i will state some of the idea which have occur to me on the subject those who contend for a simpl democraci or a pure republ actuat by the sens of the major and oper within narrow limit assum or suppos a case which is altogeth fictiti they found their reason on the idea that the peopl compos the societi enjoy not onli an equal of polit right but that they have all precis the same interest and the same feel in everi respect were thi in realiti the case their reason would be conclus the interest of the major would be that of the minor also the decis could onli turn on mere opinion concern the good of the whole of which the major voic would be the safest criterion and within a small sphere thi voic could be most easili collect and the public affair most accur manag we know howev that no societi ever did or can consist of so homogen a mass of citizen in the savag state inde an approach is made toward it but in that state littl or no govern is necessari in all civil societi distinct are variou and unavoid a distinct of properti result from that veri protect which a free govern give to unequ faculti of acquir it there will be rich and poor creditor and debtor a land interest a moni interest a mercantil interest a manufactur interest these class may again be subdivid accord to the differ product of differ situat soil accord to differ branch of commerc and of manufactur in addit to these natur distinct artifici one will be found on accident differ in polit religi or other opinion or an attach to the person of lead individu howev erron or ridicul these ground of dissent and faction may appear to the enlighten statesman or the benevol philosoph the bulk of mankind who are neither statesmen nor philosoph will continu to view them in a differ light it remain then to be enquir whether a major have ani common interest or feel ani common passion will find suffici motiv to restrain them from oppress the minor an individu is never allow to be a judg or even a wit in hi own caus if two individu are under the bia of interest or enmiti agst a third the right of the latter could never be safe refer to the major of the three will two thousand individu be less apt to oppress one thousand or two hundr thousand one hundr thousand three motiv onli can restrain in such case a prudent regard to privat or partial good as essenti involv in the gener and perman good of the whole thi ought no doubt to be suffici of itself experi howev shew that it ha littl effect on individu and perhap still less on a collect of individu and least of all on a major with the public author in their hand if the former are readi to forget that honesti is the best polici the last do more they often proceed on the convers of the maxim that whatev is polit is honest respect for charact thi motiv is not found suffici to restrain individu from injustic and lose it efficaci in proport to the number which is to

notwithstand take the oath a previou test could have no effect he would subscrib it as he would take the oath without ani principl that could be affect by either i find by a letter from mr dawson that the propos constitut is receiv by the assembl with a more prompt gener approb than could well have been expect the exampl of virginia will have great weight and the more so as the disagr of the deput will give it more the appear of be the unbiass express of the public mind it would be truli mortifi if anyth should occur to prevent or retard the concurr of a state which ha gener taken the lead on great occas and it would be the more so in thi case as it is gener believ that nine of the state at least will embrac the plan and consequ that the tardi remaind must be reduc to the dilemma of either shift for themselv or come in without ani credit for it there is reason to believ that the eastern state r island except will be among the foremost in adopt the system no particular inform is yet

opinion on so interest a subject among men of equal integr discern is at onc a melancholi proof of the fallibl of the human judgement and of the imperfect progress yet made in the scienc of govern noth is more common here and i presum the case must be the same with you than to see compani of intellig peopl equal divid and equal earnest in maintain on one side that the gener govern will overwhelm the state govern and on the other hand that it will be a prey to their encroach on one side that the structur of the govern is too firm too strong and on the other that it partak too much of the weak instabl of the govern of the particular state what is the proper conclus from all thi that unanim is not to be expect in ani great polit question that the danger is probabl exagger on each side when an opposit danger is concern on the opposit side that if ani constitut is to be establish by deliber choic it must be examin with mani allow and must be compar not with the theori which each individu may frame in hi own mind but with the system which it is meant to take the place of and with ani other which there might be a possibl of obtain i can not judg so well as yourself of the proprieti of mix with an adopt of the feder constitut a revis of that of the state if the latter could be effect without risk or inconveni of the former it is no doubt desir the practic of thi will depend upon the unanim with which it could be undertaken i should doubt extrem whether the experi could safe be made might not the blend of those two thing togeth unit those who are unfriendli to

some influenc by prove the practic safeti of such experi and if the convent think fit they may lay a proper train of themselv for bring the matter about the public mind in thi quarter seem not final
