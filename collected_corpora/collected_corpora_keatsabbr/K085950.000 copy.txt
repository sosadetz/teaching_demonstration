stoneg york mdcclxxv memoir of the life and write of mr gray section the first the live of men of letter seldom abound with incid and perhap no life ever afford fewer than that which i have undertaken to write but i am far from mention thi by way of previou apolog as is the trite custom of biograph the respect which i owe to my deceas friend to the public and let me add to myself prompt me to wave so impertin a ceremoni a reader of sens and tast never expect to find in the memoir of a philosoph or poet the same speci of entertain or inform which he would receiv from those of a statesman or gener he expect howev to be either inform or entertain nor would he be disappoint did the writer take care to dwell princip on such topic as character the man and distinguish that peculiar part which he act in the vari drama of societi but thi rule selfevid right as it may seem is seldom observ it wa said with almost as much truth as wit of one of these writer that when he compos the life of lord verulam he forgot that he wa a philosoph and therefor it wa to be fear should he finish that of the duke of marlborough he would forget that he wa a gener i shall avoid a like fault i will promis my reader that he shall in the follow page seldom behold mr gray in ani other light than that of a scholar and a poet and though i am more solicit to show that he wa a virtuou a friendli and an amiabl man than either yet thi solicitud becom unnecessari from the veri paper which he ha bequeath me and which i here arrang for the purpos sinc in these the qualiti of hi head and heart so constantli appear togeth and the fertil of hi fanci so intim unit with the sympathet tender of hi soul that were it in my intent i should find it imposs to disjoin them hi parent were reput citizen of london hi grandfath a consider merchant but hi father mr philip gray though he also follow busi wa of an indol and reserv temper and therefor rather diminish than increas hi patern fortun he had mani children of whom thoma the subject of these memoir wa the fifth born all of them except him die in their infanc and i have been told that he narrowli escap suffoc owe to too great a full of blood which destroy the rest and would certainli have been cut off as earli had not hi mother with a courag remark for one of her sex and withal so veri tender a parent ventur to open a vein with her own hand which instantli remov the paroxysm he wa born in cornhil decemb the th wa educ at eton school under the care of mr antrobu hi mother brother who wa at that time one of the assist master from thenc he remov to st peter colleg cambridg where he wa admit a pension in the year while at school he contract a friendship with mr horac walpol and mr richard west the former of these appear at present with too much distinct in the literari as well as fashion world to make it necessari i should enlarg upon hi subject but as the latter die befor he could exert hi uncommon abil it seem requisit to premis somewhat concern him especi as almost everi anecdot which i have to produc concern the juvenil part of mr gray life is includ in hi correspond with thi gentleman a correspond which continu with veri littl interrupt for the space of about eight year from the time of their leav school to the death of the accomplish youth in question hi father wa lord chancellor of ireland hi grandfath by the mother the famou bishop burnet he remov from eton to oxford about the same time that mr gray left that place for cambridg each of them carri with him the reput of an excel classic scholar though i have been told that at the time mr west geniu wa reckon the more brilliant of the two a judgment which i conceiv wa not well found for though mr west part of that correspond which i shall speedili give the reader i am well awar that i am here go to do a thing which the cautiou and courtli dr sprat were he now aliv would highli censur he had it seem a larg collect of hi friend mr cowley letter a way of write in which he peculiarli excel as in these he alway express the nativ tender and innoc gaieti of hi heart yet the doctor wa of opinion that noth of thi natur should be publish and that the letter that pass between particular friend if they are written as they ought to be can scarc ever be fit to see the light what not when they express the nativ tender and innoc gaieti of a heart like mr cowley no by no mean for in such letter the soul of men appear undrest and in that neglig habit they may be fit to be seen by one or two in a chamber but not to go abroad in the street see life of cowley page hurd edit such reader as believ it incumb on everi wellbr soul never to appear but in full dress will think that dr sprat ha reason on hi side but i suspect that the gener will notwithstand wish he had been less scrupul delic and lament that the letter in question are not now extant of one thing i am fulli confid that had thi been the case the judici dr hurd would have found hi critic labor much lessen when in pure chariti to thi amiabl writer he late employ himself in separ hi pleas moral from hi point wit will undoubtedli show that he possess veri extraordinari talent yet on mr gray side there seem superad to these such a manli precis of tast and matur of judgment as would induc one to believ mr walpol phrase not veri hyperbol who ha often assert to me that gray never wa a boy in april mr west left christ church for the inner templ and mr gray remov from peterhous to town the latter end of that year intend also to appli himself to the studi of the law in the same societi for which purpos hi father had alreadi either hire or bought him a set of chamber but on an invit which mr walpol gave him to be hi companion in hi travel thi intent wa laid asid for the present and never after put in execut accord to the plan which i have form for arrang these paper a part of the letter which i have alreadi mention will here find their proper place they will give a much clearer idea both of mr gray and hi friend at thi earli period than ani narr of mine they will includ also sever specimen of their juvenil composit and at the same time mark the progress they had made in literatur they will ascertain not onli the scope and turn of their geniu but of their temper in a word mr gray will becom hi own biograph both in thi and the rest of the section into which i divid thi work by which mean and by the assist of a few note which i shall occasion add it may be hope that noth will be omit which may tend to give a regular and clear delin of hi life and charact but as thi is the earliest part of their correspond and includ onli the time which pass between mr gray admiss into the univers and hi go abroad it may be reason expect that the manner rather than the matter of these letter must constitut their princip merit they will therefor be chiefli accept to such ingenu youth who be about the same age have a relish for the same studi and bosom suscept of the same warmth of friendship to these i address them in the pleas hope that they may prompt them to emul their eleg simplic and of cours to studi with more care the classic model from which it wa deriv if they do thi i shall not be much concern if graver reader think them unimport or even trifl letter i mr west to mr gray you use me veri cruelli you have sent me but one letter sinc i have been at oxford and that too agreeabl not to make me sensibl how great my loss is in not have more next to see you is the pleasur of see your handwrit next to hear you is the pleasur of hear from you realli

requir some littl prefac not so much becaus it express mr gray juvenil sentiment concern the mode of our academ educ as that these sentiment prevail with him through life and that he often declar them with so littl reserv as to creat him mani enemi it is certain that at the time when he wa admit and for some year after jacobit and it concomit hard drink prevail still at cambridg much to the prejudic not onli of good manner but of good letter for if thi spirit wa then on the declin it wa not extinguish till after the year but we see as wa natur enough in a young man he laid the blame rather on the mode of educ than the mode of the time and to thi error the uncommon profici he had made at eton in classic learn might contribut as he found himself in a situat where that speci of merit held not the first rank howev thi be it wa necessari not to omit thi featur of hi mind when employ in draw a gener like of it and what color could be found so forcibl as hi own to express it true light and shadow i would further observ that whatev truth there might be in hi satir at the time it wa written it can by no mean affect the present state of the univers there is usual a much
