that all the world exclaimd what magnanim no doubt thi patienc when the world is damn us is philosoph in our former friend t is also pleasant to be deemd magnanim the more so in obtain our own end and what the lawyer call a malu animu conduct like thi by no mean comprehend reveng in person s certainli no virtu but then t is not my fault if other hurt you and if your quarrel should rip up old stori

wa sole heir to a chanceri suit and messuag and land which with a long minor and care promis to turn out well in proper hand inez becam sole guardian which wa fair and answerd but to natur just demand an onli son left with an onli mother is brought up much more wise than anoth sagest of women even of widow she resolv that juan should be quit a paragon and worthi of the noblest pedigre hi sire wa of castil hi dam from aragon then for accomplish of chivalri in case our lord the king should go to war again he learnd the art of ride fenc gunneri and how to scale a fortressor a nunneri but that which donna inez most desir and saw into herself each day befor all the learn tutor whom for him she hire wa that hi breed should be strictli moral much into all hi studi she inquir and so they were submit first to her all art scienc no branch wa made a mysteri to juan eye except natur histori the languag especi the dead the scienc and most of all the abstrus the art at least all such as could be said to be the most remot from common use in all these he wa much and deepli read but not a page of ani thing that s loos or hint continu of the speci wa ever sufferd lest he should grow viciou hi classic studi made a littl puzzl becaus of filthi love of god and goddess who in the earlier age rais a bustl but never put on pantaloon or bodic hi reverend tutor had at time a tussl and for their aeneid iliad and odyssey were forc to make an odd sort of apolog for donna inez dread the mytholog ovid s a rake as half hi vers show him anacreon moral are a still wors sampl catullu scarc ha a decent poem i dont think sappho ode a good exampl although longinu tell us there is no hymn where the sublim soar forth on wing more ampl but virgil song are pure except that horrid one begin with formosum pastor corydon lucretiu irreligion is too strong for earli stomach to prove wholesom food i cant help think juven wa wrong although no doubt hi real intent wa good for speak out so plainli in hi song so much inde as to be downright rude and then what proper person can be partial to all those nauseou epigram of martial juan wa taught from out the best edit expurg by learn men who place judici from out the schoolboy vision the grosser part but fear to defac too much their modest bard by thi omiss and piti sore hi mutil case they onli add them all in an appendix which save in fact the troubl of an index for there we have them all at one fell swoop instead of be scatterd through the page they stand forth marshalld in a handsom troop to meet the ingenu youth of futur age till some less rigid editor shall stoop to call them back into their separ cage instead of stand stare all togeth like garden godsand not so decent either the missal too it wa the famili missal wa ornament in a sort of way which ancient massbook often are and thi all kind of grotesqu illumin and how they who saw those figur on the margin kiss all could turn their optic to the text and pray is more than i knowbut don juan mother kept thi herself and gave her son anoth sermon he read and lectur he endur and homili and live of all the saint to jerom and to chrysostom inur he did not take such studi for restraint but how faith is acquir and then ensur so well not one of the aforesaid paint as saint augustin in hi fine confess which make the reader envi hi transgress thi too wa a seald book to littl juan i cant but say that hi mamma wa right if such an educ wa the true one she scarc trust him from out her sight her maid were old and if she took a new one you might be sure she wa a perfect fright she did thi dure even her husband life i recommend as much to everi wife young juan waxd in goodli and grace at six a charm child and at eleven with all the promis of as fine a face as eer to man matur growth wa given he studi steadili and grew apac and seemd at least in the right road to heaven for half hi day were passd at church the other between hi tutor confessor and mother at six i said he wa a charm child at twelv he wa a fine but quiet boy although in infanc a littl wild they tame him down amongst them to destroy hi natur spirit not in vain they toild at least it seemd so and hi mother joy wa to declar how sage and still and steadi her young philosoph wa grown alreadi i had my doubt perhap i have them still but what i say is neither here nor there i knew hi father well and have some skill in characterbut it would not be fair from sire to son to augur good or ill he and hi wife were an illsort pair but scandal s my aversioni protest against all evil speak even in jest for my part i say nothingnothingbut thi i will saymi reason are my own that if i had an onli son to put to school as god be prais that i have none t is not with donna inez i would shut him up to learn hi catech alon nonoi d send him out betim to colleg for there it wa i pickd up my own knowledg for there one learnst is not for me to boast though i acquiredbut i pass over that as well as all the greek i sinc have lost i say that there s the placebut verbum sat i think i pickd up too as well as most knowledg of mattersbut no matter what i never marriedbut i think i know that son should not be educ so young juan now wa sixteen year of age tall handsom slender but well knit he seemd activ though not so sprightli as a page and everybodi but hi mother deemd him almost man but she flew in a rage and bit her lip for els she might have screamd if ani said so for to be precoci wa in her eye a thing the most atroci amongst her numer acquaint all select for discret and devot there wa the donna julia whom to call pretti were but to give a feebl notion of mani charm in her as natur as sweet to the flower or salt to ocean her zone to venu or hi bow to cupid but thi last simil is trite and stupid the dark of her orient eye accord with her moorish origin her blood wa not all spanish by the by in spain you know thi is a sort of sin when proud granada fell and forc to fli boabdil wept of donna julia kin some went to africa some stayd in spain her greatgreatgrandmamma chose to remain she marri i forget the pedigre with an hidalgo who transmit down hi blood less nobl than such blood should be at such allianc hi sire would frown in that point so precis in each degre that they bred in and in as might be shown marri their cousinsnay their aunt and niec which alway spoil the breed if it increas thi heathenish cross restor the breed again ruind it blood but much improv it flesh for from a root the ugliest in old spain sprung up a branch as beauti as fresh the son no more were short the daughter plain but there s a rumour which i fain would hush t is said that donna julia grandmamma produc her don more heir at love than law howev thi might be the race went on improv still through everi gener until it centr in an onli son who left an onli daughter my narrat may have suggest that thi singl one could be but julia whom on thi occas i shall have much to speak about and she wa marri charm chast and twentythre her eye i m veri fond of handsom eye wa larg and dark suppress half it fire until she spoke then through it soft disguis flashd an express more of pride than ire and love than either and there would aris a someth in them which wa not desir but would have been perhap but for the soul which struggl through and chastend down the whole her glossi hair wa clusterd oer a brow bright with intellig and fair and smooth her eyebrow shape wa like th aerial bow her cheek all purpl with the beam of youth mount at time to a transpar glow as if her vein ran lightn she in sooth possessd an air and grace by no mean common her statur talli hate a dumpi woman wed she wa some year and to a man of fifti and such husband are in plenti and yet i think instead of such a one t were better to have two of fiveandtwenti especi in countri near the sun and now i think on t mi vien in ment ladi even of the most uneasi virtu prefer a spous whose age is short of thirti t is a sad thing i can not choos but say and all the fault of that indec sun who can not leav alon our helpless clay but will keep bake broil burn on that howsoev peopl fast and pray the flesh is frail and so the soul undon what men call gallantri and god adulteri is much more common where the climat s sultri happi the nation of the moral north where all is virtu and the winter season send sin without a rag on shiver forth t wa snow that brought st anthoni to reason where juri cast up what a wife is worth by lay whateer sum in mulct they pleas on the lover who must pay a handsom price becaus it is a market vice alfonso wa the name of julia lord a man well look for hi year and who wa neither much belov nor yet abhorrd they live togeth as most peopl do suffer each other foibl by accord and not exactli either one or two yet he wa jealou though he did not show it for jealousi dislik the world to know it julia wasyet i never could see whi with donna inez quit a favourit friend between their tast there wa small sympathi for not a line had julia ever pennd some peopl whisper but no doubt they lie for malic still imput some privat end that inez had ere don alfonso marriag forgot with him her veri prudent carriag and that still keep up the old connect which time had late renderd much more chast she took hi ladi also in affect and certainli thi cours wa much the best she flatterd julia with her sage protect and compliment don alfonso tast and if she could not who can silenc scandal at least she left it a more slender handl i cant tell whether julia saw the affair with other peopl eye or if her own discoveri made but none could be awar of thi at least no symptom eer wa shown perhap she did not know or did not care indiffer from the first or callou grown i m realli puzzl what to think or say she kept her counsel in so close a way juan she saw and as a pretti child caressd him oftensuch a thing might be quit innoc done and harmless style when she had twenti year and thirteen he but i am not so sure i should have smile when he wa sixteen julia twentythre these few short year make wondrou alter particularli amongst sunburnt nation whateer the caus might be they had becom chang for the dame grew distant the youth shi their look cast down their greet almost dumb and much embarrass in either eye there sure will be littl doubt with some that donna julia knew the reason whi but as for juan he had no more notion than he who never saw the sea of ocean yet julia veri cold still wa kind and tremul gentl her small hand withdrew itself from hi but left behind a littl pressur thrill and so bland and slight so veri slight that to the mind t wa but a doubt but neer magician wand wrought chang with all armida fairi art like what thi light touch left on juan heart and if she met him though she smile no more she lookd a sad sweeter than her smile as if her heart had deeper thought in store she must not own but cherishd more the while for that compress in it burn core even innoc itself ha mani a wile and will not dare to trust itself with truth and love is taught hypocrisi from youth but passion most dissembl yet betray even by it dark as the blackest sky foretel the heaviest tempest it display it work through the vainli guard eye and in whatev aspect it array itself t is still the same hypocrisi cold or anger even disdain or hate are mask it often wear and still too late then there were sigh the deeper for suppress and stolen glanc sweeter for the theft and burn blush though for no transgress trembl when met and restless when left all these are littl prelud to possess of which young passion can not be bereft and mere tend to show how greatli love is embarrassd at first start with a novic poor julia heart wa in an awkward state she felt it go and resolv to make the noblest effort for herself and mate for honour pride religion virtu sake her resolut were most truli great and almost might have made a tarquin quak she prayd the virgin mari for her grace as be the best judg of a ladi case she vowd she never would see juan more and next day paid a visit to hi mother and lookd extrem at the open door which by the virgin grace let in anoth grate she wa and yet a littl sore again it open it can be no other t is sure juan nowno i m afraid that night the virgin wa no further prayd she now determin that a virtuou woman should rather face and overcom temptat that flight wa base and dastardli and no man should ever give her heart the least sensat that is to say a thought beyond the common prefer that we must feel upon occas for peopl who are pleasant than other but then they onli seem so mani brother and even if by chanceand who can tell the devil s so veri slysh should discov that all within wa not so veri well and if still free that such or such a lover might pleas perhap a virtuou wife can quell such thought and be the better when they re over and if the man should ask t is but denial i recommend young ladi to make trial and then there are such thing as love divin bright and immacul unmixd and pure such as the angel think so veri fine and matron who would be no less secur platon perfect just such love as mine thu julia saidand thought so to be sure and so i d have her think were i the man on whom her reveri celesti ran such love is innoc and may exist between young person without ani danger a hand may first and then a lip be kist for my part to such do i m a stranger but hear these freedom form the utmost list of all oer which such love may be a ranger if peopl go beyond t is quit a crime but not my faulti tell them all in time love then but love within it proper limit wa julia innoc determin in young don juan favour and to him it exert might be use on occas and light at too pure a shrine to dim it ether lustr with what sweet persuas he might be taught by love and her togeth i realli dont know what nor julia either fraught with thi fine intent and well fenc in mail of proofher puriti of soul she for the futur of her strength convinc and that her honour wa a rock or mole exceed sage from that hour dispens with ani kind of troublesom control but whether julia to the task wa equal is that which must be mentiond in the sequel her plan she deemd both innoc and feasibl and sure with a stripl of sixteen not scandal fang could fix on much that s seizabl or if they did so satisfi to mean noth but what wa good her breast wa peaceabl a quiet conscienc make one so seren christian have burnt each other quit persuad that all the apostl would have done as they did and if in the mean time her husband die but heaven forbid that such a thought should cross her brain though in a dream and then she sighd never could she surviv that common loss but just suppos that moment should betid i onli say suppos itint no thi should be entr nou for julia thought in french but then the rhyme would go for naught i onli say suppos thi supposit juan be then grown up to man estat would fulli suit a widow of condit even seven year henc it would not be too late and in the interim to pursu thi vision the mischief after all could not be great for he would learn the rudiment of love i mean the seraph way of those abov so much for julia now we ll turn to juan poor littl fellow he had no idea of hi own case and never hit the true one in feel quick as ovid miss medea he puzzl over what he found a new one but not as yet imagin it could be thing quit in cours and not at all alarm which with a littl patienc might grow charm silent and pensiv idl restless slow hi home desert for the lone wood torment with a wound he could not know hi like all deep grief plung in solitud i m fond myself of solitud or so but then i beg it may be understood by solitud i mean a sultan not a hermit with a haram for a grot oh love in such a wilder as thi where transport and secur entwin here is the empir of thi perfect bliss and here thou art a god inde divin the bard i quot from doe not sing amiss with the except of the second line for that same twine transport and secur are twist to a phrase of some obscur the poet meant no doubt and thu appeal to the good sens and sens of mankind the veri thing which everi bodi feel as all have found on trial or may find that no one like to be disturbd at meal or lovei wont say more about entwin or transport as we knew all that befor but beg secur will bolt the door young juan wanderd by the glassi brook think unutter thing he threw himself at length within the leafi nook where the wild branch of the cork forest grew there poet find materi for their book and everi now and then we read them through so that their plan and prosodi are elig unless like wordsworth they prove unintellig he juan and not wordsworth so pursu hi selfcommunion with hi own high soul until hi mighti heart in it great mood had mitig part though not the whole of it diseas he did the best he could with thing not veri subject to control and turnd without perceiv hi condit like coleridg into a metaphysician he thought about himself and the whole earth of man the wonder and of the star and how the deuc they ever could have birth and then he thought of earthquak and of war how mani mile the moon might have in girth of airballoon and of the mani bar to perfect knowledg of the boundless sky and then he thought of donna julia eye in thought like these true wisdom may discern long sublim and aspir high which some are born with but the most part learn to plagu themselv withal they know not whi t wa strang that one so young should thu concern hi brain about the action of the sky if you think t wa philosophi that thi did i cant help think puberti assist he pore upon the leav and on the flower and heard a voic in all the wind and then he thought of woodnymph and immort bower and how the goddess came down
