all the disquisit and experi which would be desir on thi subject i must therefor content myself with a few remark the specif graviti of some human bodi in comparison to that of water ha been examin by mr robinson in our philosoph transact volum l page for the year he assert that fat person with small bone float most easili upon the water the divingbel is accur describ in our transact when i wa a boy i made two oval palett each about ten inch long and six broad with a hole for the thumb in order to retain it fast in the palm of my hand they much resembl a painter palett in swim i push the edg of these forward and i struck the water with their flat surfac as i drew them back i rememb i swam faster by mean of these palett but they fatigu my wrist i also fit to the sole of my feet a kind of sandal but i wa not satisfi with them becaus i observ that the stroke is partli given by the insid of the feet and the ankl and not entir with the sole of the feet we have here waistcoat for swim which are made of doubl sailcloth with small piec of cork quilt in between them i know noth of the scaphandr of m de la chapel i know by experi that it is a great comfort to a swimmer who ha a consider distanc to go to turn himself sometim on hi back and to vari in other respect the mean of procur a progress motion when he is seiz with the cramp in the leg the method of drive it away is to give to the part affect a sudden vigor and violent shock which he may do in the air as he swim on hi back dure the great heat of summer there is no danger in bath howev warm we may be in river which have been thoroughli warm by the sun but to throw one self into cold spring water when the bodi ha been heat by exercis in the sun is an imprud which may prove fatal i onc knew an instanc of four young men who have work at harvest in the heat of the day with a view of refresh themselv plung into a spring of cold water two die upon the spot a third the next morn and the fourth recov with great difficulti a copiou draught of cold water in similar circumst is frequent attend with the same effect in north america the exercis of swim is one of the most healthi and agreeabl in the world after have swam for an hour or two in the even one sleep coolli the whole night even dure the most ardent heat of summer perhap the pore be cleans the insens perspir increas and occas thi cool it is certain that much swim is the mean of stop a diarrhœa and even of produc a constip with respect to those who do not know how to swim or who are affect with a diarrhœa at a season which doe not permit them to use that exercis a warm bath by cleans and purifi the skin is found veri salutari and often effect a radic cure i speak from my own experi frequent repeat and that of other to whom i have recommend thi you will not be displeas if i conclud these hasti remark by inform you that as the ordinari method of swim is reduc to the act of row with the arm and leg and is consequ a labori and fatigu oper when the space of water to be cross is consider there is a method in which a swimmer may pass to a great distanc with much facil by mean of a sail thi discoveri i fortun made by accid and in the follow manner when i wa a boy i amus myself one day with fli a paper kite and approach the bank of a pond which wa near a mile broad i tie the string to a stake and the kite ascend to a veri consider height abov the pond while i wa swim in a littl time be desir of amus myself with my kite and enjoy at the same time the pleasur of swim i return and loos from the stake the string with the littl stick which wa fasten to it went again into the water where i found that lie on my back and hold the stick in my hand i wa drawn along the surfac of the water in a veri agreeabl manner have then engag anoth boy to carri my cloth round the pond to a place which i point out to him on the other side i began to cross the pond with my kite which carri me quit over without the least fatigu and with the greatest pleasur imagin i wa onli oblig occasion to halt a littl in my cours and resist it progress when it appear that by follow too quick i lower the kite too much by do which occasion i made it rise again i have never sinc that time practis thi singular mode of swim though i think it not imposs to cross in thi manner from dover to calai the packetboat howev is still prefer b franklin benjamin franklin juli london john winthrop cccxxxv to john winthrop london juli dear sir— you must need think the time long that your instrument have been in hand sundri circumst have occas the delay mr short who undertook to make the telescop wa long in a bad state of health and much in the countri for the benefit of the air he howev at length finish the materi part that requir hi own hand and wait onli for someth about the mount that wa to have been done by anoth workman when he wa remov by death i have put in my claim to the instrument and shall obtain it from the executor as soon as hi affair can be settl it is now becom much more valuabl than it would have been if he had live as he excel all other in that branch the price agre for wa one hundr pound the equal altitud and transit instrument wa undertaken by mr bird who do all hi work with hi own hand for the sake of greater truth and exact one must have patienc that expect ani thing from him he is so singularli emin in hi way that the commission of longitud have late given him five hundr pound mere to discov and make public hi method of divid instrument i send it you herewith but what ha made him longer in produc your instrument is the great and hasti demand on him from franc and russia and our societi here for instrument to go to differ part of the world for observ the next transit of venu some to be use in siberia some for the observ that go to the south sea some for those that go to hudson bay these are now all complet and mostli gone it be necessari on account of the distanc that they should go thi year to be readi on the spot in time and now he tell me he can finish your and that i shall have it next week possibl he may keep hi word but we are not to wonder if he doe not mr martin when i call to see hi panopticon had not one readi but wa to let me know when he should have one to show me i have not sinc heard from him but will call again mr maskelyn wish much that some of the govern in north america would send an astronom to lake superior to observ thi transit i know no one of them like to have a spirit for such an undertak unless it be the massachusett or that have a person and instrument suitabl he present you one of hi pamphlet which i now send you togeth with two letter from him to me relat to that observ if your health and strength were suffici for such an expedit i should be glad to hear you had taken it possibl you may have an élève that is capabl the fit you out to observ the former transit wa a public act for the benefit of scienc that did your provinc great honor we expect soon a new volum of the transact in which your piec will be print i have not yet got the separ one which i order it is perhap not so extraordinari that unlearn men such as commonli compos our church vestri should not yet be acquaint with and sensibl of the benefit of metal conductor in avert the stroke of lightn and preserv our hous from it violent effect or that they should be still prejud against the use of such conductor when we see how long even philosoph men of extens scienc and great ingenu can hold out against the evid of new knowledg that doe not squar with their preconcept and how long men can retain a practic that is conform to their prejudic and expect a benefit from such practic though constant experi show it inutil a late piec of the abbé nollet print last year in the memoir of the french academi of scienc afford strong instanc of thi for though the veri relat he give of the effect of lightn in sever church and other build show clearli that it wa conduct from one part to anoth by wire gild and other piec of metal that were within or connect with the build yet in the same paper he object to the provid metallin conductor without the build as useless or danger he caution peopl not to ring the church bell dure a thunderstorm lest the lightn in it way to the earth should be conduct down to them by the bellrop which are but bad conductor and yet is against fix metal rod on the outsid of the steepl which are known to be much better conductor and which it would certainli choos to pass in rather than in dri hemp and though for a thousand year past bell have been solemnli consecr by the romish church in expect that the sound of such bless bell would drive away the storm and secur our build from the stroke of lightn and dure so long a period it ha not been found by experi that place within the reach of such bless sound are safer than other where it is never heard but that on the contrari the lightn seem to strike steepl of choic and that at the veri time the bell are ring yet still they continu to bless the new bell and jangl the old one whenev it thunder one would think it wa now time to tri some other trick and our is recommend whatev thi abl philosoph may have been told to the contrari by more than twelv year experi wherein among the great number of hous furnish with iron rod in north america not one so guard ha been materi hurt with lightn and sever have evid been preserv by their mean while a number of hous church barn ship c in differ place unprovid with rod have been struck and greatli damag demolish or burnt probabl the vestri of our english church are not gener well acquaint with these fact otherwis sinc as good protest they have no faith in the bless of bell they would be less excus in not provid thi other secur for their respect church and for the good peopl that may happen to be assembl in them dure a tempest especi as those build from their greater height are more expos to the stroke of lightn than our common dwell i have noth new in the philosoph way to commun to you except what follow when i wa last year in germani i met with a singular kind of glass be a tube about eight inch long half an inch in diamet with a hollow ball of near an inch diamet at one end and one of an inch and a half at the other hermet seal and half fill with water if one end is held in the hand and the other a littl elev abov the level a constant success of larg bubbl proce from the end in the hand to the other end make an appear that puzzl me much till i found that the space not fill with water wa also free from air and either fill with a subtil invis vapor continu rise from the water and extrem rarefi by the least heat at one end and condens again by the least cool at the other or it is the veri fluid of fire itself which part from the hand pervad the glass and by it expans forc depress the water till it can pass between it and the glass and escap to the other end where it get through the glass again into the air i am rather inclin to the first opinion but doubt between the two an ingeni artist here mr nairn mathemat instrumentmak ha made a number of them from mine and improv them for hi are much more sensibl than those i brought from germani i bore a veri small hole through the wainscot in the seat of my window through which a littl cold air constantli enter while the air in the room wa kept warmer by fire daili made in it be winter time i place one of hi glass with the elev end against thi hole and the bubbl from the other end which wa in a warmer situat were continu pass day and night to the no small surpris of even philosoph spectat each bubbl discharg is larger than that from which it proce and yet that is not diminish and by ad itself to the bubbl at the other end the bubbl is not increas which seem veri paradox when the ball at each end are made larg and the connect tube veri small and bent at right angl so that the ball instead of be at the end are brought on the side of the tube and the tube is held so that the ball are abov it the water will be depress in that which is held in the hand and rise in the other as a jet or fountain when it is all in the other it begin to boil as it were by the vapor pass up through it and the instant it begin to boil a sudden cold is felt in the ball held a curiou experi thi first observ and shown by mr nairn there is someth in it similar to the old observ i think mention by aristotl that the bottom of a boil pot is not warm and perhap it may help to explain the fact if inde it be a fact when the water stand at an equal height in both these ball and all at rest if you wet one of the ball by mean of a feather dip in spirit though that spirit is of the same tempera as to heat and cold with the water in the glass yet the cold occas by the evapor of the spirit from the wet ball will so condens the vapor over the water contain in that ball as that the water of the other ball will be press up into it follow by a success of bubbl till the spirit is all dri away perhap the observ on these littl instrument may suggest and be appli to some benefici use it ha been thought that water reduc to vapor by heat wa rarefi onli fourteen thousand time and on thi principl our engin for rais water by fire are said to be construct but if the vapor so much rarefi from water is capabl of be itself still farther rarefi to a boundless degre by the applic of heat to the vessel or part of vessel contain the vapor as at first it is appli to those contain the water perhap a much greater power may be obtain with littl addit expens possibl too the power of easili move water from one end to the other of a movabl beam suspend in the middl like a scalebeam by a small degre of heat may be appli advantag to some other mechan purpos the magic squar and circl i am told have occas a good deal of puzzl among the mathematician here but no one ha desir me to show him my method of dispos the number it seem they wish rather to investig it themselv when i have the pleasur of see you i will commun it with singular esteem and respect i am dear sir your most obedi humbl servant b franklin cccxxxvi petit of the letter

london juli dear son— sinc my last i have receiv your of may th date at amboy which i shall answer particularli by next week packet i purpos now to take notic of that part wherein you say it wa report at philadelphia i wa to be appoint to a certain offic here which my friend all wish but you did not believ it for the reason i had mention instead of my be appoint to a new offic there ha been a motion made to depriv me of that i now hold and i believ for the same reason though that wa not the reason given out viz my be too much of an american but as it came from lord sandwich our new postmastergener who is of the bedford parti and a friend of mr grenvil i have no doubt that the reason he gave out viz my nonresid wa onli the pretenc and that the other wa the true reason especi as it is the practic in mani other instanc to allow the nonresid of american offic who spend their salari here provid care is taken that the busi be done by deputi or otherwis the first notic i had of thi wa from my fast friend mr cooper secretari of the treasuri he desir me by a littl note to call upon him there which i did when he told me that the duke of grafton had mention to him some discours of lord sandwich as if the offic suffer by my absenc and that it would be fit to appoint anoth as i seem constantli to resid in england that mr todd secretari of the postoffic had also been with the duke talk to the same purpos c that the duke wish him mr cooper to mention thi to me and to say to me at the same time that though my go to my post might remov the object yet if i choos rather to resid in england my merit wa such in hi opinion as to entitl me to someth better here and it should not be hi fault if i wa not well provid for i told mr cooper that without have heard ani except had been taken to my resid here i wa realli prepar to return home and expect to be gone in a few week that howev i wa extrem sensibl of the duke good in give me thi intim and veri thank for hi favor disposit toward me that have live long in england and contract a friendship and affect for mani person here it could not but be agreeabl to me to remain among them some time longer if not for the rest of my life and that there wa no nobleman to whom i could from sincer respect for hi great abil and amiabl qualiti so cordial attach myself or to whom i should so willingli be oblig for the provis he mention as to the duke of grafton if hi grace should think i could in ani station where he might place me be servic to him and to the public mr cooper said he wa veri glad to hear i wa still will to remain in england as it agre so perfectli with hi inclin to keep me here wish me to leav my name at the duke of grafton as soon as possibl and to be at the treasuri again the next board day i accordingli call at the duke and left my card and when i went next to the treasuri hi grace not be there mr cooper carri me to lord north chancellor of the exchequ who said veri obligingli after talk of some american affair i am told by mr cooper that you are not unwil to stay with us i hope we shall find some way of make it worth your while i thank hi lordship and said i should stay with pleasur if i could ani way be use to govern he made me a compliment and i took my leav mr cooper carri me away with him to hi countryhous at richmond to dine and stay all night he then told me that mr todd had been again at the duke of grafton and that upon hi mr cooper speak in my behalf mr todd had chang hi style and said i had to be sure a great deal of merit with the offic have by my good manag regul the post in america so as greatli to increas the revenu that he had had great satisfact in correspond with me while i wa there and he believ they never had a better offic c the thursday follow be the birthday i met with mr todd at court he wa veri civil took me with him in hi coach to the king arm in the citi where i had been invit to dine by mr trevor with the gentlemen of the postoffic we had a good deal of chat after dinner between us two in which he told me lord sandwich who wa veri sharp had taken notic of my stay in england and said if one could do the busi whi should there be two on my tell mr todd that i wa go home which i still say to everybodi not know but that what is intim abov may fail of take effect he look blank and seem disconcert a littl which make me think some friend of hi wa to have been vest with my place but thi is surmis onli we part veri good friend that day i receiv anoth note from mr cooper direct me to be at the duke of grafton next morn whose porter had order to let me in i went accordingli and wa immedi admit but hi grace be then engag in some unexpect busi with much condescens and polit made that apolog for hi not discours with me then but wish me to be at the treasuri at twelv the next tuesday i went accordingli when mr cooper told me someth had call the duke into the countri and the board wa put off which wa not known till it wa too late to send me word but wa glad i wa come as he might then fix anoth day for me to go again with him into the countri the day fix wa thursday i return yesterday should have stay till monday but for write by these vessel he assur me the duke ha it at heart to do someth handsom for me sir john pringl who is anxiou for my stay say mr cooper is the honestest man of a courtier that he ever knew and he is persuad they are in earnest to keep me the piec i wrote against smuggl in the chronicl of novemb last and one in april on the labor poor which you will find in the gentleman magazin for that month have been late shown by mr cooper to the chancellor of the exchequ and to the duke who have express themselv much pleas with them i am to be again at the treasuri on tuesday next by appoint of mr cooper thu particular i have been that you may judg of thi affair for my own thought i must tell you that though i did not think fit to declin ani favor so great a man express an inclin to do me becaus at court if one show an unwilling to be oblig it is often constru as a mark of mental hostil and one make an enemi yet so great is my inclin to be at home and at rest that i shall not be sorri if thi busi fall through and i am suffer to retir with my old post nor inde veri sorri if they take that from me too on account of my zeal for america in which some of my friend have hint to me that i have been too open i shall soon be abl i hope by the next packet to give you farther light in the meantim as no one but sir john know of the treati i talk daili of go in the august packet at farthest and when the late georgia appoint of me to be their agent is mention as what may detain me i say i have yet receiv no letter from that assembl acquaint me what their busi may be that i shall probabl hear from them befor that packet sail that if it is extraordinari and of such a natur as to make my stay anoth winter necessari i may possibl stay becaus there would not be time for them to choos anoth but if it is common busi i shall leav it with mr jackson and proceed i do not by the way know how that appoint came about have no acquaint that i can recollect in that countri it ha been mention in the paper some time but i have onli just now receiv a letter from governor wright inform me that he had that day given hi assent to it and express hi desir to correspond with me on all occas say the committe as soon as they could get their paper readi would write to me and acquaint me with their busi we have lost lord clare from the board of trade he took me home from court the sunday befor hi remov that i might dine with him as he said alon and talk over american affair he seem as attent to them as if he wa to continu ever so long he gave me a great deal of flummeri say that though at my examin i answer some of hi question a littl pertli yet he like me from that day for the spirit i show in defenc of my countri and at part after we had drunk a bottl and a half of claret each he hug and kiss me protest he never in hi life met with a man he wa so much in love with thi i write for your amus you see by the natur of thi whole letter that it is to yourself onli it may serv to prepar your mind for ani event that shall happen if mr grenvil come into power again in ani depart respect america i must refus to accept of ani thing that may seem to put me in hi power becaus i apprehend a breach between the two countri and that refus might give offenc so that you see a turn of a die may make a great differ in our affair we may be either promot or discard one or the other seem like soon to be the case but it is hard to divin which i am myself grown so old as to feel much less than formerli the spur of ambit and if it were not for the flatter expect that by be fix here i might more

return of lord hillsborough to the board of trade as first commission retain the titl and power of secretari of state for the coloni thi chang wa veri sudden and unexpect my lord clare took me home from court to dine with him but two day befor say he should be without other compani and want to talk with me on sundri american busi we had accordingli a good deal of convers on our affair in which he seem to interest himself with all the attent that could be suppos in a minist who expect to continu in the manag of them thi wa on sunday and on the tuesday follow he wa remov whether my lord hillsborough administr will be more stabl than other have been for a long time is quit uncertain but as hi inclin are rather favor toward us so far as he think consist with what he suppos the unquestion right of britain i can not but wish it may continu especi as these perpetu mutat prevent the progress of all busi but anoth chang is now talk of that give me great uneasi sever of the bedford parti be now got in it ha been for some time apprehend that they would sooner or later draw their friend mr grenvil in after them it is now said he is to be secretari of state in the room of lord shelburn if thi should take place or if in ani other shape he come again into power i fear hi sentiment of the american and their of him will occas such clash as may be attend with fatal consequ the last account from your part of the world of the combin relat to commerc with thi countri and resolut concern the duti here laid upon it occas much seriou reflect and it is thought the point in disput between the two countri will not fail to come under the consider of parliament earli in next session our friend wonder that i persist in my intent of return thi summer alleg that i might be of

seem rather satisfi with the import of corn a pretti good hay harvest now near over and the prospect of plenti from a fine crop of wheat make the poor more patient in hope of an abat in the price of

and extend a separ interest of britain to the prejudic of even ireland and our own coloni it is from your philosophi onli that the maxim of a contrari and more happi conduct are to be drawn which i

may rememb when you consult me on the occas that i thought youth on both side to be no object inde from the marriag that have fallen under my observ i am rather inclin to think that earli one stand the best chanc of happi the temper and habit of the young are not yet becom so stiff and uncompli as when more advanc in life they form more easili to each other and henc mani occas of disgust are remov and if youth ha less of that prudenc which is necessari to manag a famili yet the parent and elder friend of young marri person are gener at hand to afford their advic which ampli suppli that defect and by earli marriag youth is sooner form to regular and use life and possibl some of those accid or connexion that might have injur the constitut or reput or both are therebi happili prevent particular circumst of particular person may possibl sometim make it prudent to delay enter into that state but in gener when natur ha render our bodi fit for it the presumpt is in natur favor that she ha not judg amiss in make us desir it late marriag are often attend too with thi further inconveni that there is not the same chanc that the parent shall live to see their offspr educ late children say the spanish proverb are earli orphan a melancholi reflect to those whose case it may be with us in america marriag are gener in the morn of life our children are therefor educ and settl in the world by noon and thu our busi be done we have an afternoon and even of cheer leisur to ourselv such as our friend at present enjoy by these earli marriag we are bless with more children and from the mode among us found by natur everi mother suckl and nurs her own child more of them are rais thenc the swift progress of popul among us unparallel in europ in fine i am glad you are marri and congratul you most cordial upon it you are now in the way of becom a use citizen and you have escap the unnatur state of celibaci for life the fate of mani here who never intend it but who have too long postpon the chang of their condit find at length that it is too late to think of it and so live all their live in a situat that greatli lessen a man valu an odd volum of a set of book bear not

will by such conduct stand the best chanc for such consequ i pray god to bless you both be ever your affection friend b franklin cccxlii a scheme for a new alphabet and reform mode of spell with remark and exampl concern the same and an enquiri into it use in a correspond between miss stevenson and dr franklin written in the charact of the alphabet i hope i shall be forgiven for observ that even our present print and written charact are fundament the same the roman print one is certainli the neatest simplest and most legibl of the two but for the sake of eas and rapid in our write it seem we there insert a number of join or termin stroke substitut curv for angl and give the letter a small inclin to which rule even the letter a g r and w are easili reconcil thi will ceas to appear a remark of mere curios if appli to the deciph of foreign correspond but for thi purpos i would add that the french in particular seem to treat the small upstrok in the letter h p and c as proceed origin in an angl from the bottom of the downstrok they therefor begin it with a curv from the bottom and keep it all the way distinct henc form their written r much like our written v thi last letter v they again distinguish by a loop at the bottom which loop they often place where we place an outward curv the remark termin s which they sometim use seem intend for our print s begun from the bottom but from corrupt write invert and put horizont instead of vertic it is rather from bad write than system that their n and m appear like u and w i could go on to speak of the format of written and

is to be observ in all the letter vowel and conson that wherev they are met with or in whatev compani their sound is alway the same it is also intend that there be no superflu letter use in spell that is no letter that is not sound and thi alphabet by six new letter provid that there be no distinct sound in the languag without letter to express them as to the differ between short and long vowel it is natur express by a singl vowel where short a doubl one where long as for mend write mend but for remaind write remeend for did write did but for deed write diid c what in our common alphabet is

uhphon i quick after each other the sound begin uhphon and end ii the true sound of the i is that we now give to e in the word deed keep though a singl vowel appear to be put in the tabl for did and deed equal yet in the remarks—above—th latter is made to requir two is perhap the same doubl of the vowel is meant for name and lane for certainli name is not pronounc as nem in the express nem con

that might be appli with littl variat to did and deed compar as thi is a subject i have never much examin it becom me onli to add that spell may be consid as an analysi of the oper of the organ of speech where each separ letter ha to repres a differ movement and that among these organ of speech we are to enumer the epiglotti and perhap even the lung themselv not mere as furnish air for sound

the desir of the hous to have the measur accomplish by the breviti of the letter which wa occas by the short of their sit and the ful of the instruct of former hous which render much on the subject unnecessari i am much oblig by the particular account of the situat in which thi matter stand no part of it which you wish to be conceal shall transpir you realli judg right should the petit be reject or neglect the crown will never have the like request made by the peopl nor such anoth opportun of resum one of the most benefici govern in america their own welfar will oblig them to court the proprietari favor and should they continu to gratifi the peopl by the lenient measur adopt dure the last year they will place all their confid in them and lose all idea of loyalti or affect to the person where alon they ought to be fix the revenu of our proprietari are immens not much short at thi time of one hundr thousand pound per annum and had they as much polici as money they might easili find mean with their vast treasur so to endear themselv to the peopl as to prevail on them to forget all duti and affect to other as to the peopl pay it never can be done nor is it just they should nor would they ever agre to establish fix salari on governor for the reason you have mention it is truli discourag to a peopl who wish well to the mother countri and by their duti behaviour dure these time of american confus have recommend themselv to the crown to have an applic so honor and benefici to the latter so much neglect would the ministri coolli attend to the matter it would certainli be

own opinion do not imagin that i shall condemn you if you do not follow such advic i shall onli think that from a better acquaint with circumst you form a better judgment of what is fit for you to do now i conceiv with you that —— both from her affect to you and from the long habit of have you with her would realli be miser without you her temper perhap wa never of the best and when that is the case age seldom mend it much of her unhappi must aris from thenc and sinc wrong turn of mind when confirm by time are almost as littl in our power to cure as those of the bodi i think with you that her case is a compassion one if she had through her own imprud brought on herself ani grievou sick i know you would think it your duti to attend and nurs her with filial tender even were your own health to be endang by it your apprehens therefor is right that it may be your duti to live with her though inconsist with your happi and your interest but thi can onli mean present interest and present happi for i think your futur greater and more last interest and happi will aris from the reflect that you have done your duti and from the high rank you will ever hold in the esteem of all that know you for have persev in do that duti under so mani and great discourag my advic then must be that you return to her as soon as the time propos for your visit is expir and that you continu by

is hard but i think you are equal to it not from ani servil of temper but from abund good in the meantim all your friend sensibl of your present uncomfort situat should endeavour to eas your burden by act in concert with you and to give her as mani opportun as possibl of enjoy the pleasur of societi for your sake noth is more apt to sour the temper of age peopl than the apprehens that they are neglect and they are extrem apt to entertain such suspicion it wa therefor that i propos ask her to be of our late parti but your mother dislik it the motion wa drop as some other have been by my too great easi contrari to my judgment not but that i wa sensibl her be with us might have lessen our pleasur but i hope it might have prevent you some pain in fine noth can contribut to true happi that is inconsist with duti nor can a cours of action conform to it be final without an ampl reward for god govern and he is good i pray him to direct you and inde you will never be without hi direct if
