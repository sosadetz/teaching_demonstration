author prefac thi collect of scatter thought and observ ha littl order or continu it wa begun to give pleasur to a good mother who think for herself my first idea wa to write a tract a few page long but i wa carri away by my subject and befor i knew what i wa do my tract had becom a kind of book too larg inde for the matter contain in it but too small for the subject of which it treat for a long time i hesit whether to publish it or not and i have often felt when at work upon it that it is one thing to publish a few pamphlet and anoth to write a book after vain attempt to improv it i have decid that it is my duti to publish it as it stand i consid that public attent requir to be direct to thi subject and even if my own idea are mistaken my time will not have been wast if i stir up other to form right idea a solitari who cast hi write befor the public without ani one to advertis them without ani parti readi to defend them one who doe not even know what is thought and said about those write is at least free from one anxietyâ€”if he is mistaken no one will take hi error for gospel i shall say veri littl about the valu of a good educ nor shall i stop to prove that the customari method of educ is bad thi ha been done again and again and i do not wish to fill my book with thing which everi one know i will mere state that go as far back as you will you will find a continu outcri against the establish method but no attempt to suggest a better the literatur and scienc of our day tend rather to destroy than to build up we find fault after the manner of a master to suggest we must adopt anoth style a style less in accord with the pride of the philosoph in spite of all those book whose onli aim so they say is public util the most use of all art the art of train men is still neglect even after lock book wa written the subject remain almost untouch and i fear that my book will leav it pretti much as it found it we know noth of childhood and with our mistaken notion the further we advanc the further we go astray the wisest writer devot themselv to what a man ought to know without ask what a child is capabl of learn they are alway look for the man in the child without consid what he is befor he becom a man it is to thi studi that i have chiefli devot myself so that if my method is fanci and unsound my observ may still be of servic i may be greatli mistaken as to what ought to be done but i think i have clearli perceiv the materi which is to be work upon begin thu by make a more care studi of your scholar for it is clear that you know noth about them yet if you read thi book with that end in view i think you will find that it is not entir useless with regard to what will be call the systemat portion of the book which is noth more than the cours of natur it is here that the reader will probabl go wrong and no doubt i shall be attack on thi side and perhap my critic may be right you will tell me thi is not so much a treatis on educ as the vision of a dreamer with regard to educ what can i do i have not written about other peopl idea of educ but about my own my thought are not those of other thi reproach ha been brought against me again and again but is it within my power to furnish myself with other eye or to adopt other idea it is within my power to refus to be wed to my own opinion and to refus to think myself wiser than other i can not chang my mind i can distrust myself thi is all i can do and thi i have done if i sometim adopt a confid tone it is not to impress the reader it is to make my mean plain to him whi should i profess to suggest as doubt that which is not a matter of doubt to myself i say just what i think when i freeli express my opinion i have so littl idea of claim author for it that i alway give my reason so that you may weigh and judg them for yourselv but though i would not obstin defend my idea i think it my duti to put them forward for the principl with regard to which i differ from other writer are not matter of indiffer we must know whether they are true or fals for on them depend the happi or the miseri of mankind peopl are alway tell me to make practic suggest you might as well tell me to suggest what peopl are do alreadi or at least to suggest improv which may be incorpor with the wrong method at present in use there are matter with regard to which such a suggest is far more chimer than my own for in such a connect the good is corrupt and the bad is none the better for it i would rather follow exactli the establish method than adopt a better method by halv there would be fewer contradict in the man he can not aim at one and the same time at two differ object father and mother what you desir that you can do may i count on your goodwil there are two thing to be consid with regard to ani scheme in the first place is it good in itself in the second can it be easili put into practic with regard to the first of these it is enough that the scheme should be intellig and feasibl in itself that what is good in it should be adapt to the natur of thing in thi case for exampl that the propos method of educ should be suitabl to man and adapt to the human heart the second consider depend upon certain given condit in particular case these condit are accident and therefor variabl they may vari indefinit thu one kind of educ would be possibl in switzerland and not in franc anoth would be adapt to the middl class but not to the nobil the scheme can be carri out with more or less success accord to a multitud of circumst and it result can onli be determin by it special applic to one countri or anoth to thi class or that now all these particular applic are not essenti to my subject and they form no part of my scheme it is enough for me that wherev men are born into the world my suggest with regard to them may be carri out and when you have made them what i would have them be you have done what is best for them and best for other peopl if i fail to fulfil thi promis no doubt i am to blame but if i fulfil my promis it is your own fault if you ask anyth more of me for i have promis you noth more emil or educ book i god make all thing good man meddl with them and they becom evil he forc one soil to yield the product of anoth one tree to bear anoth fruit he confus and confound time place and natur condit he mutil hi dog hi hors and hi slave he destroy and defac all thing he love all that is deform and monstrou he will have noth as natur made it not even man himself who must learn hi pace like a saddlehors and be shape to hi master tast like the tree in hi garden yet thing would be wors without thi educ and mankind can not be made by halv under exist condit a man left to himself from birth would be more of a monster than the rest prejudic author necess exampl all the social condit into which we are plung would stifl natur in him and put noth in her place she would be like a sapl chanc sown in the midst of the highway bent hither and thither and soon crush by the passersbi tender anxiou mother i appeal to you you can remov thi young tree from the highway and shield it from the crush forc of social convent tend and water it ere it die one day it fruit will reward your care from the outset rais a wall round your child soul anoth may sketch the plan you alon should carri it into execut plant are fashion by cultiv man by educ if a man were born tall and strong hi size and strength would be of no good to him till he had learnt to use them they would even harm him by prevent other from come to hi aid left to himself he would die of want befor he knew hi need we lament the helpless of infanc we fail to perceiv that the race would have perish had not man begun by be a child we are born weak we need strength helpless we need aid foolish we need reason all that we lack at birth all that we need when we come to man estat is the gift of educ thi educ come to us from natur from men or from thing the inner growth of our organ and faculti is the educ of natur the use we learn to make of thi growth is the educ of men what we gain by our experi of our surround is the educ of thing thu we are each taught by three master if their teach conflict the scholar is illeduc and will never be at peac with himself if their teach agre he goe straight to hi goal he live at peac with himself he is welleduc now of these three factor in educ natur is wholli beyond our control thing are onli partli in our power the educ of men is the onli one control by us and even here our power is larg illusori for who can hope to direct everi word and deed of all with whom the child ha to do view as an art the success of educ is almost imposs sinc the essenti condit of success are beyond our control our effort may bring us within sight of the goal but fortun must favour us if we are to reach it what is thi goal as we have just shown it is the goal of natur sinc all three mode of educ must work togeth the two that we can control must follow the lead of that which is beyond our control perhap thi word natur ha too vagu a mean let us tri to defin it natur we are told is mere habit what doe that mean are there not habit form under compuls habit which never stifl natur such for exampl are the habit of plant train horizont the plant keep it artifici shape but the sap ha not chang it cours and ani new growth the plant may make will be vertic it is the same with a man disposit while the condit remain the same habit even the least natur of them hold good but chang the condit habit vanish natur reassert herself educ itself is but habit for are there not peopl who forget or lose their educ and other who keep it whenc come thi differ if the term natur is to be restrict to habit conform to natur we need say no more we are born sensit and from our birth onward we are affect in variou way by our environ as soon as we becom consciou of our sensat we tend to seek or shun the thing that caus them at first becaus they are pleasant or unpleas then becaus they suit us or not and at last becaus of judgment form by mean of the idea of happi and good which reason give us these tendenc gain strength and perman with the growth of reason but hinder by our habit they are more or less warp by our prejudic befor thi chang they are what i call natur within us everyth should therefor be brought into harmoni with these natur tendenc and that might well be if our three mode of educ mere differ from one anoth but what can be done when they conflict when instead of train man for himself you tri to train him for other harmoni becom imposs forc to combat either natur or societi you must make your choic between the man and the citizen you can not train both the smaller social group firmli unit in itself and dwell apart from other tend to withdraw itself from the larger societi everi patriot hate foreign they are onli men and noth to him thi defect is inevit but of littl import the great thing is to be kind to our neighbour among stranger the spartan wa selfish grasp and unjust but unselfish justic and harmoni rule hi home life distrust those cosmopolitan who search out remot duti in their book and neglect those that lie nearest such philosoph will love the tartar to avoid love their neighbour the natur man live for himself he is the unit the whole depend onli on himself and on hi like the citizen is but the numer of a fraction whose valu depend on it denomin hi valu depend upon the whole that is on the commun good social institut are those best fit to make a man unnatur to exchang hi independ for depend to merg the unit in the group so that he no longer regard himself as one but as a part of the whole and is onli consciou of the common life a citizen of rome wa neither caiu nor luciu he wa a roman he ever love hi countri better than hi life the captiv regulu profess himself a carthaginian as a foreign he refus to take hi seat in the senat except at hi master bid he scorn the attempt to save hi life he had hi will and return in triumph to a cruel death there is no great like between regulu and the men of our own day the spartan pedaret present himself for admiss to the council of the three hundr and wa reject he went away rejoic that there were three hundr spartan better than himself i suppos he wa in earnest there is no reason to doubt it that wa a citizen a spartan mother had five son with the armi a helot arriv trembl she ask hi news your five son are slain vile slave wa that what i ask thee we have won the victori she hasten to the templ to render thank to the god that wa a citizen he who would preserv the supremaci of natur feel in social life know not what he ask ever at war with himself hesit between hi wish and hi duti he will be neither a man nor a citizen he will be of no use to himself nor to other he will be a man of our day a frenchman an englishman one of the great middl class to be someth to be himself and alway at one with himself a man must act as he speak must know what cours he ought to take and must follow that cours with vigour and persist when i meet thi miracl it will be time enough to decid whether he is a man or a citizen or how he contriv to be both two conflict type of educ system spring from these conflict aim one is public and common to mani the other privat and domest if you wish to know what is meant by public educ read plato republ those who mere judg book by their titl take thi for a treatis on polit but it is the finest treatis on educ ever written in popular estim the platon institut stand for all that is fanci and unreal for my own part i should have thought the system of lycurgu far more impractic had he mere commit it to write plato onli sought to purg man heart lycurgu turn it from it natur cours the public institut doe not and can not exist for there is neither countri nor patriot the veri word should be struck out of our languag the reason doe not concern us at present so that though i know it i refrain from state it i do not consid our ridicul colleg as public institut nor do i includ under thi head a fashion educ for thi educ face two way at onc achiev noth it is onli fit to turn out hypocrit alway profess to live for other while think of themselv alon these profess howev deceiv no one for everi one ha hi share in them they are so much labour wast our inner conflict are caus by these contradict drawn thi way by natur and that way by man compel to yield to both forc we make a compromis and reach neither goal we go through life struggl and hesit and die befor we have found peac useless alik to ourselv and to other there remain the educ of the home or of natur but how will a man live with other if he is educ for himself alon if the twofold aim could be resolv into one by remov the man selfcontradict one great obstacl to hi happi would be gone to judg of thi you must see the man fullgrown you must have note hi inclin watch hi progress follow hi step in a word you must realli know a natur man when you have read thi work i think you will have made some progress in thi inquiri what must be done to train thi except man we can do much but the chief thing is to prevent anyth be done to sail against the wind we mere follow one tack and anoth to keep our posit in a stormi sea we must cast anchor bewar young pilot lest your boat slip it cabl or drag it anchor befor you know it in the social order where each ha hi own place a man must be educ for it if such a one leav hi own station he is fit for noth els hi educ is onli use when fate agre with hi parent choic if not educ harm the scholar if onli by the prejudic it ha creat in egypt where the son wa compel to adopt hi father call educ had at least a settl aim where social grade remain fix but the men who form them are constantli chang no one know whether he is not harm hi son by educ him for hi own class in the natur order men are all equal and their common call is that of manhood so that a welleduc man can not fail to do well in that call and those relat to it it matter littl to me whether my pupil is intend for the armi the church or the law befor hi parent chose a call for him natur call him to be a man life is the trade i would teach him when he leav me i grant you he will be neither a magistr a soldier nor a priest he will be a man all that becom a man he will learn as quickli as anoth in vain will fate chang hi station he will alway be in hi right place occupavi te fortuna atqu cepi omnesqu aditu tuo interclusi ut ad me aspirar non poss the real object of our studi is man and hi environ to my mind those of us who can best endur the good and evil of life are the best educ henc it follow that true educ consist less in precept than in practic we begin to learn when we begin to live our educ begin with ourselv our first teacher is our nurs the ancient use the word educ in a differ sens it meant nurtur educit obstetrix say varro educat nutrix instituit pÃ¦dagogu docet magist thu educ disciplin and instruct are three thing as differ in their purpos as the dame the usher and the teacher but these distinct are undesir and the child should onli follow one guid we must therefor look at the gener rather than the particular and consid our scholar as man in the abstract man expos to all the chang and chanc of mortal life if men were born attach to the soil of our countri if one season last all the year round if everi man fortun were so firmli grasp that he could never lose it then the establish method of educ would have certain advantag the child brought up to hi own call would never leav it he could never have to face the difficulti of ani other condit but when we consid the fleet natur of human affair the restless and uneasi spirit of our time when everi gener overturn the work of it predecessor can we conceiv a more senseless plan than to educ a child as if he would never leav hi room as if he would alway have hi servant about him if the wretch creatur take a singl step up or down he is lost thi is not teach him to bear pain it is train him to feel it peopl think onli of preserv their child life thi is not enough he must be taught to preserv hi own life when he is a man to bear the buffet of fortun to brave wealth and poverti to live at need among the snow of iceland or on the scorch rock of malta in vain you guard against death he must need die and even if you do not kill him with your precaut they are mistaken teach him to live rather than to avoid death life is not breath but action the use of our sens our mind our faculti everi part of ourselv which make us consciou of our be life consist less in length of day than in the keen sens of live a man may be buri at a hundr and may never have live at all he would have fare better had he die young our wisdom is slavish prejudic our custom consist in control constraint compulsionâ€”civilis man is born and die a slave the infant is bound up in swaddl cloth the corps is nail down in hi coffinâ€”al hi life long man is imprison by our institut i am told that mani midwiv profess to improv the shape of the infant head by rub and they are allow to do it our head are not good enough as god made them they must be mould outsid by the nurs and insid by the philosoph the carib are better off than we are the child ha hardli left the mother womb it ha hardli begun to move and stretch it limb when it is depriv of it freedom it is wrap in swaddl band laid down with it head fix it leg stretch out and it arm by it side it is wound round with linen and bandag of all sort so that it can not move it is fortun if it ha room to breath and it is laid on it side so that water which should flow from it mouth can escap for it is not free to turn it head on one side for thi purpos the newborn child requir to stir and stretch hi limb to free them from the stiff result from be curl up so long hi limb are stretch inde but he is not allow to move them even the head is confin by a cap one would think they were afraid the child should look as if it were aliv thu the intern impuls which should lead to growth find an insurmount obstacl in the way of the necessari movement the child exhaust hi strength in vain struggl or he gain strength veri slowli he wa freer and less constrain in the womb he ha gain noth by birth the inact the constraint to which the child limb are subject can onli check the circul of the blood and humour it can onli hinder the child growth in size and strength and injur it constitut where these absurd precaut are absent all the men are tall strong and wellmad where children are swaddl the countri swarm with the humpback the lame the bowleg the ricketi and everi kind of deform in our fear lest the bodi should becom deform by free movement we hasten to deform it by put it in a press we make our children helpless lest they should hurt themselv is not such a cruel bondag certain to affect both health and temper their first feel is one of pain and suffer they find everi necessari movement hamper more miser than a galley slave in vain they struggl they becom angri they cri their first word you say are tear that is so from birth you are alway check them your first gift are fetter your first treatment tortur their voic alon is free whi should they not rais it in complaint they cri becaus you are hurt them if you were swaddl you would cri louder still what is the origin of thi senseless and unnatur custom sinc mother have despis their first duti and refus to nurs their own children they have had to be entrust to hire nurs find themselv the mother of a stranger children without the tie of natur they have mere tri to save themselv troubl a child unswaddl would need constant watch well swaddl it is cast into a corner and it cri are unheed so long as the nurs neglig escap notic so long as the nursl doe not break it arm or leg what matter if it die or becom a weakl for life it limb are kept safe at the expens of it bodi and if anyth goe wrong it is not the nurs fault these gentl mother have got rid of their babi devot themselv gaili to the pleasur of the town do they know how their children are be treat in the villag if the nurs is at all busi the child is hung up on a nail like a bundl of cloth and is left crucifi while the nurs goe leisur about her busi children have been found in thi posit purpl in the face their tightli bandag chest forbad the circul of the blood and it went to the head so the suffer wa consid veri quiet becaus he had not strength to cri how long a child might surviv under such condit i do not know but it could not be long that i fanci is one of the chief advantag of swaddl cloth it is maintain that unswaddl infant would assum faulti posit and make movement which might injur the proper develop of their limb that is one of the empti argument of our fals wisdom which ha never been confirm by experi out of all the crowd of children who grow up with the full use of their limb among nation wiser than ourselv you never find one who hurt himself or maim himself their movement are too feebl to be danger and when they assum an injuri posit pain warn them to chang it we have not yet decid to swaddl our kitten and puppi are they ani the wors for thi neglect children are heavier i admit but they are also weaker they can scarc move how could they hurt themselv if you lay them on their back they will lie there till they die like the turtl unabl to turn itself over not content with have ceas to suckl their children women no longer wish to do it with the natur resultâ€”motherhood becom a burden mean are found to avoid it they will destroy their work to begin it over again and they thu turn to the injuri of the race the charm which wa given them for it increas thi practic with other caus of depopul forbod the come fate of europ her art and scienc her philosophi and moral will shortli reduc her to a desert she will be the home of wild beast and her inhabit will hardli have chang for the wors i have sometim watch the trick of young wive who pretend that they wish to nurs their own children they take care to be dissuad from thi whim they contriv that husband doctor and especi mother should interven if a husband should let hi wife nurs her own babi it would be the ruin of him they would make him out a murder who want to be rid of her a prudent husband must sacrific patern affect to domest peac fortun for you there are women in the countri district more contin than your wive you are still more fortun if the time thu gain is not intend for anoth than yourself there can be no doubt about a wife duti but consid the contempt in which it is held it is doubt whether it is not just as good for the child to be suckl by a stranger thi is a question for the doctor to settl and in my opinion they have settl it accord to the women wish and for my own part i think it is better that the child should suck the breast of a healthi nurs rather than of a pet mother if he ha ani further evil to fear from her who ha given him birth ought the question howev to be consid onli from the physiolog point of view doe not the child need a mother care as much as her milk other women or even other anim may give him the milk she deni him but there is no substitut for a mother love the woman who nurs anoth child in place of her own is a bad mother how can she be a good nurs she may becom one in time use will overcom natur but the child may perish a hundr time befor hi nurs ha develop a mother affect for him and thi affect when develop ha it drawback which should make everi sensibl woman afraid to put her child out to nurs is she prepar to divid her mother right or rather to abdic them in favour of a stranger to see her child love anoth more than herself to feel that the affect he retain for hi own mother is a favour while hi love for hi fostermoth is a duti for is not some affect due where there ha been a mother care to remov thi difficulti children are taught to look down on their nurs to treat them as mere servant when their task is complet the child is withdrawn or the nurs is dismiss her visit to her fosterchild are discourag by a cold recept after a few year the child never see her again the mother expect to take her place and to repair by her cruelti the result of her own neglect but she is greatli mistaken she is make an ungrat fosterchild not an affection son she is teach him ingratitud and she is prepar him to despis at a later day the mother illeg bore him as he now despis hi nurs how emphat would i speak if it were not so hopeless to keep struggl in vain on behalf of a real reform more depend on thi than you realis would you restor all men to their primal duti begin with the mother the result will surpris you everi evil follow in the train of thi first sin the whole moral order is disturb natur is quench in everi breast the home becom gloomi the spectacl of a young famili no longer stir the husband lovo and the stranger rever the mother whose children are out of sight win scanti esteem there is no home life the tie of natur are not strengthen by those of habit father mother children brother and sister ceas to exist they are almost stranger how should they love one anoth each think of himself first when the home is a gloomi solitud pleasur will be sought elsewher but when mother deign to nurs their own children then will be a reform in moral natur feel will reviv in everi heart there will be no lack of citizen for the state thi first step by itself will restor mutual affect the charm of home are the best antidot to vice the noisi play of children which we thought so tri becom a delight mother and father reli more on each other and grow dearer to one anoth the marriag tie is strengthen in the cheer home life the mother find her sweetest duti and the father hi pleasantest recreat thu the cure of thi one evil would work a widespread reform natur would regain her right when women becom good mother men will be good husband and father my word are vain when we are sick of worldli pleasur we do not return to the pleasur of the home women have ceas to be mother they do not and will not return to their duti could they do it if they would the contrari custom is firmli establish each would have to overcom the opposit of her neighbour leagu togeth against the exampl which some have never given and other do not desir to follow yet there are still a few young women of good natur disposit who refus to be the slave of fashion and rebel against the clamour of other women who fulfil the sweet task impos on them by natur would that the reward in store for them might draw other to follow their exampl my conclus is base upon plain reason and upon fact i have never seen disput and i ventur to promis these worthi mother the firm and steadfast affect of their husband and the truli filial love of their children and the respect of all the world childbirth will be easi and will leav no illresult their health will be strong and vigor and they will see their daughter follow their exampl and find that exampl quot as a pattern to other no mother no child their duti are reciproc and when ill illeg by the one they will be neglect by the other the child illeg love hi mother befor he know what he owe her if the illeg of instinct is not strengthen by habit it soon die the heart is stillborn from the outset we have stray from the path of natur there is anoth byway which may tempt our feet from the path of natur the mother may lavish excess care on her child instead of neglect him she may make an idol of him she may develop and increas hi weak to prevent him feel it she ward off everi pain experi in the hope of withdraw him from the power of natur and fail to realis that for everi trifl ill from which she preserv him the futur hold in store mani accid and danger and that it is a cruel kind to prolong the child weak when the grown man must bear fatigu theti so the stori goe plung her son in the water of styx to make him invulner the truth of thi allegori is appar the cruel mother i speak of do otherwis they plung their children into soft and they are prepar suffer for them they open the way to everi kind of ill which their children will not fail to experi after they grow up fix your eye on natur follow the path trace by her she keep children at work she harden them by all kind of difficulti she soon teach them the mean of pain and grief they cut their teeth and are feverish sharp colic bring on convuls they are choke by fit of cough and torment by worm evil humour corrupt the blood germ of variou kind ferment in it caus danger erupt sick and danger play the chief part in infanc one half of the children who are born die befor their eighth year the child who ha overcom hardship ha gain strength and as soon as he can use hi life he hold it more secur thi is natur law whi contradict it do you not see that in your effort to improv upon her handiwork you are destroy it her care are wast to do from without what she doe within is accord to you to increas the danger twofold on the contrari it is the way to avert it experi show that children delic nurtur are more like to die provid we do not overdo it there is less risk in use their strength than in spare it accustom them therefor to the hardship they will have to face train them to endur extrem of temperatur climat and condit hunger thirst and weari dip them in the water of styx befor bodili habit becom fix you may teach what habit you will without ani risk but onc habit are establish ani chang is fraught with peril a child will bear chang which a man can not bear the muscl of the one are soft and flexibl they take whatev direct you give them without ani effort the muscl of the grown man are harder and they onli chang their accustom mode of action when subject to violenc so we can make a child strong without risk hi life or health and even if there were some risk it should not be taken into consider sinc human life is full of danger can we do better than face them at a time when they can do the least harm a child worth increas with hi year to hi person valu must be ad the cost of the care bestow upon him for himself there is not onli loss of life but the conscious of death we must therefor think most of hi futur in our effort for hi preserv he must be protect against the ill of youth befor he reach them for if the valu of life increas until the child reach an age when he can be use what mad to spare some suffer in infanc onli to multipli hi pain when he reach the age of reason is that what our master teach us man is born to suffer pain is the mean of hi preserv hi childhood is happi know onli pain of bodi these bodili suffer are much less cruel much less pain than other form of suffer and they rare lead to selfdestruct it is not the twing of gout which make a man kill himself it is mental suffer that lead to despair we piti the suffer of childhood we should piti ourselv our worst sorrow are of our own make the newborn infant cri hi earli day are spent in cri he is altern pet and shaken by way of sooth him sometim he is threaten sometim beaten to keep him quiet we do what he want or we make him do what we want we submit to hi whim or subject him to our own there is no middl cours he must rule or obey thu hi earliest idea are those of the tyrant or the slave he command befor he can speak he obey befor he can act and sometim he is punish for fault befor he is awar of them or rather befor they are commit thu earli are the seed of evil passion sown in hi young heart at a later day these are attribut to natur and when we have taken pain to make him bad we lament hi bad in thi way the child pass six or seven year in the hand of women the victim of hi own capric or their and after they have taught him all sort of thing when they have burden hi memori with word he can not understand or thing which are of no use to him when natur ha been stifl by the passion they have implant in him thi sham articl is sent to a tutor the tutor complet the develop of the germ of artifici which he find alreadi well grown he teach him everyth except selfknowledg and selfcontrol the art of life and happi when at length thi infant slave and tyrant cram with knowledg but empti of sens feebl alik in mind and bodi is flung upon the world and hi helpless hi pride and hi other vice are display we begin to lament the wretched and pervers of mankind we are wrong thi is the creatur of our fantasi the natur man is cast in anoth mould would you keep him as natur made him watch over him from hi birth take possess of him as soon as he come into the world and keep him till he is a man you will never succeed otherwis the real nurs is the mother and the real teacher is the father let them agre in the order of their duti as well as in their method let the child pass from one to the other he will be better educ by a sensibl though ignor father than by the cleverest master in the world for zeal will aton for lack of knowledg rather than knowledg for lack of zeal but the duti of public and privat busi duti inde doe a father duti come last it is not surpris that the man whose wife despis the duti of suckl her child should despis it educ there is no more charm pictur than that of famili life but when one featur is want the whole is mar if the mother is too delic to nurs her child the father will be too busi to teach him their children scatter about in school convent and colleg will find the home of their affect elsewher or rather they will form the habit of care for noth brother and sister will scarc know each other when they are togeth in compani they will behav as stranger when there is no confid between relat when the famili societi ceas to give savour to life it place is soon usurp by vice is there ani man so stupid that he can not see how all thi hang togeth a father ha done but a third of hi task when he beget children and provid a live for them he owe men to human citizen to the state a man who can pay thi threefold debt and neglect to do so is guilti more guilti perhap if he pay it in part than when he neglect it entir he ha no right to be a father if he can not fulfil a father duti poverti pressur of busi mistaken social prejudic none of these can excus a man from hi duti which is to support and educ hi own children if a man of ani natur feel neglect these sacr duti he will repent it with bitter tear and will never be comfort but what doe thi rich man do thi father of a famili compel so he say to neglect hi children he pay anoth man to perform those duti which are hi alon mercenari man do you expect to purchas a second father for your child do not deceiv yourself it is not even a master you have hire for him it is a flunkey who will soon train such anoth as himself there is much discuss as to the characterist of a good tutor my first requir and it impli a good mani more is that he should not take up hi task for reward there are call so great that they can not be undertaken for money without show our unfit for them such call are those of the soldier and the teacher but who must train my child i have just told you you should do it yourself i can not you can not then find a friend i see no other cours a tutor what a nobl soul inde for the train of a man one must either be a father or more than man it is thi duti you would calmli hand over to a hirel the more you think of it the harder you will find it the tutor must have been train for hi pupil hi servant must have been train for their master so that all who come near him may have receiv the impress which is to be transmit to him we must pass from educ to educ i know not how far how can a child be well educ by one who ha not been well educ himself can such a one be found i know not in thi age of degrad who know the height of virtu to which man soul may attain but let us assum that thi prodigi ha been discov we shall learn what he should be from the consider of hi duti i fanci the father who realis the valu of a good tutor will contriv to do without one for it will be harder to find one than to becom such a tutor himself he need search no further natur herself have done half the work some one whose rank alon is known to me suggest that i should educ hi son he did me a great honour no doubt but far from regret my refus he ought to congratul himself on my prudenc had the offer been accept and had i been mistaken in my method there would have been an educ ruin had i succeed thing would have been worseâ€”hi son would have renounc hi titl and refus to be a princ i feel too deepli the import of a tutor duti and my own unfit ever to accept such a post whoever offer it and even the claim of friendship would be onli an addit motiv for my refus few i think will be tempt to make me such an offer when they have read thi book and i beg ani one who would do so to spare hi pain i have had enough experi of the task to convinc myself of my own unfit and my circumst would make it imposs even if my talent were such as to fit me for it i have thought it my duti to make thi public declar to those who appar refus to do me the honour of believ in the sincer of my determin if i am unabl to undertak the more use task i will at least ventur to attempt the easier one i will follow the exampl of my predecessor and take up not the task but my pen and instead of do the right thing i will tri to say it i know that in such an undertak the author who rang at will among theoret system utter mani fine precept imposs to practis and even when he say what is practic it remain undon for want of detail and exampl as to it applic i have therefor decid to take an imaginari pupil to assum on my own part the age health knowledg and talent requir for the work of hi educ to guid him from birth to manhood when he need no guid but himself thi method seem to me use for an author who fear lest he may stray from the practic to the visionari for as soon as he depart from common practic he ha onli to tri hi method on hi pupil he will soon know or the reader will know for him whether he is follow the develop of the child and the natur growth of the human heart thi is what i have tri to do lest my book should be unduli bulki i have been content to state those principl the truth of which is selfevid but as to the rule which call for proof i have appli them to emil or to other and i have shown in veri great detail how my theori may be put into practic such at least is my plan the reader must decid whether i have succeed at first i have said littl about emil for my earliest maxim of educ though veri differ from those gener accept are so plain that it is hard for a man of sens to refus to accept them but as i advanc my scholar educ after anoth fashion than your is no longer an ordinari child he need a special system then he appear upon the scene more frequent and toward the end i never lose sight of him for a moment until whatev he may say he need me no longer i pass over the qualiti requir in a good tutor i take them for grant and assum that i am endow with them as you read thi book you will see how gener i have been to myself i will onli remark that contrari to the receiv opinion a child tutor should be young as young inde as a man may well be who is also wise were it possibl he should becom a child himself that he may be the companion of hi pupil and win hi confid by share hi game childhood and age have too littl in common for the format of a realli firm affect children sometim flatter old men they never love them peopl seek a tutor who ha alreadi educ one pupil thi is too much one man can onli educ one pupil if two were essenti to success what right would he have to undertak the first with more experi you may know better what to do but you are less capabl of do it onc thi task ha been well done you will know too much of it difficulti to attempt it a second timeâ€”if ill done the first attempt augur badli for the second it is one thing to follow a young man about for four year anoth to be hi guid for fiveandtwenti you find a tutor for your son when he is alreadi form i want one for him befor he is born your man may chang hi pupil everi five year mine will never have but one pupil you distinguish between the teacher and the tutor anoth piec of folli do you make ani distinct between the pupil and the scholar there is onli one scienc for children to learnâ€”th duti of man thi scienc is one and whatev xenophon may say of the educ of the persian it is indivis besid i prefer to call the man who ha thi knowledg master rather than teacher sinc it is a question of guidanc rather than instruct he must not give precept he must let the scholar find them out for himself if the master is to be so care chosen he may well choos hi pupil abov all when he propos to set a pattern for other thi choic can not depend on the child geniu or charact as i adopt him befor he is born and they are onli known when my task is finish if i had my choic i would take a child of ordinari mind such as i assum in my pupil it is ordinari peopl who have to be educ and their educ alon can serv as a pattern for the educ of their fellow the other find their way alon the birthplac is not a matter of indiffer in the educ of man it is onli in temper clime that he come to hi full growth the disadvantag of extrem are easili seen a man is not plant in one place like a tree to stay there the rest of hi life and to pass from one extrem to anoth you must travel twice as far as he who start halfway if the inhabit of a temper climat pass in turn through both extrem hi advantag is plain for although he may be chang as much as he who goe from one extrem to the other he onli remov halfway from hi natur condit a frenchman can live in new guinea or in lapland but a negro can not live in tornea nor a samoy in benin it seem also as if the brain were less perfectli organis in the two extrem neither the negro nor the lap are as wise as european so if i want my pupil to be a citizen of the world i will choos him in the temper zone in franc for exampl rather than elsewher in the north with it barren soil men devour much food in the fertil south they eat littl thi produc anoth differ the one is industri the other contempl societi show us in one and the same spot a similar differ between rich and poor the one dwell in a fertil land the other in a barren land the poor man ha no need of educ the educ of hi own station in life is forc upon him he can have no other the educ receiv by the rich man from hi own station is least fit for himself and for societi moreov a natur educ should fit a man for ani posit now it is more unreason to train a poor man for wealth than a rich man for poverti for in proport to their number more rich men are ruin and fewer poor men becom rich let us choos our scholar among the rich we shall at least have made anoth man the poor may come to manhood without our help for the same reason i should not be sorri if emil came of a good famili he will be anoth victim snatch from prejudic emil is an orphan no matter whether he ha father or mother have undertaken their duti i am invest with their right he must honour hi parent but he must obey me that is my first and onli condit i must add that there is just one other point aris out of thi we must never be separ except by mutual consent thi claus is essenti and i would have tutor and scholar so insepar that they should regard their fate as one if onc they perceiv the time of their separ draw near the time which must make them stranger to one anoth they becom stranger then and there each make hi own littl world and both of them be busi in thought with the time when they will no longer be togeth they remain togeth against their will the discipl regard hi master as the badg and scourg of childhood the master regard hi scholar as a heavi burden which he long to be rid of both are look forward to the time when they will part and as there is never ani real affect between them there will be scant vigil on the one hand and on the other scant obedi but when they consid they must alway live togeth they must need love one anoth and in thi way they realli learn to love one anoth the pupil is not asham to follow as a child the friend who will be with him in manhood the tutor take an interest in the effort whose fruit he will enjoy and the virtu he is cultiv in hi pupil form a store laid up for hi old age thi agreement made beforehand assum a normal birth a strong wellmad healthi child a father ha no choic and should have no prefer within the limit of the famili god ha given him all hi children are hi alik the same care and affect is due to all crippl or wellmad weak or strong each of them is a trust for which he is respons to the giver and natur is a parti to the marriag contract along with husband and wife but if you undertak a duti not impos upon you by natur you must secur beforehand the mean for it fulfil unless you would undertak duti you can not fulfil if you take the care of a sickli unhealthi child you are a sick nurs not a tutor to preserv a useless life you are wast the time which should be spent in increas it valu you risk the sight of a despair mother reproach you for the death of her child who ought to have die long ago i would not undertak the care of a feebl sickli child should he live to four score year i want no pupil who is useless alik to himself and other one whose sole busi is to keep himself aliv one whose bodi is alway a hindranc to the train of hi mind if i vainli lavish my care upon him what can i do but doubl the loss to societi by rob it of two men instead of one let anoth tend thi weakl for me i am quit will i approv hi chariti but i myself have no gift for such a task i could never teach the art of live to one who need all hi strength to keep himself aliv the bodi must be strong enough to obey the mind a good servant must be strong i know that intemper stimul the passion in cours of time it also destroy the bodi fast and penanc often produc the same result in an opposit way the weaker the bodi the more imperi it demand the stronger it is the better it obey all sensual passion find their home in effemin bodi the less satisfact they can get the keener their sting a feebl bodi make a feebl mind henc the influenc of physic an art which doe more harm to man than all the evil it profess to cure i do not know what the doctor cure us of but i know thi they infect us with veri deadli diseas cowardic timid credul the fear of death what matter if they make the dead walk we have no need of corps they fail to give us men and it is men we need medicin is all the fashion in these day and veri natur it is the amus of the idl and unemploy who do not know what to do with their time and so spend it in take care of themselv if by illluck they had happen to be born immort they would have been the most miser of men a life they could not lose would be of no valu to them such men must have doctor to threaten and flatter them to give them the onli pleasur they can enjoy the pleasur of not be dead i will say no more at present as to the useless of medicin my aim is to consid it bear on moral still i can not refrain from say that men employ the same sophism about medicin as they do about the search for truth they assum that the patient is cure and that the seeker after truth find it they fail to see that against one life save by the doctor you must set a hundr slain and against the valu of one truth discov the error which creep in with it the scienc which instruct and the medicin which heal are no doubt excel but the scienc which mislead us and the medicin which kill us are evil teach us to know them apart that is the real difficulti if we were content to be ignor of truth we should not be the dupe of falsehood if we did not want to be cure in spite of natur we should not be kill by the doctor we should do well to steer clear of both and we should evid be the gainer i do not deni that medicin is use to some men i assert that it is fatal to mankind you will tell me as usual that the doctor are to blame that medicin herself is infal well and good then give us the medicin without the doctor for when we have both the blunder of the artist are a hundredfold greater than our hope from the art thi lie art invent rather for the ill of the mind than of the bodi is useless to both alik it doe less to cure us of our diseas than to fill us with alarm it doe less to ward off death than to make us dread it approach it exhaust life rather than prolong it should it even prolong life it would onli be to the prejudic of the race sinc it make us set it precaut befor societi and our fear befor our duti it is the knowledg of danger that make us afraid if we thought ourselv invulner we should know no fear the poet arm achil against danger and so rob him of the merit of courag on such term ani man would be an achil would you find a realli brave man seek him where there are no doctor where the result of diseas are unknown and where death is littl thought of by natur a man bear pain brave and die in peac it is the doctor with their rule the philosoph with their precept the priest with their exhort who debas the heart and make us afraid to die give me a pupil who ha no need of these or i will have noth to do with him no one els shall spoil my work i will educ him myself or not at all that wise man lock who had devot part of hi life to the studi of medicin advis us to give no drug to the child whether as a precaut or on account of slight ailment i will go farther and will declar that as i never call in a doctor for myself i will never send for one for emil unless hi life is clearli in danger when the doctor can but kill him i know the doctor will make capit out of my delay if the child die he wa call in too late if he recov it is hi do so be it let the doctor boast but do not call him in except in extrem as the child doe not know how to be cure he know how to be ill the one art take the place of the other and is often more success it is the art of natur when a beast is ill it keep quiet and suffer in silenc but we see fewer sickli anim than sick men how mani men have been slain by impati fear anxieti and abov all by medicin men whom diseas would have spare and time alon have cure i shall be told that anim who live accord to natur are less liabl to diseas than ourselv well that way of live is just what i mean to teach my pupil he should profit by it in the same way hygien is the onli use part of medicin and hygien is rather a virtu than a scienc temper and industri are man true remedi work sharpen hi appetit and temper teach him to control it to learn what system is most benefici you have onli to studi those race remark for health strength and length of day if common observ show us that medicin neither increas health nor prolong life it follow that thi useless art is wors than useless sinc it wast time men and thing on what is pure loss not onli must we deduct the time spent not in use life but preserv it but if thi time is spent in torment ourselv it is wors than wast it is so much to the bad and to reckon fairli a correspond share must be deduct from what remain to us a man who live ten year for himself and other without the help of doctor live more for himself and other than one who spend thirti year as their victim i have tri both so i think i have a better right than most to draw my own conclus for these reason i declin to take ani but a strong and healthi pupil and these are my principl for keep him in health i will not stop to prove at length the valu of manual labour and bodili exercis for strengthen the health and constitut no one deni it nearli all the instanc of long life are to be found among the men who have taken most exercis who have endur fatigu and labour neither will i enter into detail as to the care i shall take for thi alon it will be clear that it form such an essenti part of my practic that it is enough to get hold of the idea without further explan when our life begin our need begin too the newborn infant must have a nurs if hi mother will do her duti so much the better her instruct will be given her in write but thi advantag ha it drawback it remov the tutor from hi charg but it is to be hope that the child own interest and her respect for the person to whom she is about to confid so preciou a treasur will induc the mother to follow the master wish and whatev she doe you may be sure she will do better than anoth if we must have a strang nurs make a good choic to begin with it is one of the misfortun of the rich to be cheat on all side what wonder they think ill of mankind it is rich that corrupt men and the rich are rightli the first to feel the defect of the onli tool they know everyth is illdon for them except what they do themselv and they do next to noth when a nurs must be select the choic is left to the doctor what happen the best nurs is the one who offer the highest bribe i shall not consult the doctor about emil nurs i shall take care to choos her myself i may not argu about it so elegantli as the surgeon but i shall be more reliabl i shall be less deceiv by my zeal than the doctor by hi greed there is no mysteri about thi choic it rule are well known but i think we ought probabl to pay more attent to the age of the milk as well as it qualiti the first milk is wateri it must be almost an aperi to purg the remain of the meconium curdl in the bowel of the newborn child littl by littl the milk thicken and suppli more solid food as the child is abl to digest it it is sure not without caus that natur chang the milk in the femal of everi speci accord to the age of the offspr thu a newborn child requir a nurs who ha recent becom a mother there is i know a difficulti here but as soon as we leav the path of natur there are difficulti in the way of all welldo the wrong cours is the onli right one under the circumst so we take it the nurs must be healthi alik in disposit and in bodi the violenc of the passion as well as the humour may spoil her milk moreov to consid the bodi onli is to keep onli half our aim in view the milk may be good and the nurs bad a good charact is as necessari as a good constitut if you choos a viciou person i do not say her fosterchild will acquir her vice but he will suffer for them ought she not to bestow on him day by day along with her milk a care which call for zeal patienc gentl and cleanli if she is intemper and greedi her milk will soon be spoilt if she is careless and hasti what will becom of a poor littl wretch left to her merey and unabl either to protect himself or to complain the wick are never good for anyth the choic is all the more import becaus her fosterchild should have no other guardian just as he should have no teacher but hi tutor thi wa the custom of the ancient who talk less but act more wise than we the nurs never left her fosterdaught thi is whi the nurs is the confidant in most of their play a child who pass through mani hand in turn can never be well brought up at everi chang he make a secret comparison which continu tend to lessen hi respect for those who control him and with it their author over him if onc he think there are grownup peopl with no more sens than children the author of age is destroy and hi educ is ruin a child should know no better but it father and mother or fail them it fostermoth and it tutor and even thi is one too mani but thi divis is inevit and the best that can be done in the way of remedi is that the man and woman who control him shall be so well agre with regard to him that they seem like one the nurs must live rather more comfort she must have rather more substanti food but her whole way of live must not be alter for a sudden chang even a chang for the better is danger to health and sinc her usual way of life ha made her healthi and strong whi chang it countri women eat less meat and more veget than townswomen and thi vegetarian diet seem favour rather than otherwis to themselv and their children when they take nursl from the upper class they eat meat and broth with the idea that they will form better chyle and suppli more milk i do not hold with thi at all and experi is on my side for we do not find children fed in thi way less liabl to colic and worm that need not surpris us for decay anim matter swarm with worm but thi is not the case with veget matter milk although manufactur in the bodi of an anim is a veget substanc thi is shown by analysi it readili turn acid and far from show trace of ani volatil alkali like anim matter it give a neutral salt like plant the milk of herbivor creatur is sweeter and more wholesom than the milk of the carnivor form of a substanc similar to it own it keep it good and becom less liabl to putrifact if quantiti is consid it is well known that farinac food produc more blood than meat so they ought to yield more milk if a child were not wean too soon and if it were fed on vegetarian food and it fostermoth were a vegetarian i do not think it would be troubl with worm milk deriv from veget food may perhap be more liabl to go sour but i am far from consid sour milk an unwholesom food whole nation have no other food and are none the wors and all the array of absorb seem to me mere humbug there are constitut which do not thrive on milk other can take it without absorb peopl are afraid of the milk separ or curdl that is absurd for we know that milk alway curdl in the stomach thi is how it becom suffici solid to nourish children and young anim if it did not curdl it would mere pass away without food them in vain you dilut milk and use absorb whoever swallow milk digest chees thi rule is without except rennet is made from a calf stomach instead of chang the nurs usual diet i think it would be enough to give food in larger quantiti and better of it kind it is not the natur of the food that make a veget diet indigest but the flavour that make it unwholesom reform your cookeri use neither butter nor oil for fri butter salt and milk should never be cook let your veget be cook in water and onli season when they come to tabl the veget diet far from disturb the nurs will give her a plenti suppli of milk if a veget diet is best for the child how can meat food be best for hi nurs the thing are contradictori fresh air affect children constitut particularli in earli year it enter everi pore of a soft and tender skin it ha a power effect on their young bodi it effect can never be destroy so i should not agre with those who take a countri woman from her villag and shut her up in one room in a town and her nursl with her i would rather send him to breath the fresh air of the countri than the foul air of the town he will take hi new mother posit will live in her cottag where hi tutor will follow him the reader will bear in mind that thi tutor is not a paid servant but the father friend but if thi friend can not be found if thi transfer is not easi if none of my advic can be follow you will say to me what shall i do instead i have told you alreadyâ€”do what you are do no advic is need there men are not made to be crowd togeth in anthil but scatter over the earth to till it the more they are mass togeth the more corrupt they becom diseas and vice are the sure result of overcrowd citi of all creatur man is least fit to live in herd huddl togeth like sheep men would veri soon die man breath is fatal to hi fellow thi is liter as well as figur true men are devour by our town in a few gener the race die out or becom degener it need renew and it is alway renew from the countri send your children to renew themselv so to speak send them to regain in the open field the strength lost in the foul air of our crowd citi women hurri home that their children may be born in the town they ought to do just the opposit especi those who mean to nurs their own children they would lose less than they think and in more natur surround the pleasur associ by natur with matern duti would soon destroy the tast for other delight the newborn infant is first bath in warm water to which a littl wine is usual ad i think the wine might be dispens with as natur doe not produc ferment liquor it is not like that they are of much valu to her creatur in the same way it is unnecessari to take the precaut of heat the water in fact among mani race the newborn infant are bath with no more ado in river or in the sea our children made tender befor birth by the soft of their parent come into the world with a constitut alreadi enfeebl which can not be at onc expos to all the trial requir to restor it to health littl by littl they must be restor to their natur vigour begin then by follow thi custom and leav it off gradual wash your children often their dirti way show the need of thi if they are onli wipe their skin is injur but as they grow stronger gradual reduc the heat of the water till at last you bath them winter and summer in cold even in icecold water to avoid risk thi chang must be slow gradual and impercept so you may use the thermomet for exact measur thi habit of the bath onc establish should never be broken off it must be kept up all through life i valu it not onli on ground of cleanli and present health but also as a wholesom mean of make the muscl suppl and accustom them to bear without risk or effort extrem of heat and cold as he get older i would have the child train to bath occasion in hot water of everi bearabl degre and often in everi degre of cold water now water be a denser fluid touch us at more point than air so that have learnt to bear all the variat of temperatur in
