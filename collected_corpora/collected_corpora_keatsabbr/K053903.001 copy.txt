littl out of hi way to take leav of m barreaux whom he found botan in the wood near hi chateau and who when he wa told the purpos of st aubert visit express a degre of concern such as hi friend had thought it wa scarc possibl for him to feel on ani similar occas they part with mutual regret if ani thing could have tempt me from my retir said m barreaux it would have been the pleasur of accompani you on thi littl tour i do not often offer compliment you may therefor believ me when i say that i shall look for your return with impati the travel proceed on their journey as they ascend the height st aubert often look back upon hi chateau in the plain below tender imag crowd to hi mind hi melancholi imagin suggest that he should return no more and though he check thi wander thought still he continu to look till the hazi of distanc blend hi home with the gener landscap and st aubert seem to drag at each remov a lengthen chain he and emili continu sunk in muse silenc for some leagu from which melancholi reveri emili first awok and her young fanci struck with the grandeur of the object around gradual yield to delight impress the road now descend into glen confin by stupend wall of rock gray and barren except where shrub fring their summit or patch of meagr veget tint their recess in which the wild goat wa frequent brows and now the way led to the lofti cliff from whenc the landscap wa seen extend in all it magnific emili could not restrain her transport as she look over the pine forest of the mountain upon the vast plain that enrich with wood town blush vine and plantat of almond palm and oliv stretch along till their variou color melt in distanc into one harmoni hue that seem to unit earth with heaven through the whole of thi gloriou scene the majest garonn wander descend from it sourc among the pyrene and wind it blue wave toward the bay of biscay the rugged of the unfrequ road often oblig the wander to alight from their littl carriag but they thought themselv ampli repaid for thi inconveni by the grandeur of the scene and while the mulet led hi anim slowli over the broken ground the travel had leisur to linger and these solitud and to indulg the sublim reflect which soften while they elev the heart and fill it with the certainti of a present god still the enjoy of st aubert wa touch with that pensiv melancholi which give to everi object a mellow tint and breath a sacr charm over all around they had provid against part of the evil to be encount from a want of conveni inn by carri a stock of provis in the carriag so that they might take refresh on ani pleasant spot in the open air and pass the night wherev they should happen to meet with a comfort cottag for the mind also they had provid by a work on botani written by m barreaux and by sever of the latin and italian poet while emili pencil enabl her to preserv some of those combin of form which charm her at everi step the loneli of the road where onli now and then a peasant wa seen drive hi mule or some mountaineerchildren at play among the rock heighten the effect of the sceneri st aubert wa so much struck with it that he determin if he could hear of a road to penetr further among the mountain and bend hi way rather more to the south to emerg into rousillon and coast the mediterranean along part of that countri to languedoc soon after midday they reach the summit of one of those cliff which bright with the verdur of palm tree adorn like gem the tremend wall of the rock and which overlook the greater part of gasconi and part of languedoc here wa shade and the fresh water of a spring that glide among the turf under the tree thenc precipit itself from rock to rock till it dash murmur were lost in the abyss though it white foam wa long seen amid the dark of the pine below thi wa a spot well suit for rest and the travel alight to dine while the mule were unhar to brows on the savouri herb that enrich thi summit it wa some time befor st aubert or emili could withdraw their attent from the surround object so as to partak of their littl repast seat in the shade of the palm st aubert point out to her observ the cours of the river the situat of great town and the boundari of provinc which scienc rather than the eye enabl him to describ notwithstand thi occup when he had talk awhil he suddenli becam silent thought and tear often swell to hi eye which emili observ and the sympathi of her own heart told her their caus the scene befor them bore some resembl though it wa on a much grander scale to a favorit one of the late madam st aubert within view of the fishinghous they both observ thi and thought how delight she would have been with the present landscap while they knew that her eye must never never more open upon thi world st aubert rememb the last time of hi visit that spot in compani with her and also the mourn presag thought which had then arisen in hi mind and were now even thu soon realiz the recollect subdu him and he abruptli rose from hi seat and walk away to where no eye could observ hi grief when he return hi counten had recov it usual seren he took emili hand press it affection without speak and soon after call to the mulet who sat at a littl distanc concern a road among the mountain toward rousillon michael said there were sever that way but he did not know how far they extend or even whether they were passabl and st aubert who did not intend to travel after sun set ask what villag they could reach about that time the mulet calcul that they could easili reach mateau which wa in their present road but that if they took a road that slope more to the south toward rousillon there wa a hamlet which he thought they could gain befor the even shut in st aubert after some hesit determin to take the latter cours and michael have finish hi meal and har hi mule again set forward but soon stop and st aubert saw him do homag to a cross that stood on a rock impend over their way have conclud hi devot he smack hi whip in the air and in spite of the rough road and the pain of hi poor mule which he had been late lament rattl in a full gallop along the edg of a precipic which it made the eye dizzi to look down emili wa terrifi almost to faint and st aubert apprehend still greater danger from suddenli stop the driver wa compel to sit quietli and trust hi fate to the strength and discret of the mule who seem to possess a greater portion of the latter qualiti than their master for they carri the travel safe into the valley and there stop upon the brink of the rivulet that water it leav the splendor of extens prospect they now enter thi narrow valley screen by rock on rock pile as if by magic spell here scorch by lightn there with ivi green the scene of barren wa here and there interrupt by the spread branch of the larch and cedar which threw their gloom over the cliff or a hwart the torrent that roll in the vale no live creatur appear except the izard scrambl among the rock and often hang upon point so danger that fanci shrunk from the view of them thi wa such a scene as salvat would have chosen had he then exist for hi canvass st aubert impress by the romant charact of the place almost expect to see banditti start from behind some project rock and be kept hi hand upon the arm with which he alway travel as they advanc the valley open it savag featur gradual soften and toward even they were among heathi mountain stretch in far perspect along which the solitari sheepbel wa heard and the voic of the shepherd call hi wander flock to the nightli fold hi cabin partli shadow by the corktre and the ilex which st aubert observ to flourish in higher region of the air than ani other tree except the fir wa all the human habit that yet appear along the bottom of thi valley the most vivid verdur wa spread and in the littl hollow recess of the mountain under the shade of the oak and chestnut herd of cattl were graze group of them too were often seen repos on the bank of the rivulet or lave their side in the cool stream and sip it wave the sun wa now set upon the valley it last light gleam upon the water and heighten the rich yellow and purpl tint of the heath and broom that overspread the mountain st aubert enquir of michael the distanc to the hamlet he had mention but the man could not with certainti tell and emili began to fear that he had mistaken the road here wa no human be to assist or direct them they had left the shepherd and hi cabin far behind and the scene becam so obscur in twilight that the eye could not follow the distant perspect of the valley in search of a cottag or a hamlet a glow of the horizon still mark the west and
