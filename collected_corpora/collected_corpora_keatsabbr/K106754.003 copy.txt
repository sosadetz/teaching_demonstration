passag to anoth to enjoy with gratitud what heaven in it bounti should bestow and to bear with submiss all which in it vengeanc it might inflict in a greater degre than most peopl he practic thi doctrin and as soon as the first shock he receiv from ladi elmwood conduct wa abat an entir calm and resign ensu but still of that sensibl and feel kind which could never forc him to forget the happi he had lost and it wa thi sensibl which urg him to fli from it more keen recollect as much as possibl thi he alleg as the reason he would never suffer ladi elmwood or even her child to be name in hi hear but thi injunct which all hi friend and even the servant in the hous who attend hi person had receiv wa by mani peopl suspect rather to proceed from hi resent than hi tender nor did he himself deni that resent mingl with hi prudenc for prudenc he call it not to remind himself of happi he could never tast again and of ingratitud that might impel him to hatr and prudenc he call it not to form anoth attach near to hi heart more especi so near as a parent which might a second time expos him to all the torment of ingratitud from one whom he affection love upon these principl he form the unshaken resolut never to acknowledg ladi matilda as hi child or acknowledg her as such never to see hear of or take one concern whatev in her fate and fortun the death of her mother appear a favor time had he been so inclin to have recal thi declar which he had solemnli and repeatedli made she wa now destitut of the protect of her other parent and it becam hi duti at least to provid her a guardian if he did not choos to take that tender titl upon himself but to mention either the mother or child to lord elmwood wa an equal offens and prohibit in the strongest term to all hi friend and household and as he wa an excel good master a sincer friend and a most gener patron not one of hi acquaint or depend were hardi enough to draw upon themselv hi certain displeasur which wa violent in the extrem by even the offici intellig of ladi elmwood death sandford himself intimid through age or by the auster and even moros manner lord elmwood had of late year adopt sandford wish if possibl some other would undertak the danger task of recal to hi lordship memori there ever wa such a person as hi wife he advis miss woodley to indit a proper letter to him on the subject but she remind him

she had no will she said but what she would wholli submit to lord elmwood and if it were even hi will her child should live in poverti as well as banish it should be so but perhap in thi implicit submiss to hi lordship there wa a distant hope that the necessit situat of hi daughter might plead more forcibl than hi parent love and that know her abandon of everi support but through himself that idea might form some littl tie between them and be at least a token of the relationship but as ladi elmwood anxious wish thi principl upon which she act should be conceal from hi lordship suspicion she includ her friend miss woodley in the same fate and thu the onli person dear to her she left but at lord elmwood pleasur to be preserv from perish in want her child wa too young to advis her on thi subject her friend too disinterest and at thi moment they were both without the smallest mean of support except through the justic or compass of hi lordship sandford had inde promis hi protect to

chang the convers which sandford wa happi to join for in the present discours he did not feel himself veri comfort as they advanc in their dinner miss woodley and sandford embarrass diminish while lord elmwood in hi turn becam not embarrass but absent and melancholi he now and then sigh heavili and call for wine much often than he wa accustom when miss woodley took her leav hi lordship invit her to dine with him and sandford whenev it wa conveni to her he said mani thing too of the same kind and all with the utmost civil yet not with that warmth with which he had spoken in the morn into that he had been surpris while thi cool wa the effect of reflect when she came to ladi matilda and sandford had join them they talk and deliber on what had pass you acknowledg mr sandford said miss woodley that you think my presenc affect lord elmwood so as to make him much more thought than usual if you imagin these thought were upon ladi elmwood i will never intrud again but if you suppos i caus him to think upon hi daughter i can not go too often i dont see how he can divid those two object in hi mind repli sandford and therefor you must even visit him on and take your chanc what reflect you may inspir but be they what they will time will take away from you that power of affect him she concur in the opinion and occasion walk into hi lordship apart dine or took coffe with him as the accid suit and observ accord to sandford prescienc that time wore off that impress her visit first made lord elmwood now becam just the same befor her as befor other she easili discern too

wa receiv by hi lordship with all that affection warmth due to the man he thought worthi to make hi heir rushbrook had been a beauti boy and wa now an extrem handsom young man he had made an unusu progress in hi studi had complet the tour of itali and germani and return home with the air and address of a perfect man of fashion there wa besid an eleg and persuas in hi manner almost irresist yet with all those accomplish when he wa introduc to sandford and put out hi hand to take hi sandford with evid reluct gave it to him and when lord elmwood ask him in the young man presenc if he did not think hi nephew greatli improv he look at him from head to foot and mutter he could not say he observ it the color heighten in mr rushbrook face upon thi occas but he wa too well bred not to be still in perfect good humor sandford saw thi young man treat in the hous of lord elmwood with the same respect and attent as if he had been hi lordship son and it wa but probabl the old priest should make a comparison between the situat of him and of ladi matilda elmwood befor her it wa sandford mean to have conceal hi thought upon the subject and never to have mention it but with composur that wa howev imposs unus to conceal hi feel at the name of rushbrook hi counten would alway chang and a sarcast sneer and sometim a frown of resent forc their way in spite of hi resolut miss woodley too with all her boundless chariti and good will wa upon thi occas induc to limit their excess and they did not extend so far as to reach poor rushbrook she even and in realiti did not think him handsom or engag in hi manner she thought hi gaieti frivil hi complais affect and hi good humor impertin it wa imposs to conceal those unfavour sentiment entir from matilda for when the subject aros as it frequent did miss woodley undisguis heart and sandford undisguis counten told them instantli matilda had the understand to imagin she wa perhap the object who had thu deform mr rushbrook and frequent though he wa a stranger to her and one who had caus her mani a jealou heartach frequent she would speak in hi vindic you are veri good said sandford one day to her you like him becaus you know your father love him

offici prais of him to hi uncl first gave him that power he now possess over him she littl foresaw at that time hi ingratitud and it effect veri true said miss woodley with a heavi sigh what ingratitud said matilda do you suppos mr rushbrook is the caus my father will not see me oh do not pay lord elmwood motiv so ill a compliment i do not say he is the absolut caus return sandford but if a parent heart is void i would have it remain so till store by it law owner a usurp i detest no one can take lord elmwood heart by forc repli hi daughter it must i believ be a free gift to the possessor and as such whoever ha it ha a right to it in thi manner she would plead the young man excus perhap but to hear what could be said in hi disfavour for secretli hi name wa bitter to her and onc she exclaim in vexat on sandford say lord elmwood and mr rushbrook were gone out shoot togeth all that pleasur is now eclips which i use to take in listen to the report of my father gun for i can not now distinguish hi from hi parasit sandford much as he dislik rushbrook for thi express which compris her father in the reflect turn to matilda in extrem anger but as he saw the color mount to her face for what in the strong feel of her heart had escap her lip he did not say a word and by a flood of tear that follow after he rejoic to see how much she reprov herself miss woodley vex to the

elmwood observ thi he did not appear to observ it and though he receiv her veri polit when she did pay him a visit it wa alway veri coldli nor did she suppos if she never went he would ever ask for her for hi daughter sake howev she thought it right sometim to show herself befor him for she knew it must be imposs that with all hi seem indiffer lord elmwood could ever see her without think for a moment on hi child and what one fortun thought might sometim bring about wa an object too seriou for her to slight she therefor after remain confin to her apart near three week except those short and anxiou walk she and matilda stole while lord elmwood dine or befor he rose in a morn went one forenoon into hi lordship apart where as usual she found him mr sandford and mr rushbrook after she had sat about half an hour convers with them all though but veri littl with the latter hi lordship wa call out of the room upon some busi present after sandford and now not much pleas with the companion with whom she wa left she rose and wa go likewis when rushbrook fix hi speak eye upon her and cri miss woodley will you pardon me what i am go to say certainli sir you can i am sure say noth but what i must forgiv but she made thi repli with a distanc and a reserv veri unlik the usual manner of miss woodley he look at her earnestli and cri ah miss woodley you dont behav so kindli to me as you use

miss woodley she wa more confus than befor and hi lordship turn to him ask what the subject wa by thi time he had invent one and continu hi laugh said miss woodley my lord will to thi day protest she saw my apparit when i wa a boy and she say it is a sign i shall die young and is realli much affect at it lord elmwood turn away befor thi ridicul speech wa conclud yet so well had it been act he did not for an instant doubt it truth miss woodley felt herself greatli reliev and yet so littl is it in the power of those we dislik to do ani thing to pleas us that from thi veri circumst she form a still more unfavour opinion of mr rushbrook than she had done befor she saw in thi littl incid the art of dissimul cun and duplic in it most glare shape and detest the method by which they had each escap lord elmwood suspicion and perhap anger the more becaus it wa so dexter manag ladi matilda and sandford were both in their turn inform of thi trait in mr rushbrook charact and although miss woodley had the best of disposit and upon everi occas spoke the strictest truth yet in relat thi occurr she did not speak all the truth for everi circumst that would have told to the young man
