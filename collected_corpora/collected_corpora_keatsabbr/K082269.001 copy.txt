abash under the scrutin eye of sir robert after much deliber with what subject to begin she rememb that miss larol had been present the first time they had met and thought it probabl they might be acquaint with each other and therefor bend forward she ventur to enquir if she had late seen that young ladi miss leeson in a voic alik inexpress of satisfact or displeasur quietli answer no maam cecilia discourag by thi concis wa a few minut silent but the persever of sir robert in stare at her excit her own in tri to avoid hi eye she exert herself so far as to add doe mr mear expect miss larol here thi even miss leeson without rais her head grave repli i dont know maam all wa now to be done over again and a new subject to be start for she could suggest noth further to ask concern miss larol cecilia had seen littl of life but that littl she had well mark and her observ had taught her that among fashion peopl public place seem a neverfail sourc of convers and entertain upon thi topic therefor she hope for better success and as to those who have spent more time in the countri than in london no place of amus is so interest as a theater she open the subject she had so happili suggest by an enquiri whether ani new play had late come out miss leeson with the same dryness onli answer inde i can not tell anoth paus now follow and the spirit of cecilia were consider dampt but happen accident to recollect the name of almack she present reviv and congratul herself that she should now be abl to speak of a place too fashion for disdain she ask her in a manner somewhat more assur if she wa a subscrib to hi assembl ye maam do you go to them constantli no maam again they were both silent and now tire of find the ill success of each particular enquiri she thought a more gener one might obtain an answer less lacon and therefor beg she would inform her what wa the most fashion place of divers for the present season thi question howev cost miss leeson no more troubl than ani which had preced it for she onli repli inde i dont know cecilia now began to sicken of her attempt and for some minut to give it up as hopeless but afterward when she reflect how frivol were the question she had ask she felt more inclin to pardon the answer she had receiv and in a short time to fanci she had mistaken contempt for stupid and to grow less angri with miss leeson than asham of herself thi supposit excit her to make yet anoth trial of her talent for convers and therefor summon all the courag in her power she modestli apolog for the liberti she wa take and then beg her permiss to enquir whether there wa ani thing new in the literari way that she thought worth recommend miss leeson now turn her eye toward her with a look that impli a doubt whether she had heard right and when the attent attitud of cecilia confirm her question surpris for a few instant took place of insens and with rather more spirit than she had yet shown she answer inde i know noth of the matter cecilia wa now utterli disconcert and half angri with herself and wholli provok with her sullen neighbor she resolv to let noth in futur provok her to a similar trial with so unpromis a subject she had not howev much longer to endur the examin of sir robert who be pretti well satisfi with stare turn upon hi heel and wa stride out of the room when he wa stop by mr gosport who for some time had been watch him mr gosport wa a man of good part and keen satir minut in hi observ and iron in hi express so you dont play sir robert he cri what here no i am go to brookess but how do you like harrel ward you have taken a pretti good survey of her whi faith i dont know but not much i think she is a devilish fine woman too but she ha no spirit no life did you tri her have you talk to her not i truli nay then how do you mean to judg of her o faith that is all over now one never think of talk to the women by way of tri them what other method then have you adopt none none whi then how do you go on whi they talk to us the women take all that troubl upon themselv now and pray how long may you have commenc fade macaroni for thi is a part of your charact with which i wa not acquaint o hang it it is not from ton no it is mere from lazi who the d l will fatigu himself with danc attend upon the women when keep them at a distanc make them danc attend upon us then stalk from him to mr harrel he took him by the arm and they left the room togeth mr gosport now advanc to cecilia and address her so as not to be heard by miss leeson said i have been wish to approach you some time but the fear that you are alreadi overpow by the loquac of your fair neighbor make me cautiou of attempt to engag you you mean said cecilia to laugh at my loquac and inde it ill success ha render it suffici ridicul are you then yet to learn cri he that there are certain young ladi who make it a rule never to speak but to their own croni of thi class is miss leeson and till you get into her particular coteri you must never expect to hear from her a word of two syllabl the ton miss as they are call who now infest the town are in two divis the supercili and the volubl the supercili like miss leeson are silent scorn languid and affect and disdain all convers but with those of their own set the volubl like miss larol are flirt commun restless and familiar and attack without the smallest ceremoni everi one they think worthi their notic but thi they have in common that at home they think of noth but dress abroad of noth but admir and that everi where they hold in suprem contempt all but themselv probabl then said cecilia i have pass to night for one of the volubl howev all the advantag ha been with the supercili for i have suffer a total repuls are you sure howev you have not talk too well for her o a child of five year old ought to have been whip for not talk better but it is not capac alon you are to consult when you talk with miss of the ton were their understand onli to be consid they would inde be wonder easi of access in order therefor to render their commerc somewhat difficult they will onli be pleas by an observ of their humor which are ever most variou and most exuber where the intellect are weakest and least cultiv i have howev a receipt which i have found infal for engag the attent of young ladi of whatsoev charact or denomin o then cri cecilia pray favor me with it for i have here an admir opportun to tri it efficaci i will give it you he answer with full direct when you meet with a young ladi who seem resolut determin not to speak or who if compel by a direct question to make some answer drili give a brief affirm or coldli a lacon neg a case in point interrupt cecilia well thu circumstanc he continu the remedi i have to propos consist of three topic of discours pray what are they dress public place and love cecilia half surpris and half divert wait a fuller explan without give ani interrupt these three topic he continu are to answer three purpos sinc there are no less than three caus from which the silenc of young ladi may proceed sorrow affect and stupid do you then cri cecilia give noth at all to modesti i give much to it he answer as an excus nay almost as an equival for wit but for that sullen silenc which resist all encourag modesti is a mere pretens not a caus you must howev be somewhat more explicit if you mean that i should benefit from your instruct well then he answer i will briefli enumer the three caus with direct for the three method of cure to begin with sorrow the taciturn which realli result from that is attend with an incur absenc of mind and a total unconsci of the observ which it excit upon thi occas public place may sometim be tri in vain and even dress may fail but love are you sure then said cecilia with a laugh that sorrow ha but that one sourc by no mean answer he for perhap papa may have been angri or mama may have been cross a millin may have sent a wrong pompoon or a chaperon to an assembl may have been taken ill bitter subject of afflict inde and are these all you allow us nay i speak but of young ladi of fashion and what of greater import can befal them if therefor the grief of the fair patient proce from papa mama or the chaperon then the mention of public place those endless incent of displeasur between the old and the young will draw forth her complaint and her complaint will bring their own cure for those who lament find speedi consol if the
