at catoshead in russel street covent garden and t edl at the princ arm over against exerterchang in the strand mddcxxi the prefac the world is so taken up of late with novel and romanc that it will be hard for a privat histori to be taken for genuin where the name and other circumst of the person are conceal and on thi account we must be content to leav the reader to pass hi own opinion upon the ensu sheet and take it just as he pleas the author is here suppos to be write her own histori and in the veri begin of her account she give the reason whi she think fit to conceal her true name after which there is no occas to say ani more about that it is true that the origin of thi stori is put into new word and the style of the famou ladi we here speak of is a littl alter particularli she is made to tell her own tale in modest word than she told it at first the copi which came first to hand have been written in languag more like one still in newgat than one grown penit and humbl as she afterward pretend to be the pen employ in finish her stori and make it what you now see it to be ha had no littl difficulti to put it into a dress fit to be seen and to make it speak languag fit to be read when a woman debauch from her youth nay even be the offspr of debaucheri and vice come to give an account of all her viciou practic and even to descend to the particular occas and circumst by which she first becam wick and of all the progress of crime which she run through in threescor year an author must be hard put to it to wrap it up so clean as not to give room especi for viciou reader to turn it to hi disadvantag all possibl care howev ha been taken to give no lewd idea no immodest turn in the new dress up thi stori no not to the worst part of her express to thi purpos some of the viciou part of her life which could not be modestli told is quit left out and sever other part are veri much shortnd what is left it is hope will not offend the chastest reader or the modestest hearer and as the best use is made even of the worst stori the moral it is hope will keep the reader seriou even where the stori might inclin him to be otherwis to give the histori of a wick life repent of necessarili requir that the wickd part should be made as wick as the real histori of it will bear to illustr and give a beauti to the penit part which is certainli the best and brightest if relat with equal spirit and life it is suggest there can not be the same life the same bright and beauti in relat the penit part as is in the crimin part if there is ani truth in that suggest i must be allow to say it is becaus there is not the same tast and relish in the read and inde it is too true that the differ lie not in the real worth of the subject so much as in the gust and palat of the reader but as thi work is chiefli recommend to those who know how to read it and how to make the good use of it which the stori all along recommend to them so it is to be hope that such reader will be much more pleas with the moral than the fabl with the applic than with the relat and with the end of the writer than with the life of the person written of there is in thi stori abund of delight incid and all of them use appli there is an agreeabl turn art given them in the relat that natur instruct the reader either one way or other the first part of her lewd life with the young gentleman at colchest ha

given there against even the law intimaci of the dearest friend and how unabl they are to preserv the most solemn resolut of virtu without divin assist there are part which to a just discern will appear to have more real beauti in them than all the amor chain of stori which introduc it in a word as the whole relat is care garbld of all the leviti and loos that wa in it so it is all appli and with the utmost care to virtuou and religi use none can without be guilti of manifest injustic cast ani reproach upon it or upon our design in publish it the advoc for the stage have in all age made thi the great argument to persuad peopl that their play are use and that they ought to be allow in the most civilzd and in the most religi govern name that they are appli to virtuou purpos and that by the most live represent they fail not to recommend virtu and gener principl and to discourag and expos all sort of vice and corrupt of manner and were it true that they did so and that they constantli adher to that rule as the test of their act on the theater much might be said in their favor throughout the infinit varieti of thi book thi fundament is most strictli adher to there is not a wick action in ani part of it but is first and last render unhappi and unfortun there is not a superl villain brought upon the stage but either he is brought to an unhappi end or brought to be a penit there is not an ill thing mentiod but it is condemn even in the relat nor a virtuou just thing but it carri it prais along with it what can more exactli answer the rule laid down to recommend even those represent of thing which have so mani other just object lie against them name of exampl of bad compani obscen languag and the like upon thi foundat thi book is recommend to the reader as a work from everi part of which someth may be learn and some just and religi infer is drawn by which the reader will have someth of instruct if he pleas to make use of it all the exploit of thi ladi of fame in her depred upon mankind stand as so mani warn to honest peopl to bewar of them intim to them by what method innoc peopl are drawn in plunder and rob and by consequ how to avoid them her rob a littl innoc child dress fine by the vaniti of the mother to go to the dancingschool is a good memento to such peopl hereaft as is likewis her pick the goldwatch from the young ladi side in the park her get a parcel from a hairbrain wench at the coach in st johnstreet her booti made at the fire and again at harwich all give us excel warn in such case to be more present to ourselv in sudden surpris of everi sort her applic to a sober life and industri manag at last in virginia with her transport spous is a stori fruit of instruct to all the unfortun creatur who are oblig to seek their reestablish abroad whether by the miseri of transport or other disast let them know that dilig and applic have their due encourag even in the remotest part of the world and that no case can be so low so despic or so empti of prospect but that an unweari industri will go a great way to deliv us from it will in time rais the meanest creatur to appear again in the world and give him a new cast for hi life these are a few of the seriou infer which we are led by the hand to in thi book and these are fulli suffici to justifi ani man in recommend it to the world and much more to justifi the public of it there are two of the most beauti part still behind which thi stori give some idea of and let us into the part of them but they are either of them too long to be brought into the same volum and inde are as i may call them whole volum of themselv viz the life of her gover as she call her who had run through it seem in a few year all the emin degre of a gentlewoman a whore and a bawd a midwif and a midwifekeep as they are call a pawnbrok a childtak a receiv of thiev and of thiev purchas that is to say of stolen good and in a word her self a thief a breeder up of thiev and the like and yet at last a penit the second is the life of her transport husband a highwayman who it seem live a twelv year life of success villaini upon the road and even at last came off so well as to be a volunti transport not a convict and in whose life there is an incred varieti but as i have said these are thing too long to bring in here so neither can i make a promis of their come out by themselv we can not say inde that thi histori is carri on quit to the end of the life of thi famou moll flander as she call her self for no bodi can write their own life to the full end of it unless they can write it after they are dead but her husband life be written by a third hand give a full account of them both how long they live togeth in that countri and how they came both to england again after about eight year in which time they were grown veri rich and where she live it seem to be veri old but wa not so extraordinari a penit as she wa at first it seem onli that inde she alway spoke with abhor of her former life and of everi part of it in her last scene at maryland and virginia mani pleasant thing happen which make that part of her life veri agreeabl but they are not told with the same eleg as those account for by herself so it is still to the more advantag that we break off here the histori and misfortun of the famou moll flander etc my true name is so well known in the record or regist at newgat and in the old bailey and there are some thing of such consequ still depend there relat to my particular conduct that it is not to be expect i should set my name or the account of my famili to thi work perhap after my death it may be better known at present it would not be proper no not though a gener pardon should be issu even without except and reserv of person or crime it is enough to tell you that as some of my worst comrad who are out of the way of do me harm have gone out of the world by the step and the string as i often expect to go know me by the name of moll flander so you may give me leav to speak of myself under that name till i dare own who i have been as well as who i am i have been told that in one of our neighbor nation whether it be in franc or where els i know not they have an order from the king that when ani crimin is condemn either to die or to the galley or to be transport if they leav ani children as such are gener unprovid for by the poverti or forfeitur of their parent so they are immedi taken into the care of the govern and put into an hospit call the hous of orphan where they are bred up cloth fed taught and when fit to go out are place out to trade or to servic so as to be well abl to provid for themselv by an honest industri behavior had thi been the custom in our countri i had not been left a poor desol girl without friend without cloth without help or helper in the world as wa my fate and by which i wa not onli expos to veri great distress even befor i wa capabl either of understand my case or how to amend it nor brought into a cours of life which wa not onli scandal in itself but which in it ordinari cours tend to the swift destruct both of soul and bodi but the case wa otherwis here my mother wa convict of feloni for a certain petti theft scarc worth name viz have an opportun of borrow three piec of fine holland of a certain draper in cheapsid the circumst are too long to repeat and i have heard them relat so mani way that i can scarc be certain which is the right account howev it wa thi they all agre in that my mother plead her belli and be found quick with child she wa respit for about seven month in which time have brought me into the world and be about again she wa call down as they term it to her former judgment but obtain the favor of be transport to the plantat and left me about half a year old and in bad hand you may be sure thi is too near the first hour of my life for me to relat ani thing of myself but by hearsay it is enough to mention that as i wa born in such an unhappi place i had no parish to have recours to for my nourish in my infanc nor can i give the least account how i wa kept aliv other than that as i have been told some relat of my mother took me away for a while as a nurs but at whose expens or by whose direct i know noth at all of it the first account that i can recollect or could ever learn of myself wa that i had wander among a crew of those peopl they call gypsi or egyptian but i believ it wa but a veri littl while that i had been among them for i had not had my skin discolor or blacken as they do veri young to all the children they carri about with them nor can i tell how i came among them or how i got from them it wa at colchest in essex that those peopl left me and i have a notion in my head that i left them there that is that i hid myself and would not go ani farther with them but i am not abl to be particular in that account onli thi i rememb that be taken up by some of the parish offic of colchest i gave an account that i came into the town with the gypsi but that i would not go ani farther with them and that so they had left me but whether they were gone that i knew not nor could they expect it of me for though they sent round the countri to enquir after them it seem they could not be found i wa now in a way to be provid for for though i wa not a parish charg upon thi or that part of the town by law yet as my case came to be known and that i wa too young to do ani work be not abov three year old compass move the magistr of the town to order some care to be taken of me and i becam one of their own as much as if i had been born in the place in the provis they made for me it wa my good hap to be put to nurs as they call it to a woman who wa inde poor but had been in better circumst and who got a littl livelihood by take such as i wa suppos to be and keep them with all necessari till they were at a certain age in which it might be suppos they might go to servic or get their own bread thi woman had also had a littl school which she kept to teach children to read and to work and have as i have said live befor that in good fashion she bred up the children she took with a great deal of art as well as with a great deal of care but that which wa worth all the rest she bred them up veri religi be herself a veri sober piou woman veri housewifli and clean and veri mannerli and with good behavior so that in a word except a plain diet cours lodg and mean cloth we were brought up as mannerli and as gente as if we had been at the dancingschool i wa continu here till i wa eight year old when i wa terrifi with news that the magistr as i think they call them had order that i should go to servic i wa abl to do but veri littl servic where ever i wa to go except it wa to run of errand and be a druge to some cookmaid and thi they told me of often which put me into a great fright for i had a thorough avers to go to servic as they call it that is to be a servant though i wa so young and i told my nurs as we call her that i believ i could get my live without go to servic if she pleas to let me for she had taught me to work with my needl and spin worst which is the chief trade of that citi and i told her that if she would keep me i would work for her and i would work veri hard i talk to her almost everi day of work hard and in short i did noth but work and cri all day which griev the good kind woman so much that at last she began to be concern for me for she love me veri well one day after thi as she came into the room were all we poor children were at work she sat down just over against me not in her usual place as mistress but as if she set herself on purpos to observ me and see me work i wa do someth she had set me to as i rememb it wa mark some shirt which she had taken to make and after a while she began to talk to me thou foolish child say she thou art alway cri for i wa cri then prithe what do cri for becaus they will take me away say i and put me to servic and i can not work housework well child say she but though you can not work housework as you call it you will learn it in time and they will not put you to hard thing at first ye they will say i and if i can not do it they will beat me and the maid will beat me to make me do great work and i am but a littl girl and i can not do it and then i cri again till i could not speak ani more to her thi move my good motherli nurs so that she from that time resolv i should not go to servic yet so she bid me not cri and she would speak to mr mayor and i should not go to servic till i wa bigger well thi did not satisfi me for to think of go to servic wa such a fright thing to me that if she had assur me i should not have gone till i wa year old it would have been the same to me i should have cri i believ all the time with the veri apprens of it be to be so at last when she saw that i wa not pacifi yet she began to be angri with me and what would you have say she dont i tell you that you shall not go to servic till you are bigger ay say i but then i must go at last whi what said she is the girl mad what would you be a gentlewoman ye say i and cri heartili till i roar out again thi set the old gentlewoman a laugh at me as you may be sure it would well madam forsooth say she gibe at me you would be a gentlewoman and pray how will you come to be a gentlewoman what will you do it by your finger end ye say i again veri innoc whi what can you earn say she what can you get at your work threepenc said i when i spin and d when i work plain work ala poor gentlewoman said she again laugh what will that do for thee it will keep me say i if you will let me live with you and thi i said in such a poor petit tone that it made the poor woman heart yearn to me as she told me afterward but say she that will not keep you and buy you cloth too and who must buy the littl gentlewoman cloth say she and smile all the while at me i will work harder then say i and you shall have it all poor child it will not keep you say she it will hardli keep you in victual then i will have no victual say i again veri innoc let me but live with you whi can you live without victual say she ye again say i veri much like a child you may be sure and still i cri heartili i had no polici in all thi you may easili see it wa all natur but it wa join with so much innoc and so much passion that in short it set the good motherli creatur a weep too and she cri at last as fast as i did and then took me and led me out of the teach room come say she you shall not go to servic you shall live with me and thi pacifi me for the present sometim after thi she go to wait on the mayor and talk of such thing as belong to her busi at last my stori came up and my good nurs told mr mayor the whole tale he wa so pleas with it that he would call hi ladi and hi two daughter to hear it and it made mirth enough among them you may be sure howev not a week had pass over but on a sudden come mr mayoress and her two daughter to the hous to see my old nurs and to see her school and the children when they had look about them a littl well mr say the mayoress to my nurs and pray which is the littl lass that intend to be a gentlewoman i heard her and i wa terribl fright at first though i did not know whi neither but mr mayoress come up to me well miss say she and what are you at work upon the word miss wa a languag that had hardli been heard of in our school and i wonder what sad name it wa she call me howev i stood up made a curtsi and she took my work out of my hand look on it and said it wa veri well then she took up one of my hand nay say she the child may come to be a gentlewoman for ought ani bodi know she ha a gentlewoman hand say she thi pleas me mightili you may be sure but mr mayoress did not stop there but give me my work again she put her hand in her pocket gave me a shill and bid me mind my work and learn to work well and i might be a gentlewoman for ought she knew now all thi while my good old nurs mr mayoress and all the rest of them did not understand me at all for they meant one sort of thing by the word gentlewoman and i meant quit anoth for ala all i understood by be a gentlewoman wa to be abl to work for myself and get enough to keep me without that terribl bugbear go to servic wherea they meant to live great rich and high and i know not what well after mr mayoress wa gone her two daughter came in and they call for the gentlewoman too and they talk a long while to me and i answer them in my innoc way but alway if they ask me whether i resolv to be a gentlewoman i answer ye at last one of them ask me what a gentlewoman wa that puzzeld me much but howev i explain myself neg that it wa one that did not go to servic to do housework they were pleas to be familiar me and like my littl prattl to them which it seem wa agreeabl enough to them and they gave me money too as for my money i gave it all to my mistress nurs as i call her and told her she should have all i got for myself when i wa a gentlewoman as well as now by thi and some other of my talk my old tutress began to understand me about what i meant by be a gentlewoman and that i understood by it to no more than to be abl to get my bread by my own work and at last she ask me whether it wa not so i told her ye and insist on it that to do so wa to be a gentlewoman for say i there is such a one name a woman that mend lace and wash the ladi lacdhead she say i is a gentlewoman and they call her madam poor child say my good old nurs you may soon be such a gentlewoman as that for she is a person of ill fame and ha had two or three bastard i did not understand ani thing of that but i answer i am sure they call her madam and she doe not go to servic nor do housework and therefor i insist that she wa a gentlewoman and i would be such a gentlewoman as that the ladi were told all thi again to be sure and they made themselv merri with it and everi now and then the young ladi mr mayor daughter would come and see me and ask where the littl gentlewoman wa which made me not a littl proud of myself thi held a great while and i wa often visit by these young ladi and sometim they brought other with them so that i wa known by it almost all over the town i wa now about ten year old and began to look a littl womanish for i wa mighti grave and humbl veri mannerli and as i had often heard the ladi say i wa pretti and would be a veri handsom woman so you may be sure that hear them say so made me not a littl proud howev that pride had no ill effect upon me yet onli as they often gave me money and i gave it my old nurs she honest woman wa so just to me as to lay it all out again for me and gave me headdress and linen and glove and ribbon and i went veri neat and alway clean for that i would do and if i had rag on i would alway be clean or els i would dabbl them in water myself but i say my good nurs when i had money given me veri honestli laid it out for me and would alway tell the ladi thi or that wa bought with their money and thi made them oftentim give me more till at last i wa inde call upon by the magistr as i understood it to go out to servic but then i wa come to be so good a workwoman myself and the ladi were so kind to me that it wa plain i could maintain myself that is to say i could earn as much for my nurs as she wa abl by it to keep me so she told them that if they would give her leav she would keep the gentlewoman as she call me to be her assist and teach the children which i wa veri well abl to do for i wa veri nimbl at my work and had a good hand with my needl though i wa yet veri young but the kind of the ladi of the town did not end here for when they came to understand that i wa no more maintain by the public allow as befor they gave me money often than formerli and as i grew up they brought me work to do for them such as linen to make and lace to mend and head to dress up and not onli paid me for do them but even taught me how to do them so that now i wa a gntlewoman inde as i understood that word and as i desir to be for by that time i wa twelv year old i not onli found myself cloth and paid my nurs for my keep but got money in my pocket too beforehand the ladi also gave me cloth frequent of their own or their children some stock some petticoat some gown some one thing some anoth and these my old woman manag for me like a mere mother and kept them for me oblig me to mend them and turn them and twist them to the best advantag for she wa a rare housewif at last one of the ladi took so much fanci to me that she would have me home to her hous for a month she said to be among her daughter now though thi wa exceed kind in her yet as my old good woman said to her unless she resolv to keep me for good and all she would do the littl gentlewoman more harm then good well say the ladi that is true and therefor i will onli take her home for a week then that i may see how my daughter and she agre togeth and how i like her temper and then i will tell you more and in the mean time if ani bodi come to see her as they use to do you may onli tell them you have sent her out to my hous thi wa prudent manag enough and i went to the ladi hous but i wa so pleas there with the young ladi and they so pleas with me that i had enough to do to come away and they were as unwil to part with me howev i did come away and live almost a year more with my honest old woman and began now to be veri help to her for i wa almost fourteen year old wa tall of my age and look a littl womanish but i had such a tast of genteel live at the ladi hous that i wa not so easi in my old quarter as i use to be and i thought it wa fine to be a gentlewoman inde for i had quit other notion of a gentlewoman now than i had befor and as i thought i say that it wa fine to be a gentlewoman so i love to be among gentlewomen and therefor i long to be there again about the time that i wa fourteen year and a quarter old my good old nurs mother i ought rather to call her fell sick and dy i wa then in a sad condit inde for as there is no great bustl in put an end to a poor bodi famili when onc they are carri to the grave so the poor good woman be buri the parish children she kept were immedi remov by the churchwarden the school wa at an end and the children of it had no more to do but just stay at home till they were sent some where els and as for what she left her daughter a marri woman with six or seven children came and swept it all away at onc and remov the good they had no more to say to me than to jest with me and tell me that the littl gentlewoman might set up for her self if she pleas i wa fright out of my wit almost and knew not what to do for i wa as it were turn out of door to the wide world and that which wa still wors the old honest woman had two and twenti shill of mine in her hand which wa all the estat the littl gentlewoman had in the world and when i ask the daughter for it she huft me and laugh at me and told me she had noth to do with it it wa true the good poor woman had told her daughter of it and that it lay in such a place that it wa the child money and had call onc or twice for me to give it me but i wa unhappili out of the way some where or other and when i came back she wa past be in a condit to speak of it howev the daughter wa so honest afterward as to give it me though at first she use me cruelli about it now wa i a poor gentlewoman inde and i wa just that veri night to be turn into the wide world for the daughter remov all the good and i had not so much as a lodg to go to or a bit of bread to eat but it seem some of the neighbor who had known my circumst took so much compass of me as to acquaint the ladi in whose famili i had been a week as i mention abov and immedi she sent her maid to fetch me away and two of her daughter came with the maid though unsent so i went with them bag and baggag and with a glad heart you may be sure the fright of my condit had made such an impress upon me that i did not want now to be a gentlewoman but wa veri will to be a servant and that ani kind of servant they thought fit to have me be but my new gener mistress for she exceed the good woman i wa with befor in everi thing as well as in the matter of estat i say in everi thing except honesti and for that tho thi wa a ladi most exactli just yet i must not forget to say on all occas that the first tho poor wa as uprightli honest as it wa possibl for ani one to be i wa no sooner carri away as i have said by thi good gentlewoman but the first ladi that is to say the mayoress that wa sent her two daughter to take care of me and anoth famili which had taken notic of me when i wa the littl gentlewoman and had given me work to do sent for me after her so that i wa mightili made of as we say nay and they were not a littl angri especi madam the mayoress that her friend had taken me away from her as she call it for as she said i wa her by right she have been the first that took ani notic of me but they that had me would no part with me and as for me though i should have been veri well treat with ani of the other yet i could not be better than where i wa here i continu till i wa between and year old and here i had all the advantag for my educ that could be imagin the ladi had master home to the hous to teach her daughter to danc and to speak french and to write and other to teach them music and as i wa alway with them i learn as fast as they and though the master were not appoint to teach me yet i learn by imit and enquiri all that they learn by instruct and direct so that in short i learn to danc and speak french as well as ani of them and to sing much better for i had a better voic than ani of them i could not so readili come at play on the harpsicord or spinnet becaus i had no instrument of my own to practic on and could onli come at their in the interv when they left it which wa uncertain but yet i learn toller well too and the young ladi at length got two instrument that is to say a harpsicord and a spinnet too and then they taught me themselv but as to danc they could hardli help my learn countri danc becaus they alway want me to make up even number and on the other hand they were as heartili will to learn me everi thing that they had been taught themselv as i could be to take the learn by thi mean i had as i have said abov all the advantag of educ that i could have had if i had been as much a gentlewoman as they were with whom i live and in some thing i had the advantag of my ladi though they were my superior but they were all the gift of natur and which all their fortun could not furnish first i wa appar handsom than ani of them secondli i wa better shape and thirdli i sung better by which i mean i had a better voic in all which you will i hope allow me to say i do not speak my own conceit of myself but the opinion of all that knew the famili i had with all these the common vaniti of my sex viz that be realli taken for veri handsom or if you pleas for a great beauti i veri well knew it and had as good an opinion of myself as ani bodi els could have of me and particularli i love to hear ani bodi speak of it which could not but happen to me sometim and wa a great satisfact to me thu far i have had a smooth stori to tell of myself and in all thi part of my life i not onli had the reput of live in a veri good famili and a famili note and respect everi where for virtu and sobrieti and for everi valluabl thing but i had the charact too of a veri sober modest and virtuou young woman and such i had alway been neither had i yet ani occas to think of ani thing els or to know what a temptat to wicked meant but that which i wa too vain of wa my ruin or rather my vaniti wa the caus of it the ladi in the hous where i wa had two son young gentlemen of veri promis part and of extraordinari behavior and it wa my misfortun to be veri well with them both but they manag themselv with me in a quit differ manner the eldest a gay gentleman that knew the town as well as the countri and though he had leviti enough to do an illnatur thing yet had too much judgment of thing to pay too dear for hi pleasur he began with that unhappi snare to all women viz take notic upon all occas how pretti i wa as he call it how agreeabl how well carriag and the like and thi he contriv so subtli as if he had known as well how to catch a woman in hi net as a patridg when he went a set for he would contriv to be talk thi to hi sister when though i wa not by yet when he knew i wa not so far off but that i should be sure to hear him hi sister would return softli to him hush brother she will hear you she is but in the next room then he would put it off and talk softlier as if he had not known it and begun to ackowledg he wa wrong and then as if he had forgot himself he would speak aloud again and i that wa so well pleas to hear it wa sure to lissen for it upon all occas after he had thu bait hi hook and found easili enough the method how to lay it in my way he play an open game and one day go by hi sister chamber when i wa there do someth about dress her he come in with an air of gayti o mr betti said he to me how do you do mr betti dont your cheek burn mr betti i made a curtsi and blush but said noth what make you talk so brother say the ladi whi say he we have been talk of her below stair thi half hour well say hi sister you can say no harm of her that i am sure so it is no matter what you have been talk about nay say he it is so far from talk harm of her that we have been talk a great deal of good and a great mani fine thing have been said of mr betti i assur you and particularli that she is the handsomest young woman in colchest and in short they begin to toast her health in the town i wonder at you brother say the sister betti want but one thing but she had as good want everi thing for the market is against our sex just now and if a young woman have beauti birth breed wit sens manner modesti and all these to an extrem yet if she have not money she is no bodi she had ha good want them all for noth but money now recommend a woman the men play the game all into their own hand her younger brother who wa by cri hold sister you run too fast i am an except to your rule i assur you if i find a woman so accomplish as you talk of i say i assur you i would not troubl myself about the money o say the sister but you will take care not to fanci one then without the money you dont know that neither say the brother but whi sister say the elder brother whi do you exclaim so at the men for aim so much at the fortun you are none of them that want a fortun what ever els you want i understand you brother repli the ladi veri smartli you suppos i have the money and want the beauti but as time go now the first will do without the last so i have the better of my neighbor well say the younger brother but your neighbor as you call them may be even with you for beauti will steal a husband sometim in spite of money and when the maid chanc to be handsom than the mistress she oftentim make as good a market and ride in a coach befor her i thought it wa time for me to withdraw and leav them and i did so but not so far but that i heard all their discours in which i heard abund of fine thing said of myself which serv to prompt my vaniti but as i soon found wa not the way to increas my interest in the famili for the sister and the younger brrother fell grievious out about it and as he said some veri dissoblig thing to her upon my account so i could easili see that she resent them by her futur conduct to me which inde wa veri unjust to me for i had never had the least thought of what she suspect as to her younger brother inde the elder brother in hi distant remot way had said a great mani thing as in jest which i had the folli to believ were in earnest or to flatter myself with the hope of what i ought to have suppos he never intend and perhap never thought of it happen one day that he came run up stair toward the room where hi sister use to sit and work as he often use to do and call to them befor he came in as wa hi way too i be there alon step to the door and said sir the ladi are not here they are walk down the garden as i step forward to say thi toward the door he wa just got to the door and clasp me in hi arm as if it had been by chanc o mr betti say he are you here that is better still i want to speak with you more than i do with them and then have me in hi arm he kiss me three or four time i struggl to get away and yet did it but faintli neither and he held me fast and still kiss me till he wa almost out of breath and then sit down say dear betti i am in love with you hi word i must confess fire my blood all my spirit flew about my heart and put me into disord enough which he might easili have seen in my face he repeat it afterward sever time that he wa in love with me and my heart spoke as plain as a voic that i like it nay when ever he said i am in love with you my blush plainli repli would you were sir howev noth els pass at that time it wa but a surpris and when he wa gone i soon recov myself again he had stay longer with me but he happen to look out at the window and see hi sister come up the garden so he took hi leav kiss me again told me he wa veri seriou and i should hear more of him veri quickli and away he went leav me infinit pleas though surpris and had there not been one misforun in it i had been in the right but the mistak lay here that mr betti wa in earnest and the gentleman wa not from thi time my head run upon strang thing and i may truli say i wa not myself to have such a gentleman talk to me of be in love with me and of my be such a charm creatur as he told me i wa these were thing i knew not how to bear my vaniti wa elev to the last degre it is true i had my head full of pride but know noth of the wicked of the time i had not one thought of my own safeti or of my virtu about me and had my young master offer it at first sight he might have taken ani liberti he thought sit with me but he did not see hi advantag which wa my happi for that time after thi attack it wa not long but he found an opportun to catch me again and almost in the same postur inde it had more of design in it on hi part though not on my part it wa thu the young ladi were all gone a visit with their mother hi brother wa out of town and as for hi father he had been at london for a week befor he had so well watch me that he knew where i wa though i did not so much as know that he wa in the hous and he briskli come up the stair and see me at work come into the room to me directli and began just as he did befor with take me in hi arm and kiss me for almost a quarter of an hour togeth it wa hi younger sister chamber that i wa in and as there wa no bodi in the hous but the maid below stair he wa it may be the ruder in short he began to be in earnest with me inde perhap he found me a littl too easi for god know i made no resist to him while he onli held me in hi arm and kiss me inde i wa too well pleas with it to resist him much howev as it were tire with that kind of work we sat down and there he talk with me a great while he said he wa charm with me and that he could not rest night or day till he had told me how he wa in love with me and if i wa abl to love him again and would make him happi i should be the save of hi life and mani such fine thing i said littl to him again but easili discov that i wa a fool and that i did not in the least perceiv what he meant then he walk about the room and take me by the hand i walk with him and by and by take hi advantag he threw me down upon the bed and kiss me there most violent but to give him hi due offer no manner of rude to me onli kiss me a great while after thi he thought he had heard some bodi come up stair so he got off from the bed lift me up profess a great deal of love for me but told me it wa all an honest affect and that he meant no ill to me and with that he put five guinea into my hand and went away down stair i wa more confound with the money than i wa befor with the love and began to be so elev that i scarc knew the ground i stood on i am the more particular in thi part that if my stori come to be read by ani innoc young bodi they may learn from it to guard themselv against the mischief which attend an earli knowledg of their own beauti if a young woman onc think herself handsom she never doubt the truth of ani man that tell her he is in love with her for if she believ herself charm enough to captiv him it is natur to expect the effect of it thi young gentleman had fire hi inclin as much as he had my vaniti and as if he had found that he had an opportun and wa sorri he did not take hold of it he come up again in half an hour or thereabout and fall to work with me again as befor onli with a littl less introduct and first when he enter the room he turn about and shut the door mr betti said he i fanci befor some bodi wa come up stair but it wa not so howev add he if they find me in the room with you they shall not catch me a kiss of you i told him i did not know who should be come up stair for i believ there wa no bodi in the hous but the cook and the other maid and they never came up those stair well my dear say he it is good to be sure howev and so he sit down and we began to talk and now though i wa still all on fire with hi first visit and said littl he did as it were put word in my mouth tell me how passion he love me and that though he could not mention such a thing till he came to hi estat yet he wa resolv to make me happi then and himself too that is to say to marri me and abund of such fine thing which i poor fool did not understand the drift off but act as if there wa no such thing as ani kind of love but that which tend to matrimoni and if he had spoke of that i had no room as well as no power to have said no but we were not come that length yet we had not sat long but he got up and stope my veri breath with kiss threw me upon the bed again but then be both well warm he went farther with me then decenc permit me to mention nor had it been in my power to have deni him at that moment had he offer much more than he did howev though he took these freedom with me it did not go to that which they call the last favor which to do him justic he did not attempt and he made that self denial of hi a plea for all hi freedom with me upon other occas after thi when thi wa over he stay but a littl while but he put almost a hand of gold in my hand and left me make a thousand protest of hi passion for me and of hi love me abov all the women in the world it will not be strang if i now began to think but ala it wa but with veri littl solid reflect i had a most unbound stock of vaniti and pride and but a veri littl stock of virtu i did inde cast sometim with myself what my young master aim at but thought of noth but the fine word and the gold whether he intend to marri me or not to marri me seem a matter of no great consequ to me nor did my thought so much as suggest to me the necess of make ani capitul for myself till he came to make a kind of formal propos to me as you shall hear present thu i gave up myself to a readi of be ruin without the least concern and am a fair memento to all young women whose vaniti prevail over their virtu noth wa ever so stupid on both side had i act as becam me and resist as virtu and honor requir thi gentleman had either desist hi attack find no room to expect the accomplish of hi design or had made fair and honor propos of marriag in which case whoever had blame him no bodi could have blame me in short if he had known me and how easi the trifl he aim at wa to be had he would have troubl hi head no farther but have given me four or five guinea and have lain with me the next time he had come at me and if i had known hi thought and how hard he thought i would be to be gain i might have made my own term with him and if i had not capitul for an immedi marriag i might for a mainten till marriag and might have had what i would for he wa alreadi rich to excess besid what he had in expect but i seem wholli to have abandon all such thought as these and wa taken up onli with the pride of my beauti and of be be love by such a gentleman as for the gold i spent whole hour in look upon it i told the guinea over and over a thousand time a day never poor vain creatur wa to wrap up with everi part of the stori as i wa not consid what wa befor me and how near my ruin wa at the door inde i think i rather wish for that ruin than studi to avoid it in the mean time howev i wa cun enough not to give the least room to ani in the famili to suspect me or to imagin that i had the least correspond with thi young gentleman i scarc ever look toward him in public or answer if he spoke to me if ani bodi wa near us but for all that we had everi now and then a littl encount where we had room for a word or two and now and then a kiss but no fair opportun for the mischief intend and especi consid that he made more circumlocut than if he had known my thought he had occas for and the work appear difficult to him he realli made it so but as the devil is an unweari tempter so he never fail to find opportun for that wicked he invit to it wa one even that i wa in the garden with hi two younger sister and himself and all veri innoc merri when he found mean to convey a note into my hand by which he direct me to understand that he would to morrow desir me to publicli to go of an errand for him into the town and that i should see him somewher by the way accordingli after dinner he veri grave say to me hi sister be all by mr betti i must ask a favor of you what is that say hi second sister nay sister say be veri grave if you can not spare mr betti to day ani other time will do ye they said they could spare her well enough and the sister beg pardon for ask which she did but of mere cours without ani mean well but brother say the eldest sister you must tell mr betti what it is if it be ani privat busi that we must not hear you may call her out there she is whi sister say the gentleman veri grave what do you mean i onli desir her to go into the high street and then he pull out a turnov to such a shop and then he tell them a long stori of two fine neckcloth he had bid money for and he want to have me go and make an errand to buy a neck to the turnov that he show to see if they would take my money for the neckcloth to bid a shill more and haggl with them and then he made more errand and so continu to have such petti busi to do that i should be sure to stay a good while when he had given me my errand he told them a long stori of a visit he wa go to make to a famili they all knew and where wa to be such and such gentlemen and how merri they were to be and veri formal ask hi sister to go with him and they as formal excus themselv becaus of compani that they had notic wa to come and visit them that afternoon which by the way he had contriv on purpos he had scarc done speak to them and give me my errand but thi man came up to tell him that sir w h s coach stop at the door so he run down and come up again immedi ala say he aloud there is all my mirth spoil at onc sir w ha sent hi coach for me and desir to speak with me upon some earnest busi it seem thi sir w wa a gentleman who live about three mile out of town to whom he had spoken on purpos the day befor to lend him hi chariot for a particular occas and had appoint it to call for him as it did about three aclock immedi he call for hi best wig hat and sword and order hi man to go to the other place to make hi excus that wa to say he made an excus to send hi man away he prepar to go into the coach as he wa go he stop a while and speak mighti earnestli to me about hi busi and find an opportun to say veri softli to me come away my dear as soon as ever you can i said noth but made a curtsi as if i had done so to what he said in public in about a quarter of an hour i went out too i had no dress other than befor except that i had a hood a mask a fan and a pair of glove in my pocket so that there wa not the least suspicion in the hous he wait for me in the coach in a back lane which he knew i must pass by and had direct the coachman whether to go which wa to a certain place call mileend where live a confid of hi where we went in and where wa all the conveni in the world to be as wick as we pleas when we were togeth he began to talk veri grave to me and to tell me he did not bring me there to betray me that hi passion for me would not suffer him to abus me that he resolv to marri me as soon as he came to hi estat that in the mean time if i would grant hi request he would maintain me veri honor and made me a thousand protest of hi sincer and of hi affect to me and that he would never abandon me and as i may say made a thousand more preambl than he need to have done howev as he press me to speak i told him i had no reason to question the sincer of hi love to me after so mani protest but and there i stop as if i left him to guess the rest but what my dear say he i guess what you mean what if you should be with child is not that it whi then say he i will take care of you and provid for you and the child too and that you may see i am not in jest say he here is an earnest for you and with that he pull out a silk purs with an hundr guinea in it and gave it me and i will give you such anoth say he everi year till i marri you my color came and went at the sight of the purs and with the fire of hi propos togeth so that i could not say a word and he easili perceiv it so put the purs into my bosom i made no more resist to him but let him do just what he pleas and as often as he pleas and thu i finish my own destruct at onc for from thi day be forsaken of my virtu and my modesti i had noth of valu left to recommend me either to god bless or man assist but thing did not end here i went back to the town did the busi he publicli direct me to and wa at home befor ani bodi thought me long as for my gentleman he staid out as he told me he would till late at night and there wa not the least suspicion in the famili either on hi account or on mine we had after thi frequent opportun to repeat our crime chiefli by hi contriv especi at home when hi mother and the young ladi went abroad a visit which he watch so narrowli as never to miss know alway beforehand when they went out and then fail not to catch me all alon and secur enough so that we took our fill of our wick pleasur for near half a year and yet which wa the most to my satisfact i wa not with child but befor thi half year wa expir hi younger brother of whom i have made some mention in the begin of the stori fall to work with me and he find me alon in the garden one even begin a stori of the same kind to me made good honest profess of be in love with me and in short propos fairli and honor to marri me and that befor he made ani other offer to me at all i wa now confound and driven to such an extrem as the like wa never known at least not to me i resist the propos with obstin and now i began to arm my self with argument i laid befor him the inequal of the match the treatment i should meet with in the famili the ingratitud it would be to hi good father and mother who had taken me into their hous upon such gener principl and when i wa in such a low condit and in short i said everi thing to dissuad him from hi design that i could imagin except tell him the truth which would inde have put an end to it all but that i durst not think of mention but here happen a circumst that i did not expect inde which put me to my shift for thi young gentleman as he wa plain and honest so he pretend to noth with me but what wa so too and know hi own innoc he wa not so care to make hi have a kind for mr betti a secret in the hous as hi brother wa and though he did not let them know that he had talk to me about it yet he said enough to let hi sister perceiv he love me and hi mother saw it too which though they took no notic of it to me yet they did to him and immedi i found their carriag to me alter more than ever befor i saw the cloud though i did not forese the storm it wa easi i say to see that their carriag to me wa alter and that it grew wors and wors everi day till at last i got inform among the servant that i should in a veri littl while be desir to remov i wa not alarm at the news have a full satisfact that i should be otherwis provid for and especi consid that i had reason everi day to expect i should be with child and that then i should be oblig to remov without ani pretens for it after some time the younger gentleman took an opportun to tell me that the kind he had for me had got vent in the famili he did not charg me with it he said for he knew well enough which way it came out he told me hi plain way of talk had been the occas of it for that he did not make hi respect for me so much a secret as he might have done and the reason wa that he wa at a point that if i would consent to have him he would tell them all openli that he love me and that he intend to marri me that it wa true hi father and mother might resent it and be unkind but that he wa now in a way to live be bred to the law and he did not fear maintain me agreeabl to what i should expect and that in short as he believ i would not be asham of him so he wa resolv not to be asham of me and that he scorn to be afraid to own me now who he resolv to own after i wa hi wife and therefor i had noth to do but to give him my hand and he would answer for all the rest i wa now in a dread condit inde and now i repent heartili my easi with the eldest brother not from ani reflect of conscienc but from a view of the happi i might have enjoy and had now made imposs for though i had no great scrupl of conscienc as i have said to struggl with yet i could not think of be a whore to one brother and a wife to the other but then it came into my thought that the first brother had promis to make me hi wife when he came to hi estat but i present rememb what i had often thought of that he had never spoken a word of have me for a wife after he had conquer me for a mistress and inde till now though i said i thought of it often yet it gave me no disturb at all for as he did not seem in the least to lessen hi affect to me so neither did he lessen hi bounti though he had the discret himself to desir me not to lay out a penni of what he gave me in cloth or to make the least show extraordinari becaus it would necessarili give jealousi in the famili sinc everi bodi knew i could come at such thing no manner of ordinari way but by some privat friendship which they would present have suspect but i wa now in a great strait and realli knew not what to do the main difficulti wa thi the younger brother not onli laid close sieg to me but suffer it to be seen he would come into hi sister room and hi mother room and sit down and talk a thousand kind thing of me and to me even befor their face and when they were all there thi grew so public that the whole hous talk of it and hi mother reprov him for it and their carriag to me appear quit alter in short hi mother had let fall some speech as if she intend to put me out of the famili that is in english to turn me out of door now i wa sure thi could not be a secret to hi brother onli that he might not think as inde no bodi els yet did that the youngest brother had made ani propos to me about it but as i easili could see that it would go farther so i saw likewis there wa an absolut necess to speak of it to him or that he would speak of it to me and which to do first i knew not that is whether i should break it to him or let it alon till he should break it to me upon seriou consider for inde now i began to consid thing veri serious and never till now i say upon seriou consider i resolv to tell him of it first and it wa not long befor i had an opportun for the veri next day hi brother went to london upon some busi and the famili be out a visit just as it had happen befor and as inde wa often the case he came accord to hi custom to spend an hour or two with mr betti when he came and had sat down a while he easili perceiv there wa an alter in my counten that i wa not so free and pleasant with him as i use to be and particularli that i had been a cri he wa not long befor he took notic of it and ask me in veri kind term what wa the matter and if ani thing troubl me i would have put it off if i could but it wa not to be conceal so after suffer mani importun to draw that out of me which i long as much as possibl to disclos i told him that it wa true someth did troubl me and someth of such a natur that i could not conceal from him and yet that i could not tell how to tell him of it neither that it wa a thing that not onli surpis me but greatli perplex me and that i knew not what cours to take unless he would direct me he told me with great tender that let it be what it would i should not let it troubl me for he would protect me from all the world i then begun at a distanc and told him i wa afraid the ladi had got some secret inform of our correspond for that it wa easi to see that their conduct wa veri much chang toward me for a great while and that now it wa come to that pass that they frequent found fault with me and sometim fell quit out with me though i never gave them the least occas that wherea i use alway to lie with the eldest sister i wa late put to lie by my self or with one of the maid and that i had overheard them sever time talk veri unkindli about me but that which confirm it all wa that one of the servant had told me that she had heard i wa to be turn out and that it wa not safe for the famili that i should be ani longer in the hous he smile when he heard all thi and i ask him how he could make so light of it when he must need know that if there wa ani discoveri i wa undon for ever and that even it would hurt him though not ruin him as it would me i upbraid him that he wa like all the rest of the sex that when they had the charact and honor of a woman at their merci often time made it their jest and at least look upon it as a trifl and count the ruin of those they had had their will of as a thing of no valu he saw me warm and seriou and he chang hi style immedi he told me he wa sorri i should have such a thought of him that he had never given me the least occas for it but had been as tender of my reput as he could be of hi own that he wa sure our correspond had been manag with so much address that not one creatur in the famili had so much as a suspicion of it that if he smile when i told him my thought it wa at the assur he late receiv that our understand one anoth wa not so much as known or guess at and that when he had told me how much reason he had to be easi i should smile as he did for he wa veri certain it would give me a full satisfact thi is a mysteri i can not understand say i or how it should be to my satisfact that i am to be turn out of door for if our correspond is not discov i know not what els i have done to chang the counten of the whole famili to me or to have them treat me as they do now who formerli use me with so much tender as if i had been one of their own children whi look you child say he that they are uneasi about you that is true but that they have the least suspicion of the case as it is and as it respect you and i is so far from be true that they suspect my brother robin and in short they are fulli persuad he make love to you nay the fool ha put it into their head too himself for he is continu bantr them about it and make a
