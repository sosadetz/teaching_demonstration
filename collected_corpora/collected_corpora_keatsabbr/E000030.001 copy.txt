introduct there are few amus more danger for an author than the indulg in iron descript of hi own work if the ironi is depreciatori poster is but too like to say mani a true word is spoken in jest if it is encomiast the same ruthless and ungrat critic is but too like to take it as an involuntari confess of folli and vaniti but when field in one of hi seriocom introduct to tom jone describ it as thi prodigi work he all unintent for he wa the least pretenti of men anticip the verdict which poster almost at onc and with everincreas suffrag of the best judg as time went on wa about to pass not mere upon thi particular book but upon hi whole geniu and hi whole product as a novelist hi work in other kind is of a veri differ order of excel it is suffici interest at time in itself and alway more than suffici interest as hi for which reason as well as for the further one that it is compar littl known a consider select from it is offer to the reader in the last two volum of thi edit until the present occas which made it necessari that i should acquaint myself with it i own that my own knowledg of these miscellan write wa by no mean thorough it is now pretti complet but the idea which i previous had of them at first and second hand though a littl improv ha not veri materi alter though in all thi hackwork field display partial and at interv the same qualiti which he display emin and constantli in the four great book here given he wa not as the french idiom express it dan son assiett in hi own natur and impregn disposit and situat of charact and abil when he wa occupi on it the novel wa for him that assiett and all hi novel are here although henri field live in quit modern time although by famili and connect he wa of a higher rank than most men of letter and although hi geniu wa at onc recognis by hi contemporari so soon as it display itself in it proper sphere hi biographi until veri recent wa by no mean full and the most recent research includ those of mr austin dobsona critic unsurpass for combin of literari faculti and knowledg of the eighteenth centuryhav not altogeth suffic to fill up the gap hi famili said to have descend from a member of the great hous of hapsburg who came to england in the reign of henri ii distinguish itself in the war of the rose and in the seventeenth centuri wa advanc to the peerag of denbigh in england and later of desmond in

death gener field for he attain that rank marri again the most remark offspr of the first marriag next to henri wa hi sister sarah also a novelist who wrote david simpl of the second john afterward sir john field who though blind succeed hi halfbroth as a bow street magistr and in that offic combin an equal honour record with a longer tenur field wa born at sharpham park in somersetshir the seat of hi matern grandfath but most of hi earli youth wa spent at east stour in dorsetshir to which hi father remov after the judg death he is said to have receiv hi first educ under a parson of the neighbourhood name oliv in whom a veri uncomplimentari tradit see the origin of parson trullib he wa then certainli sent to eton where he did not wast hi time as regard learn and made sever valuabl friend but the date of hi enter and leav school are alik unknown and hi subsequ sojourn at leyden for two yearsthough there is no reason to doubt itdepend even less upon ani posit documentari evid thi famou univers still had a great reput as a train school in law for which profess he wa intend but the reason whi he did not receiv the even then far more usual complet of a public school educ by a sojourn at oxford or cambridg may be suspect to be differ it may even have had someth to do with a curiou escapad of hi about which not veri much is knownan attempt to carri off a pretti heiress of lyme name sarah andrew even at leyden howev gener field seem to have been unabl or unwil to pay hi son expens which must have been far less there than at an english univers and henri return to london in is said to have been due to sheer impecunios when he return to england hi father wa good enough to make him an allow of l nomin which appear to have been equival to l actual and as practic noth is known of him for the next six or seven year except the fact of hi have work industri enough at a larg number of not veri good play of the lighter kind with a few poem and miscellani it is reason enough suppos that he live by hi pen the onli product of thi period which ha kept or inde which ever receiv compet applaus is tom thumb or the tragedi of tragedi a follow of cours of the rehears but full of humour and spirit the most success of hi other dramat work were the mock doctor and the miser adapt of molier famou piec hi undoubt connect with the stage and the fact of the contemporari exist of a certain timothi field help suggest of less dignifi occup as actor boothkeep and so forth but these have long been discredit and inde disprov in or about when field wa twentyeight we find him in a new a more brilliant and agreeabl but even a more transient phase he had marri we do not know when or where miss charlott cradock one of three sister who live at salisburi it is to be observ that field entir connect both in life and letter are with the western counti and london who were certainli of compet mean and for whose alleg illegitimaci there is no evid but an unsupport fling of that old maid of geniu richardson the descript both of sophia and of amelia are said to have been taken from thi ladi her good look and her amiabl are as well establish as anyth of the kind can be in the absenc of photograph and affidavit and it is certain that her husband wa passion attach to her dure their too short marri life hi method howev of show hi affect smack in some way too much of the foibl which he ha attribut to captain booth and of those which we must suspect mr thoma jone would also have exhibit if he had not been adopt as mr allworthi heir and had not had mr western fortun to share and look forward to it is true that grave breach have been made by recent critic in the veri picturesqu and circumstanti stori told on the subject by murphi the first of field biograph thi legend wa that field have succeed by the death of hi mother to a small estat at east stour worth about l a year and have receiv l in readi money as hi wife fortun got through the whole in three year by keep open hous with a larg retinu in costli yellow liveri and so forth in detail thi stori ha been simpli riddl hi mother had die long befor he wa certainli not away from london three year or anyth like it and so forth at the same time the best and soberest judg agre that there is an intrins probabl a consensu if a vagu one of tradit and a chain of almost unmistak person refer in the novel which plead for a certain amount of truth at the bottom of a much embellish legend at ani rate if field establish himself in the countri it wa not long befor he return to town for earli in we find him back again and not mere a playwright but lesse of the littl theatr in the haymarket the play which he produc heresatiricopolit piec such as pasquin and the histor registerwer popular enough but offend the

novemb of the same year and wa call three year later but dure these year and inde for some time afterward our inform about him is still of the vaguest charact nobodi doubt that he had a larg share in the champion an essayperiod on the usual eighteenthcenturi model which began to appear in and which is still occasion consult for the work that is certainli or probabl hi he went the western circuit and attend the wiltshir session after he wa call give up hi contribut to period soon after that event but he soon return to literatur proper or rather made hi debut in it with the immort book now republish the histori of the adventur of joseph andrew and hi friend mr abraham adam appear in februari and it author receiv from andrew millar the publish the sum of l s even greater work have fetch much smaller sum but it will be admit that joseph andrew wa not dear the advantag howev of present a survey of an author life uninterrupt by critic is so clear that what ha to be said about joseph may be conveni postpon for the moment immedi after it public the author fell back upon miscellan write and in the next year collect and issu three volum of miscellani in the two first volum the onli thing of much interest is the unfinish and unequ but in part power journey from thi world to the next an attempt of a kind which fontenel and other follow lucian had made veri popular with the time but the third volum of the miscellani deserv a less modest and gregari appear for it contain and is wholli occupi by the wonder and terribl satir of jonathan wild the greatest piec of pure ironi in english out of swift soon after the public of the book a great calam came on field hi wife had been veri ill when he wrote the prefac soon afterward she wa dead they had taken the chanc had made the choic that the more prudent and less wise studenthero and heroin of mr brown youth and art had shun they had no doubt sigh deep laugh free starv feast despair and we need not question that they had also been happi except thi sad event and it rather incongru sequel field marriag to hi wife maid mari daniela marriag howev which did not take place till full four year later and which by all account suppli him with a faith and excel companion and nurs and hi children with a kind stepmotherlittl or noth is again known of thi elus man of geniu between the public of the miscellani in and that of tom

newspap field wa alway a strong whig and hanoverian call the true patriot and the jacobit journal in and the follow year some indistinct tradit about resid at twickenham and elsewher and some more precis but not much more authent respect patronag by the duke of bedford mr lyttelton mr allen and other pretti well sum up the whole tom jone wa publish in februari a favourit month with field or hi publish millar and as it brought him the for those day veri consider sum of l to which millar ad anoth hundr later the novelist must have been for a time at ani rate reliev from hi chronic penuri but he had alreadi by lyttelton interest secur hi first and last piec of prefer be made justic of the peac for westminst an offic on which he enter with characterist vigour he wa qualifi for it not mere by a solid knowledg of the law and by great natur abil but by hi thorough kind of heart and perhap it may also be ad by hi long year of queer experi on as mr carlyl would have said the burn marl of the london bohemia veri shortli afterward he wa chosen chairman of quarter session and establish himself in bow street the bow street magistr of that time occupi a most singular posit and wa more like a french prefect of polic or even a minist of public safeti than a mere justic yet he wa ill paid field say that the emolu which befor hi access had but been l a year of dirti money were by hi own action but l of clean and the work if properli perform wa veri sever that he perform it properli all compet evid show a foolish inconclus and i fear it must be said emphat snobbish stori of walpol notwithstand in particular he broke up a gang of cutthroat thiev which had been the terror of london but hi tenur of the post wa short enough and scarc extend to five year hi health had long been broken and he wa now constantli attack by gout so that he had frequent to retreat on bath from bow street or hi suburban cottag of fordhook eal but he did not relax hi literari work hi pen wa activ with pamphlet concern hi offic amelia hi last novel appear toward the close of and next year saw the begin of a new paper the covent garden journal which appear twice a week ran for the greater part

buri in the cemeteri of the estrella of not mani writer perhap doe a clearer notion as far as their person goe exist in the gener mind that interest itself at all in literatur than of field yet more than onc a warn ha been sound especi by hi best and most recent biograph to the effect that thi idea is found upon veri littl warranti of scriptur the truth is that as the forego recordwhich brief as it is is a suffici faith summarywil have shown we know veri littl about field we have hardli ani letter of hi and so lack the best by far and the most reveal of all characterportrait we have but one import autobiograph fragment and though that is of the highest interest and valu it wa written far in the valley of the shadow of death it is not in the least retrospect and it afford but dim and inferenti light on hi younger healthier and happier day and way he came moreov just short of one set of men of letter of whom we have a great deal of person knowledg and just beyond anoth he wa neither of those about addison nor of those about johnson no intim friend of hi ha left us anyth elabor about him on the other hand we have a far from inconsider bodi of documentari evid of a kind often by no mean trustworthi the best part of it is contain in the letter of hi cousin ladi mari wortley montagu and the reminisc or famili tradit of her granddaught ladi louisa stuart but ladi mari vivaci and agreeabl as she is had with all her talent a veri consider knack of write for effect of draw strong contrast and the like and it is not quit certain that she saw veri much of field in the last and most interest third of hi life anoth wit horac walpol to less knowledg and equal dubiou accuraci ad decid illwil which may have been due partli to the shrink of a dilettant and a fop from a burli bohemian but i fear is also consequ upon the fact that horac could not afford to despis field birth and knew him to be vastli hi own superior in geniu we hear someth of him again from richardson and richardson hate him with the hatr of dissimilar geniu of inferior social posit and lastli of the cat for the dog who touzl and worri her johnson partli inherit or share richardson avers partli wa blind to field geniu by hi aggress whiggeri i fear too that he wa incap of appreci it for reason other than polit it is certain that johnson sane and robust as he wa wa never quit at eas befor geniu of the gigant kind either in dead or live whether he did not like to have to look up too much or wa actual unabl to do so it is certain that shakespear milton swift and field those four atlant of english vers and prose all affect him with lukewarm admir or with posit dislik for which it is vain to attempt to assign ani uniform secondari caus polit or other it may be permit to hint anoth reason all johnson most sharpsight critic have notic though most have discreetli refrain from insist on hi thornintheflesh the combin in him of veri strong physic passion with the deepest sens of the moral and religi duti of abstin it is perhap imposs to imagin anyth more distast to a man so buffet than the extrem indulg with which field regard and the easi freedom not to say gusto with which he depict those who succumb to similar temptat onli by suppos the work of some subtl influenc of thi kind is it possibl to explain even in so caprici a humour as johnson the famou and absurd applic of the term barren rascal to a writer who die almost young after have for mani year live a life of pleasur and then for four or five one of labori offici duti ha left work anyth but small in actual bulk and fertil with the most luxuri growth of intellectu origin partli on the obit dicta of person like these partli on the still more tempt and still more treacher ground of indic drawn from hi work a field of fantasi ha been construct which in thackeray admir sketch attain real life and immort as a creatur of art but which possess rather dubiou claim as a histor charact it is astonish how thi field of fantasi sink and shrivel when we begin to appli the horrid test of critic to hi compon part the eidolon with ink ruffl and a towel round hi head sit in the templ and dash off articl for the covent garden journal then come critic hellish maid and remind us that when the covent garden journal appear field wild oat if ever sown at all had been sown long ago that he wa a busi magistr and household in bow street and that if he had towel round hi head it wa probabl less becaus he had exceed in liquor than becaus hi grace of newcastl had given him a headach by want elabor plan and scheme prepar at an hour notic ladi mari appar with some envi tell us that he could feel raptur with hi cookmaid which mani ha as mr ridley remark from xanthia phoceu downward but when we rememb the histor fact that he marri thi maid not a cookmaid at all and that though he alway speak of her with warm affect and hearti respect such raptur as we have of hi clearli refer to a veri differ woman who wa both a ladi and a beauti one we begin a littl to shake our head horac walpol at secondhand draw us a field pig with low companion in a hous kept like a hedg tavern field himself within a year or two show us more than halfundesignedli in the voyag to lisbon that he wa veri care about the appoint and decenc of hi tabl that he stood rather upon ceremoni in regard to hi own treatment of hi famili and the treatment of them and himself by other and that he wa altogeth a person orderli correct and even a littl finikin nor is there the slightest reason reason to regard thi as a piec of hypocrisi a vice as alien from the field of fanci as from the field of fact and one the particular manifest of which in thi particular place would have been equal unlik and unintellig it may be ask whether i propos to substitut for the tradit field a quit differ person of regular habit and method economi certainli not the tradit estim of great men is rare wrong altogeth but it constantli ha a habit of exagger and dramatis their characterist for some thing in field career we have posit evid of document and evid hardli less certain of probabl although i believ the best judg are now of opinion that hi impecunios ha been overcharg he certainli had experi which did not often fall to the lot of even a cadet of good famili in the eighteenth centuri there can be no reason doubt that he wa a man who had a lean toward pretti girl and bottl of good wine and i should suppos that if the girl were kind and fairli winsom he would not have insist that she should possess helen beauti that if the bottl of good wine were not forthcom he would have been veri toler of a mug of good ale he may veri possibl have drunk more than he should and lost more than he could conveni pay it may be put down as moral ascertain that toward all these weak of human and other like unto them he held an attitud which wa less that of the unassail philosoph than that of the sympathis indulg and excus in regard more especi to what are commonli call moral delinqu thi attitud wa so decid as to shock some peopl even in those day and mani in these just when the first sheet of thi edit were pass through the press a violent attack wa made in a newspap correspond on the moral of tom jone by certain notori advoc of puriti as some say of prurienc and pruderi combin accord to less complimentari estim even midway between the two period we find the admir miss ferrier a sister of field own craft who sometim had touch of natur and satir not far inferior to hi own express by the mouth of one of her charact with whom she seem partli to agre the sentiment that hi work are vanish like noxiou exhal toward ani misdo by person of the one sex toward person of the other when it involv brutal or treacheri field wa pitiless but when treacheri and brutal were not concern he wa to say the least facil so too he probabl knew by experienceh certainli knew by nativ shrewd and acquir observationthat to look too much on the wine when it is red or on the card when they are particolour is ruinou to health and fortun but he thought not over badli of ani man who did these thing still it is possibl to admit thi in him and to stop short of that idea of a careless and reckless viveur which ha so often been put forward in particular ladi mari view of hi childlik enjoy of the moment ha been i think much exagger by poster and wa probabl not a littl mistaken by the ladi herself there are two mood in which the motto is carp diem one a mood of simpli childish hurri the other one where behind the enjoy of the moment lurk and in which the enjoy of the moment is not a littl heighten by that vast iron conscious of the befor and after which i at least see everywher in the background of field work the man howev of whom we know so littl concern us much less than the author of the work of which it onli rest with ourselv to know everyth i have abov class field as one of the four atlant of english vers and prose and i doubt not that both the phrase and the applic of it to him will meet with question and demur i have onli to interject as the critic so often ha to interject a request to the court to take what i say in the sens in which i say it i do not mean that shakespear milton swift and field are in all or even in most respect on a level i do not mean that the three last are in all respect of the greatest name in english literatur i onli mean that in a certain qualiti which for want of a better word i have chosen to call atlantean they stand alon each of them for the metaphor is applic either way carri a whole world on hi shoulder or look down on a whole world from hi natur altitud the world are differ but they are world and though the attitud of the giant is differ also it agre in all of them on the point of compet and strength take whomsoev els we may among our men of letter and we shall find thi characterist to be in comparison want these four carri their world and are not carri by it and if it in the languag so dear to field himself were to crash and shatter the inquiri que vou restetil could be answer by each moi the appear which field make is no doubt the most modest of the four he ha not shakespear absolut univers and in fact not mere the poet tongu but the poet thought seem to have been deni him hi sphere is not the ideal like milton hi ironi splendid as it is fall a littl short of that diabol magnific which exalt swift to the point whenc in hi own way he survey all the kingdom of the world and the glori or vainglori of them all field critic have note the manner in a certain sens modest in anoth ostentati in which he seem to confin himself to the present of thing english they might have ad to the present of thing englisha they appear in london and on the western circuit and on the bath road but thi appar parochi ha never deceiv good judg it did not deceiv ladi mari who had seen the men and manner of veri mani clime it did not deceiv gibbon who wa not especi prone to overvalu thing english and who could look down from twenti centuri on thing ephemer it deceiv inde i am told some excel person at the present day who think field microcosm a toylik world and imagin that russian nihilist and french naturalist have gone beyond it it will deceiv no one who ha live for some compet space of time a life dure which he ha tri to regard hi fellowcreatur and himself as nearli as a mortal may sub speci aeternitati as thi is in the main an introduct to a complet reprint of field four great novel the justif in detail of the estim just made or hint of the novelist geniu will be best and most fitli made by a brief success discuss of the four as they are here present with some subsequ remark on the miscellani here select and inde it is not fanci to perceiv in each book a somewhat differ present of the author geniu though in no one of the four is ani one of hi masterli qualiti absent there is tender even in jonathan wild there are touch in joseph andrew of that ironi of the preacher the last echo of which is heard amid the kindli resign of the journey to lisbon in the sentenc wherea envi of all thing most expos us to danger from other so contempt of all thing best secur us from them but on the whole it is safe to say that joseph andrew best present field mischiev and play wit jonathan wild hi halflucian halfswiftian ironi tom jone hi uner knowledg of human natur and hi construct faculti amelia hi tender hi miti sapientia hi observ of the detail of life and first of the first the histori of the adventur of joseph andrew and hi friend mr abraham adam wa as ha been said abov publish in februari a facsimil of the agreement between author and publish will be given in the second volum of thi seri and it is not uninterest to observ that the wit william young is none other than the assert origin of the immort mr adam himself he might on balzac plea in a toler wellknown anecdot have demand half of the l s of the other origin of the book we have a pretti full account partli documentari that it is writ in the manner of cervant and is intend as a kind of comic epic is the author own statementno doubt as near the actual truth as is consist with comicep theori that there are resembl to scarron to le sage and to other practition of the picaresqu novel is certain and it wa inevit that there should be of direct and more immedi model or startingpoint one is undoubt the other though less gener admit not much less indubit to my mind the parodi of richardson pamela which wa littl more than a year earlier nov is avow open flagrant nor do i think that the author wa so soon carri away by the greater and larger tide of hi own invent as some critic seem to hold he is alway more or less return to the iron charg and the multipl of the assail of joseph virtu onli disguis the resembl to the longdrawn danger of pamela from a singl ravish but field wa also well acquaint with marivaux paysan parvenu and the resembl between that book and joseph andrew are much stronger than field admir have alway been will to admit thi recalcitr ha i think been mainli due to the erron concept of marivaux as if not a mere fribbl yet a dresdenshepherdess kind of writer good at precious and patchandpowd manner but noth more there wa in fact a veri strong satir and iron touch in the author of mariann and i do not think that i wa too rash when some year ago i ventur to speak of him as play field to hi own richardson in the paysan parvenu origin howev and indebted and the like are when great work is concern question for the studi and the lectureroom for the literari historian and the profession critic rather than for the reader howev intellig and alert who wish to enjoy a masterpiec and is content simpli to enjoy it it doe not realli matter how close to anyth els someth which possess independ good is the veri utmost technic origin the most spotless puriti from the faintest taint of suggest will not suffic to confer merit on what doe not otherwis possess it whether as i rather think field pursu the plan he had form ab incepto or whether he cavalierli neglect it or whether the current of hi own geniu carri him off hi leg and land him half against hi will on the shore of origin are question for the school and as i ventur to think not for the higher form in them we have joseph andrew as it is and we may be abundantli thank for it the content of it as of all field work in thi kind includ certain thing for which the modern are scantli grate of late year and not of late year onli there ha grown up a singular and perhap an ignor impati of digress of episod of tale within a tale the exampl of thi which ha been most maltreat is the man of the hill episod in tom jone but the stori of the unfortun jilt and of mr wilson in our present subject do not appear to me to be much less obnoxi to the censur and amelia contain more than one or two thing of the same kind me they do not greatli disturb and i see mani defenc for them besid the obviou and at a pinch suffici one that divag of thi kind exist in all field spanish and french model that the public of the day expect them and so forth thi defenc is enough but it is easi to amplifi and reintrench it it is not by ani mean the fact that the picaresqu novel of adventur is the onli or the chief form of fiction which prescrib or admit these episod excurs all the classic epic have them mani eastern and other stori present them they are common if not invari in the abund mediaev literatur of prose and vers romanc they are not unknown by ani mean in the modern novel and you will veri rare hear a stori told oral at the dinnert or in the smokingroom without someth of the kind there must therefor be someth in them correspond to an insepar accid of that most unchang of all thing human natur and i do not think the special form with which we are here concern by ani mean the worst that they have taken it ha the grand and promin virtu of be at onc and easili skippabl there is about cervant and le sage about field and smollett none of the treacheri of the modern novelist who induc the conscienti reader to drag through page chapter and sometim volum which have noth to do with the action for fear he should miss someth that ha to do with it these great men have a fearless frank and almost tell you in so mani word when and what you may skip therefor if the curiou impertin and the bane marriag and the man of the hill and the ladi of qualiti get in the way when you desir to read for the stori you have noth to do but turn the page till fini come the defenc ha alreadi been made by an illustri hand for field interchapt and exordium it appear to me to be almost more applic to hi insert and so we need not troubl ourselv ani more either about the insert or about the exordium they both pleas me the second class ha pleas person much better worth pleas than i can pretend to be but the make or mar of the book lie elsewher i do not think that it lie in the construct though field follow of the ancient both sincer and satir ha impos a fals air of regular upon that the odyssey of joseph of fanni and of their ghostli mentor and bodili guard is in truth a littl haphazard and might have been longer or shorter without ani discreet man approv it the more or the less therefor the real merit lie partli in the abound humour and satir of the artist critic but even more in the marvel vivac and fertil of hi creation for the veri first time in english prose fiction everi charact is aliv everi incid is capabl of have happen there are live touch in the elizabethan romanc but they are buri in verbiag swath in stage costum choke and fetter by their author want of art the qualiti of bunyan knowledg of men wa not much inferior to shakespear or at least to field but the rang and the result of it were cramp by hi singl theolog purpos and hi unvari allegor or typic form whi defo did not discov the new world of fiction i at least have never been abl to put into ani brief critic formula that satisfi me and i have never seen it put by ani one els he had not onli seen it afar off he had made land and descent on it he had carri off and exhibit in triumph nativ such as robinson cruso as man friday as moll flander as william the quaker but he had conquer subdu and settl no provinc therein i like pamela i like it better than some person who admir richardson on the whole more than i do seem to like it but as in all it author work the handl seem to me academicth work out on paper of an ingeni conceiv problem rather than the observ or evolut of actual or possibl life i should not greatli fear to push the comparison even into foreign countri but it is well to observ limit let us be content with hold that in england at least without prejudic to anyth further field wa the first to display the qualiti of the perfect novelist as distinguish from the romanc what are those qualiti as shown in joseph andrew the faculti of arrang a probabl and interest cours of action is one of cours and field show it here but i do not think that it is at ani time the greatest one and nobodi deni that he made great advanc in thi direct later the faculti of live dialogu is anoth and that he ha not often been refus but much the same may be said of it the interspers of appropri descript is anoth but here also we shall not find him exactli a paragon it is in characterth chief differentia of the novel as distinguish not mere from it elder sister the romanc and it cousin the drama but still more from everi other kind of literaturethat field stand even here preemin no one that i can think of except hi greatest successor in the present centuri ha the same unfail gift of breath life into everi charact he creat or borrow and even thackeray draw if i may use the phrase hi charact more in the flat and less in the round than field whether in blifil he onc fail we must discuss hereaft he ha fail nowher in joseph andrew some of hi sketch may requir the caution that they are eighteenthcenturi men and women some the warn that they are obvious caricatur or set in design profil or mere sketch but they are all aliv the finic estim of gray it is a horrid joy to think how perfectli capabl field wa of have join in that practic joke of the young gentlemen of cambridg which made gray chang hi colleg while dismiss these light thing with patronag had to admit that parson adam is perfectli well so is mr slipslop they were mr gray said some one onc they were more perfectli well and in a higher kind than anyth you ever did though you were a pretti workman too ye parson adam is perfectli well and so is mr slipslop but so are they all even the hero and heroin tie and bound as they are by the necess under which their maker lay of preserv joseph josephhood and of make fanni the exampl of a franker and less interest virtu than her sisterinlaw that might have been are surprisingli human where most writer would have made them stick and the rest requir no allow ladi boobi few as are the stroke given to her is not much less aliv than ladi bellaston mr trullib monster and not at all delic monster as he is is also a man and when he lay it down that no one even in hi own hous shall drink when he caal vurst one can but pay hi maker the tribut of that silent shudder of admir which hail the addit of one more everlast entiti to the world of thought and fanci and mr towwous is real and mr towwous is more real still and betti is real and the coachman and miss graveair and all the wonder crew from first to last the dress they wear the manner they exhibit the law they live under the veri food and drink they live upon are past like the shadow on glassesto the comfort and rejoic of some to the greater or less sorrow of other but they are thereal full of blood full of breath as we are and in truth i fear a littl more so for some purpos a centuri is a gap harder to cross and more estrang than a coupl of millennium but in their case the gap is noth and it is not too much to say that as they have stood the harder test they will stand the easier there are veri strike differ between nausicaa and mr slipslop there are differ not less strike between mr slipslop and beatric but their like is a stranger and more wonder thing than ani of their unlik it is that they are all women that they are all live citiz of the land of matter unforgot the fashion whereof passeth not away and the franchis whereof onc acquir assur immort note to gener introduct the text of thi issu in the main follow that of the standard or first collect edit of the variant which the author introduc in success edit dure hi lifetim are not inconsider but for the purpos of the present issu it did not seem necessari or inde desir to take account of them in the case of prose fiction more than in ani other depart of literatur it is desir that work should be read in the form which repres the completest intent and execut of the author nor have ani note been attempt for again such thing in the case of prose fiction are of veri doubt use and suppli pretti certain stumblingblock to enjoy while in the particular case of field the annot unless extrem caprici would have to be disgustingli full far be it at ani rate from the present editor to buri these delight creation under an ugli crust of parallel passag and miscellan erudit the sheet howev have been care read in order to prevent the casual error which are wont to creep into frequent reprint text and the editor hope that if ani such have escap him the escap will not be attribut to wil neglig a few obviou error in spell of proper name c which occur in the version have been correct but wherev the read of that version are possibl they have been prefer the embellish of the edit are partli fanci and partli documentari so that it is hope both class of tast may have someth to feed upon author prefac as it is possibl the mere english reader may have a differ idea of romanc from the author of these littlea volum and may consequ expect a kind of entertain not to be found nor which wa even intend in the follow page it may not be improp to premis a few word concern thi kind of write which i do not rememb to have seen hitherto attempt in our languag a joseph andrew wa origin publish in vol duodecimo the epic as well as the drama is divid into tragedi and comedi homer who wa the father of thi speci of poetri gave us a pattern of both these though that of the latter kind is entir lost which aristotl tell us bore the same relat to comedi which hi iliad bear to tragedi and perhap that we have no more instanc of it among the writer of antiqu is owe to the loss of thi great pattern which had it surviv would have found it imit equal with the other poem of thi great origin and farther as thi poetri may be tragic or comic i will not scrupl to say it may be likewis either in vers or prose for though it want one particular which the critic enumer in the constitu part of an epic poem name metr yet when ani kind of write contain all it other part such as fabl action charact sentiment and diction and is defici in metr onli it seem i think reason to refer it to the epic at least as no critic hath thought proper to rang it under ani other head or to assign it a particular name to itself thu the telemachu of the archbishop of cambray appear to me of the epic kind as well as the odyssey of homer inde it is much fairer and more reason to give it a name common with that speci from which it differ onli in a singl instanc than to confound it with those which it resembl in no other such are those volumin work commonli call romanc name clelia cleopatra astraea cassandra the grand cyru and innumer other which contain as i apprehend veri littl instruct or entertain now a comic romanc is a comic epic poem in prose differ from comedi as the seriou epic from tragedi it action be more extend and comprehens contain a much larger circl of incid and introduc a greater varieti of charact it differ from the seriou romanc in it fabl and action in thi that as in the one these are grave and solemn so in the other they are light and ridicul it differ in it charact by introduc person of inferior rank and consequ of inferior manner wherea the grave romanc set the highest befor us lastli in it sentiment and diction by preserv the ludicr instead of the sublim in the diction i think burlesqu itself may be sometim admit of which mani instanc will occur in thi work as in the descript of the battl and some other place not necessari to be point out to the classic reader for whose entertain those parodi or burlesqu imit are chiefli calcul but though we have sometim admit thi in our diction we have care exclud it from our sentiment and charact for there it is never properli introduc unless in write of the burlesqu kind which thi is not intend to be inde no two speci of write can differ more wide than the comic and the burlesqu for as the latter is ever the exhibit of what is monstrou and unnatur and where our delight if we examin it aris from the surpriz absurd as in appropri the manner of the highest to the lowest or e converso so in the former we should ever confin ourselv strictli to natur from the just imit of which will flow all the pleasur we can thi way convey to a sensibl reader and perhap there is one reason whi a comic writer should of all other be the least excus for deviat from natur sinc it may not be alway so easi for a seriou poet to meet with the great and the admir but life everywher furnish an accur observ with the ridicul i have hint thi littl concern burlesqu becaus i have often heard that name given to perform which have been truli of the comic kind from the author have sometim admit it in hi diction onli which as it is the dress of poetri doth like the dress of men establish charact the one of the whole poem and the other of the whole man in vulgar opinion beyond ani of their greater excel but sure a certain drolleri in stile where charact and sentiment are perfectli natur no more constitut the burlesqu than an empti pomp and digniti of word where everyth els is mean and low can entitl ani perform to the appel of the true sublim and i apprehend my lord shaftesburi opinion of mere burlesqu agre with mine when he assert there is no such thing to be found in the write of the ancient but perhap i have less abhorr than he profess for it and that not becaus i have had some littl success on the stage thi way but rather as it contribut more to exquisit mirth and laughter than ani other and these are probabl more wholesom physic for the mind and conduc better to purg away spleen melancholi and ill affect than is gener imagin nay i will appeal to common observ whether the same compani are not found more full of goodhumour and benevol after they have been sweeten for two or three hour with entertain of thi kind than when sour by a tragedi or a grave lectur but to illustr all thi by anoth scienc in which perhap we shall see the distinct more clearli and plainli let us examin the work of a comic histori painter with those perform which the italian call caricatura where we shall find the true excel of the former to consist in the exactest copi of natur insomuch that a judici eye instantli reject anyth outr ani liberti which the painter hath taken with the featur of that alma mater wherea in the caricatura we allow all licenceit aim is to exhibit monster not men and all distort and exagger whatev are within it proper provinc now what caricatura is in paint burlesqu is in write and in the same manner the comic writer and painter correl to each other and here i shall observ that as in the former the painter seem to have the advantag so it is in the latter infinit on the side of the writer for the monstrou is much easier to paint than describ and the ridicul to describ than paint and though perhap thi latter speci doth not in either scienc so strongli affect and agit the muscl as the other yet it will be own i believ that a more ration and use pleasur aris to us from it he who should call the ingeni hogarth a burlesqu painter would in my opinion do him veri littl honour for sure it is much easier much less the subject of admir to paint a man with a nose or ani other featur of a preposter size or to expos him in some absurd or monstrou attitud than to express the affect of men on canva it hath been thought a vast commend of a painter to say hi figur seem to breath but sure it is a much greater and nobler applaus that they appear to think but to return the ridicul onli as i have befor said fall within my provinc in the present work nor will some explan of thi word be thought impertin by the reader if he consid how wonder it hath been mistaken even by writer who have profess it for to what but such a mistak can we attribut the mani attempt to ridicul the blackest villani and what is yet wors the most dread calam what could exceed the absurd of an author who should write the comedi of nero with the merri incid of rip up hi mother belli or what would give a greater shock to human than an attempt to expos the miseri of poverti and distress to ridicul and yet the reader will not want much learn to suggest such instanc to himself besid it may seem remark that aristotl who is so fond and free of definit hath not thought proper to defin the ridicul inde where he tell us it is proper to comedi he hath remark that villani is not it object but he hath not as i rememb posit assert what is nor doth the abb bellegard who hath written a treatis on thi subject though he show us mani speci of it onc trace it to it fountain the onli sourc of the true ridicul as it appear to me is affect but though it aris from one spring onli when we consid the infinit stream into which thi one branch we shall present ceas to admir at the copiou field it afford to an observ now affect proce from one of these two caus vaniti or hypocrisi for as vaniti put us on affect fals charact in order to purchas applaus so hypocrisi set us on an endeavour to avoid censur by conceal our vice under an appear of their opposit virtu and though these two caus are often confound for there is some difficulti in distinguish them yet as they proceed from veri differ motiv so they are as clearli distinct in their oper for inde the affect which aris from vaniti is nearer to truth than the other as it hath not that violent repugn of natur to struggl with which that of the hypocrit hath it may be likewis note that affect doth not impli an absolut negat of those qualiti which are affect and therefor though when it proce from hypocrisi it be nearli alli to deceit yet when it come from vaniti onli it partak of the natur of ostent for instanc the affect of liber in a vain man differ visibl from the same affect in the avarici for though the vain man is not what he would appear or hath not the virtu he affect to the degre he would be thought to have it yet it sit less awkwardli on him than on the avarici man who is the veri revers of what he would seem to be from the discoveri of thi affect aris the ridicul which alway strike the reader with surpriz and pleasur and that in a higher and stronger degre when the affect aris from hypocrisi than when from vaniti for to discov ani one to be the exact revers of what he affect is more surpriz and consequ more ridicul than to find him a littl defici in the qualiti he desir the reput of i might observ that our ben jonson who of all men understood the ridicul the best hath chiefli use the hypocrit affect now from affect onli the misfortun and calam of life or the imperfect of natur may becom the object of ridicul sure he hath a veri illfram mind who can look on ugli infirm or poverti as ridicul in themselv nor do i believ ani man live who meet a dirti fellow ride through the street in a cart is struck with an idea of the ridicul from it but if he should see the same figur descend from hi coach and six or bolt from hi chair with hi hat under hi arm he would then begin to laugh and with justic in the same manner were we to enter a poor hous and behold a wretch famili shiver with cold and languish with hunger it would not inclin us to laughter at least we must have veri diabol natur if it would but should we discov there a grate instead of coal adorn with flower empti plate or china dish on the sideboard or ani other affect of rich and fineri either on their person or in their furnitur we might then inde be excus for ridicul so fantast an appear much less are natur imperfect the object of deris but when ugli aim at the applaus of beauti or lame endeavour to display agil it is then that these unfortun circumst which at first move our compass tend onli to rais our mirth the poet carri thi veri far none are for be what they are in fault but for not be what they would be thought where if the metr would suffer the word ridicul to close the first line the thought would be rather more proper great vice are the proper object of our detest smaller fault of our piti but affect appear to me the onli true sourc of the ridicul but perhap it may be object to me that i have against my own rule introduc vice and of a veri black kind into thi work to which i shall answer first that it is veri difficult to pursu a seri of human action and keep clear from them secondli that the vice to be found here are rather the accident consequ of some human frailti or foibl than caus habitu exist in the mind thirdli that they are never set forth as the object of ridicul but detest fourthli that they are never the princip figur at that time on the scene and lastli they never produc the intend evil have thu distinguish joseph andrew from the product of romanc writer on the one hand and burlesqu writer on the other and given some few veri short hint for i intend no more of thi speci of write which i have affirm to be hitherto unattempt in our languag i shall leav to my goodnatur reader to appli my piec to my observ and will detain him no longer than with a word concern the charact in thi work and here i solemnli protest i have no intent to vilifi or aspers ani one for though everyth is copi from the book of natur and scarc a charact or action produc which i have not taken from my i own observ and experi yet i have use the utmost care to obscur the person by such differ circumst degre and colour that it will be imposs to guess at them with ani degre of certainti and if it ever happen otherwis it is onli where the failur character is so minut that it is a foibl onli which the parti himself may laugh at as well as ani other as to the charact of adam as it is the most glare in the whole so i conceiv it is not to be found in ani book now extant it is design a charact of perfect simplic and as the good of hi heart will recommend him to the goodnatur so i hope it will excus me to the gentlemen of hi cloth for whom while they are worthi of their sacr order no man can possibl have a greater respect they will therefor excus me notwithstand the low adventur in which he is engag that i have made him a clergyman sinc no other offic could have given him so mani opportun of display hi worthi inclin the histori of the adventur of joseph andrew and hi friend mr abraham adam book i chapter i of write live in gener and particularli of pamela with a word by the bye of colley cibber and other it is a trite but true observ that exampl work more forcibl on the mind than precept and if thi be just in what is odiou and blameabl it is more strongli so in what is amiabl and praiseworthi here emul most effectu oper upon us and inspir our imit in an irresist manner a good man therefor is a stand lesson to all hi acquaint and of far greater use in that narrow circl than a good book but as it often happen that the best men are but littl known and consequ can not extend the use of their exampl a great way the writer may be call in aid to spread their histori farther and to present the amiabl pictur to those who have not the happi of know the origin and so by commun such valuabl pattern to the world he may perhap do a more extens servic to mankind than the person whose life origin afford the pattern in thi light i have alway regard those biograph who have record the action of great and worthi person of both sex not to mention those antient writer which of late day are littl read be written in obsolet and as they are gener thought unintellig languag such as plutarch nepo and other which i heard of in my youth our own languag afford mani of excel use and instruct fine calcul to sow the seed of virtu in youth and veri easi to be comprehend by person of moder capac such as the histori of john the great who by hi brave and heroic action against men of larg and athlet bodi obtain the gloriou appel of the giantkil that of an earl of warwick whose christian name wa guy the live of argalu and parthenia and abov all the histori of those seven worthi personag the champion of christendom in all these delight is mix with instruct and the reader is almost as much improv as entertain but i pass by these and mani other to mention two book late publish which repres an admir pattern of the amiabl in either sex the former of these which deal in male virtu wa written by the great person himself who live the life he hath record and is by mani thought to have live such a life onli in order to write it the other is commun to us by an historian who borrow hi light as the common method is from authent paper and record the reader i believ alreadi conjectur i mean the live of mr colley cibber and of mr pamela andrew how art doth the former by insinu that he escap be promot to the highest station in church and state teach us a contempt of worldli grandeur how strongli doth he inculc an absolut submiss to our superior lastli how complet doth he arm us against so uneasi so wretch a passion as the fear of shame how clearli doth he expos the empti and vaniti of that phantom reput what the femal reader are taught by the memoir of mr andrew is so well set forth in the excel essay or letter prefix to the second and subsequ edit of that work that it would be here a needless repetit the authent histori with which i now present the public is an instanc of the great good that book is like to do and of the preval of exampl which i have just observ sinc it will appear that it wa by keep the excel pattern of hi sister virtu befor hi eye that mr joseph andrew wa chiefli enabl to preserv hi puriti in the midst of such great temptat i shall onli add that thi charact of male chastiti though doubtless as desir and becom in one part of the human speci as in the other is almost the onli virtu which the great apologist hath not given himself for the sake of give the exampl to hi reader chapter ii of mr joseph andrew hi birth parentag educ and great endow with a word or two concern ancestor mr joseph andrew the hero of our ensu histori wa esteem to be the onli son of gaffar and gammer andrew and brother to the illustri pamela whose virtu is at present so famou as to hi ancestor we have search with great dilig but littl success be unabl to trace them farther than hi greatgrandfath who as an elderli person in the parish rememb to have heard hi father say wa an excel cudgelplay whether he had ani ancestor befor thi we must leav to the opinion of our curiou reader find noth of suffici certainti to reli on howev we can not omit insert an epitaph which an ingeni friend of our hath commun stay travel for underneath thi pew lie fast asleep that merri man andrew when the last day great sun shall gild the sky then he shall from hi tomb get up and rise be merri while thou canst for sure thou shalt shortli be as sad as he is now the word are almost out of the stone with antiqu but it is needless to observ that andrew here is writ without an s and is besid a christian name my friend moreov conjectur thi to have been the founder of that sect of laugh philosoph sinc call merryandrew to waiv therefor a circumst which though mention in conform to the exact rule of biographi is not greatli materi i proceed to thing of more consequ inde it is suffici certain that he had as mani ancestor as the best man live and perhap if we look five or six hundr year backward might be relat to some person of veri great figur at present whose ancestor within half the last centuri are buri in as great obscur but suppos for argument sake we should admit that he had no ancestor at all but had sprung up accord to the modern phrase out of a dunghil as the athenian pretend they themselv did from the earth would not thi autokoprosa have been justli entitl to all the prais aris from hi own virtu would it not be hard that a man who hath no ancestor should therefor be render incap of acquir honour when we see so mani who have no virtu enjoy the honour of their forefath at ten year old by which time hi educ wa advanc to write and read he wa bound an apprentic accord to the statut to sir thoma boobi an uncl of mr boobi by the father side sir thoma have then an estat in hi own hand the young andrew wa at first employ in what in the countri they call keep bird hi offic wa to perform the part the ancient assign to the god priapu which deiti the modern call by the name of jack o lent but hi voic be so extrem music that it rather allur the bird than terrifi them he wa soon transplant from the field into the dogkennel where he wa place under the huntsman and made what the sportsmen term whipperin for thi place likewis the sweet of hi voic disqualifi him the dog prefer the melodi of hi chide to all the allur note of the huntsman who soon becam so incens at it that he desir sir thoma to provid otherwis for him and constantli laid everi fault the dog were at to the account of the poor boy who wa now transplant to the stabl here he soon gave proof of strength and agil beyond hi year and constantli rode the most spirit and viciou hors to water with an intrepid which surpriz everi one while he wa in thi station he rode sever race for sir thoma and thi with such expert and success that the neighbour gentlemen frequent solicit the knight to permit littl joey for so he wa call to ride their match the best gamest befor they laid their money alway inquir which hors littl joey wa to ride and the bet were rather proport by the rider than by the hors himself especi after he had scorn refus a consider bribe to play booti on such an occas thi extrem rais hi charact and so pleas the ladi boobi that she desir to have him be now seventeen year of age for her own footboy a in english sprung from a dunghil joey wa now prefer from the stabl to attend on hi ladi to go on her errand stand behind her chair wait at her teatabl and carri her prayerbook to church at which place hi voic gave him an opportun of distinguish himself by sing psalm he behav likewis in everi other respect so well at divin servic that it recommend him to the notic of mr abraham adam the curat who took an opportun one day as he wa drink a cup of ale in sir thomass kitchen to ask the young man sever question concern religion with hi answer to which he wa wonder pleas chapter iii of mr abraham adam the curat mr slipslop the chambermaid and other mr abraham adam wa an excel scholar he wa a perfect master of the greek and latin languag to which he ad a great share of knowledg in the orient tongu and could read and translat french italian and spanish he had appli mani year to the most sever studi and had treasur up a fund of learn rare to be met with in a univers he wa besid a man of good sens good part and good natur but wa at the same time as entir ignor of the way of thi world as an infant just enter into it could possibl be as he had never ani intent to deceiv so he never suspect such a design in other he wa gener friendli and brave to an excess but simplic wa hi characteristick he did no more than mr colley cibber apprehend ani such passion as malic and envi to exist in mankind which wa inde less remark in a countri parson than in a gentleman who hath pass hi life behind the scenesa place which hath been seldom thought the school of innoc and where a veri littl observ would have convinc the great apologist that those passion have a real exist in the human mind hi virtu and hi other qualif as they render him equal to hi offic so they made him an agreeabl and valuabl companion and had so much endear and well recommend him to a bishop that at the age of fifti he wa provid with a handsom incom of twentythre pound a year which howev he could not make ani great figur with becaus he live in a dear countri and wa a littl encumb with a wife and six children it wa thi gentleman who have as i have said observ the singular devot of young andrew had found mean to question him concern sever particular as how mani book there were in the new testament which were they how mani chapter they contain and such like to all which mr adam privat said he answer much better than sir thoma or two other neighbour justic of the peac could probabl have done mr adam wa wonder solicit to know at what time and by what opportun the youth becam acquaint with these matter joey told him that he had veri earli learnt to read and write by the good of hi father who though he had not interest enough to get him into a chariti school becaus a cousin of hi father landlord did not vote on the right side for a churchwarden in a borough town yet had been himself at the expens of sixpenc a week for hi learn he told him likewis that ever sinc he wa in sir thomass famili he had employ all hi hour of leisur in read good book that he had read the bibl the whole duti of man and thoma a kempi and that as often as he could without be perceiv he had studi a great good book which lay open in the hall window where he had read as how the devil carri away half a church in sermontim without hurt one of the congreg and as how a field of corn ran away down a hill with all the tree upon it and cover anoth man meadow thi suffici assur mr adam that the good book meant could be no other than baker chronicl the curat surpriz to find such instanc of industri and applic in a young man who had never met with the least encourag ask him if he did not extrem regret the want of a liber educ and the not have been born of parent who might have indulg hi talent and desir of knowledg to which he answer he hope he had profit somewhat better from the book he had read than to lament hi
