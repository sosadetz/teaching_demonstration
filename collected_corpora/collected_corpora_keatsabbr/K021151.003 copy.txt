whom hi great reput wa not known and perhap upon a veri nice examin into the matter we shall find that thi circumst bear no inconsider part among the mani bless of grandeur the great happi of be known to poster with the hope of which we so delight ourselv in the preced chapter is the portion of few to have the sever element which compos our name as sydenham express it repeat a thousand year henc is a gift beyond the power of titl and wealth and is scarc to be purchas unless by the sword and the pen but to avoid the scandal imput while we yet live of be one whom nobodi know a scandal by the by as old as the day of homer see the d odyssey ver will alway be the envi portion of those who have a legal titl either to honor or estat from that figur therefor which the irish peer who brought sophia to town ha alreadi made in thi histori the reader will conclud doubtless it must have been an easi matter to have discov hi hous in london without know the particular street or squar which he inhabit sinc he must have been one whom everi bodi know to say the truth so it would have been to ani of those tradesmen who are accustom to attend the region of the great for the door of the great are gener no less easi to find than it is difficult to get entranc into them but jone as well as partridg wa an entir stranger in london and as he happen to arriv first in a quarter of the town the inhabit of which have veri littl intercours with the household of hanov or grosvenor squar for he enter through gray inn lane so he rambl about some time befor he could even find hi way to those happi mansion where fortun segreg from the vulgar those magnanim hero the descend of ancient briton saxon or dane whose ancestor be born in better day by sundri kind of merit have entail rich and honor on their poster jone be at length arriv at those terrestri elysian field would now soon have discov hi lordship mansion but the peer unluckili quit hi former hous when he went for ireland and as he wa just enter into a new one the fame of hi equipag had not yet suffici blaze in the neighborhood so that after a successless enquiri till the clock had struck eleven jone at last yield to the advic of partridg and retreat to the bull and gate in holborn that be the inn where he had first alight and where he retir to enjoy that kind of repos which usual attend person in hi circumst earli in the morn he again set forth in pursuit of sophia and mani a weari step he took to no better purpos than befor at last whether it wa that fortun relent or whether it wa no longer in her power to disappoint him he came into the veri street which wa honor by hi lordship resid and be direct to the hous he gave one gentl rap at the door the porter who from the modesti of the knock had conceiv no high idea of the person approach conceiv but littl better from the appear of mr jone who wa dress in a suit of fustian and had by hi side the weapon formerli purchas of the sergeant of which though the blade might be compos of welltemp steel the handl wa compos onli of brass and that none of the brightest when jone therefor enquir after the young ladi who had come to town with hi lordship thi fellow answer surlili that there were no ladi there jone then desir to see the master of the hous but wa inform that hi lordship would see no bodi that morn and upon grow more press the porter said he had posit order to let no person in but if you think proper said he to leav your name i will acquaint hi lordship and if you call anoth time you shall know when he will see you jone now declar that he had veri particular busi with the young ladi and could not depart without see her upon which the porter with no veri agreeabl voic or aspect affirm that there wa no young ladi in that hous and consequ none could he see ad sure you are the strangest man i ever met with for you will not take an answer i have often thought that by the particular descript of cerberu the porter of hell in the th aeneid virgil might possibl intend to satyr the porter of the great men in hi time the pictur at least resembl those who have the honor to attend at the door of our great men the porter in hi lodg answer exactli to cerberu in hi den and like him must be appeas by a sop befor access can be gain to hi master perhap jone might have seen him in that light and have recollect the passag where the sybil in order to procur an entranc for aenea present the keeper of the stygian avenu with such a sop jone in like manner now began to offer a bribe to the human cerberu which a footman overhear instantli advanc and declar if mr jone would give him the sum propos he would conduct him to the ladi jone instantli agre and wa forthwith conduct to the lodg of mr fitzpatrick by the veri fellow who had attend the ladi thither the day befor noth more aggrav ill success than the near approach to good the gamest who lose hi parti at piquet by a singl point lament hi bad luck ten time as much as he who never came within a prospect of the game so in a lotteri the proprietor of the next number to that which win the great prize are apt to account themselv much more unfortun than their fellowsuffer in short these kind of hairbreadth miss of happi look like the insult of fortun who may be consid as thu play trick with us and wantonli divert herself at our expens jone who more than onc alreadi had experienc thi frolicksom disposit of the heathen goddess wa now again doom to be tantal in the like manner for he arriv at the door of mr fitzpatrick about ten minut after the departur of sophia he now address himself to the wait woman belong to mr fitzpatrick who told him the disagre news that the ladi wa gone but could not tell him whither and the same answer he afterward receiv from mr fitzpatrick herself for as that ladi made no doubt but that mr jone wa a person detach from her uncl western in pursuit of hi daughter so she wa too gener to betray her though jone had never seen mr fitzpatrick yet he had heard that a cousin of sophia wa marri to a gentleman of that name thi howev in the present tumult of hi mind never onc recur to hi memori but when the footman who had conduct him from hi lordship acquaint him with the great intimaci between the ladi and with their call each other cousin he then recollect the stori of the marriag which he had formerli heard and as he wa present convinc that thi wa the same woman he becam more surpris at the answer which he had receiv and veri earnestli desir leav to wait on the ladi herself but she as posit refus him that honor jone who though he had never seen a court wa better bred than most who frequent it wa incap of ani rude or abrupt behavior to a ladi when he had receiv therefor a peremptori denial he retir for the present say to the wait woman that if thi wa an improp hour to wait on her ladi he would return in the afternoon and that he then hope to have the honor of see her the civil with which he utter thi ad to the great comeli of hi person made an impress on the wait woman and she could not help answer perhap sir you may and inde she afterward said everi thing to her mistress which she thought most like to prevail on her to admit a visit from the handsom young gentleman for so she call him jone veri shrewdli suspect that sophia herself wa now with her cousin and wa deni to him which he imput to her resent of what had happen at upton have therefor dispatch partridg to procur him lodg he remain all day in the street watch the door where he thought hi angel lay conceal but no person did he see issu forth except a servant of the hous and in the even he return to pay hi visit to mr fitzpatrick which that good ladi at last condescend to admit there is a certain air of natur gentil which it is neither in the power of dress to give nor to conceal mr jone as ha been befor hint wa possess of thi in a veri emin degre he met therefor with a recept from the ladi somewhat differ from what hi apparel seem to demand and after he had paid her hi proper respect wa desir to sit down the reader will not i believ be desir of know all the particular of thi convers which end veri littl to the satisfact of poor jone for though mr fitzpatrick soon discov the lover as all women have the eye of hawk in those matter yet she still thought it wa such a lover as a gener friend of the ladi should not betray her to in short she suspect thi wa the veri mr blifil from whom sophia had flown and all the answer which she art drew from jone concern mr allworthi famili confirm her in thi opinion she therefor strictli deni ani knowledg concern the place whither sophia wa gone nor could jone obtain more than a permiss to wait on her again the next even when jone wa depart mr fitzpatrick commun her suspicion concern mr blifil to her maid who answer sure madam he is too pretti a man in my opinion for ani woman in the world to run away from i had rather fanci it is mr jone mr jone said the ladi what jone for sophia had not given the least hint of ani such person in all their convers but mr honor had been much more commun and had acquaint her sister abigail with the whole histori of jone which thi now again relat to her mistress mr fitzpatrick no sooner receiv thi inform than she immedi agre with the opinion of her maid and what is veri unaccount saw charm in the gallant happi lover which she had overlook in the slight squir betti say she you are certainli in the right he is a veri pretti fellow and i dont wonder that my cousin maid should tell you so mani women are fond of him i am sorri now i did not inform him where my cousin wa and yet if he be so terribl a rake as you tell me it is a piti she should ever see him ani more for what but her ruin can happen from marri a rake and a beggar against her father consent i protest if he be such a man as the wench describ him to you it is but an offic of chariti to keep her from him and i am sure it would be unpardon in me to do otherwis who have tast so bitterli of the misfortun attend such marriag here she wa interrupt by the arriv of a visitor which wa no other than hi lordship and as noth pass at thi visit either new or extraordinari or ani way materi to thi histori we shall here put an end to thi chapter chap iii a project of mr fitzpatrick and her visit to ladi bellaston when mr fitzpatrick retir to rest her thought were entir taken up by her cousin sophia and mr jone she wa inde a littl offend with the former for the disingenu which she now discov in which medit she had not long exercis her imagin befor the follow conceit suggest itself that could she possibl becom the mean of preserv sophia from thi man and of restor her to her father she should in all human probabl by so great a servic to the famili reconcil to herself both her uncl and her aunt western as thi wa one of her most favorit wish so the hope of success seem so reason that noth remain but to consid of proper method to accomplish her scheme to attempt to reason the case with sophia did not appear to her one of those method for as betti had report from mr honor that sophia had a violent inclin to jone she conceiv that to dissuad her from the match wa an endeavor of the same kind as it would be veri heartili and earnestli to entreat a moth not to fli into a candl if the reader will pleas to rememb that the acquaint which sophia had with ladi bellaston wa contract at the hous of mr western and must have grown at the veri time when mr fitzpatrick live with thi latter ladi he will want no inform that mr fitzpatrick must have been acquaint with her likewis they were besid both equal her distant relat after much consider therefor she resolv to go earli in the morn to that ladi and endeavor to see her unknown to sophia and to acquaint her with the whole affair for she did not in the least doubt but that the prudent ladi who had often ridicul romant love and indiscreet marriag in her convers would veri readili concur in her sentiment concern thi match and would lend her utmost assist to prevent it thi resolut she accordingli execut and the next morn befor the sun she huddl on her cloth and at a veri unfashion unseason unvisit hour went to ladi bellaston to whom she got access without the least knowledg or suspicion of sophia who though not asleep lay at that time awak in her bed with honor snore by her side mr fitzpatrick made mani apolog for thi earli abrupt visit at an hour when she said she should not have thought of disturb her ladyship but upon busi of the utmost consequ she then open the whole affair told all she had heard from betti and did not forget the visit which jone had paid to herself the preced even ladi bellaston answer with a smile then you have seen thi terribl man madam pray is he so veri fine a figur as he is repres for etoff entertain me last night almost two hour with him the wench i believ is in love with him by reput here the reader will be apt to wonder but the truth is that mr etoff who had the honor to pin and unpin the ladi bellaston had receiv complet inform concern the said mr jone and had faith convey the same to her ladi last night or rather that morn while she wa undress on which account she had been detain in her offic abov the space of an hour and half the ladi inde though gener well enough pleas with the narr of mr etoff at those season gave an extraordinari attent to her account of jone for honor had describ him as a veri handsom fellow and mr etoff in her hurri ad so much to the beauti of hi person to her report that ladi bellaston began to conceiv him to be a kind of miracl in natur the curios which her woman had inspir wa now greatli increas by mr fitzpatrick who spoke as much in favor of the person of jone as she had befor spoken in disprais of hi birth charact and fortun when ladi bellaston had heard the whole she answer grave inde madam thi is a matter of great consequ noth can certainli be more commend than the part you act and i shall be veri glad to have my share in the preserv of a young ladi of so much merit and for whom i have so much esteem doth not your ladyship think say mr fitzpatrick eagerli that it would be the best way to write immedi to my uncl and acquaint him where my cousin is the ladi ponder a littl upon thi and thu answer whi no madam i think not di western ha describ her brother to me to be such a brute that i can not consent to put ani woman under hi power who ha escap from it i have heard he behav like a monster to hi own wife for he is one of those wretch who think they have a right to tyrann over us and from such i shall ever esteem it the caus of my sex to rescu ani woman who is so unfortun to be under their power the busi dear cousin will be onli to keep miss western from see thi young fellow till the good compani which she will have an opportun of meet here give her a proper turn if he should find her out madam answer the other your ladyship may be assur he will leav noth unattempt to come at her but madam repli the ladi it is imposs he should come here though inde it is possibl he may get some intellig where she is and then may lurk about the hous i wish therefor i knew hi person is there no way madam by which i could have a sight of him for otherwis you know cousin she may contriv to see him here without my knowledg mr fitzpatrick answer that he had threaten her with anoth visit that afternoon and that in her ladyship pleas to do her the honor of call upon her then she would hardli fail of see him between six and seven and if he came earlier she would by some mean or other detain him till her ladyship arriv ladi bellaston repli she would come the moment she could get from dinner which she suppos would be by seven at farthest for that it wa absolut necessari she should be acquaint with hi person upon my word madam say she it wa veri good to take thi care of miss western but common human as well as regard to our famili requir it of us both for it would be a dread match inde mr fitzpatrick fail not to make a proper return to the compliment which ladi bellaston had bestow on her cousin and after some littl immateri convers withdrew and get as fast as she could into her chair unseen by sophia or honor return home chap iv which consist of visit mr jone had walk within sight of a certain door dure the whole day which though one of the shortest appear to him to be one of the longest in the whole year at length the clock have struck five he return to mr fitzpatrick who though it wa a full hour earlier than the decent time of visit receiv him veri civilli but still persist in her ignor concern sophia jone in ask for hi angel had drop the word cousin upon which mr fitzpatrick said then sir you know we are relat and as we are you will permit me the right of enquir into the particular of your busi with my cousin here jone hesit a good while and at last answer he had a consider sum of money of her in hi hand which he desir to deliv to her he then produc the pocketbook and acquaint mr fitzpatrick with the content and with the method in which they came into hi hand he had scarc finish hi stori when a most violent nois shook the whole hous to attempt to describ thi nois to those who have heard it would be in vain and to aim at give ani idea of it to those who have never heard the like would be still more vain for it may be truli said non acuta sic gemin corybant era the priest of cybel do not so rattl their sound brass in short a footman knock or rather thunder at the door jone wa a littl surpris at the sound have never heard it befor but mr fitzpatrick veri calmli said that as some compani were come she could not make him ani answer now but if he pleas to stay till they were gone she intim she had someth to say to him the door of the room now flew open and after push in her hoop sideway befor her enter ladi bellaston who have first made a veri low curtesi to mr fitzpatrick and as low a one to mr jone wa usher to the upper end of the room we mention these minut matter for the sake of some countri ladi of our acquaint who think it contrari to the rule of modesti to bend their knee to a man the compani were hardli well settl befor the arriv of the peer late mention caus a fresh diurbanc and a repetit of ceremoni here be over the convers began to be as the phrase is extrem brilliant howev as noth past in it which can be thought materi to thi histori or inde veri materi in itself i shall omit the relat the rather as i have known some veri fine polit convers grow extrem dull when transcrib into book or repeat on the stage inde thi mental repast is a dainti of which those who are exclud from polit assembl must be content to remain as ignor as they must of the sever dainti of french cookeri which are onli serv at the tabl of the great to say the truth as neither of these are adapt to everi tast they might both be often thrown away on the vulgar poor jone wa rather a spectat of thi eleg scene than an actor in it for though in the short interv befor the peer arriv ladi bellaston first and afterward mr fitzpatrick had address some of their discours to him yet no sooner wa the nobl lord enter than he engross the whole attent of the two ladi to himself and as he took no more notic of jone than if no such person had been present unless by now and then stare at him the ladi follow hi exampl the compani had now staid so long that mr fitzpatrick plainli perceiv they all design to stay out each other she therefor resolv to rid herself of jone he be the visit to whom she thought the least ceremoni wa due take therefor an opportun of a cessat of chat she address herself grave to him and said sir i shall not possibl be abl to give you an answer tonight as to that busi but if you pleas to leav word where i may send to you tomorrow jone had natur but not artifici good breed instead therefor of commun the secret of is lodg to a servant he acquaint the ladi eself with it particularli and soon after veri ceremoni withdrew he wa no sooner gone than the great personag who had taken no notic of him present began to take much notic of him in hi absenc but if the reader ha alreadi excus us from relat the more brilliant part of thi convers he will sure be veri readi to excus the repetit of what may be call vulgar abus though perhap it may be materi to our histori to mention an observ of ladi bellaston who took her leav in a few minut after him and then said to mr fitzpatrick at her departur i am satisfi on the account of my cousin she can be in no danger from thi fellow our histori shall follow the exampl of ladi bellaston and take leav of the present compani which wa now reduc to two person between whom as noth pass which in the least concern us or our reader we shall not suffer ourselv to be divert by it from matter which must seem of more consequ to all those who are at all interest in the affair of our hero chap v an adventur which happen to mr jone at hi lodg with some account of a young gentleman who lodg there and of the mistress of the hous and her two daughter the next morn as earli as it wa decent jone attend at mr fitzpatrick door where he wa answer that the ladi wa not at home an answer which surpris him the more as he had walk backward and forward in the street from break of day and if she had gone out he must have seen her thi answer howev he wa oblig to receiv and not onli now but to five sever visit which he made her that day to be plain with the reader the nobl peer had from some reason or other perhap from a regard for the ladi honor insist that she should not see mr jone whom he look on as a scrub ani more and the ladi had compli in make that promis to which we now see her so strictli adher but as our gentl reader may possibl have a better opinion of the young gentleman than her ladyship and may even have some concern should it be apprehend that dure thi unhappi separ from sophia he took up hi resid either at an inn or in the street we shall now give an account of hi lodg which wa inde in a veri reput hous and in a veri good part of the town mr jone then had often heard mr allworthi mention the gentlewoman at whose hous he use to lodg when he wa in town thi person who as jone likewis knew live in bondstreet wa the widow of a clergyman and wa left by him at hi deceas in possess of two daughter and of a complet set of manuscript sermon of these two daughter nanci the elder wa now arriv at the age of seventeen and betti the younger at that of ten hither jone had dispatch partridg and in thi hous he wa provid with a room for himself in the second floor and with one for partridg in the fourth the first floor wa inhabit by one of those young gentlemen who in the last age were call men of wit and pleasur about town and properli enough for as men are usual denomin from their busi or profess so pleasur may be said to have been the onli busi or profess of those gentlemen to whom fortun had made all use occup unnecessari play hous coffeehous and tavern were the scene of their rendezv wit and humor were the entertain of their looser hour and love wa the busi of their more seriou moment wine and the muse conspir to kindl the brightest flame in their breast nor did they onli admir but some were abl to celebr the beauti they admir and all to judg of the merit of such composit such therefor were properli call the men of wit and pleasur but i question whether the same appel may with the same proprieti be given to those young gentlemen of our time who have the same ambit to be distinguish for part wit certainli they have noth to do with to give them their due they soar a step higher than their predecessor and may be call men of wisdom and virtu take heed you do not read virtu thu at an age when the gentlemen abovement employ their time in toast the charm of a woman or in make sonnet in her prais in give their opinion of a play at the theater or of a poem at will or button these gentlemen are consid of method to bribe a corpor or medit speech for the hous of common or rather for the magazin but the scienc of game is that which abov all other employ their thought these are the studi of their graver hour while for their amus they have the vast circl of connoisseurship paint music statuari and natur philosophi or rather unnatur which deal in the wonder

nanci likewis who wa the onli femal then in the hous her mamma and sister be gone to the play condescend to favor them with her compani when the bottl and glass were on the tabl the gentleman began to relat the occas of the preced disturb i hope sir said he to jone you will not from thi accid conclud that i make a custom of strike my servant for i assur you thi is the first time i have been guilti of it in my remembr and i have pass by mani provok fault in thi veri fellow befor he could provok me to it but when you hear what ha happen thi even you will i believ think me excus i happen to come home sever hour befor my usual time when i found four gentlemen of the cloth at whisk by my fire and my hoyl sir my best hoyl which cost me a guinea lie open on the tabl with a quantiti of porter spilt on one of the most materi leav of the whole book thi you will allow wa provok but i said noth till the rest of the honest compani were gone and then gave the fellow a gentl rebuk who instead of express ani concern made me a pert answer that servant must have their divers as well as other peopl that he wa sorri for the accid which had happen to the book but that sever of hi acquaint had bought the same for a shill and that i might stop as much in hi wage if i pleas i now gave him a sever reprimand than befor when the rascal had the insol to in short he imput my earli come home to in short he cast a reflect he mention the name of a young ladi in a manner in such a manner that incens me beyond all patienc and in my passion i struck him jone answer that he believ no person live would blame him for my part said he i confess i should on the last mention provoc have done the same thing our compani had not sat long befor they were join by the mother and daughter at their return from the play and now they all spent a veri cheer even togeth for all but jone were heartili merri and even he put on as much constrain mirth as possibl inde half hi natur flow of anim spirit join to the sweet of hi temper wa suffici to make a most amiabl companion and notwithstand the heavi of hi heart so agreeabl did he make himself on the present occas that at their break up the young gentleman earnestli desir hi further acquaint miss nanci wa well pleas with him and the widow quit charm with her new lodger invit him with the other next morn to breakfast jone on hi part wa no less satisfi as for miss nanci though a veri littl creatur she wa extrem pretti and the widow had all the charm which can adorn a woman near fifti as she wa one of the most innoc creatur in the world so she wa one of the most cheer she never thought nor spoke nor wish ani ill and had constantli that desir of pleas which may be call the happiest of all desir in thi that it scarc ever fail of attain it end when not disgrac by affect in short though her power wa veri small she wa in her heart one of the warmest friend she had been a most affection wife and wa a most fond and tender mother as our histori doe not like a newspap give great charact to peopl who never were heard of befor nor will ever be heard of again the reader may henc conclud that thi excel woman will hereaft appear to be of some import in our histori nor wa jone a littl pleas with the young gentleman himself whose wine he had been drink he thought he discern in him much good sens though a littl too much taint with town fopperi but what recommend him most to jone were some sentiment of great generos and human which occasion drop from him and particularli mani express of the highest disinterested in the affair of love on which subject the young gentleman deliv himself in a languag which might have veri well becom an arcadian shepherd of old and which appear veri extraordinari when proceed from the lip of a modern fine gentleman but he wa onli one by imit and meant by natur for a much better charact chap vi what arriv while the compani were at breakfast with some hint concern the govern of daughter our compani brought togeth in the morn the same good inclin toward each other with which they had separ the even befor but poor jone wa extrem disconsol for he had just receiv inform from partridg that mr fitzpatrick had left her lodg and that he could not learn whither she wa gone thi news highli affect him and hi counten as well as hi behavior in defianc of all hi endeavor to the contrari betray manifest indic of a disord mind the discours turn at present as befor on love and mr nightingal again express mani of those warm gener and disinterest sentiment upon thi subject which wise and sober men call romant but which wise and sober women gener regard in a better light mr miller for so the mr of the hous wa call greatli approv these sentiment but when the young gentleman appeal to miss nanci she answer onli that she believ the gentleman who had spoke the least wa capabl of feel the most thi compliment wa so appar direct to jone that we should have been sorri had he pass it by unregard he made her inde a veri polit answer and conclud with an obliqu hint that her own silenc subject her to a suspicion of the same kind for inde she had scarc open her lip either now or the last even i am glad nanni say mr miller the gentleman ha made the observ i protest i am almost of hi opinion what can be the matter with you child i never saw such an alter what is becom of all your gayeti would you think sir i use to call her my littl prattler she ha not spoke twenti word thi week here their convers wa interrupt by the entranc of a maidserv who brought a bundl in her hand which she said wa deliv by a porter for mr jone she ad that the man immedi went away say it requir no answer jone express some surpris on thi occas and declar it must be some mistak but the maid persist that she wa certain of the name all the women were desir of have the bundl immedi open which oper wa at length perform by littl betsi with the consent of mr jone and the content were found to be a domino a mask and a masquerad ticket jone wa now more posit than ever in assert that these thing must have been deliv by mistak and mr miller herself express some doubt and said she knew not what to think but when mr nightingal wa ask he deliv a veri differ opinion all i can conclud from it sir said he is that you are a veri happi man for i make no doubt but these were sent you by some ladi whom you will have the happi of meet at the masquerad jone had not a suffici degre of vaniti to entertain ani such flatter imagin nor did mr miller herself give much assent to what mr nightingal had said till miss nanci have lift up the domino a card drop from the sleev in which wa written as follow to mr jone the queen of the fairi send you thi use her favor not amiss mr miller and miss nanci now both agre with mr nightingal nay jone himself wa almost persuad to be of the same opinion and as no other ladi but mr fitzpatrick he thought knew hi lodg he began to flatter himself with some hope that it came from her and that he might possibl see hi sophia these hope had sure veri littl foundat but as the conduct of mr fitzpatrick in not see him accord to her promis and in quit her lodg had been veri odd and unaccount he conceiv some faint hope that she of whom he had formerli heard a veri whimsic charact might possibl intend to do him that servic in a strang manner which she declin do by more ordinari method to say the truth as noth certain could be conclud from so odd and uncommon an incid he had the greater latitud to draw what imaginari conclus from it he pleas as hi temper therefor wa natur sanguin he indulg it on thi occas and hi imagin work up a thousand conceit to favor and support hi expect of meet hi dear sophia in the even reader if thou have ani good wish toward me i will fulli repay them by wish thee to be possess of thi sanguin disposit of mind sinc after have read much and consid long on that subject of happi which ha employ so mani great pen i am almost inclin to fix it in the possess of thi temper which put us in a manner out of the reach of fortun and make us happi without her assist inde the sensat of pleasur it give are much more constant as well as much keener than those which that blind ladi bestow natur have wise contriv that some satieti and languor should be annex to all our real enjoy lest we should be so taken up by them as to be stop from further pursuit i make no manner of doubt but that in thi light we may see the imaginari futur chancellor just call to the bar the archbishop in crape and the prime minist at the tail of an opposit more truli happi than those who are invest with all the power and profit of these respect offic mr jone have now determin to go to the masquerad that even mr nightingal offer to conduct him thither the young gentleman at the same time offer ticket to miss nanci and her mother but the good woman would not accept them she said she did not conceiv the harm which some peopl imagin in a masquerad but that such extravag divers were onli proper for person of qualiti and fortun and not for young women who were to get their live and could at best hope to be marri to a good tradesman a tradesman cri nightingal you shall not undervalu my nanci there is not a nobleman upon earth abov her merit o fie mr nightingal answer mr miller you must not fill the girl head with such fanci but if it wa her good luck say the mother with a simper to find a gentleman of your gener way of think i hope she would make a better return to hi generos than to give her mind up to extravag pleasur inde where young ladi bring great fortun themselv they have some right to insist on spend what is their own and on that account i have heard the gentlemen say a man ha sometim a better bargain with a poor wife than with a rich one but let my daughter marri whom they will i shall endeavor to make them bless to their husband i beg therefor i may hear of no more masquerad nanci is i am certain too good a girl to desir to go for she must rememb when you carri her thither last year it almost turn her head and she did not return to herself or to her needl in a month afterward though a gentl sigh which stole from the bosom of nanci seem to argu some secret disapprob of these sentiment she did not dare openli to oppos them for as thi good woman had all the tender so she had preserv all the author of a parent and as her indulg to the desir of her children wa onli restrain by her fear for their safeti and futur welfar so she never suffer those command which proceed from such fear to be either disobey or disput and thi the young gentleman who had lodg two year in the hous knew so well that he present acquiesc in the refus mr nightingal who grew everi minut fonder of jone wa veri desir of hi compani that day to dinner at the tavern where he offer to introduc him to some of hi acquaint but jone beg to be excus as hi cloth he said were not yet come to town to confess the truth mr jone wa now in a situat which sometim happen to be the case of young gentlemen of much better figur than himself in short he had not one penni in hi pocket a situat in much greater credit among the ancient philosoph than among the modern wise men who live in lombard street or those who frequent white chocol hous and perhap the great honor which those philosoph have ascrib to an empti pocket may be one of the reason of that high contempt in which they are held in the aforesaid street and chocolatehous now if the ancient opinion that men might live veri comfort on virtu onli be as the modern wise men just abovement pretend to have discov a notori error no less fals is i apprehend that posit of some writer of romanc that a man can live altogeth on love for howev delici repast thi may afford to some of our sens or appetit it is most certain it can afford none to other those therefor who have place too great a confid in such writer have experienc their error when it wa too late and have found that love wa no more capabl of allay hunger than a rose is capabl of delight the ear or a violin of gratifi the smell notwithstand therefor all the delicaci which love had set befor him name the hope of see sophia at the masquerad on which howev illfound hi imagin might be he had voluptu feast dure the whole day the even no sooner came than mr jone began to languish for some food of a grosser kind partridg discov thi by intut and took the occas to give some obliqu hint concern the bankbil and when those were reject with disdain he collect courag enough onc more to mention a return to mr allworthi partridg cri jone you can not see my fortun in a more desper light than i see it myself and i begin heartili to repent that i suffer you to leav a place where you wa settl and to follow me howev i insist now on your return home and for the expens and troubl which you have so kindli put yourself to on my account all the cloth i left behind in your care i desir you would take as your own i am sorri i can make you no other acknowledg he spoke these word with so pathet an accent that partridg among whose vice ill natur or hard of heart were not number burst into tear and after swear he would not quit him in hi distress he began with the most earnest entreati to urg hi return home for heaven sake sir say he do but consid what can your honor do how is it possibl you can live in thi town without money do what you will sir or go wherev you pleas i am resolv not to desert you but pray sir consid do pray sir for your own sake take it into your consider and i am sure say he that your own goodsens will bid you return home how often shall i tell thee answer jone that i have no home to return to had i ani hope that mr allworthi door would be open to receiv me i want no distress to urg me nay there is no other caus upon earth which could detain me a moment from fli to hi presenc but ala that i am for ever banish from it hi last word were o partridg they still ring in my ear hi last word were when he gave me a sum of money what it wa i know not but consider i am sure it wa hi last word were i am resolv from thi day forward on no account to convers with you ani more here passion stop the mouth of jone as surpris for a moment did that of partridg but he soon recov the use of speech and after a short prefac in which he declar he had no inquisit in hi temper enquir what jone meant by a consider sum he knew not how much and what wa becom of the money in both these point he now receiv full satisfact on which he wa proceed to comment when he wa interrupt by a messag from mr nightingal who desir hi master compani in hi apart when the two gentlemen were both attir for the masquerad and mr nightingal had given order for chair to be sent for a circumst of distress occur to jone which will appear veri ridicul to mani of my reader thi wa how to procur a shill but if such reader will reflect a littl on what they have themselv felt from the want of a thousand pound or perhap of ten or twenti to execut a favorit scheme they will have a perfect idea of what mr jone felt on thi occas for thi sum therefor he appli to partridg which wa the first he had permit him to advanc and wa the last he intend that poor fellow should advanc in hi servic to say the truth partridg had late made no offer of thi kind whether it wa that he desir to see the bankbil broke in upon or that distress should prevail on jone to return home or from what other motiv it proceed i will not determin chap vii contain the whole humor of a masquerad our cavali now arriv at that templ where heydegg the great arbit deliciarum the great high priest of pleasur presid and like other heathen priest impos on hi votari by the pretend presenc of the deiti when in realiti no such deiti is there mr nightingal have taken a turn or two with hi companion soon left him and walk off with a femal say now you are here sir you must beat about for your own game jone began to entertain strong hope that hi sophia wa present and these hope gave him more spirit than the light the music and the compani though these are pretti strong antidot against the spleen he now accost everi woman he saw whose statur shape or air bore ani resembl to hi angel to all of whom he endeavor to say someth smart in order to engag an answer by which he might discov that voic which he thought it imposs he should mistak some of these answer by a question in a squeak voic do you know me much the greater number said i dont know you sir and noth more some call him an impertin fellow some made him no answer at all some said inde i dont know your voic and i shall have noth to say to you and mani gave him as kind answer as he could wish but not in the voic he desir to hear whilst he wa talk with one of these last who wa in the habit of a shepherdess a ladi in a domino came up to him and slap him on the shoulder whisper him at the same time in the ear if you talk ani longer with that trollop i will acquaint miss western jone no sooner heard that name than immedi quit hi former companion he appli to the domino beg and entreat her to show him the ladi she had mention if she wa then in the room the mask walk hastili to the upper end of the innermost apart befor she spoke and then instead of answer him sat down and declar she wa tire jone sat down by her and still persist in hi entreati at last the ladi coldli answer i imagin mr jone had been a more discern lover than to suffer ani disguis to conceal hi mistress from him is she here then madam repli jone with much vehem upon which the ladi cri hush sir you will be observ i promis you upon my honor miss western is not here jone now take the mask by the hand fell to entreat her in the most earnest manner to acquaint him where he might find sophia and when he could obtain no direct answer he began to upbraid her gentli for have disappoint him the day befor and conclud say inde my good fairi queen i know your majesti veri well notwithstand the affect disguis of your voic inde mr fitzpatrick it is a littl cruel to divert yourself at the expens of my torment the mask answer though you have so ingeni discov me i must still speak in the same voic lest i should be known by other and do you think good sir that i have no greater regard for my cousin than to assist in carri on an affair between you two which must end in her ruin as well as your own besid i promis you my cousin is not mad enough to consent to her own destruct if you are so much her enemi as to tempt her to it ala madam said jone you littl know my heart when you call me an enemi of sophia and yet to ruin ani one cri the other you will allow is the act of an enemi and when by the same act you must knowingli and certainli bring ruin on yourself is it not folli or mad as well as guilt now sir my cousin ha veri littl more than her father will pleas to give her veri littl for one of her fashion you know him and you know your own situat jone vow he had no such design on sophia that he would rather suffer the most violent of death than sacrific her interest to hi desir he said he knew how unworthi he wa of her everi way that he had long ago resolv to quit all such aspir thought but that some strang accid had made him desir to see her onc more when he promis he would take leav of her for ever no madam conclud he my love is not of that base kind which seek it own satisfact at the expens of what is most dear to it object i would sacrific everi thing to the possess of my sophia but sophia herself though the reader may have alreadi conceiv no veri sublim idea of the virtu of the ladi in the mask and though possibl she may hereaft appear not to deserv one of the first charact of her sex yet it is certain these gener sentiment made a strong impress upon her and greatli ad to the affect she had befor conceiv for our young hero the ladi now after a silenc of a few moment said she did not see hi pretens to sophia so much in the light of presumpt as of imprud young fellow say she can never have too aspir thought i love ambit in a young man and i would have you cultiv it as much as possibl perhap you may succeed with those who are infinit superior in fortun nay i am convinc there are women but dont you think me a strong creatur mr jone to be thu give advic to a man with whom i am so littl acquaint and one with whose behavior to me i have so littl reason to be pleas here jone began to apolog and to hope he had not offend in ani thing he had said of her cousin to which the mask answer and are you so littl vers in the sex to imagin you can well affront a ladi more than by entertain her with your passion for anoth woman if the fairi queen had had no better opinion of your gallantri she would scarc have appoint you to meet her at a masquerad jone had never less inclin to an amor than at present but gallantri to the ladi wa among hi principl of honor and he held it as much incumb on him to accept a challeng to love as if it had been a challeng to fight nay hi veri love to sophia made it necessari for him to keep well with the ladi as he made no doubt but she wa capabl of bring him into the presenc of the other he began therefor to make a veri warm answer to her last speech when a mask in the charact of an old woman join them thi mask wa one of those ladi who go to a masquerad onli to vent ill natur by tell peopl rude truth and by endeavor as the phrase is to spoil as much sport as they are abl thi good ladi therefor have observ jone and hi friend whom she well knew in close consult togeth in a corner of the room conclud she could no where satisfi her spleen better than by interrupt them she attack them therefor and soon drove them from their retir nor wa she content with thi but pursu them to everi place which they shift to avoid her till mr nightingal see the distress of hi friend at last reliev him and engag the old woman in anoth pursuit while jone and hi mask were walk togeth about the room to rid themselv of the teazer he observ hi ladi speak to sever mask with the same freedom of acquaint as if they had been barefac he could not help express hi surpris at thi say sure madam you must have infinit discern to know peopl in all disguis to which the ladi answer you can not conceiv ani thing more insipid and childish than a masquerad to the peopl of fashion who in gener know one anoth as well here as when they meet in an assembl or a draw room nor will ani woman of condit convers with a person with whom she is not acquaint in short the gener of person whom you see here may more properli be said to kill time in thi place than in ani other and gener retir from henc more tire than from the longest sermon to say the truth i begin to be in that situat myself and if i have ani faculti at guess you are not much better pleas i protest it would be almost chariti in me to go home for your sake i know but one chariti equal to it cri jone and that is to suffer me to wait on you home sure answer the ladi you have a strang opinion of me to imagin that upon such an acquaint i would let you into my door at thi time onight i fanci you imput the friendship i have shown my cousin to some other motiv confess honestli dont you consid thi contriv interview as littl better than a downright assign are you use mr jone to make these sudden conquest i am not use madam said jone to submit to such sudden conquest but as you have taken my heart by surpris the rest of my bodi ha a right to follow so you must pardon me if i resolv to attend you wherev you go he accompani these word with some proper action upon which the ladi after a gentl rebuk and say their familiar would be observ told him she wa go to sup with an acquaint whither she hope he would not follow her for if you should said she i shall be thought an unaccount creatur though my friend inde is not censori yet i hope you will not follow me i protest i shall not know what to say if you do the ladi present after quit the masquerad and jone notwithstand the sever prohibit he had receiv presum to attend her he wa now reduc to the same dilemma we have mention befor name the want of shill and could not reliev it by borrow as befor he therefor walk boldli on after the chair in which hi ladi rode pursu by a grand huzza from all the chairmen present who wise take the best care they can to discounten all walk afoot by their better luckili howev the gentri who attend at the operahous were too busi to quit their station and as the late of the hour prevent him from meet mani of their brethren in the street he proceed without molest in a dress which at anoth season would have certainli rais a mob at hi heel the ladi wa set down in a street not far from hanoversquar where the door be present open she wa carri in and the gentleman without ani ceremoni walk in after her jone and hi companion were now togeth in a veri wellfurnish and wellwarmd room when the femal still speak in her masquerad voic said she wa surpris at her friend who must absolut have forgot her appoint at which after vent much resent she suddenli express some apprehens from jone and ask him what the world would think of their have been alon togeth in a hous at that time of night but instead of a direct answer to so import a question jone began to be veri importun with the ladi to unmask and at length have prevail there appear not mr fitzpatrick but the ladi bellaston herself it would be tediou to give the particular convers which consist of veri common and ordinari occurr and which last from two till six oclock in the morn it is suffici to

then take hi leav of her when thi wa thoroughli settl and a second meet in the even appoint at the same place they separ the ladi return to her hous and jone to hi lodg chap viii contain a scene of

go and chang it partridg receiv thi with sparkl eye though when he came to reflect farther it rais in him some suspicion not veri advantag to the honor of hi master to these the dread idea he had of the masquerad the disguis in which hi master had gone out and return and hi have been abroad all night contribut in plain languag the onli way he could possibl find to account for the possess of thi note wa by robberi and to confess the truth the reader unless he should suspect it wa owe to the generos of ladi bellaston can hardli imagin ani other to clear therefor the honor of mr jone and to do justic to the liber of the ladi he had realli receiv thi present from her who though she did not give much in to the hackney chariti of the age such as build hospit etc wa not howev entir void of that christian virtu and conceiv veri righti i think that a young fellow of merit without a shill in the world wa no improp object of thi virtu mr jone and mr nightingal had been invit to dine thi day with
