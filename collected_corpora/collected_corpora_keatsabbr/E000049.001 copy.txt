longman green co paternosterrow iv for heaven sake buy two book kant fundament principl of the metaphys of moral and kant critic examin of the practic reason kant is not a light of the world but a whole solar system at onc jean paul richter first edit of thi translat second edit enlarg third edit further enlarg fourth edit dublin print at the univers press by ponsonbi and weldrick v translat prefac to third edit thi volum contain the whole of kant work on the gener theori of ethi it consist of four parts— i a complet translat of the grundlegung zur metaphysik der sitten thi work wa first publish in ii a complet translat of the kritik der praktischen vernunft first publish in iii a translat of the gener introduct to the metaphys element of moral philosophi metaphysisch anfangsgrund der sittenlehr and of the prefac and introduct to the metaphys element of ethic metaph anfangsgründ der tugendlehr iv the first portion of die religion innerhalb der grenzen der blossen vernunft otherwis name philosophisch religionslehr thi portion wa first publish vi by kant himself separ in and it appear to me to be indispens to a complet view of kant ethic the remaind of the work first edit doe not come within the sphere of ethic proper i have ad in an appendix a translat of kant essay—ueb ein vermeint recht au menschenlieb zu lügen werk ed rosenkr vol vii which is interest as throw further light on kant applic of hi principl the first of these treatis and half of the second were translat by mr sempl edinburgh reprint in connexion with the greater part of the metaphysik der sitten which is concern with the discuss of particular virtu and vice mr sempl ha also translat in a distinct volum the religion u s w the edit which i have use is that of kant whole work by rosenkranz and schubert vol viii of which contain the grundlegung and the kritik and vol x the religion for conveni of refer to the origin i have given at the top of each page the correspond page of rosenkranz edit it is not veri accur print and where the error are obviou i have silent correct them other i have vii notic in footnot mani of these error seem to have been hand down through all edit from the first hartenstein edit is more care revis and i have refer to it and to kirchmann in case of doubt kant grammat error partli provinci partli due to hi age are usual correct by hartenstein but silent which is a somewhat question proceed in an editor amongst these error are uncertainti in the use of the indic and conjunct an almost thoroughgo misus of preposit hartenstein and irregular in the gender of substant hi use of vor for für ha been gener correct by editor where vor remain the reader must rememb that it retent is a matter of judgment i have to express my oblig to professor selss for hi kind in revis the proof and for mani valuabl suggest the memoir prefix will it is hope prove interest in the present fourth edit some correct have been made the portrait prefix is from a photograph of an oilpaint in the possess of gräfe and unzer booksel of königsberg it is inferior as a work of art to the portrait engrav in the former edit viii but as it repres kant in the vigour of hi age and unlik the former ha never appear in ani book reader will probabl be pleas with the substitut i possess also a copi of a rare fulllength silhouett photograph copi of which can be suppli my note are in squar bracket ix xiii memoir of kant immanuel kant wa born in königsberg on the nd of april thirteen year after hume and fourteen after reid hi famili wa of scottish origin hi grandfath have been one of the mani scotchmen who emigr from scotland at the end of the seventeenth centuri some settl in prussia and some in sweden and he is said to have been himself the first to chang the spell of the name from cant which he did in order to avoid the mispronunci zant hi father wa a saddler in modest if not humbl circumst both parent were person of simpl and sincer pieti kant himself although he did not sympath with their religi view bear the strongest testimoni to the practic effect of their religion on their life although said he speak warmli the religi idea of that time and the notion of what wa call virtu and pieti were far from be distinct and satisfactori yet such person had the root of the matter in them let men decri pietism as they may the peopl who were in earnest with it were honour distinguish they possess the highest that man can possess—that calm that seren that inward peac which is not disturb by ani passion no troubl no persecut dismay them no contest had the power to stir xiv them up to anger or hostil in a word even the mere observ wa involuntarili compel to respect them i still rememb ad he how a quarrel onc broke out between the harnessmak and the saddler about their respect privileg my father suffer consider nevertheless even in convers amongst hi own famili he spoke about thi quarrel with such forbear and love toward hi oppon and with such firm trust in provid that although i wa then onli a boy i shall never forget it of hi mother especi he ever retain a tender and grate memori say i shall never forget my mother for she plant and foster the first germ of good in me she open my heart to the impress of natur she awok and enlarg my thought and her teach ha alway had an endur and wholesom influenc on my life she die when he wa onli thirteen and even in hi later year he could scarc restrain hi emot when he relat to hi intim friend how she had sacrif her own life through her devot to a friend kant strongli resembl hi mother in featur and in hi singularli contract chest xv at ten year of age kant wa sent to the collegium fridericianum where he continu for seven year here he appli himself chiefli to classic studi and learn to write latin with eas and fluenci of greek he doe not seem to have ever read much amongst hi schoolfellow wa david ruhnken and these two with a third name kund read their favourit author togeth and laid their plan for the futur all three propos to devot themselv to classic literatur ruhnken actual attain high distinct in thi field at the age of sixteen kant pass to the univers where he appli himself chiefli to mathemat and philosophi the instruct in hi favourit subject the ancient classic be inadequ he had enter himself as a theolog student and as wa then the practic with such student in prussia he occasion preach in the neighbour church inde he had complet hi theolog cours when he final gave up that line of studi no doubt hi tast had been long turn in a differ direct but the immedi caus of hi decis seem to have been the failur of hi applic for a subordin post in a school such post be usual the first step to ecclesiast appoint dure the latter part of hi resid at the univers he had been oblig to eke out hi scanti mean by give instruct in classic mathemat and natur philosophi to some of hi fellowstud for whom the lectur of the professor were too difficult but the littl that he could earn in thi way wa insuffici for hi support when by hi father death he wa thrown altogeth on hi own resourc xvi he therefor sought and obtain employ as a resid tutor in famili of distinct he wa thu engag for nine year and accord to hi own candid confess in later year there wa hardli ever a tutor with a better theori or a wors practic howev that may be he certainli gain the affect of hi pupil and the respect of their parent at the begin of thi period he publish hi first work—an essay on the estim of vi viva and toward the end of it hi second—a brief discuss of the question whether the length of the day ha undergon ani chang a question which had been propos by the berlin academi as the subject for a prize essay kant argu that the tide must have the effect of retard the earth rotat and he enter into a rough calcul of the amount of thi retard hi first step to a conjectur approxim be an estim of the effect of the impuls of the water on the whole east coast of the american contin hi suggest wa sound and sagaci but he overr vastli the amount of the effect he infer that the day had lengthen by about ½s in two thousand year accord to delaunay the actual amount of retard is s in year thi result is base on histor fact the record of eclips kant wa a pure physic calcul and for thi he did not xvii possess suffici data on account of thi inevit lack of precis he did not offer hi essay in competit for the prize the same essay contain anoth veri remark suggest in explan of the fact that the moon alway present the same face to the earth in fact if the moon were origin in a fluid state the tide produc in it by the earth which would be veri great would similarli retard it rotat until the fluid surfac attain a posit of equilibrium rel to the earth i e until the moon rotat round it axi in the same time that it revolv round the earth thi specul ha been recent brought forward as novel the conjectur as to the moon origin fluiditi wa no isol one in kant mind on the contrari he speak of it as part of a gener theori of the heaven which he wa about to publish in the follow year accordingli he publish anonym an import work of about page entitl a gener theori of the heaven or essay on the mechan origin of the structur of the univers on the principl of newton thi work is an elabor exposit of the nebular theori commonli call by the name of laplac although laplac systèm du mond wa not publish till forti year later the onli consider differ are first that laplac suppos the condens of the diffus matter to be the result of cool and secondli that he postul an origin movement of rotat wherea kant thought he could account for both condens and rotat from the two elementari forc of attract and repuls it is not easi to say whether laplac xviii wa awar of kant prioriti he assert inde that he wa not awar of ani theori except buffon a rather extravag one but then laplac never did acknowledg that he borrow anyth from anybodi els even when he use the mathemat discoveri of contemporari frenchmen he introduc them as if they were hi own how much more if he adopt a suggest of an anonym german philosoph if he realli did calcul on the ignor of hi reader the event ha justifi hi expect for even those writer who mention kant prioriti speak as if kant had mere thrown out a hint while laplac had develop a theori wherea in fact kant wrote a treatis on the subject and laplac onli a few page kant begin by defend hi attempt against the possibl object of those who might regard it as an endeavour to dispens with the necess for a divin author such person he say appear to suppos that natur left to it own law would produc onli disord and that the adapt we admir indic the interfer of a compel hand as if natur were a rebelli subject that could be reduc to order onli by compuls or els were an independ principl whose properti are uncaus and which god strive to reduc into the plan of hi purpos but answer he if the gener law of matter are themselv a result of suprem wisdom must they not be fit to carri out it wise design in fact xix we have here a power weapon in aid of theism when we trace certain benefici effect to the regular work of the law of natur we see that these effect are not produc by chanc but that these law can work in no other way but if the natur of thing were independ and necessari what an astound accid or rather what an imposs would it not be that they should fit togeth just as a wise and good choic would have made them fit as thi appli to such reason in gener so it appli also to the present undertak we shall find that matter had certain law impos on it by virtu of which it necessarili produc the finest combin that there is a god is prove even by thi that natur even in chao could onli proceed with regular and order he proce to work out in detail the problem of the format of the planet out of the origin diffus matter take into consider the eccentr inclin c of the planet the ring of saturn the satellit the comet it is notic that he doe not like laplac regard the ring of saturn as an illustr of hi theori on account of their larg inclin to the eclipt ° he thought it necessari to assign to them a differ origin hi hypothesi wa that they were produc by eman from the planet itself and he show further as laplac afterward did that the ring must have a movement of rotat and that in consequ of the differ veloc belong to differ distanc from the planet it stabil requir that it should consist of sever distinct ring thi conjectur or rather deduct xx ha been verifi he also conjectur as a result of hi hypothesi regard the format of the ring that the great veloc of rotat of particl of the inner ring would be the same as that of the planet equat from thi consider combin with the assumpt that the ring conform to kepler third law he deduc the time of the planet rotat he drew particular attent to thi as the first predict of the kind hi deduct howev ha not been verifi saturn time of rotat is nearli doubl what it ought to be on kant theori anoth conjectur of hi subsequ verifi wa that there are planet beyond saturn later he conjectur also the exist of a planet between mar and jupit kant then extend hi view to the sider system he state that the first to suggest to him that the fix star constitut a system wa wright of durham kant develop thi concept if gravit is a xxi univers properti of matter we can not suppos the sun attract forc limit to our system but if it extend to the nearest fix star and if the fix star like sun exercis a similar forc around them then they would sooner or later fall togeth if not prevent like the planet by a centrifug forc henc we may conclud that all the star of the firmament have their own orbit motion if we conceiv our planetari system multipli a thousandfold and the sever bodi in it to be selflumin the appear as seen from the earth would resembl that of the milki way the form of the heaven of the fix star then is in great an effect of the same systemat arrang as our system in littl our sun with the other star are in short the planet of a vaster system which is in fact the milki way there may be mani such system and some of these may appear to us as nebulæ and these be seen obliqu would present an ellipt form the milki way seen from a suffici distanc would appear like one of these ellipt nebulæ but these system again may be mutual relat and constitut togeth a still more immeasur system thi open to us a view into the infinit field of creation and give us a concept of the work of god suitabl to the infin of the great creator if the magnitud of a planetari system in which the earth is as a grain of sand fill our understand with wonder with what amaz are we seiz when we consid the vast multitud of world and system which constitut xxii the milki way and how is thi amaz increas again when we learn that all these immeasur star system are in their turn onli a unit in a number whose limit we know not and which is perhap as inconceiv great as the former while it is itself the unit of a new combin there is here a verit abyss of immens in which all human power of concept is lost the wisdom the good the power that are reveal are infinit and in the same degre fruit and activ the plan of it revel must therefor be equal infinit he ventur upon the conjectur give hi reason that natur may in cours of time be again reduc to chao and again emerg like a phœnix from it ash when we contempl natur in these success chang carri out the plan by which god reveal himself in wonder that fill space and etern the mind is overwhelm with astonish but not satisfi with thi vast yet perish object the soul desir to know more nearli that be whose intellig and whose great are the sourc of that light which spread as from a centr over all natur with what awe must not the soul regard even it own natur when it reflect that it shall outliv all these chang o happi he exclaim when amid the tumult of the element and the ruin of natur it is place on a height from whenc it can as it were see beneath it feet the desol of all perish thing xxiii of the world reason could not even dare to wish for such happi but revel teach us to hope for it with confid when the fetter that have bound us to the vaniti of the creatur have fallen off the immort spirit will find itself in the enjoy of true happi in communion with the infinit be the contempl of the harmoni of univers natur with the will of god must fill with everincreas satisfact the ration creatur who find himself unit to thi sourc of all perfect view from thi centr natur will show on all side noth but stabil and fit it chang can not interfer with the happi of a creatur who ha reach thi height in sweet foretast of thi condit the soul can exercis it mouth in those song of prais with which all etern shall ring— when natur fail and day and night divid thi work no more my evergr heart o lord thi merci shall ador through all etern to thee a joy song ill rais for oh etern too short to utter all thi prais addison discuss the question whether the planet are inhabit he state hi opinion that it would be absurd to deni thi as to all or even most of them but in the wealth of natur in which world and system are to the whole creation onli sundust there may well be xxiv wast and uninhabit place as there are uninhabit wast on our own earth perhap inde he add some of the planet are not yet brought into a state fit for habit it may take thousand of year to bring the matter of a great planet into a steadi condit jupit appear to be in thi transit state one planet may come to it perfect thousand of year later than anoth we may be sure that most of the planet are inhabit and those that are not will be so in due time he imagin that the further the planet are from the sun the more the inhabit excel in liveli and distinct of thought indulg in fanci he ask doe sin exist in those world and suggest that perhap the be in the inferior planet may be too low to be respons those in the superior planet too wise and too elev to fall into sin with the except perhap of mar perhap he add some of these bodi may be prepar for our futur habit who know whether the satellit which revolv round jupit are destin one day to illumin us no one howev will base hi hope of the futur on such uncertain fanci when corrupt ha claim it part in human natur then shall the immort spirit swiftli soar abov all that is finit and continu it exist in a new relat to the whole of natur aris from it nearer relat to the suprem be when we gaze on the starri heaven with our mind fill with such thought as have here been express while all natur is at rest and our sens also in repos the hidden faculti of xxv the immort soul speak in a languag unutter and give us concept which can be felt but not describ if there are on thi planet think be so base as to bind themselv to the servic of corrupt in spite of all that draw them away from it how unhappi is thi globe to produc such miser creatur but how happi on the other hand that under condit worthi of all accept a way is open to them to attain to a happi and a digniti infinit beyond all the advantag which the most favour arrang of natur can reach in all the bodi of the univers the reader who is interest in kant himself will readili pardon thi long notic of a work to which he attach some import at it first public it wa dedic to the king frederick the great and the theori develop in it is frequent refer to by kant in hi subsequ write for he never ceas to take an interest in these subject so late as he wrote an essay on the volcano in the moon with refer to an observ of herschel in thi paper he suggest a mode of account for the great heat of the sun and origin of the planet hi suggest is base on the discoveri of crawford that heat is develop by condens on the hypothesi then that the sun and planet were form by the condens of matter origin diffus through the whole xxvi space thi heat would be a direct consequ of the condens still later in write on the influenc of the moon on the weather he throw out the suggest that the moon centr of graviti may for reason which he give lie beyond it centr of figur a consequ of which would be that ani air and water which might be upon it surfac would be collect at the side remot from us in anoth instanc both kant and laplac might have had reason to say pereant qui ant no nostra dixerunt in kant wrote a short paper on the theori of the wind in which for the first time as he believ he gave the true account of the trade wind and monsoon halley had shown that the effect of the sun in heat the atmospher at the equat would be to caus an indraught toward the equat from north and south thi indraught accord to him natur follow the daili cours of the sun and henc the east kant show that thi theori wa unten in fact the wind would tend rather to meet the sun the region to the west be the cooler nor could a wind from such a caus extend with nearli equal forc all round the earth kant show further that owe to the differ in the veloc of rotat between the part near the equat and those near the pole all wind that move from the pole toward the equat tend to becom more and more easterli and those that move from the equat toward the pole becom more and more xxvii westerli henc in the northern hemispher everi north wind tend to becom a northeast and everi south wind a southwest wind in the southern hemispher on the contrari south wind tend to becom southeast and north wind northwest he follow out in some detail the gener principl of thi circul of the atmospher we can thu explain for instanc the monsoon of the indian ocean c which blow from april to septemb from the southwest for when the sun is north of the equat the wind blow from the equat toward these part and therefor take a southwesterli direct again the current from the pole toward the equat is balanc by a counter current the heat air in the upper strata at the equat overflow as it were toward the pole when thi descend or overcom the weaker motion of the lower strata it becom in the northern hemispher a westerli wind such as prevail between the th and th degre of latitud kant subsequ introduc thi theori into hi cours of lectur on physic geographi which wa veri numer attend laplac propound the same theori forti year later xxviii in kant publish hi essay on the onli possibl demonstr proof of the exist of god the proof develop in thi essay is found on the principl that everi possibl of exist presuppos an actual exist thing on which it depend thi he character as a more thoroughli à priori argument than ani other that ha been propos sinc it doe not assum ani actual fact of exist i need not explain how he develop step by step the attribut of uniti intellig c at a later period he himself abandon thi line of argument howev the greater part of the essay is occupi with remark on design in the constitut of natur and with an exposit of the theori develop in the abovement treatis on the structur of the heaven we may he observ argu from design either as exhibit in a conting arrang for exampl in the bodi of an anim or in a plant or we may argu from the necessari result of the constitut of matter the law of motion c the latter method ha the great advantag of present the first caus not mere as an architect but as a creator from thi point of view he instanc first the simplic and harmoni result from the geometr condit of space e g that if we seek all the path which a fall bodi would travers either to or from the same point in the same time they are found to be chord of the same circl again he take the manifold and harmoni benefit result by necessari law from the mere fact of the exist of an atmospher there may be mani reason for it exist if we suppos it primari purpos to be that it should serv for respir we find that it exist lead to other xxix import benefici result it make cloud possibl which intercept excess heat prevent too rapid cool and dri and keep the land suppli with the necessari moistur from the great reservoir of the sea by caus twilight it prevent the strain on the eye which would be caus by the sudden chang from day to night it exist prevent rain from drop with too great forc and it pressur make suck possibl if it occur to anyon to say—oh these are all the necessari result of the natur of matter c he answer ye it is just thi that show that they proceed from a wise creator he treat of the law of motion from the same point of view and then take occas to show how the law of the planetari motion result from the simplest law of matter attract and repuls in conclus he remark that while it is of the greatest consequ to be convinc of the exist of god it is by no mean necessari to have a demonstr of it and those who can not grasp the demonstr proof are advis to hold fast by the more easili apprehend proof from design hardli inde he observ would anyon stake hi whole happi on the correct of a metaphys proof especi if it were oppos to the convict of sens the argument from design is more strike and vivid as well as easi to the common understand and more natur than ani other it also give an idea of the wisdom and provid c of god which come home and ha the greatest effect in produc awe and humil and it is in fine more practic than ani other even in the view of a philosoph it doe not inde give a definit abstract idea of xxx divin nor doe it claim mathemat certainti but so mani proof each of great forc take possess of the soul and the specul may calmli follow sinc convict ha preceded—a convict far abov the forc of ani subtil object in the same year in which kant publish hi theori of the heaven he issu hi first metaphys treatis principiorum primorum cognitioni metaphysicœ nova dilucidatio and publicli defend it as an exercis prior to hi obtain permiss to deliv lectur in the univers as a privatdoc he forthwith commenc lectur on mathemat and physic to these subject he afterward ad lectur on philosophi natur theolog physic geographi anthropolog and fortif he had alreadi so great a reput that at hi first lectur the room in hi own hous wa fill liter to overflow the student crowd even on the stair hi lectur are thu describ by the celebr herder who attend them in the year i have had the good fortun to know a philosoph who wa my teacher he had the happi sprightli of a youth and thi i believ he retain even in old age hi open thought brow wa the seat of unruffl calm and joy discours full of thought flow from hi lip jest and wit and humour were at hi command and hi lectur wa the most entertain convers with the same geniu with which he criticis leibnitz wolf crusiu hume and expound the law of newton and kepler he would also take up the write of rousseau or ani recent discoveri in natur give hi estim of them and come back again to the knowledg of natur and xxxi to the moral worth of man natur histori natur philosophi the histori of nation and human natur mathemat and experience—thes were the sourc from which he enliven hi lectur and hi convers noth worth know wa indiffer to him no parti no sect no desir of fame or profit had the smallest charm for him compar with the advanc and elucid of the truth he encourag and urg to independ thought and wa far from wish to domin thi man whom i name with the greatest gratitud and rever is immanuel kant hi imag stand pleasantli befor me hi lectur attract mani hearer of matur age and visitor to königsberg even prolong their stay for the purpos of attend them at the same time he continu to act as tutor to young men special entrust to hi care who live with him he had to wait fifteen year in the posit of privatdoc befor obtain a professorship he had inde been offer a professorship by the govern befor thi but it wa almost the onli chair which he felt he could not worthili fill—th chair of poetri thi involv not onli the censorship of new poem but the composit of poem for academ celebr and kant declin the offic in the follow year he wa appoint sublibrarian at the modest salari of thaler thi wa hi first offici appoint œt four year later he wa nomin to the professorship of logic and metaphys with an incom from all sourc of xxxii thaler thi wa ultim increas to thi wa of cours exclus of fee from student he inaugur hi professorship by defend hi essay de mundi sensibili atqu intelligibili forma et principii in thi he distinguish the sensibl apprehens of phenomena from the concept of the understand just as in the critiqu of pure reason he show precis as in the latter work that space and time are form of the intuit of sens as professor he continu to lectur in the same wide circl of subject as befor the lectur on physic geographi and anthropolog were especi popular he wa fond of studi natur but especi human natur in all it phase and took great pleasur in read book of travel although he never travel have an excel memori and a live power of imagin he could distinctli pictur to himself even in minut detail the sever object describ on one occas he describ westminst bridg it form dimens c with such detail and distinct that an englishman who wa present thought he wa an architect and had spent some year in london at anoth time he spoke of itali as if he had known it from long person acquaint so popular were hi lectur that we find von zedlitz the prussian minist write from berlin to say that he is read with pleasur an imperfect manuscript report of the lectur on physic geographi and request kant to favour him with a xxxiii correct copi these lectur were publish in the lectur on anthropolog had appear in both work are written in an extrem interest and popular style and those on anthropolog are full of entertain remark and illustr anecdot not without humour thu speak of the emot that natur employ for the promot of health which are chiefli laugh and weep he remark that anger also conduc to health if one can indulg in a good scold without fear of opposit and in fact mani a housewif get no hearti exercis except in scold her children and servant and provid these take it patient a pleasant feel of fatigu spread itself through the organ thi sort of exercis howev he add is not without danger as the object of the scold may possibl resist even when lectur on metaphys kant is said to have been lucid and interest when the difficulti of hi write wa complain of he use to say that he wrote for thinker by profess and with these technic express had the advantag of breviti besid said he it flatter the vaniti of the reader to find perplex and obscur here and there which he can solv by hi own acut but in hi lectur he endeavour to be clear and intellig he sought as he express it to teach not philosophi but to philosoph in one of hi letter he state that he wa unceasingli observ of phenomena and their law even in common life so that from first to last hi hearer should not have to listen to a dri exposit but be interest by be led to compar hi remark with their own observ it wa hi custom to keep hi eye fix on some xxxiv particular student sit near him perhap in order to judg from the hearer counten whether he wa make himself understood so arago in hi popular lectur use to select for the same purpos the most stupidlook person in the audienc continu hi explan until the person fix show sign of intellig with kant howev the consequ were disastr if the student happen to have ani peculiar or defect either in person or dress one day the student thu select happen to have lost a button from hi coat kant glanc recur to the vacant spot and dure the whole lectur hi thought were distract and even confus in a manner inexplic to those who were not in the secret he did not like to see hi hearer take note but would say put up your pencil gentlemen and would not begin until they had done so the reason of thi wa that he thought such attempt at report interf with their attent to the matter of the lectur by fix it on the word some of hi hearer took full note nevertheless in he form the design of write a critic examin of pure reason theoret and practic the former part of which he hope to complet in three month the month grew to year six year later he write that he expect it to appear thi summer and that it would not be a larg volum it did not see the light howev until nine year after he had announc that it would be readi in three month when thi masterwork wa produc kant wa fiftyseven year of age he state himself that it wa hume that rous xxxv him from hi dogmat slumber and compel him to seek a solid barrier against sceptic it is state on kant own author that he did not commit to write a singl sentenc in thi work on which he had not first ask the judgment of hi friend green a man to whom kant show such defer deserv a brief notic he wa an english merchant and dure the american war of independ happen to be present when kant who sympath with the american denounc the conduct of england in strong term green sprang up in a rage declar that kant word were a person insult to him as an englishman and demand satisfact kant repli so calmli and persuas that green shook hand with him and they becam fast friend and continu so until the death of green in a loss which kant deepli felt of the critiqu of pure reason i need not here speak suffic it to say that as lock attempt to keep the mind from go beyond it tether wa follow at no long interv by the ideal of berkeley and the annihil sceptic of hume so kant analog attempt led in a still shorter space to the most complet ideal and transcendent inde hi review not unnatur mistook him for an idealist and hamann call him the prussian hume xxxvi the work excit a live controversi in the philosoph world but most of the public to which it gave rise have been long forgotten kant fame howev rose to the highest and königsberg becam a shrine to which student and tourist made pilgrimag the critiqu of pure reason wa to be follow by the metaphys element of natur philosophi and of moral philosophi the former appear in under the titl metaphysisch anfangsgründ der naturwissenschaft the view respect motion with which thi treatis commenc had howev alreadi been publish as a programm of lectur in motion is onli rel to the surround space while i sit with a ball on the tabl befor me in the cabin of a ship moor in a river i say that the ball is at rest i look out and see that the ship ha been unmoor and is drift westward the ball then is move but i reflect that the earth is rotat with greater veloc eastward the ball then is move eastward nay for the earth in it orbit is move westward with still higher speed the orbit itself is move i can not tell how rapidli nor do i know in what direct in ani case then it is the same thing whether i regard a point as move in it space or regard the space as move and the point as at rest henc the law of the composit of motion result directli for if a be a point have a motion of one foot per second westward and two feet per second southward i can regard it as have onli the southward motion while the space in which it is is move one foot per second eastward at the end therefor xxxvii of one second the point will be found two feet to the south and as it space in move east ha left it one foot behind it will also be one foot west rel to it surround space thi is the same as if it had move in the diagon of the parallelogram kant claim as an advantag of thi proof that it repres the result motion not as an effect of the two motion but as actual includ them it is incompar simpler and more philosoph than the proof given by dalembert and other contemporari mathematician when we treat of collis of bodi thi mode of view the matter becom absolut indispens if the bodi a is approach the bodi b equal to it with a veloc of two degre we regard a as move with a speed of one degre while b and it space move one degre in the opposit direct the motion be equal and opposit the result of their contact is mutual rest but as the space is move thi rest is equival to a motion of the two bodi in contact rel to the surround space and in amount one degre if the bodi are unequ and have unequ veloc we have onli to divid the veloc in the invers proport of the mass and assign to the space the motion which we take from one to add to the other and the result will again be mutual rest which is equival to a motion of the bodi in contact with a veloc equal and opposit to what we have assign to the space we can in thi way banish altogeth the notion of vi inertiœ matter could not exist unless there were both a repuls forc and an attract forc if attract onli exist matter would be condens into a point xxxviii if repuls onli it would be dispers infinit the rel incompress of matter is noth but the repuls forc eman from point which increas as the distanc diminish perhap invers as the cube and would therefor requir an infinit pressur to overcom it altogeth physic contact is the immedi action and reaction of incompress the action of matter on matter without contact is what is call actio in distan and the attract of gravit is of thi kind both attract and repuls be elementari forc are inexplic but the forc of attract is not a whit more incomprehens than the origin repuls forc incompress appear more comprehens sole becaus it is immedi present to the sens wherea attract is onli infer it seem at first sight a contradict to say that a bodi can act where it is not but in fact we might rather say that everyth in space act where it is not for to act where it is it should occupi the veri same space as the thing act on to say that there can be no action without physic contact is as much as to say that matter can act onli by the forc of incompress in other word that repuls forc are either the onli forc of matter or the condit of all it action which is a groundless assert the ground of the mistak is a confus between mathemat contact and physic contact that bodi attract one anoth without contact mean that they approach one anoth accord to a certain law without ani forc of repuls be requir as a condit and thi is just as conceiv as that they should separ from xxxix one anoth without an attract forc be suppos as a condit kant howev thought it conceiv that in the case of chemic solut there might be complet interpenetr or intussuscept on thi view of matter we may he remark regard matter as infinit divis the fundament principl of the metaphys of moral had appear the year befor the lastment work and wa follow in by the critic examin of practic reason both these are translat in the present volum the few remark i have to offer on them will be found at the end of the memoir in wa publish the critic examin of the faculti of judgment the essay on the corrupt of human natur which form the third part of thi volum appear in in a berlin magazin four year befor thi an edict had been issu limit the freedom of the press and appoint special censor whose xl busi wa to examin as to the orthodoxi not onli of book but of professor lectur and theolog candid the magazin in question wa print in jena but in order to avoid ani appear of underhand deal kant expressli desir that hi essay should be submit to the berlin licens author who gave hi imprimatur on the ground that onli deep thinker read kant work the second part of the work on the theori of religion wa refer to the theolog censor who refus hi imprimatur kant accordingli submit hi essay to the censorship of the theolog faculti of königsberg and thi unanim sanction the public which reach a second edit in the follow year the berlin censor were natur annoy at thi way of escap their decis and the sever remark in the prefac did not tend to concili them a few month afterward kant receiv an order from the king frederick william ii forbid him to teach or write anyth further in thi manner kant did not mention the order even to hi intim friend a slip of paper found after hi death contain thi reflect to deni one inner convict is mean but in such a case as thi silenc is the duti of a subject and although a man must say onli what is true it is not alway a duti to say all the truth publicli he therefor in hi repli to the king declar that to avoid all suspicion he as hi majesti most loyal subject solemnli engag to refrain from write or lectur on religion natur or reveal the word as your majesti most loyal subject were insert with the intent of limit hi engag to the life of xli the king and on the death of frederick william in kant regard himself as free and publish hi contest of the faculti i e of the academ faculti in kant ceas to lectur publicli in the same year he publish hi metaphys element of moral which treat of the sever virtu and vice in detail and metaphys element of law after the public of these he seem to have been regard as a counsellor to be consult in all difficulti and an author in all question of conscienc the pain he took to give real assist in such case both by hi own reflect and by inquir from hi colleagu are attest by hi written and often correct memoranda as an exampl may be mention the question whether inocul wa moral allow or not thi question wa address to him at the same time by a professor of medicin in hall and by a young nobleman who wa go to be marri and whose bride wish to be inocul kant repli is not known although some memoranda for it exist after thi time he began to feel the burden of age and hi power mental and bodili gradual fail he wa quit awar

evil upon thi fellowmen the case would be otherwis thi wa spoken say wasianski in a tone of earnest sincer two day after hi seventyninth birthday he wrote in hi memoranda accord to the bibl our life last seventi year and if veri long fourscor year and though it wa pleasant it ha been labour and sorrow up to thi time he wa abl to read the smallest print without spectacl although he had lost the sight of one eye nearli twenti year befor but soon after he had written thi memorandum hi sight also fail and he die in februari in hi eightieth year hi bodi wa so dri up that the physician said they

which earli in life caus a tendenc to hypochondria to such an xliii extent as even to make him feel weari of life thi howev he overcam by forc of thought when engag on the kritik in he speak of hi health be serious impair and some year later he say that it is unceasingli broken yet by dint of care attent and great regular he wa abl without medic aid to maintain such good health on the whole that at a later period he use to say to himself on go to bed is it possibl to conceiv ani human be enjoy better health than i do hi maxim for preserv health wa sustin et abstin hi practic illustr thi the two indulg of which he wa found were tobacco and coffe but of the former he limit himself to a singl pipe in the morn whilst he altogeth abstain from the latter until far advanc in life think it injuri to health at the age of seventi he wrote an essay on the power of the mind to master the feel of ill by forc of resolut the essay wa origin address to hufeland the celebr author of the treatis on the art of prolong life and the principl contain in it are exemplifi from kant own experi he attach great import to the habit of breath through the nostril instead of through the mouth and assert that he had by thi mean overcom a tendenc to cough and cold in the head there is more truth in thi than is perhap gener thought kant howev is said to have xliv regard it as of so much import that he did not like to have a companion in hi daili walk lest he should have to open hi mouth the true reason of thi prefer in later life onli for solitari walk wa beyond doubt that which is mention in thi essay that it is undesir to exercis the limb and the brain or the brain and the stomach at the same time hi punctili attent to health is amusingli illustr by the artific he use for suspend hi stock think that garter injuri imped the circul he had a coupl of band attach to each stock and pass through a hole in the pocket of hi breech insid the pocket they were connect with a spring enclos in a

after dinner follow regularli hi daili walk for an hour or more along what wa from him name the philosoph walk until he wa driven from it by the number of beggar whom hi habit of almsgiv had attract there even the severest weather did not interfer with thi daili walk in which in hi earlier year he usual had companion after sixti year of age he walk alon for the reason alreadi mention he had on one occas a narrow escap from assassin a lunat who had made up hi mind to kill some one waylaid kant for the purpos and follow him for three mile but on reflect think it a piti to kill an old professor who must have so mani sin on hi head the unfortun madman kill a child instead the even wa devot to lighter read and medit he would read over and over again such book as don quixot hudibra swift tale of a tub juven and horac in hi later year he wa especi fond of read book on physic scienc and book of travel pure specul work he care littl for but like to read lock hutcheson pope hume

depart from it so hi life pass say one of hi biograph like the most regular of regular verb punctual howev as he wa hi punctual did not come up to the standard of hi friend green one even kant had promis that he would accompani green in a drive the next morn at eight at a quarter befor eight green wa walk up and down hi room watch in hand at fifti minut past seven he put on hi coat at fiftyf he took hi stick and at the first stroke of eight enter hi carriag and drove off and although he met kant who wa a coupl of minut late he would not stop for him becaus thi wa against the agreement and against hi rule thi gentleman for whom kant had a great esteem serv as the model for the descript of the english charact in the anthropologi kant save were invest with thi mr green and allow to accumul at per cent interest kant is said to have been on two occas on the xlviii point of marri or at least of make a propos but he took so long to calcul hi incom and outgo with exact in order to see whether he could afford it that the ladi in the first case wa marri and in the second had left königsberg befor he had made up hi mind when he wa seventi year of age an offici friend actual print a dialogu on marriag with a view to persuad the philosoph to marri kant reimburs him for the expens of print but at that age not unnatur thought the advic rather too late how sensibl he wa to the

the regular of hi habit he never allow himself to run into debt when a student at the univers with veri narrow mean hi onli coat had onc becom so shabbi that some friend subscrib a sum of money which wa offer to him in the most delic manner possibl for the purchas of a new one kant howev prefer to retain hi shabbi coat rather than incur debt xlix or lose hi independ in hi old age he boast that he

want in the most liber manner on the death of hi brother he assign to the widow a pension of thaler mani poor person also receiv a weekli allow from him and wasianski who in later year manag kant affair for him state that hi charit expens amount to about thaler annual hi kind wa shown in hi last will in which he left an annual sum to a servant who had treat him shame but who had serv him not inde faith for thirti year kant had dismiss him two year befor with a pension on condit of hi never set foot insid the hous again after some other small legaci the residu wa left to the children of hi brother and sister the whole amount wa under four thousand pound the princip question on the theori of moral may with suffici accuraci for the present purpos be said to be these first the pure specul question what is the essenti natur of moral right secondli the practic question what is to man the criterion of hi duti and what is the foundat of oblig the addit question by what faculti do we discern right and wrong is properli a psycholog one l if we had onli to do with a be in whom reason wa irresist domin we should not need to rais ani further question but have to treat of a be with affect and appetit distinct from reason and not of themselv depend on it we must answer the further question how is reason to maintain it author in spite of these resist forc ie what is the motiv lastli sinc we have to deal with a corrupt creatur a new question aris how is such a creatur to be reform now how doe kant deal with these question hi categor imperative—act as if the maxim of thi action were to becom by thi will a univers law of nature—g perhap not the essenc of virtu but a properti of it which may inde serv as a subject criterion that thi criterion is formal onli and therefor empti is hardli of itself a valid object the test of valid reason the syllog is equal empti the categor imper is howev rather neg than posit and it is far from be suffici clear as a test of the moral of action thi appear even in the exampl which kant himself give for exampl treat of compass he suppos that if a man refus aid to the distress it is out of selfish and then show that if selfish wa the rule principl it would contradict itself but whi assum a motiv for refus help what we want is a motiv for give help there is noth contradictori in will that none should help other so in the case of gratitud there is no contradict in will that those who receiv benefit should entertain no peculiar feel toward their benefactor it is true we should look li for it ourselv but thi impli that such a feel is natur to man and that we approv it again put the case of selfsacrific of a man give hi life to save hi friend it would seem as easi on kant principl to prove thi a vice as a virtu kant ha in fact treat human natur too abstractli in elimin the matter he ha elimin that on which frequent the whole question turn inde in some of the instanc he himself choos he elicit a contradict onli by bring in a teleolog consider e g as to suicid he bring in the end for which selflov wa given the will to destroy one own life is not contradictori of the will to sustain it unless the circumst be suppos the same these remark howev onli show that the formula is not a mechan rule of conduct they do not disprov it scientif valu in fact precis similar object have been alleg against the logic analysi of specul reason that it leav untouch what in practic is the most difficult part of the problem if all poison substanc could be brought under a singl chemic formula the gener would be of valu both theoret and practic although it applic to particular case might be difficult and uncertain kant never attempt to deduc a complet code of duti from a pure formal principl he expressli state that lii thi is onli a neg principl and that the matter of practic maxim is to be deriv from a differ sourc cf the present work p nor is it to be suppos that kant wa not fulli awar of the difficulti of appli hi formula to the complex circumst of actual life in hi metaphys of moral he state a great number of question of casuistri which he leav undecid as puzzl or exercis to the reader and inde similar difficulti might be rais from a specul point of view respect the rule whatsoev ye would that men should do unto you even so do unto them—a rule of which we may nevertheless say that in practic it probabl never misl anyon for everyon see that the essenc of it is the elimin of selfparti and inward dishonesti the scientif basi of it is state by clark in languag nearli equival to kant the reason of it say the former is the same as that which forc us in specul to affirm that if one line or number be equal to anoth that other is equal to it whatev relat or proport one man in ani case bear to anoth the same that other when put in like circumst bear to him whatev i judg reason or unreason for anoth to do for me that by the same judgment i declar reason or unreason that i in the like case should do for him kant rule is a gener of thi so as to includ duti to ourselv as well as to other as such it ha a real scientif valu practic it valu liii consist like that of the golden rule in the elimin of inward dishonesti mr mill critic on kant formula is that when we speak of a maxim be fit to be a univers law it is obviou that some test of fit is requir and that kant in fact test the maxim by their consequ as if the whole gist of kant argument were not that the onli test of thi fit is logic possibl or as if thi were not the one thing express in hi formula as to test maxim by consequ he doe so in the same sens in which euclid in indirect demonstr test a hypothesi by it consequ and in no other i e by the logic consequ not the practic take the case of a promis in kant view the argument against the law permit unfaith is not that it would be attend with consequ injuri to societi but that it would annihil all promis the present includ and therefor annihil itself of inconveni to societi not a word is said or impli henc kant object rest wholli on the absolut univers of the suppos law wherea the utilitarian object from practic consequ would be applic in a proportion degre to a law not suppos univers henc also kant test would hold even if the present promis were never to be follow by anoth nay it would be of equal forc even though it should be prove that it would be better for societi that there should be no verbal promis it ha been said that in appli kant formula liv we must qualifi it by introduc the consider of the probabl that our exampl or rule will be gener follow and the instanc of celibaci ha been suggest which it is said would be necessarili condemn as a crime if test by kant rule pure and simpl for if all men practis celibaci there would be an end of the race and on the greatest happi principl to effect thi would be the worst of crime now if a qualif were requir or admiss kant formula would be depriv of all scientif signific and it applic made depend on privat and uncertain opinion as to the exampl of celibaci kant ha himself indic how he would dispos of it by the way in which he treat suicid he doe not show it unlaw by alleg that if everyon commit suicid the human race would come to an end but by expos the inconsist in the principl of action which would lead to suicid in everi case it is the mental principl which is to be test not the mere extern action bear thi in mind we shall find no difficulti in the case of celibaci it may proceed from motiv which there would be no absurd in suppos univers becaus the circumst which give them thi particular direct could onli be except but suppos celibaci recommend on ground which are in their own natur univers eg as a condit of moral perfect then kant formula would properli lv appli for moral perfect is an end to be aim at by all one might just as well say that kant rule would make all kill crimin wherea kant would obvious requir us to take into account the motiv selfdef or other on the other hand appli mr sidgwick qualif and what would result whi that we might innoc kill provid the action were not like to be gener imit if occasion celibaci is justifi onli becaus there exist a natur passion which is sure to be usual power enough to prevent the exampl be follow then we may equal justifi occasion violenc or murder on the ground that fear or benevol will natur prevent the action from be extens imit kant view of the sourc of oblig in the autonomi of the will appear to requir qualif if we would avoid a contradict a law must be abov the natur to which it is a law and which is subject to it a be which gave itself the moral law and whose freedom therefor is autonomi would not be consciou of oblig or duti sinc the moral law would coincid with it will kant draw the appar selfcontradictori conclus that we though will the law yet resist it even if thi be grant it would follow not that we should feel oblig but that either no action at all would follow or the more power side would prevail that we condemn ourselv when we have violat the law is an import fact on which kant veri strongli insist but which hi theori fail to explain is it not a far simpler and truer explan to say that thi selfcondemn thi humili in the presenc of an unbend judg is a proof that we have not given ourselv the law lvi that we are subject of a higher power there is inde a sens in which autonomi may be truli vindic to man the moral law is not a mere precept impos upon us from without nor is it forc upon us by our sensit natur it is a law prescrib to us or more correctli speak reveal to us by our own reason but reason is not our own in the sens in which our appetit or sensat are our own it is not under our own control it bear the stamp of univers and author thu it declar itself imperson in other word what reason reveal we regard as valid for all be possess of intellig equal or superior to our own henc mani ethic writer both ancient and modern have insist as strongli as kant that the moral law is common to man with all ration creatur and when kant speak of autonomi thi is all that hi argument requir accordingli he sometim speak of ration creatur as the subject of reason which is the suprem legisl as regard the sanction of the moral law which practic to imperfect creatur furnish the motiv these consist accord to kant in the happi and miseri which are the natur consequ of virtu lvii and vice and he think that when they are regard as natur consequ the dread of the miseri will have more effect than if it were thought to be an arbitrari punish the view into an illimit futur of happi or miseri is suffici to serv as a motiv to the virtuou to continu steadfast in welldo and to arous in the viciou the condemn voic of conscienc to check hi evil cours in thi kant agre with cumberland kant argument for immort is in substanc that it is necessari for a continu indefinit approxim to the ideal of the moral law but sinc as he maintain we have ourselv to blame for not have attain thi ideal what right have we to expect such an opportun have miss the true moment in hi argument which led to the exist of a suprem lawgiv he arriv at thi fundament truth by a roundabout way through the concept of the summum bonum but thi introduc a quit heterogen notion viz that of happi happi belong to a man as a sensibl creatur and all that he ha a right to say is that if practic reason had happi to confer it would confer it on virtu how much more direct and convinc is the argument suggest by butler brief word conscious of a rule or guid of action in creatur who are capabl of consid it as given them by their maker not onli rais immedi a sens of duti but also a sens of secur in follow it and of danger in deviat from it a direct of the author of natur given to creatur capabl of look upon it as such is plainli a command from lviii him and a command from him necessarili includ in it at least an implicit promis in case of obedi or threaten in case of disobedi and sinc hi method of govern is to reward and punish action hi have annex to some action an insepar sens of good desert and to other of ill thi sure amount to declar upon whom hi punish shall be inflict and hi reward bestow kant see no mode of reconcil moral with the law of causal except by hi distinct of noumena and phenomena when the law of causal is rightli understood there is no inconsist for the caus which it demand is an effici caus and the idea of an effici caus involv the idea of mind it is involv in the idea of matter that it can not origin thi kant himself adopt as a first principl in hi metaphys of natur philosophi wherea it is the veri idea of mind with will that it doe origin lix when we seek the caus of motion we are satisfi when we trace it to a will true we may then ask for the motiv but the natur of motiv and that of effici caus are heterogen kant view of freedom howev doe not involv anyth of capric or indetermin freedom accord to him is not independ on law which we can conscious follow but independ on the physic relat of causal the not be determin by physic or sensibl caus on thi view the contradict which to hobb and other seem to exist between the concept of freedom and that of the divin foreknowledg would have littl weight a short consider suffic to show that there is a fallaci involv in hobb argument suppos a be perfectli wise and good and at the same time free then we should onli requir perfect knowledg of the circumst of a particular case in order to predict hi conduct and that infal if he were not free we could not do so and the more nearli a be approach such perfect the more certainli could we predict hi action if hi good were perfect but hi knowledg imperfect and if we knew how far hi knowledg extend we could still predict it would be absurd to say that thi would be a contradict it is worthi of notic that cudworth concept of liberti correspond close with that of kant the true liberti of a man as it speak pure perfect is when by the right use of the faculti of free will togeth with the assist of divin grace he is habitu fix in moral good but when by the abus of that faculti of free will men come to be lx habitu fix in evil and sin inclin then are they as boëthiu well express it propriæ libertati captivi—mad captiv and brought into bondag by their own free will it may have been suggest to both of them by st paul who repres sin as slaveri righteous as freedom kant is by no mean happi in hi treatment of the corrupt of human natur in order to escap the difficulti of reconcil respons with the innat corrupt on which he so strongli dwell he ha recours as in the case of freedom to the distinct between man noumenon and man phenomenon the innat evil of human natur rest on an invers of the natur order the legisl will be subordin to the sensibl but how can thi be reconcil with the selfgiven and therefor selfwil law which make good a duti
