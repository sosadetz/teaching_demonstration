that is she knew someth of everi thing and talk as if she knew a great deal more among the men of ton who contribut to feed her vaniti and rais her fashion wa mr molyneux the onli son of an irish baronet of whom the bounti of a grandfath had made him independ with an handsom figur a good fortun and a titl in revers mr molyneux wa everi where court and admir and by loung about from one public place to anoth dure the summer and pass hi winter whether in england or ireland in the veri first world he had acquir so high a polish that hi manner and hi dress hi express and even hi air were copi by all the rise beaux hi understand wa just of that level which render him capabl of be pleas with thi speci of fame and have no great warmth of heart he had no other motiv of choic in marri than that which aros from hi solicitud to maintain hi import as a man of tast in the fashion world he had inde no great inclin to marri at all but hi father now far advanc in life press him so earnestli to take

himself to talk upon them but as they were not hi read never extend beyond a short novel a pamphlet or a newspap to strike out someth new in a cape or a carriag someth which the great would imit and the littl wonder at wa half the purpos of hi life to have ani affect wa reckon extrem vulgar and as he realli had as few as wa well possibl it cost him but littl troubl to divest himself of them entir and to obtain that sang froid which is the true criterion of a man of fashion it is absolut necessari to be in the hous of common a seat therefor he had for a cornish borough where he gave a silent

celestina with cold and distant civil shorten hi visit to three day at the end of which time he took leav of hi mother who again mention to him her view in regard to miss fitzhayman to which willoughbi who wa less than ever inclin to listen to her on that point return vagu but gentl answer escap from it as well as he could without give ani thing like a promis he hasten back to hi book

much more precari situat than she could herself allow or than matilda wa will to see yet thi cruel and yet unexpect blow quit overwhelm her but willoughbi as unabl to bear the sight of her grief as

howev troubl themselv veri littl with her and she wa left at liberti to retrac the walk which she had so often travers with willoughbi while matilda lean on one arm and she on the other and to gaze on the prospect which he while yet a boy had point out to them with so much pleasur she rememb all the propos improv of which he delight to talk a rapid stream burst from the hollow of a rocki common that bound the park and made it way through it had been by the former mr willoughbi widen at a great expens and now fell sever feet into a vale which he had at a still greater cost float with water on
