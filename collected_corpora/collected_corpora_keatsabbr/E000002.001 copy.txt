satir of persiu as the last of these author ha almost transcrib the preced dialogu entitl alcibiad the first in hi fourth satir the speaker in thi dialogu upon prayer are socrat and alcibiad and the substanc of it when drawn togeth out of the intricaci and digress as follow socrat meet hi pupil alcibiad as he wa go to hi devot and observ hi eye to be fix upon the earth with great serious and attent tell him that he had reason to be thought on that occas sinc it wa possibl for a man to bring down evil upon himself by hi own prayer and that those thing which the god send him in answer to hi petit might turn to hi destruct thi say he may not onli happen when a man pray for what he know is mischiev in it own natur as oedipu implor the god to sow dissens between hi son but when he pray for what he believ would be for hi good and against what he believ would be to hi detriment thi the philosoph shew must necessarili happen among us sinc most men are blind with ignor prejudic or passion which hinder them from see such thing as are realli benefici to them for an instanc he ask alcibiad whether he would not be thoroughli pleas and satisfi if that god to whom he wa go to address himself should promis to make him the sovereign of the whole earth alcibiad answer that he should doubtless look upon such a promis as the greatest favour that he could bestow upon him socrat then ask him if after receiv thi great favour he would be content to lose hi life or if he would receiv it though he wa sure he should make an ill use of it to both which question alcibiad answer in the neg socrat then shew him from the exampl of other how these might veri probabl be the effect of such a bless he then add that other reput piec of goodfortun as that of have a son or procur the highest post in a govern are subject to the like fatal consequ which nevertheless say he men ardent desir and would not fail to pray for if they thought their prayer might be effectu for the obtain of them have establish thi great point that all the most appar bless in thi life are obnoxi to such dread consequ and that no man know what in it event would prove to him a bless or a curs he teach alcibiad after what manner he ought to pray in the first place he recommend to him as the model of hi devot a short prayer which a greek poet compos for the use of hi friend in the follow word o jupit give us those thing which are good for us whether they are such thing as we pray for or such thing as we do not pray for and remov from us those thing which are hurt though they are such thing as we pray for in the second place that hi discipl may ask such thing as are expedi for him he shew him that it is absolut necessari to appli himself to the studi of true wisdom and to the knowledg of that which is hi chief good and the most suitabl to the excel of hi natur in the third and last place he inform him that the best method he could make use of to draw down bless upon himself and to render hi prayer accept would be to live in a constant practic of hi duti toward the god and toward men under thi head he veri much recommend a form of prayer the lacedemonian made use of in which they petit the god to give them all good thing so long as they were virtuou under thi head likewis he give a veri remark account of an oracl to the follow purpos when the athenian in the war with the lacedemonian receiv mani defeat both by sea and land they sent a messag to the oracl of jupit ammon to ask the reason whi they who erect so mani templ to the god and adorn them with such costli offer whi they who had institut so mani festiv and accompani them with such pomp and ceremoni in short whi they who had slain so mani hecatomb at their altar should be less success than the lacedemonian who fell so short of them in all these particular to thi say he the oracl made the follow repli i am better pleas with the prayer of the lacedemonian than with all the oblat of the greek as thi prayer impli and encourag virtu in those who made it the philosoph proce to shew how the most viciou man might be devout so far as victim could make him but that hi offer were regard by the god as bribe and hi petit as blasphemi he likewis quot on thi occas two vers out of homer in which the poet say that the scent of the trojan sacrific wa carri up to heaven by the wind but that it wa not accept to the god who were displeas with priam and all hi peopl the conclus of thi dialogu is veri remark socrat have deter alcibiad from the prayer and sacrific which he wa go to offer by set forth the abovement difficulti of perform that duti as he ought add these word we must therefor wait till such time as we may learn how we ought to behav ourselv toward the god and toward men but when will that time come say alcibiad and who is it that will instruct us for i would fain see thi man whoever he is it is one say socrat who take care of you but as homer tell us that minerva remov the mist from diomed hi eye that he might plainli discov both god and men so the dark that hang upon your mind must be remov befor you are abl to discern what is good and what is evil let him remov from my mind say alcibiad the dark and what els he pleas i am determin to refus noth he shall order me whoever he is so that i may becom the better man by it the remain part of thi dialogu is veri obscur there is someth in it that would make us think socrat hint at himself when he spoke of thi divin teacher who wa to come into the world did not he own that he himself wa in thi respect as much at a loss and in as great distress as the rest of mankind some learn men look upon thi conclus as a predict of our saviour or at least that socrat like the highpriest prophesi unknowingli and point at that divin teacher who wa to come into the world some age after him howev that may be we find that thi great philosoph saw by the light of reason that it wa suitabl to the good of the divin natur to send a person into the world who should instruct mankind in the duti of religion and in particular teach them how to pray whoever read thi abstract of plato discours on prayer will i believ natur make thi reflect that the great founder of our religion as well by hi own exampl as in the form of prayer which he taught hi discipl did not onli keep up to those rule which the light of natur had suggest to thi great philosoph but instruct hi discipl in the whole extent of thi duti as well as of all other he direct them to the proper object of ador and taught them accord to the third rule abovement to appli themselv to him in their closet without show or ostent and to worship him in spirit and in truth as the lacedemonian in their form of prayer implor the god in gener to give them all good thing so long as they were virtuou we ask in particular that our offenc may be forgiven as we forgiv those of other if we look into the second rule which socrat ha prescrib name that we should appli ourselv to the knowledg of such thing as are best for us thi too is explaind at larg in the doctrin of the gospel where we are taught in sever instanc to regard those thing as curs which appear as bless in the eye of the world and on the contrari to esteem those thing as bless which to the gener of mankind appear as curs thu in the form which is prescrib to us we onli pray for that happi which is our chief good and the great end of our exist when we petit the suprem be for the come of hi kingdom be solicit for no other tempor bless but our daili susten on the other side we pray against noth but sin and against evil in gener leav it with omnisci to determin what is realli such if we look into the first of socrat hi rule of prayer in which he recommend the abovement form of the ancient poet we find that form not onli comprehend

thi satyr is woman he describ the sex in their sever charact which he deriv to them from a fanci supposit rais upon the doctrin of præexist he tell us that the god form the soul of women out of those

author veri faith and if not word for word which our languag would not bear at least so as to comprehend everi one of hi sentiment without ad ani thing of my own i have alreadi apolog for thi author want of delicaci and must further premis that the follow satyr affect onli some of the lower part of the sex and not those who have been refin by a polit educ which wa not so common in the age of thi poet in the begin god made the soul of womankind out of differ materi and in a separ state from their bodi the soul of one kind of women were form out of those ingredi which compos a swine a woman of thi make is a slut in her hous and a glutton at her tabl she is uncleanli in her person a slattern in her dress and her famili is no better than a dunghil a second sort of femal soul wa form out of the same materi that enter into the composit of a fox such an one is what we call a notabl discern woman who ha an insight into everi thing whether it be good or bad in thi speci of femal there are some virtuou and some viciou a third kind of women were made up of canin particl these are what we commonli call scold who imit the anim of which they were taken that are alway busi and bark that snarl at everi one who come in their way and live in perpetu clamour the fourth kind of women were made out of the earth these are your sluggard who pass away their time in indol and ignor hover over the fire a whole winter and appli themselv with alacr to no kind of busi but eat the fifth speci of femal were made out of the sea these are women of variabl uneven temper sometim all storm and tempest sometim all calm and sunshin the stranger who see one of these in her smile and smooth would cri her up for a miracl of good humour but on a sudden her look and her word are chang she is noth

upon hard fare and do everi thing to pleas him they are howev far from be avers to vener pleasur and seldom refus a male companion the cat furnish materi for a seventh speci of women who are of a

theft cheat and pilfer the mare with a flow mane which wa never broke to ani servil toil and labour compos an eighth speci of women these are they who have littl regard for their husband who pass away their time in dress bath and perfum who throw their hair into the nicest curl and trick it up with the fairest flower and garland a woman of thi speci is a veri pretti thing for a stranger to look upon but veri detriment to the owner unless it be a king or princ who take a fanci to such a toy the ninth speci of femal were taken out of the ape these are such as are both ugli and illnatur who

she distinguish her self among her sex she is surround with grace she never sit among the loos tribe of women nor pass away her time with them in wanton discours she is full of virtu and prudenc and is the best wife that jupit can bestow on man i shall conclud these iambick with the motto of thi paper which is a fragment of the same author a man can not possess ani thing that is better than a good woman nor ani thing that is wors than a bad one as the poet ha shewn a great penetr in thi divers of femal charact he ha avoid the fault which juven and monsieur boileau are guilti of the former in hi sixth and the other in hi last satyr where they have endeavour to expos the sex in gener without do justic to the valuabl part of it such level satyr are of no use to the world and for thi reason i have often wonder how the french author abovement who wa a man of exquisit judgment and a lover of virtu could think human natur a proper subject for satyr in anoth of hi celebr piec which is call the satyr upon man what vice or frailti can a discours correct which censur the whole speci alik and endeavour to shew by some superfici stroke of wit that brute are the more excel creatur of the
