cours veri mani who had form their tast and their notion of poetri from the write of pope and hi follow or to speak more gener in that school of french poetri condens and invigor by english understand which had predomin from the last centuri i wa not blind to the merit of thi school yet as from inexperi of the world and consequ want of sympathi with the gener subject of these poem they gave me littl pleasur i doubtless undervalu the kind and with the presumpt of youth withheld from it master the legitim name of poet i saw that the excel of thi kind consist in just and acut observ on men and manner in an artifici state of societi as it matter and substanc and in the logic of wit convey in smooth and strong epigrammat couplet as it form that even when the subject wa address to the fanci or

look for at the end of each second line and the whole wa as it were a sorit or if i may exchang a logic for a grammat metaphor a conjunct disjunct of epigram meantim the matter and diction seem to me character not so much by poetic thought as by thought translat into the languag of poetri on thi last point i had occas to render my own thought gradual more and more plain to myself by frequent amic

put or not put a small capit both in thi and in mani other passag of the same poet whether the word should be personif or mere abstract i mention thi becaus in refer variou line in gray to their origin in shakespear and milton and in the clear percept how complet all the proprieti wa lost in the transfer i wa at that earli period led to a conjectur which mani year afterward wa recal to me from the same thought have been start in convers but far more abli and develop more fulli by mr wordsworthnam that thi style of poetri which i have character abov as translat of prose thought into poetic languag had been kept up by if it did not wholli aris from the custom of write latin vers and the great import attach to these exercis in our public school whatev might have been the case in the fifteenth centuri when the use of the latin tongu wa so gener among learn men that erasmu is said to have forgotten hi nativ languag yet in the present day it is not to be suppos that a youth can think in latin or that he can have ani other relianc on the forc or fit of hi phrase but the author of the writer from whom he ha adopt them consequ he must first prepar hi thought and then pick out from virgil horac ovid or perhap more compendi from hi gradu halv and quarter of line in which to embodi them i never object to a certain degre of disputati in a young man from the age of seventeen to that of four or five and twenti provid i find him alway argu on one side of the question the controversi occas by my unfeign zeal for the honour of a favourit contemporari then known to me onli by hi

nor vulgar neither redol of the lamp nor of the kennel such as i will rememb thee instead of the same thought trick up in the ragfair fineri of thi imag on her wing befor my fanci eye shall memori bring i had continu to adduc the metr and diction of the greek poet from homer to theocritu inclus and still more of our elder english poet from chaucer to milton nor wa thi all but as it wa my constant repli to author brought against me from later poet of great name that no author could avail in opposit to truth natur logic and the law of univers grammar actuat too by my former passion for metaphys investig i labour at a solid foundat on which perman to ground my opinion in the compon faculti of the human mind itself and their compar digniti and import accord to the faculti or sourc from which the pleasur given by ani poem or passag wa deriv i estim the merit of such poem or passag as the result of all my read and medit i abstract two critic aphor deem them to compris the condit and criteria of poetic stylefirst that not the poem which we have read but that to which we return with the greatest pleasur possess the genuin power and claim the name of essenti poetrysecondli that whatev line can be translat into other word of the same languag without diminut of their signific either in sens or associ or in ani worthi feel are so far viciou in their diction be it howev observ that i exclud from the list of worthi feel the pleasur deriv from mere novelti in the reader and the desir of excit wonder at hi power in the author oftentim sinc then in pursu french tragedi i have fanci two mark of admir at the end of each line as hieroglyph of the author own admir at hi own clever our genuin admir of a great poet is a continu undercurr of feel it is everywher present but seldom anywher as a separ excit i wa wont boldli to affirm that it would be scarc more difficult to push a stone out from the pyramid with the bare hand than to alter a word or the posit of a word in milton or shakespear in their most import work at least without make the poet say someth els or someth wors than he doe say one great distinct i appear to myself to see plainli between even the characterist fault of our elder poet and the fals beauti of the modern in the former from donn to cowley we find the most fantast outoftheway thought but in the most pure and genuin mother english in the latter the most obviou thought in languag the most fantast and arbitrari our faulti elder poet sacrif the passion and passion flow of poetri to the subtleti of intellect and to the star of wit the modern to the glare and glitter of a perpetu yet broken and heterogen imageri or rather to an amphibi someth made up half of imag and half of abstract mean the one sacrif the heart to the head the other both heart and head to point and draperi the reader must make himself acquaint with the gener style of composit that wa at that time deem poetri in order to understand and account for the effect produc on me by the sonnet the monodi at matlock and the hope of mr bowl for it is peculiar to origin geniu to becom less and less strike in proport to it success in improv the tast and judgment of it contemporari the poem of west inde had the merit of chast and manli diction but they were cold and if i may so express it onli deadcolour while in the best of warton there is a stiff which too often give them the appear of imit from the greek whatev relat therefor of caus or impuls perci collect of ballad may bear to the most popular poem of the present day yet in a more sustain and elev style of the then live poet cowper and bowl were to the best of my knowledg the first who combin natur thought with natur diction the first who reconcil the heart with the head it is true as i have befor mention that from diffid in my own power i for a short time adopt a labori and florid diction which i myself deem if not absolut viciou yet of veri inferior worth gradual howev my practic conform to my better judgment and the composit of my twentyfourth and twentyfifth yearsfor exampl the shorter blank vers poem the line which now form the middl and conclus of the poem entitl the destini of nation and the tragedi of remorsear not more below my present ideal in respect of the gener tissu of the style than those of the latest date their fault were at least a remnant of the former leaven and among the mani who have done me the honour of put my poem in the same class with those of my better the one or two who have pretend to bring exampl of affect simplic from my volum have been abl to adduc but one instanc and that out of a copi of vers half ludicr half splenet which i intend and had myself character as sermoni propiora everi reform howev necessari will by weak mind be carri to an excess which will itself need reform the reader will excus me for notic that i myself wa the first to expos risu honesto the three sin of poetri one or the other of which is the most like to beset a young writer so long ago as the public of the second number of the monthli magazin under the name of nehemiah higginbottom i contribut three sonnet the first of which had for it object to excit a
