print for j dodsley in pall mall mdccxc it may not be unnecessari to inform the reader that the follow reflect had their origin in a correspond between the author and a veri young gentleman at pari who did him the honor of desir hi opinion upon the import transact which then and ever sinc have so much occupi the attent of all men an answer wa written some time in the month of octob but it wa kept back upon prudenti consider that letter is allud to in the begin of the follow sheet it ha been sinc forward to the person to whom it wa address the reason for the delay in send it were assign in a short letter to the same gentleman thi produc on hi part a new and press applic for the author sentiment the author began a second and more full discuss on the subject thi he had some thought of publish earli in the last spring but the matter gain upon him he found that what he had undertaken not onli far exceed the measur of a letter but that it import requir rather a more detail consider than at that time he had ani leisur to bestow upon it howev have thrown down hi first thought in the form of a letter and inde when he sat down to write have intend it for a privat letter he found it difficult to chang the form of address when hi sentiment had grown into a greater extent and had receiv anoth direct a differ plan he is sensibl might be more favor to a commodi divis and distribut of hi matter dear sir you are pleas to call again and with some earnest for my thought on the late proceed in franc i will not give you reason to imagin that i think my sentiment of such valu as to wish myself to be solicit about them they are of too littl consequ to be veri anxious either commun or withheld it wa from attent to you and to you onli that i hesit at the time when you first desir to receiv them in the first letter i had the honor to write to you and which at length i send i wrote neither for nor from ani descript of men nor shall i in thi my error if ani are my own my reput alon is to answer for them you see sir by the long letter i have transmit to you that though i do most heartili wish that franc may be anim by a spirit of ration liberti and that i think you bound in all honest polici to provid a perman bodi in which that spirit may resid and an effectu organ by which it may act it is my misfortun to entertain great doubt concern sever materi point in your late transact you imagin when you wrote last that i might possibl be reckon among the approv of certain proceed in franc from the solemn public seal of sanction they have receiv from two club of gentlemen in london call the constitut societi and the revolut societi i certainli have the honor to belong to more club than one in which the constitut of thi kingdom and the principl of the gloriou revolut are held in high rever and i reckon myself among the most forward in my zeal for maintain that constitut and those principl in their utmost puriti and vigor it is becaus i do so that i think it necessari for me that there should be no mistak those who cultiv the memori of our revolut and those who are attach to the constitut of thi kingdom will take good care how they are involv with person who under the pretext of zeal toward the revolut and constitut too frequent wander from their true principl and are readi on everi occas to depart from the firm but cautiou and deliber spirit which produc the one and which presid in the other befor i proceed to answer the more materi particular in your letter i shall beg leav to give you such inform as i have been abl to obtain of the two club which have thought proper as bodi to interfer in the concern of franc first assur you that i am not and that i have never been a member of either of those societi the first call itself the constitut societi or societi for constitut inform or by some such titl is i believ of seven or eight year stand the institut of thi societi appear to be of a charit and so far of a laudabl natur it wa intend for the circul at the expens of the member of mani book which few other would be at the expens of buy and which might lie on the hand of the booksel to the great loss of an use bodi of men whether the book so charit circul were ever as charit read is more than i know possibl sever of them have been export to franc and like good not in request here may with you have found a market i have heard much talk of the light to be drawn from book that are sent from henc what improv they have had in their passag as it is said some liquor are melior by cross the sea i can not tell but i never heard a man of common judgment or the least degre of inform speak a word in prais of the greater part of the public circul by that societi nor have their proceed been account except by some of themselv as of ani seriou consequ your nation assembl seem to entertain much the same opinion that i do of thi poor charit club as a nation you reserv the whole stock of your eloqu acknowledg for the revolut societi when their fellow in the constitut were in equiti entitl to some share sinc you have select the revolut societi as the great object of your nation thank and prais you will think me excus in make it late conduct the subject of my observ the nation assembl of franc ha given import to these gentlemen by adopt them and they return the favor by act as a sort of subcommitte in england for extend the principl of the nation assembl henceforward we must consid them as a kind of privileg person as no inconsider member in the diplomat bodi thi is one among the revolut which have given splendor to obscur and distinct to undiscern merit until veri late i do not recollect to have heard of thi club i am quit sure that it never occupi a moment of my thought nor i believ those of ani person out of their own set i find upon enquiri that on the anniversari of the revolut in a club of dissent but of what denomin i know not have long had the custom of hear a sermon in one of their church and that afterward they spent the day cheer as other club do at the tavern but i never heard that ani public measur or polit system much less that the merit of the constitut of ani foreign nation had been the subject of a formal proceed at their festiv until to my inexpress surpris i found them in a sort of public capac by a congratulatori address give an authorit sanction to the proceed of the nation assembl in franc in the ancient principl and conduct of the club so far at least as they were declar i see noth to which i or ani sober man could possibl take except i think it veri probabl that for some purpos new member may have enter among them and that some truli christian politician who love to dispens benefit but are care to conceal the hand which distribut the dole may have made them the instrument of their piou design whatev i may have reason to suspect concern privat manag i shall speak of noth as of a certainti but what is public for one i should be sorri to be thought directli or indirectli concern in their proceed i certainli take my full share along with the rest of the world in my individu and privat capac in specul on what ha been done or is do on the public stage in ani place ancient or modern in the republ of rome or the republ of pari but have no gener apostol mission be a citizen of a particular state and be bound up in a consider degre by it public will i should think it at least improp and irregular for me to open a formal public correspond with the actual govern of a foreign nation without the express author of the govern under which i live i should be still more unwil to enter into that correspond under ani thing like an equivoc descript which to mani unacquaint with our usag might make the address in which i join appear as the act of person in some sort of corpor capac acknowledg by the law of thi kingdom and author to speak the sens of some part of it on account of the ambigu and uncertainti of unauthor gener descript and of the deceit which may be practic under them and not from mere formal the hous of common would reject the most sneak petit for the most trifl object under that mode of signatur to which you have thrown open the foldingdoor of your presenc chamber and have usher into your nation assembl with as much ceremoni and parad and with as great a bustl of applaus as if you had been visit by the whole repres majesti of the whole english nation if what thi societi ha thought proper to send forth had been a piec of argument it would have signifi littl whose argument it wa it would be neither the more nor the less convinc on account of the parti it came from but thi is onli a vote and resolut it stand sole on author and in thi case it is the mere author of individu few of whom appear their signatur ought in my opinion to have been annex to their instrument the world would then have the mean of know how mani they are who they are and of what valu their opinion may be from their person abil from their knowledg their experi or their lead and author in thi state to me who am but a plain man the proceed look a littl too refin and too ingeni it ha too much the air of a polit stratagem adopt for the sake of give under an highsound name an import to the public declar of thi club which when the matter came to be close inspect they did not altogeth so well deserv it is a polici that ha veri much the complexion of a fraud i flatter myself that i love a manli moral regul liberti as well as ani gentleman of that societi be he who he will and perhap i have given as good proof of my attach to that caus in the whole cours of my public conduct i think i envi liberti as littl as they do to ani other nation but i can not stand forward and give prais or blame to ani thing which relat to human action and human concern on a simpl view of the object as it stand strip of everi relat in all the naked and solitud of metaphys abstract circumst which with some gentlemen pass for noth give in realiti to everi polit principl it distinguish color and discrimin effect the circumst are what render everi civil and polit scheme benefici or noxiou to mankind abstractedli speak govern as well as liberti is good yet could i in common sens ten year ago have felicit franc on her enjoy of a govern for she then had a govern without enquiri what the natur of that govern wa or how it wa administ can i now congratul the same nation upon it freedom is it becaus liberti in the abstract may be class amongst the bless of mankind that i am serious to felicit a madman who ha escap from the protect restraint and wholesom dark of hi cell on hi restor to the enjoy of light and liberti am i to congratul an highwayman and murder who ha broke prison upon the recoveri of hi natur right thi would be to act over again the scene of the crimin condemn to the galley and their heroic deliver the metaphys knight of the sorrow counten when i see the spirit of liberti in action i see a strong principl at work and thi for a while is all i can possibl know of it the wild ga the fix air is plainli broke loos but we ought to suspend our judgment until the first efservesc is a littl subsid till the liquor is clear and until we see someth deeper than the agit of a troubl and frothi surfac i must be toler sure befor i ventur publicli to congratul men upon a bless that they have realli receiv one flatteri corrupt both the receiv and the giver and adul is not of more servic to the peopl than to king i should therefor suspend my congratul on the new liberti of franc until i wa inform how it had been combin with govern with public forc with the disciplin and obedi of armi with the collect of an effect and welldistribut revenu with moral and religion with the solid of properti with peac and order with civil and social manner all these in their way are good thing too and without them liberti is not a benefit whilst it last and is not like to continu long the effect of liberti to individu is that they may do what they pleas we ought to see what it will pleas them to do befor we risqu congratul which may be soon turn into complaint prudenc would dictat thi in the case of separ insul privat men but liberti when men act in bodi is power consider peopl befor they declar themselv will observ the use which is made of power and particularli of so tri a thing as new power in new person of whose principl temper and disposit they have littl or no experi and in situat where those who appear the most stir in the scene may possibl not be the real mover all these consider howev were below the transcendent digniti of the revolut societi whilst i continu in the countri from whenc i had the honor of write to you i had but an imperfect idea of their transact on my come to town i sent for an account of their proceed which had been publish by their author contain a sermon of dr price with the duke de rochefaucault and the archbishop of aix letter and sever other document annex the whole of that public with the manifest design of connect the affair of franc with those of england by draw us into an imit of the conduct of the nation assembl gave me a consider degre of uneasi the effect of that conduct upon the power credit prosper and tranquil of franc becam everi day more evid the form of constitut to be settl for it futur politi becam more clear we are now in a condit to discern with toler exact the true natur of the object held up to our imit if the prudenc of reserv and decorum dictat silenc in some circumst in other prudenc of an higher order may justifi us in speak our thought the begin of confus with us in england are at present feebl enough but with you we have seen an infanc still more feebl grow by moment into a strength to heap mountain upon mountain and to wage war with heaven itself whenev our neighbor hous is on fire it can not be amiss for the engin to play a littl on our own better to be despis for too anxiou apprehens than ruin by too confid a secur sollicit chiefli for the peac of my own countri but by no mean unconcern for your i wish to commun more larg what wa at first intend onli for your privat satisfact i shall still keep your affair in my eye and continu to address myself to you indulg myself in the freedom of epistolari intercours i beg leav to throw out my thought and express my feel just as they aris in my mind with veri littl attent to formal method i set out with the proceed of the revolut societi but i shall not confin myself to them is it possibl i should it look to me as if i were in a great crisi not of the affair of franc alon but of all europ perhap of more than europ all circumst taken togeth the french revolut is the most astonish that ha hitherto happen in the world the most wonder thing are brought about in mani instanc by mean the most absurd and ridicul in the most ridicul mode and appar by the most contempt instrument everi thing seem out of natur in thi strang chao of leviti and feroc and of all sort of crime jumbl togeth with all sort of folli in view thi monstrou tragicom scene the most opposit passion necessarili succeed and sometim mix with each other in the mind altern contempt and indign altern laughter and tear altern scorn and horror it can not howev be deni that to some thi strang scene appear in quit anoth point of view into them it inspir no other sentiment than those of exult and raptur they saw noth in what ha been done in franc but a firm and temper exert of freedom so consist on the whole with moral and with pieti as to make it deserv not onli of the secular applaus of dash machiavelian politician but to render it a fit theme for all the devout effus of sacr eloqu on the forenoon of the th of novemb last doctor richard price a nonconform minist of emin preach at the dissent meet hous of the old jewri to hi club or societi a veri extraordinari miscellan sermon in which there are some good moral and religi sentiment and not ill express mix up in a sort of porridg of variou polit opinion and reflect but the revolut in franc is the grand ingredi in the cauldron i consid the address transmit by the revolut societi to the nation assembl through earl stanhop as origin in the principl of the sermon and as a corollari from them it wa move by the preacher of that discours it wa pass by those who came reek from the effect of the sermon without ani censur or qualif express or impli if howev ani of the gentlemen concern shall wish to separ the sermon from the resolut they know how to acknowledg the one and to disavow the other they may do it i can not for my part i look on that sermon as the public declar of a man much connect with literari cabal and intrigu philosoph with polit theologian and theolog politician both at home and abroad i know they set him up as a sort of oracl becaus with the best intent in the world he natur philipp and chaunt hi prophet song in exact unison with their design that sermon is in a strain which i believ ha not been heard in thi kingdom in ani of the pulpit which are toler or encourag in it sinc the year when a predecessor of dr price the reverend hugh peter made the vault of the king own chapel at st jamess ring with the honor and privileg of the saint who with the high prais of god in their mouth and a twoedg sword in their hand were to execut judgment on the heathen and punish upon the peopl to bind their king with chain and their nobl with fetter of iron psalm cxlix few harangu from the pulpit except in the day of your leagu in franc or in the day of our solemn leagu and coven in england have ever breath less of the spirit of moder than thi lectur in the old jewri suppos howev that someth like moder were visibl in thi polit sermon yet polit and the pulpit are term that have littl agreement no sound ought to be heard in the church but the heal voic of christian chariti the caus of civil liberti and civil govern gain as littl as that of religion by thi confus of duti those who quit their proper charact to assum what doe not belong to them are for the greater part ignor both of the charact they leav and of the charact they assum wholli unacquaint with the world in which they are so fond of meddl and inexperienc in all it affair on which they pronounc with so much confid they have noth of polit but the passion they excit sure the church is a place where one day truce ought to be allow to the dissens and animos of mankind thi pulpit style reviv after so long a discontinu had to me the air of novelti and of a novelti not wholli without danger i do not charg thi danger equal to everi part of the discours the hint given to a nobl and reverend laydivin who is suppos high in offic in one of our univers discours on the love of our countri nov by dr richard price d edit p and and to other laydivin of rank and literatur may be proper and season though somewhat new if the nobl seeker should find noth to satisfi their piou fanci in the old stapl of the nation church or in all the

give an exampl of a nation and manli worship men of weight from their rank and literatur may do the greatest servic to societi and the world p dr price sermon it is somewhat remark that thi reverend

arrang howev favor to the caus of compulsori freedom civil and religi may not be equal conduc to the nation tranquil these few restrict i hope are no great stretch of intoler no veri violent exert of despot but i may say of our preacher utinam nugi tota illa dedisset tempora saevitia all thing in thi hi fulmin bull are not of so innoxi a tendenc hi doctrin affect our constitut in it vital part he tell the revolut societi in thi polit sermon that hi majesti is almost the onli law king in the world becaus the onli one who owe hi crown to the choic of hi peopl as to the king of the world all of whom except one thi archpontiff of the right of men with all the plenitud and with more than the bold of the papal depos power in it meridian fervor of the twelfth centuri put into one sweep claus of ban and anathema and proclaim usurp by circl of longitud and latitud over the whole globe it behoov them to consid how they admit into their territori these apostol missionari who are to tell their subject they are not law king that is their concern it is our as a domest interest of some moment serious to consid the solid of the onli principl upon which these gentlemen acknowledg a king of great britain to be entitl to their allegi thi doctrin as appli to the princ now on the british throne either is nonsens and therefor neither true nor fals or it affirm a most unfound danger illeg and unconstitut posit accord to thi spiritu doctor of polit if hi majesti doe not owe hi crown to the choic of hi peopl he is no law king now noth can be more untru than that the crown of thi kingdom is so held by hi majesti therefor if you follow their rule the king of great britain who most certainli doe not owe hi high offic to ani form of popular elect is in no respect better than the rest of the gang of usurp who reign or rather rob all over the face of thi our miser world without ani sort of right or titl to the allegi of their peopl the polici of thi gener doctrin so qualifi is evid enough the propag of thi polit gospel are in hope their abstract principl their principl that a popular choic is necessari to the legal exist of the sovereign magistraci would be overlook whilst the king of great britain wa not affect by it in the mean time the ear of their congreg would be gradual habitu to it as if it were a first principl admit without disput for the present it would onli oper as a theori pickl in the preserv juic of pulpit eloqu and laid by for futur use condo et compono quae mox depromer possim by thi polici whilst our govern is sooth with a reserv in it favor to which it ha no claim the secur which it ha in common with all govern so far as opinion is secur is taken away thu these politician proceed whilst littl notic is taken of their doctrin but when they come to be examin upon the plain mean of their word and the direct tendenc of their doctrin then equivoc and slipperi construct come into play when they say the king owe hi crown to the choic of hi peopl and is therefor the onli law sovereign in the world they will perhap tell us they mean to say no more than that some of the king predecessor have been call to the throne by some sort of choic and therefor he owe hi crown to the choic of hi peopl thu by a miser subterfug they hope to render their proposit safe by render it nugatori they are welcom to the asylum they seek for their offens sinc they take refug in their folli for if you admit thi interpret how doe their idea of elect differ from our idea of inherit and how doe the settlement of the crown in the brunswick line deriv from jame the first come to legal our monarchi rather than that of ani of the neighbor countri at some time or other to be sure all the beginn of dynasti were chosen by those who call them to govern there is ground enough for the opinion that all the kingdom of europ were at a remot period elect with more or fewer limit in the object of choic but whatev king might have been here or elsewher a thousand year ago or in whatev manner the rule dynasti of england or franc may have begun the king of great britain is at thi day king by a fix rule of success accord to the law of hi countri and whilst the legal condit of the compact of sovereignti are perform by him as they are perform he hold hi crown in contempt of the choic of the revolut societi who have not a singl vote for a king amongst them either individu or collect though i make no doubt they would soon erect themselv into an elector colleg if thing were ripe to give effect to their claim hi majesti heir and successor each in hi time and order will come to the crown with the same contempt of their choic with which hi majesti ha succeed to that he wear whatev may be the success of evas in explain away the gross error of fact which suppos that hi majesti though he hold it in concurr with the wish owe hi crown to the choic of hi peopl yet noth can evad their full explicit declar concern the principl of a right in the peopl to

person who were to inherit in the protest line thi act also incorpor by the same polici our liberti and an hereditari success in the same act instead of a right to choos our own governor they declar that the success in that line the protest line drawn from jame the first wa absolut necessari for the peac quiet and secur of the realm and that it wa equal urgent on them to maintain a certainti in the success thereof to which the subject may safe have recours for their protect both these act in which are heard the uner unambigu oracl of revolut polici instead of countenanc the delus gypsey predict of a right to choos our governor prove to a demonstr how total advers the wisdom of the nation wa from turn a case of necess into a rule of law unquestion there wa at the revolut in the person of king william a small and a temporari deviat from the strict order of a regular hereditari success but it is against all genuin principl of jurisprud to draw a principl from a law made in a special case and regard an individu person privilegium non transit in exemplum if ever there wa a time favor for establish the principl that a king of popular choic wa the onli legal king without all doubt it wa at the revolut it not be done at that time is a proof that the nation wa of opinion it ought not to be done at ani time there is no person so complet ignor of our histori as not to know that the major in parliament of both parti were so littl dispos to ani thing resembl that principl that at first they were determin to place the vacant crown not on the head of the princ of orang but on that of hi wife mari daughter of king jame the eldest born of the issu of that king which they acknowledg as undoubtedli hi it would be to repeat a veri trite stori to recal to your memori all those circumst which demonstr that their accept king william wa not properli a choic but to all those who did not wish in effect to recal king jame or to delug their countri in blood and again to bring their religion law and liberti into the peril they had just escap it wa an act of necess in the strictest moral sens in which necess can be taken in the veri act in which for a time and in a singl case parliament depart from the strict order of inherit in favor of a princ who though not next wa howev veri near in the line of success it is curiou to observ how lord summer who drew the bill call the declar of right ha comport himself on that delic occas it is curiou to observ with what address thi temporari solut of continu is kept from the eye whilst all that could be found in thi act of necess to counten the idea of an hereditari success is brought forward and foster and made the most of by thi great man and by the legislatur who follow him quit the dri imper style of an act of parliament he make the lord and common fall to a piou legisl ejacul and declar that they consid it as a mavel provid and merci good of god to thi nation to preserv their said majesti royal person most happili to reign over us on the throne of their ancestor for which from the bottom of their heart they return their humblest thank and prais the legislatur plainli had in view the act of recognit of the first of queen elizabeth chap d and of that of jame the first chap st both act strongli declaratori of the inherit natur of the crown and in mani part they follow with a nearli liter precis the word and even the form of thanksgiv which is found in these old declaratori statut the two hous in the act of king william did not thank god that they had found a fair opportun to assert a right to choos their own governor much less to make an elect the onli law titl to the crown their have been in a condit to avoid the veri appear of it as much as possibl wa by them consid as a providenti escap they threw a polit wellwrought veil over everi circumst tend to weaken the right which in the melior order of success they meant to perpetu or which might furnish a preced for ani futur departur from what they had then settl for ever accordingli that they might not relax the nerv of their monarchi and that they might preserv a close conform to the practic of their ancestor as it appear in the declaratori statut of queen mari st mari sess chapter and queen elizabeth in the next claus they vest by recognit in their majesti all the legal prerog of the crown declar that in them they are most fulli right and entir invest incorpor unit and annex in the claus which follow for prevent question by reason of ani pretend titl to the crown they declar observ also in thi the traditionari languag along with the traditionari polici of the nation and repeat as from a rubric the languag of the preced act of elizabeth and jame that on the preserv a certainti in the success thereof the uniti peac and tranquil of thi nation doe under god wholli depend they knew that a doubt titl of success would but too much resembl an elect and that an elect would be utterli destruct of the uniti peac and tranquil of thi nation which they thought to be consider of some moment to provid for these object and therefor to exclud for ever the old jewri doctrin of a right to choos our own governor they follow with a claus contain a most solemn pledg taken from the preced act of queen elizabeth as solemn a pledg as ever wa or can be given in favor of an hereditari success and as solemn a renunci as could be made of the principl by thi societi imput to them the lord spiritu and tempor and common do in the name of all the peopl aforesaid most humbl and faith submit themselv their heir and poster for ever and do faith promis that they will stand to maintain and defend their said majesti and also the limit of the crown herein specifi and contain to the utmost of their power etc etc so far is it from be true that we acquir a right by the revolut to elect our king that if we had possess it befor the english nation did at that time most solemnli renounc and abdic it for themselv and for all their poster for ever these gentlemen may valu themselv as much as they pleas on their whig principl but i never desir to be thought a better whig than lord summer or to understand the principl of the

the same ground on which they might have wholli abolish their monarchi and everi other part of their constitut howev they did not think such bold chang within their commiss it is inde difficult perhap imposs to give limit to the mere abstract compet of the suprem power such as wa exercis by parliament at that time but the limit of a moral compet subject even in power more indisput sovereign

had lost the bond of union in their ancient edific they did not howev dissolv the whole fabric on the contrari in both case they regener the defici part of the old constitut through the part which were not impair they kept these old part exactli as they were that the part recov might be suit to them they act by the ancient organ state in the shape of their old organ and not by the organ molecula of a disband peopl at no time perhap did the sovereign legislatur manifest a more tender regard to that fundament principl of british constitut polici than at the time of the revolut when it deviat from the direct line of hereditari success the crown wa carri somewhat out of the line in which it had befor move but the new line wa deriv from the same stock it wa still a line of hereditari descent still an hereditari descent in the same blood though an hereditari descent qualifi with protestant when the legislatur alter the direct but kept the principl they show that they held it inviol on thi principl the law of inherit had admit some amend in the old time and long befor the era of the revolut some time after the conquest great question aros upon the legal principl of hereditari descent it becam a matter of doubt whether the heir per capita or the heir per stirp wa to succeed but whether the heir per capita gave way when the heirdom per stirp took place or the cathol heir when the protest wa prefer the inherit principl surviv with a sort of immort through all transmigr multosqu per anno stat fortuna domu et avi numerantur avorum thi is the spirit of our constitut not onli in it settl cours but in all it revolut whoever came in or howev he came in whether he obtain the crown by law or by forc the hereditari success wa either continu or adopt the gentlemen of the societi for revolut see noth in that of but the deviat from the constitut and they take the deviat from the principl for the principl they have littl regard to the obviou consequ of their doctrin though they must see that it leav posit author in veri few of the posit institut of thi countri when such an unwarrant maxim is onc establish that no throne is law but the elect no one act of the princ who preced their era of fictiti elect can be valid do these theorist mean to imit some of their predecessor who drag the bodi of our ancient sovereign out of the quiet of their tomb do they mean to attaint and disabl backward all the king that have reign befor the revolut and consequ to stain the throne of england with the blot of a continu usurp do they mean to invalid annul or to call into question togeth with the titl of the whole line of our king that great bodi of our statut law which pass under those whom they treat as usurp to annul law of inestim valu to our liberti of as great valu at least as ani which have pass at or sinc the period of the revolut if king who did not owe their crown to the choic of their peopl had no titl to make law what will becom of the statut de tallagio non concedendo of the petit of right of the act of habea corpu do these new doctor of the right of men presum to assert that king jame the second who came to the crown as next of blood accord to the rule of a then unqualifi success wa not to all intent and purpos a law king of england befor he had done ani of those act which were justli constru into an abdic of hi crown if he wa not much troubl in parliament might have been save at the period these gentlemen commemor but king jame wa a bad king with a good titl and not an usurp the princ who succeed accord to the act of parliament which settl the crown on the electress sophia and on her descend be protest came in as much by a titl of inherit as king jame did he came in accord to the law as it stood at hi access to the crown and the princ of the hous of brunswick came to the inherit of the crown not by elect but by the law as it stood at their sever access of protest descent and inherit as i hope i have shown suffici the law by which thi royal famili is specif destin to the success is the act of the th and th of king william the term of thi act bind us and our heir and our poster to them their heir and their poster be protest to the end of time in the same word as the declar of right had bound us to the heir of king william and queen mari it therefor secur both an hereditari crown and an hereditari allegi on what ground except the constitut polici of form an establish to secur that kind of success which is to preclud a choic of the peopl for ever could the legislatur have fastidi reject the fair and abund choic which our own countri present to them and search in strang land for a foreign princess from whose womb the line of our futur ruler were to deriv their titl to govern million of men through a seri of age the princess sophia wa name in the act of settlement of the th and th of king william for a stock and root of inherit to our king and not for her merit as a temporari administratrix of a power which she might not and in fact did not herself ever exercis she wa adopt for one reason and for one onli becaus say the act the most excel princess sophia electress and duchess dowag of hanov is daughter of the most excel princess elizabeth late queen of bohemia daughter of our late sovereign lord king jame the first of happi memori and is herebi declar to be the next in success in the protest line etc etc and the crown shall continu to the heir of her bodi be protest thi limit wa made by parliament that through the princess sophia an inherit line not onli wa to be continu in futur but what they thought veri materi that through her it wa to be connect with the old stock of inherit in king jame the first in order that the monarchi might preserv an unbroken uniti through all age and might be preserv with safeti to our religion in the old approv mode by descent in which if our liberti had been onc endang they had often through all storm and struggl of prerog and privileg been preserv they did well no experi ha taught us that in ani other cours or method than that of an hereditari crown our liberti can be regularli perpetu and preserv sacr as our hereditari right an irregular convuls movement may be necessari to throw off an irregular convuls diseas but the cours of success is the healthi habit of the british constitut wa it that the legislatur want at the act for the limit of the crown in the hanoverian line drawn through the femal descend of jame the first a due sens of the inconveni of have two or three or possibl more foreign in success to the british throne no they had a due sens of the evil which might happen from such foreign rule and more than a due sens of them but a more decis proof can not be given of the full convict of the british nation that the principl of the revolut did not author them to elect king at their pleasur and without ani attent to the ancient fundament principl of our govern than their continu to adopt a plan of hereditari protest success in the old line with all the danger and all the inconveni of it be a foreign line full befor their eye and oper with the utmost forc upon their mind a few year ago i should be asham to overload a matter so capabl of support itself by the then unnecessari support of ani argument but thi sediti unconstitut doctrin is now publicli taught avow and print the dislik i feel to revolut the signal for which have so often been given from pulpit the spirit of chang that is gone abroad the total contempt which prevail with you and may come to prevail with us of all ancient institut when set in opposit to a present sens of conveni or to the bent of a present inclin all these consider make it not unadvis in my opinion to call back our attent to the true principl of our own domest law that you my french friend should begin to know and that we should continu to cherish them we ought not on either side of the water to suffer ourselv to be impos upon by the counterfeit ware which some person by a doubl fraud export to you in illicit bottom as raw commod of british growth though wholli alien to our soil in order afterward to smuggl them back again into thi countri manufactur after the newest pari fashion of an improv liberti the peopl of england will not ape the fashion they have never tri nor go back to those which they have found mischiev on trial they look upon the legal hereditari success of their crown as among their right not as among their wrong as a benefit not as a grievanc as a secur for their liberti not as a badg of servitud they look on the frame of their commonwealth such as it stand to be of inestim valu and they conceiv the undisturb success of the crown to be a pledg of the stabil and perpetu of all the other member of our constitut i shall beg leav befor i go ani further to take notic of some paltri artific which the abettor of elect as the onli law titl to the crown are readi to employ in order to render the support of the just principl of our constitut a task somewhat invidi these sophist substitut a fictiti caus and feign personag in whose favor they suppos you engag whenev you defend the inherit natur of the crown it is common with them to disput as if they were in a conflict with some of those explod fanat of slaveri who formerli maintain what i believ no creatur now maintain that the crown is held by divin hereditari and indefeas right these old fanat of singl arbitrari power dogmat as if hereditari royalti wa the onli law govern in the world just as our new fanat of popular arbitari power maintain that a popular elect is the sole law sourc of author the old prerog enthusiast it is true did specul foolishli and perhap impious too as if monarchi had more of a divin fanction than ani other mode of govern and as if a right to govern by inherit were in strict indefeas in everi person and under everi circumst which no civil or polit right can be but an absurd opinion concern the king hereditari right to the crown doe not prejudic one that is ration and bottom upon solid principl of law and polici if all the absurd theori of lawyer and divin were to vitiat the object in which they are convers we should have no law and no religion left in the world but an absurd theori on one side of a question form no justif for alleg a fals fact or promulg mischiev maxim on the other the second claim of the revolut societi is a right of cashier their governor on misconduct perhap the apprehens our ancestor entertain of form such a preced as that of cashier for misconduct wa the caus that the declar of the act which impli the abdic of king jame wa if it had ani fault rather too guard and too circumstanti that king jame the second have endeavor to subvert the constitut of the kingdom by break the origin contract between king and peopl and by the advic of jesuit and other wick person have violat the fundament law and have withdrawn himself out of the kingdom ha abdic the govern and the throne is therebi vacant but all thi guard and all thi accumul of circumst serv to show the spirit of caution which predomin in the nation council in a situat in which men irrit by oppress and elev by a triumph over it are apt to abandon themselv to violent and extrem cours it show the anxieti of the great men who influenc the conduct of affair at that great event to make the revolut a parent of settlement and not a nurseri of futur revolut no govern could stand a moment if it could be blown down with ani thing so loos and indefinit as an opinion of misconduct they who led at the revolut ground the virtual abdic of king jame upon no such light and uncertain a principl they charg him with noth less than a design confirm by a multitud of illeg overt act to subvert the protest church and state and their fundament unquestion law and liberti they charg him with have broken the origin contract between king and peopl thi wa more than misconduct a grave and overrul necess oblig them to take the step they took and took with infinit reluct as under that most rigor of all law their trust for the futur preserv of the constitut wa not in futur revolut the grand polici of all their regul wa to render it almost impractic for ani futur sovereign to compel the state of the kingdom to have again recours to those violent remedi they left the crown what in the eye and estim of law it had ever been perfectli irrespons in order to lighten the crown still further they aggrav respons on minist of state by the statut of the st of king william sess d call the act for declar the right and liberti of the subject and for settl the success of the crown they enact that the minist should serv the crown on the term of that declar they secur soon after the frequent meet of parliament by which the whole govern would be under the constant inspect and activ control of the popular repres and of the magnat of the kingdom in the next great constitut act that of the th and th of king william for the further limit of the crown and better secur the right and liberti of the subject they provid that no pardon under the great seal of england should be pleadabl to an impeach by the common in parliament the rule laid down for govern in the declar of right the constant inspect of parliament the practic claim of impeach they thought infinit a better secur not onli for their constitut liberti but against the vice of administr than the reserv of a right so difficult in the practic so uncertain in the issu and often so mischiev in the consequ as that of cashier their governor dr price in thi sermon p condemn veri properli the practic of gross adulatori address to king instead of thi fulsom style he propos that hi majesti should be told on occas of congratul that he is to consid himself as more properli the servant than the sovereign of hi peopl for a compliment thi new form of address doe not seem to be veri sooth those who are servant in name as well as in effect do not like to be told of their situat their duti and their oblig the slave in the old play tell hi master haec commemoratio est quasi exprobratio it is not pleasant as compliment it is not wholesom as instruct after all if the king were to bring himself to echo thi new kind of address to adopt it in term and even to take the appel of servant of the peopl as hi royal style how either he or we should be much mend by it i can not imagin i have seen veri assum letter sign your most obedi humbl servant the proudest domin that ever wa endur on earth took a titl of still greater humil than that which is now propos for sovereign by the apostl of liberti king and nation were trampl upon by the foot of one call himself the servant of servant and mandat for depos sovereign were seal with the signet of the fisherman i should have consid all thi as no more than a sort of flippant vain discours in which as in an unsavori fume sever person suffer the spirit of liberti to evapor if it were not plainli in support of the idea and a part of the scheme of cashier king for misconduct in that light it is worth some observ king in one sens are undoubtedli the servant of the peopl becaus their power ha no other ration end than that of the gener advantag but it is not true that they are in the ordinari sens by our constitut at least ani thing like servant the essenc of whose situat is to obey the command of some other and to be remov at pleasur but the king of great britain obey no other person all other person are individu and collect too under him and owe to him a legal obedi the law which know neither to flatter nor to insult call thi high magistr not our servant as thi humbl divin call him but our sovereign lord the king and we on our part have learn to speak onli the primit languag of the law and not the confus jargon of their babylonian pulpit as he is not to obey us but as we are to obey the law in him our constitut ha made no sort of provis toward render him as a servant in ani degre respons our constitut know noth of a magistr like the justicia of arragon nor of ani court legal appoint nor of ani process legal settl for submit the king to the respons belong to all servant in thi he is not distinguish from the common and the lord who in their sever public capac can never be call to an account for their conduct although the revolut societi choos to assert in direct opposit to one of the wisest and most beauti part of our constitut that a king is no more than the first servant of the public creat by it and respons to it ill would our ancestor at the revolut have deserv their fame for wisdom if they had found no secur for their freedom but in render their govern feebl in it oper and precari in it tenur if they had been abl to contriv no better remedi against arbitrari power than civil confus let these gentlemen state who that repres public is to whom they will affirm the king as a servant to be respons it will be then time enough for me to produc to them the posit statut law which affirm that he is not the ceremoni of cashier king of which these gentlemen talk so much at their eas can rare if ever be perform without forc it then becom a case of war and not of constitut law are command to hold their tongu amongst arm and tribun fall to the ground with the peac they are no longer abl to uphold the revolut of wa obtain by a just war in the onli case in which ani war and much more a civil war can be just justa bella quibu necessaria the question of dethron or if these gentlemen like the phrase better cashier king will alway be as it ha alway been an extraordinari question of state and wholli out of the law a question like all other question of state of disposit and of mean and of probabl consequ rather than of posit right as it wa not made for common abus so it is not to be agit by common mind the specul line of demarc where obedi ought to end and resist must begin is faint obscur and not easili defin it is not a singl act or a singl event which determin it govern must be abus and derang inde befor it can be thought of and the prospect of the futur must be as bad as the experi of the past when thing are in that lament condit the natur of the diseas is to indic the remedi to those whom natur ha qualifi to administ in extrem thi critic ambigu bitter potion to a distemp state time and occas and provoc will teach their own lesson the wise will determin from the graviti of the case the irrit from sensibl to oppress the highmind from disdain and indign at abus power in unworthi hand the brave and bold from the love of honor danger in a gener caus but with or without right a revolut will be the veri last resourc of the think and the good the third head of right assert by the pulpit of the old jewri name the right to form a govern for ourselv ha at least as littl counten from ani thing done at the revolut either in preced or principl as the two first of their claim the revolut wa made to preserv our ancient indisput law and liberti and that ancient constitut of govern which is our onli secur for law and liberti if you are desir of know the spirit of our constitut and the polici which predomin in that great period which ha secur it to thi hour pray look for both in our histori in our record in our act of parliament and journal of parliament and not in the sermon of the old jewri and the afterdinn toast of the revolut societi in the former you will find other idea and anoth languag such a claim is as illsuit to our temper and wish as it is unsupport by ani appear of author the veri idea of the fabric of a new govern is enough to fill us with disgust and horror we wish at the period of the revolut and do now wish to deriv all we possess as an inherit from our forefath upon that bodi and stock of inherit we have taken care not to inocul ani cyon alien to the natur of the origin plant all the reform we have hitherto made have proceed upon the principl of refer to antiqu and i hope nay i am persuad that all those which possibl may be made hereaft will be care form upon analog preced author and exampl our oldest reform is that of magna charta you will see that sir edward coke that great oracl of our law and inde all the great men who follow him to blackston see blackston magna charta print at oxford are industri to prove the pedigre of our liberti they endeavor to prove that the ancient charter the magna charta of king john wa connect with anoth posit charter from henri i and that both the one and the other were noth more than a reaffirm of the still more ancient stand law of the kingdom in the matter of fact for the greater part these author appear to be in the right perhap not alway but if the lawyer mistak in some particular it prove my posit still the more strongli becaus it demonstr the power prepossess toward antiqu with which the mind of all our lawyer and legisl and of all the peopl whom they wish to influenc have been alway fill and the stationari polici of thi kingdom in consid their most sacr right and franchis as an inherit in the famou law of the d of charl i call the petit of right the parliament say to the king your subject have inherit thi freedom claim their franchis not on abstract principl as the right of men but as the right of englishmen and as a patrimoni deriv from their forefath seldom and the other profoundli learn men who drew thi petit of right were as well acquaint at least with all the gener theori concern the right of men as ani of the discours in our pulpit or on your tribun full as well as dr price or as the abb sey but for reason worthi of that practic wisdom which supersed their theoret scienc they prefer thi posit record hereditari titl to all which can be dear to the man and the citizen to that vagu specul right which expos their sure inherit to be scrambl for and torn to piec by everi wild litigi spirit the same polici pervad all the law which have sinc been made for the preserv of our liberti in the st of william and mari in the famou statut call the declar of right the two hous utter not a syllabl of a right to frame a govern for themselv you will see that their whole care wa to secur the religion law and liberti that had been long possess and had been late endang take w and m into their most seriou consider the best mean for make such an establish that their religion law and liberti might not be in danger of be again subvert they auspic all their proceed by state as some of those best mean in the first place to do as their ancestor in like case have usual done for vindic their ancient right and liberti to declar and then they pray the king and queen that it may be declar and enact that all and singular the right and liberti assert and declar are the true ancient and indubit right and liberti of the peopl of thi kingdom you will observ that from magna charta to the declar of right it ha been the uniform polici of our constitut to claim and assert our liberti as an entail inherit deriv to us from our forefath and to be transmit to our poster as an estat special belong to the peopl of thi kingdom without ani refer whatev to ani other more gener or prior right by thi mean our constitut preserv an uniti in so great a divers of it part we have an inherit crown an inherit peerag and an hous of common and a peopl inherit privileg franchis and liberti from a long line of ancestor thi polici appear to me to be the result of profound reflect or rather the happi effect of follow natur which is wisdom without reflect and abov it a spirit of innov is gener the result of a selfish temper and confin view peopl will not look forward to poster who never look backward to their ancestor besid the peopl of england well know that the idea of inherit furnish a sure principl
