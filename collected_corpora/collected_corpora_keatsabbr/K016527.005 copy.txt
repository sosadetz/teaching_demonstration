great pain taken with them in their book husbandri and labor are what are most want to be encourag among the lower class of peopl provid ha given to men differ geniuss and capac for differ end and that all might becom use link of the same great chain let us appli those talent to labor those to learn those to trade to mechan in their differ branch which point out the differ pursuit and then no person will be unus on the contrari everi one may be emin in some way or other learn of itself never made ani man happi the ploughman make fewer mistak in the conduct of life than the scholar becaus the sphere in which he move is a more contract one but if a geniu aris let us encourag it there will be rustic enough to do the common servic for the finer spirit and to carri on the busi of the world if we do not by our own indiscrimin good offic contribut to their misappl i will write to congratul lord w and hi ladi i rejoic exceedingli in their happi i will also write to my beauchamp and to ladi beauchamp to give her joy on her enlarg heart sure dr bartlett human natur is not so bad a thing as some disgrac of their own speci have imagin i have on mani occas found that it is but appli properli to the passion of person who though they have not been veri remark for benevol may yet be induc to do right thing in some manner if not alway in the most grace but as it is an observ that the miser feast is often the most splendid so may we say as in the case of lord w and ladi beauchamp the one to her soninlaw the other to hi ladi and niec that when such person are brought to tast the sweet of a gener and benefic action they are abl to behav greatli we should not too soon and without make proper applic give up person of abil or power upon concept of their gener charact and then with the herd set our face against them as if we knew them to be invinc how mani way are there to overcom person who may not howev be natur benefic polici a regard for outward appear ostent love of prais will sometim have great influenc and not seldom is the request of a favor himself in fault who perhap show as much self in the applic as the refus doe in the denial let charlott know that i will write to her when she give me a subject i will write to lord and ladi l by the next mail to write to either is to write to both i have alreadi answer emili favor i am veri glad that her mother and her mother

letter from him but i see the proud man in it valu himself on hi knowledg of the world and rather vex to be overreach by the common artific of some of the worst peopl in it than from right principl i know not what i can do for him except i were on the spot i am griev that he ha not profit by other men wisdom i wish he may by hi own experi i will write to him yet neither to reproach him nor to extenu hi folli though i wish to free him from the consequ of it i write to my aunt eleanor to congratul and welcom her to london i hope to find her there on my return from itali the unhappi sir hargrav the still unhappi merceda what sport have they made of their health in the prime of their day and with their reput how poor would have been their triumph had they escap by a flight so ignomini the due reward of their iniquit contriv but to meet with such a disgrac punish and so narrowli to escap a still more disgrac one tell me can the poor men look out into open day but poor bagenhal sunk as he is almost beneath piti what can be said of him we see dr bartlett in the behavior and sordid acquiesc with insult of these three men that offens spirit can not be true one if you have ani call

present are omit i am greatli oblig to you my dear ladi g for dispatch to me in so extraordinari a way the first letter of your brother to dr bartlett i thank god for hi safe arriv at the destin place and for the faint hope given in it of hi friend life the almighti will do hi own work and in hi own way and that must be best you ask me for my opinion of the content of thi letter at larg what can i say thu much i must say i admir more and more your brother i piti the famili he is gone to comfort and reliev and i pray for clementina and jeronymo and thi as well for your brother sake as their he gener rejoic that he did not pursu hi own inclin i am veri happi in what he say of your harriet inde my dear i am though we may be consciou of not deserv the prais bestow upon us yet are we fond of stand high in the opinion of those we love two paragraph i have got by heart i need not tell you which they are but ala hi greatli favor friend is not so free as he hope she wa it is a pleasur to me howev becaus it is such to him that it is not hi fault but her own that she is not the countess whom he so justli prais write to me and i answer but to what purpos i am afraid that a veri import observ of hi come not in time to do me servic sinc if my prudenc is proport to my trial i ought to have endeavor to exert it sooner but it seem there is an insuper object against the poor ladi go into a nunneri i never heard of that befor it seem right to the marchio that the young ladi who is entitl to a great share of thi world good should not be dedic to heaven thi may be so in the famili eye for aught i know but i am persuad that if there is ani one of it who would not have plead thi obstacl to a divin dedic it would be clementina herself and yet i own i can allow of their regret that the cruel laurana should be a gainer by clementina be lost as i may say to the world your brother kind remembr of mr and mr reev is an honor done to me as well as to them i must take it so ladi g and what he say of me in the paragraph in which he mention emili add to the pride he had rais in me befor dr bartlett is extrem oblig in not offer to with hold ani passag in your brother letter from us i have let him know that i think him so and have beg him not to spare anyth out of tender to me on a supposit that i may be affect or made uneasi by what your brother shall write to him thi is speak veri plainli my dear but it is to dr battlett and he signifi to us more than onc that he could not be a stranger to the heart of your harriet and now my dear ladi g let me ask you in my turn what you think of one passag in your brother letter of which you have not taken the least notic in your to me charlott i hope is happi if she be not it must be her own fault you have honestli own in your last yet too roguishli for a true penit that it wa evid so in the debat about be present miss grandison use to like the draw room well enough her brother ha own in my hear as well as in your that had he not been so long out of england and sinc hi return to it so seldom in town he would have made it a part of hi duti to pay hi attend there at proper time but ladi g forsooth disdain to appear as the properti reflect but my dear how absurd of a worthi man to whom she had vow love honor and obedi i should not remind you thu of past flippanc did not new one seem to spring up everi day for heaven sake my dear ladi g let it not be carri from england to itali that lord g is not so happi with a sister of sir charl grandison as might be expect left it be ask whether that sister and thi brother had the same mother i have written befor all that i could possibl say on thi subject you know yourself to be wrong it would be impertin to expostul further on a duti so known and acknowleg no more therefor on thi head author me to say for ever as to my health i would fain be well i am more sorri that i am not for the sake of my friend who are incessantli griev for me than for my own i have not i think i have not anyth to reproach myself with nor yet anybodi to reproach me to whom have i given caus of triumph over me by my ill usag or insol to him i yield to an event to which i ought to submit and to a woman not less but more worthi than myself and who ha a prior claim i long to hear of the meet of thi nobl pair may it be propiti may sir charl grandison have the satisfact and the merit with the famili of be the mean of restor to reason a greater restor than to health the woman everi faculti of whose soul ought in that case to be devot to god and to him methink i have at present but one wish it is that i may live to see thi ladi if she is to be the happi woman
