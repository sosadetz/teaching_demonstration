order to enrich hi shrine they impoverish the whole empir yet still with the conniv and by the influenc of the cuboy who gratifi thi sordid passion or superstit of the dairo with a view to prevent him from employ hi attent on matter of greater consequ nathaniel you have heard of the transmigr of soul a doctrin avow by one pythagora a philosoph of crotona thi doctrin though discard and reprob by christian is nevertheless sound and orthodox i affirm on the integr of an atom further i shall not explain myself on thi subject though i might with safeti set the convoc and the whole hierarchi at

truth are conceal between friend honest nathaniel i myself constitut part of that sage bodi and i could say a great deal but there is a time for all thing i shall onli observ that philip tessier had some reason for suppos pythagora to have been a monk and there are shrewd hint in meyer dissert utrum pythagora judaeu fuit an monachu carmelita wave these intric discuss for the present though i can not help disclos that pythagora wa actual circumcis know peacock that the metempsychosi or transmigr of soul is the method which natur and fate constantli pursu in anim the creatur produc on the face

had success pass through the bodi of an ass a dottril an applewoman and a cowboy it wa divert enough to see the rejoic with which the birth of thi quanbuku quanbuku is a digniti of the first order in

eager embrac and continu unit ever after the favor of the sovereign ad to the natur influenc aris from a vast fortun and great allianc did not fail to elev fikakaka to the most emin offic of the state until at length he attain to the digniti of cuboy or chiefminist which virtual comprehend all the rest here then wa the strangest phenomenon that ever appear in the polit world a statesman without capac or the smallest tinctur of human learn a secretari who could not write a financi who did not understand the multipl tabl and the treasur of a vast empir who never could balanc account with hi

their suprem director and everi morn ador him with a veri singular rite of worship thi attach wa the more remark as fikakaha wa known to favor the sect of nembudsju who distinguish themselv by the ceremoni of circumcis some malici peopl did not scrupl to whisper about that he himself had privat undergon the oper but these to my certain knowledg were the suggest of falsehood and slander a slight scarif inde it wa onc necessari to make on account of hi health but thi wa no ceremoni of ani religi worship the truth wa thi the nembudsju be few in number and gener hate by the whole nation had recours to the protect of fikakaka which they obtain for a valuabl consider then a law wa promulg in their favor a step which wa so far from excit the jealousi of the bonza that there wa not abov three out of one hundr and fiftynin thousand that open their lip in disapprob of the measur such were the virtu and moder of the bonza and so loath were they to disoblig their great director fikakaka what render the knot of connect between the dairo gothamababa and thi cuboy altogeth indissolubl wa a singular circumst which i shall now explain fikakika not onli devot himself entir to the gratif of hi master prejudic and rapac even when they interf the most with the interest and reput of japan but he also submit person to hi caprici humor with the most placid resign he present hi posterior to be kick as regularli as the day revolv and present them not bare with submiss but with all the appear of fond desir and truli thi diurnal exposur wa attend with such delect as he never enjoy in ani other attitud to explain thi matter i must tell thee peacock that fikakaka wa from hi infanc afflict with an itch of the podex which the learn dr woodward would have term immani pruritu that great naturalist would have imput it to a redund of cholicki salt got out of the stomach and gut into the blood and thrown upon these part and he would have attempt to break their colluct with oil etc but i who know the real caus of thi disord smile at these whim of philosophi be that as it may certain it is all the most emin physician in japan were consult about thi strang tickl and tingl and among these the celebr fansey whose spirit afterward inform the bodi of rabelai thi experienc leech have prescrib a cours of cathart balsam and sweeten on the supposit that the blood wa taint with a scorbut itch at length found reason to believ that the diseas wa local he therefor tri the method of gentl friction for which purpos he use almost the veri same substanc which were mani centuri after appli by gargantua to hi own posterior such as a night cap a pillowbi a slipper a poke a pannier a beaver a hen a cock a chicken a calfskin a hareskin a pigeon a cormor a lawyer bag a lamprey a coif a lure nay even a goos neck without find that volupt merifiqu au trou de cul which wa the portion of the son of grangousi in short there wa noth that gave fikakaka such respit from thi torment titil as did smear the part with thick cream which wa afterward lick up by the rough tongu of a boarcat but the administr of thi remedi wa onc product of a disagre incid in the mean time the distemp gain ground becam so troublesom that the unfortun quanbuku wa incessantli in the fidget and ran about distract cackl like a hen in labor the sourc of all thi misfortun wa the juxta posit of two atom quarrel for preced in thi the cuboy seat of honor their press and squeez and elbow and jostl though of no effect in discompos one anoth occas all thi irrit and titil in the posterior of fikakaka what do thou mutter peacock do thou presum to question my verac now by the indivis rotund of an atom i have a good mind caitiff to rais such a buzz commot in thi glandula pineali that thou shall run distract over the face of the earth like io when she wa stung by juno gadfli what thou who have been wrap from the cradl in vision of mysteri and revel swallow imposs like lamb wool and digest doctrin harder than iron three time quench in the ebro thou to demur at what i assert upon the evid and faith of my own conscious and consist oh you capitul well then bewar of a relaps you know a relaps heret find no merci i say while fikakaka podex wa the scene of content between two turbul atom i had the honor to be post immedi under the nail of the dairo great toe which happen one day to itch more than usual for occup the cuboy present himself at that instant and turn hi face from hi master gothamababa perform the exercis with such uncommon vehem that first hi slipper and then hi toenail flew off after have made a small breach in the perineum of fikakaka by the same effort i wa divorc from the great toe of the sovereign and lodg near the great gut of hi minist exactli in the interstic between the two hostil particl which were thu in some measur restrain from wrangl though it wa not in my power to keep the peac entir nevertheless fikakaka tortur wa immedi suspend and he wa even seiz with an orgasm of pleasur analog to that which characteris the extaci of love think not howev peacock that i would adduc thi circumst as a proof that pleasur and pain are mere relat which can exist onli as they are contrast no pleasur and pain are simpl independ idea incap of definit and thi which fikakaka felt wa an extaci compound of posit pleasur ingrast upon the remov of pain but whether thi posit pleasur depend upon a particular center of percuss hit upon by accid or wa the insepar effect of a kick and scratch confer by a royal foot and toe i shall not at present unfold neither will i demonstr the modu operandi on the nervou papilla of fikakaka breech whether by irrit relax undul or vibrat were these essenti discoveri commun human philosophi would becom too arrog it wa but the other day that newton made shift to dive into some subaltern law of matter to explain the revolut of the planet and analyz the composit of light and ever sinc that reptil man ha believ itself a demigod i hope to see the day when the petul philosoph shall be driven back to hi categori and the organum universal of aristotl hi hi and hi but wave these digress the pleasur which the cuboy felt from the applic of the dairo toenail wa succeed by a kind of tension or stiff which began to grow troublesom just as he reach hi own palac where the bonza were assembl to offer up their diurnal incens instinct on thi occas perform what could hardli have been expect from the most extraordinari talent at sight of a grizzl heard belong to one of those vener doctor he wa struck with the idea of a power assuag and take him into hi cabinet propos that he should make oral applic to the part affect the propos wa embrac without hesit and the effect even transcend the hope of the cuboy the oscul itself wa soft warm emolli and comfort but when the nervou papilla were gentli stroak and as it were fondl by the long elast peristalt absters fiber that compos thi reverend verriculum such a delect titil ensu that fikaka wa quit in raptur that which he intend at first for a medicin he now convert into an articl of luxuri all the bonza who enrol themselv in the number of hi depend whether old or young black or fair rough or smooth were enjoin everi day to perform thi addit and posterior rite of worship so product of delight to the cuboy that he wa everi morn impati to receiv the dairo calcitr or rather hi pedestrian digit after which he flew with all the eager of desir to the subsequ part of hi entertain the transport thu produc seem to disarrang hi whole nervou system and produc an odd kind of revolut in hi fanci for though he wa natur grave and inde overwhelm with constitut hebetud he becam in consequ of thi period tickl the most giddi pert buffoon in natur all wa grin giggl laugh and prate except when hi fear interven then he start and stare and curs and pray by turn there wa but one barber in the whole empir that would undertak to shave him so ticklish and unsteadi he wa under the hand of the oper he could not fit abov one minut in the same attitud or on the same seat but shift about from couch to chair from chair to stool from stool to closestool with incess rotat and all the time gave audienc to those who solicit hi favor and protect to all and sever he promis hi best offic and confirm these promis with oath and protest one he shook by the hand anoth he hug a third he kiss on both side the face with a fourth he whisper a fifth he honor with a familiar horselaugh he never had courag to refus even that which he could not possibl grant and at last hi tongu actual forgot how to pronounc the neg particl but as in the english languag two nag amount to an affirm five hundr affirm in the mouth of fikakaka did not altogeth destroy the efficaci of simpl negat a promis five hundr time repeat and at everi repetit confirm by oath bare amount to a comput chanc of perform it must be allow howev he promot a great number of bonza and in thi promot he manifest an uncommon tast they were prefer accord to the color of their beard he found by experi that beard of differ color yield him differ degre of pleasur in the friction we have describ abov and the provis he made for each wa in proport to the satisfact the candid could afford the sensat ensu from the contact of a gray beard wa soft and delic and agreeabl demulc when the part were unusu inflam a red yellow or brindl beard wa in request when the busi wa to thrill or tingl but a black beard wa of all other the most honor by fikakaka not onli on account of it fleeci feel equal spirit and balsam but also for anoth philosoph reason which i shall now explain you know peacock that black color absorb the ray of light and detain them as it were in a repositori thu a black beard like the back of a black cat becom a phosphoru in the dark and emit sparkl upon friction you must know that one of the gravest doctor of the bonza who had a privat request to make desir an audienc of fikakaka in hi closet at night and the taper fall down by accid at that veri instant when hi beard wa in contact with the cuboy seat of honor the electr snap wa heard and the part illumin to the astonish of the spectat who look upon it as a prelud to the apotheosi of fikakaka be made acquaint with thi phenomenon the minist wa exceedingli elev in hi own mind he rejoic in it as a commun of some divin efficaci and rais the happi bonza to the rank of
