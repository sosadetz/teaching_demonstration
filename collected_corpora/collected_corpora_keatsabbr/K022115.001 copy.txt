scienc than to insinu the prais of their own system by decri all those which have been advanc befor them and inde were they content with lament that ignor which we still lie under in the most import question that can come befor the tribun of human reason there are few who have an acquaint with the scienc that would not readili agre with them it is easi for one of judgment and learn to perceiv the weak foundat even of those system which have obtain the greatest credit and have carri their pretens highest to accur and profound reason principl taken upon trust consequ lame deduc from them want of coher in the part and of evid in the whole these are everi where to be met with in the system of the most emin philosoph and seem to have drawn disgrac upon philosophi itself nor is there requir such profound knowledg to discov the present imperfect condit of the scienc but even the rabbl without door may judg from the nois and clamor which they hear that all goe not well within there is noth which is not the subject of debat and in which men of learn are not of contrari opinion the most trivial question escap not our controversi and in the most moment we are not abl to give ani certain decis disput are multipli as if everi thing wa uncertain and these disput are manag with the greatest warmth as if everi thing wa certain amidst all thi bustl it is not reason which carri the prize but eloqu and no man need ever despair of gain proselyt to the most extravag hypothesi who ha art enough to repres it in ani favor color the victori is not gain by the men at arm who manag the pike and the sword but by the trumpet drummer and musician of the armi from henc in my opinion aris that common prejudic against metaphys reason of all kind even amongst those who profess themselv scholar and have a just valu for everi other part of literatur by metaphys reason they do not understand those on ani particular branch of scienc but everi kind of argument which is ani way abstrus and requir some attent to be comprehend we have so often lost our labor in such research that we commonli reject them without hesit and resolv if we must for ever be a prey to error and delus that they shall at least be natur and entertain and inde noth but the most determin skeptic along with a great degre of indol can justifi thi avers to metaphys for if truth be at all within the reach of human capac it is certain it must lie veri deep and abstrus and to hope we shall arriv at it without pain while the greatest genius have fail with the utmost pain must certainli be esteem suffici vain and presumptu i pretend to no such advantag in the philosophi i am go to unfold and would esteem it a strong presumpt against it were it so veri easi and obviou it is evid that all the scienc have a relat greater or less to human natur and that howev wide ani of them may seem to run from it they still return back by one passag or anoth even mathemat natur philosophi and natur religion are in some measur depend on the scienc of man sinc they lie under the cogniz of men and are judg of by their power and faculti it is imposs to tell what chang and improv we might make in these scienc were we thoroughli acquaint with the extent and forc of human understand and could explain the natur of the idea we employ and of the oper we perform in our reason and these improv are the more to be hope for in natur religion as it is not content with instruct us in the natur of superior power but carri it view farther to their disposit toward us and our duti toward them and consequ we ourselv are not onli the be that reason but also one of the object concern which we reason if therefor the scienc of mathemat natur philosophi and natur religion have such a depend on the knowledg of man what may be expect in the other scienc whose connect with human natur is more close and intim the sole end of logic is to explain the principl and oper of our reason faculti and the natur of our idea moral and critic regard our tast and sentiment and polit consid men as unit in societi and depend on each other in these four scienc of logic moral critic and polit is comprehend almost everi thing which it can ani way import us to be acquaint with or which can tend either to the improv or ornament of the human mind here then is the onli expedi from which we can hope for success in our philosoph research to leav the tediou linger method which we have hitherto follow and instead of take now and then a castl or villag on the frontier to march up directli to the capit or center of these scienc to human natur itself which be onc master of we may everi where els hope for an easi victori from thi station we may extend our conquest over all those scienc which more intim concern human life and may afterward proceed at leisur to discov more fulli those which are the object of pure curios there is no question of import whose decis is not compris in the scienc of man and there is none which can be decid with ani certainti befor we becom acquaint with that scienc in pretend therefor to explain the principl of human natur we in effect propos a complet system of the scienc built on a foundat almost entir new and the onli one upon which they can stand with ani secur and as the scienc of man is the onli solid foundat for the other scienc so the onli solid foundat we can give to thi scienc itself must be laid on experi and observ it is no astonish reflect to consid that the applic of experiment philosophi to moral subject should come after that to natur at the distanc of abov a whole centuri sinc we find in fact that there wa about the same interv betwixt the origin of these scienc and that reckon from thale to socrat the space of time is nearli equal to that betwixt my lord bacon mr lock my lord shaftsburi dr mandevil mr hutchinson dr butler etc and some late philosoph in england who have begun to put the scienc of man on a new foot and have engag the attent and excit the curios of the public so true it is that howev other nation may rival us in poetri and excel us in some other agreeabl art the improv in reason and philosophi can onli be owe to a land of toler and of liberti nor ought we to think that thi latter improv in the scienc of man will do less honor to our nativ countri than the former in natur philosophi but ought rather to esteem it a greater glori upon account of the greater import of that scienc as well as the necess it lay under of such a reform for to me it seem evid that the essenc of the mind be equal unknown to us with that of extern bodi it must be equal imposs to form ani notion of it power and qualiti otherwis than from care and exact experi and the observ of those particular effect which result from it differ circumst and situat and though we must endeavor to render all our principl as univers as possibl by trace up our experi to the utmost and explain all effect from the simplest and fewest caus it is still certain we can not go beyond experi and ani hypothesi that pretend to discov the ultim origin qualiti of human natur ought at first to be reject as presumptu and chimer i do not think a philosoph who would appli himself so earnestli to the explain the ultim principl of the soul would show himself a great master in that veri scienc of human natur which he pretend to explain or veri know in what is natur satisfactori to the mind of man for noth is more certain than that despair ha almost the same effect upon us with enjoy and that we are no sooner acquaint with the imposs of satisfi ani desir than the desir itself vanish when we see that we have arriv at the utmost extent of human reason we sit down content though we be perfectli satisfi in the main of our ignor and perceiv that we can give no reason for our most gener and most refin principl besid our experi of their realiti which is the reason of the mere vulgar and what it requir no studi at first to have discov for the most particular and most extraordinari phenomenon and as thi imposs of make ani farther progress is enough to satisfi the reader so the writer may deriv a more delic satisfact from the free confess of hi ignor and from hi prudenc in avoid that error into which so mani have fallen of impos their conjectur and hypothes on the world for the most certain principl when thi mutual content and satisfact can be obtain betwixt the master and scholar i know not what more we can requir of our philosophi but if thi imposs of explain ultim principl should be esteem a defect in the scienc of man i will ventur to affirm that it is a defect common to it with all the scienc and all the art in which we can employ ourselv whether they be such as are cultiv in the school of the philosoph or practic in the shop of the meanest artizan none of them can go beyond experi or establish ani principl which are not found on that author moral philosophi ha inde thi peculiar disadvantag which is not found in natur that in collect it experi it can not make them purpos with premedit and after such a manner as to satisfi itself concern everi particular difficulti which may aris when i am at a loss to know the effect of one bodi upon anoth in ani situat i need onli put them in that situat and observ what result from it but should i endeavor to clear up after the same manner ani doubt in moral philosophi by place myself in the same case with that which i consid it is evid thi reflect and premedit would so disturb the oper of my natur principl as must render it imposs to form ani just conclus from the phenomenon we must therefor glean up our experi in thi scienc from a cautiou observ of human life and take them as they appear in the common cours of the world by men behavior in compani in affair and in their pleasur where experi of thi kind are judici collect and compar we may hope to establish on them a scienc which will not be inferior in certainti and will be much superior in util to ani other of human comprehens a treatis of human natur book i of the understand part i of idea their origin composit connect abstract etc sect i of the origin of our idea all the percept of the human mind resolv themselv into two distinct kind which i shall call impress and idea the differ betwixt these consist in the degre of forc and liveli with which they strike upon the mind and make their way into our thought or conscious those percept which enter with most forc and violenc we may name impress and under thi name i comprehend all our sensat passion and emot as they make their first appear in the soul by idea i mean the faint imag of these in think and reason such as for instanc are all the percept excit by the present discours except onli those which aris from the sight and touch and except the immedi pleasur or uneasi it may occas i believ it will not be veri necessari to employ mani word in explain thi distinct everi one of himself will readili perceiv the differ betwixt feel and think the common degre of these are easili distinguish though it is not imposs but in particular instanc they may veri nearli approach to each other thu in sleep in a fever in mad or in ani veri violent emot of soul our idea may approach to our impress as on the other hand it sometim happen that the impress are so faint and low that we can not distinguish them from our idea but notwithstand thi near resembl in a few instanc they are in gener so veri differ that noon can make a scrupl to rank them under distinct head and assign to each a peculiar name to mark the differ i here make use of these term impress and idea in a sens differ from what is usual and i hope thi liberti will be allow me perhap i rather restor the word idea to it origin sens from which mr lock had pervert it in make it stand for all our percept by the term of impress i would not be understood to express the manner in which our live percept are produc in the soul but mere the percept themselv for which there is no particular name either in the english or ani other languag that i know of there is anoth divis of our percept which it will be conveni to observ and which extend itself both to our impress and idea thi divis is into simpl and complex simpl percept or impress and idea are such as admit of no distinct nor separ the complex are the contrari to these and may be distinguish into part though a particular color tast and smell are qualiti all unit togeth in thi appl it is easi to perceiv they are not the same but are at least distinguish from each other have by these divis given an order and arrang to our object we may now appli ourselv to consid with the more accuraci their qualiti and relat the first circumst that strike my eye is the great resembl betwixt our impress and idea in everi other particular except their degre of forc and vivac the one seem to be in a manner the reflect of the other so that all the percept of the mind are doubl and appear both as impress and idea when i shut my eye and think of my chamber the idea i form are exact represent of the impress i felt nor is there ani circumst of the one which is not to be found in the other in run over my other percept i find still the same resembl and represent idea and impress appear alway to correspond to each other thi circumst seem to me remark and engag my attent for a moment upon a more accur survey i find i have been carri away too far by the first appear and that i must make use of the distinct of percept into simpl and complex to limit thi gener decis that all our idea and impress are resembl i observ that mani of our complex idea never had impress that correspond to them and that mani of our complex impress never are exactli copi in idea i can imagin to myself such a citi as the new jerusalem whose pavement is gold and wall are rubi though i never saw ani such i have seen pari but shall i affirm i can form such an idea of that citi as will perfectli repres all it street and hous in their real and just proport i perceiv therefor that though there is in gener a great resembl betwixt our complex impress and idea yet the rule is not univers true that they are exact copi of each other we may next consid how the case stand with our simpl percept after the most accur examin of which i am capabl i ventur to affirm that the rule here hold without ani except and that everi simpl idea ha a simpl impress which resembl it and everi simpl impress a correspond idea that idea of red which we form in the dark and that impress which strike our eye in sunshin differ onli in degre not in natur that the case is the same with all our simpl impress and idea it is imposs to prove by a particular enumer of them everi one may satisfi himself in thi point by run over as mani as he pleas but if ani one should deni thi univers resembl i know no way of convinc him but by desir him to show a simpl impress that ha not a correspond idea or a simpl idea that ha not a correspond impress if he doe not answer thi challeng as it is certain he can not we may from hi silenc and our own observ establish our conclus thu we find that all simpl idea and impress resembl each other and as the complex are form from them we may affirm in gener that these two speci of percept are exactli correspond have discov thi relat which requir no farther examin i am curiou to find some other of their qualiti let us consid how they stand with regard to their exist and which of the impress and idea are caus and which effect the full examin of thi question is the subject of the present treatis and therefor we shall here content ourselv with establish one gener proposit that all our simpl idea in their first appear are deriv from simpl impress which are correspond to them and which they exactli repres in seek for phenomenon to prove thi proposit i find onli those of two kind but in each kind the phenomenon are obviou numer and conclus i first make myself certain by a new review of what i have alreadi assert that everi simpl impress is attend with a correspond idea and everi simpl idea with a correspond impress from thi constant conjunct of resembl percept i immedi conclud that there is a great connect betwixt our correspond impress and idea and that the exist of the one ha a consider influenc upon that of the other such a constant conjunct in such an infinit number of instanc can never aris from chanc but clearli prove a depend of the impress on the idea or of the idea on the impress that i may know on which side thi depend lie i consid the order of their first appear and find by constant experi that the simpl impress alway take the preced of their correspond idea but never appear in the contrari order to give a child an idea of scarlet or orang of sweet or bitter i present the object or in other word convey to him these impress but proceed not so absurdli as to endeavor to produc the impress by excit the idea our idea upon their appear produc not their correspond impress nor do we perceiv ani color or feel ani sensat mere upon think of them on the other hand we find that ani impress either of the mind or bodi is constantli follow by an idea which resembl it and and is onli differ in the degre of forc and liveli the constant conjunct of our resembl percept is a convinc proof that the one are the caus of the other and thi prioriti of the impress is an equal proof that our impress are the caus of our idea not our idea of our impress to confirm thi i consid anoth plain and convinc phenomenon which is that wherev by ani accid the faculti which give rise to ani impress are obstruct in their oper as when one is born blind or deaf not onli the impress are lost but also their correspond idea so that there never appear in the mind the least trace of either of them nor is thi onli true where the organ of sensat are entir destroy but likewis where they have never been put in action to produc a particular impress we can not form to ourselv a just idea of the tast of a pineappl without have actual tast it there is howev one contradictori phenomenon which may prove that it is not absolut imposs for idea to go befor their correspond impress i believ it will readili be allow that the sever distinct idea of color which enter by the eye or those of sound which are convey by the hear are realli differ from each other though at the same time resembl now if thi be true of differ color it must be no less so of the differ shade of the same color that each of them produc a distinct idea independ of the rest for if thi should be deni it is possibl by the continu gradat of shade to run a color insens into what is most remot from it and if you will not allow ani of the mean to be differ you can not without absurd deni the extrem to be the same suppos therefor a person to have enjoy hi sight for thirti year and to have becom perfectli well acquaint with color of all kind except one particular shade of blue for instanc which it never ha been hi fortun to meet with let all the differ shade of that color except that singl one be place befor him descend gradual from the deepest to the lightest it is plain that he will perceiv a blank where that shade is want and will be sensibl that there is a greater distanc in that place betwixt the contigu color than in ani other now i ask whether it is possibl for him from hi own imagin to suppli thi defici and rais up to himself the idea of that particular shade though it had never been convey to him by hi sens i believ there are few but will be of opinion that he can and thi may serv as a proof that the simpl idea are not alway deriv from the correspond impress though the instanc is so particular and singular that it is scarc worth our observ and doe not merit that for it alon we should alter our gener maxim but besid thi except it may not be amiss to remark on thi head that the principl of the prioriti of impress to idea must be understood with anoth limit viz that as our idea are imag of our impress so we can form secondari idea which are imag of the primari as appear from thi veri reason concern them thi is not properli speak an except to the rule so much as an explan of it idea produc the imag of themselv in new idea but as the first idea are suppos to be deriv from impress it still remain true that all our simpl idea proceed either mediat or immedi from their correspond impress thi then is the first principl i establish in the scienc of human natur nor ought we to despis it becaus of the simplic of it appear for it is remark that the present question concern the preced of our impress or idea is the same with what ha made so much nois in other term when it ha been disput whether there be ani innat idea or whether all idea be deriv from sensat and reflect we may observ that in order to prove the idea of extens and color not to be innat philosoph do noth but show that they are convey by our sens to prove the idea of passion and desir not to be innat they observ that we have a preced experi of these emot in ourselv now if we care examin these argument we shall find that they prove noth but that idea are preced by other more live percept from which they are deriv and which they repres i hope thi clear state of the question will remov all disput concern it and will render thi principl of more use in our reason than it seem hitherto to have been sect ii divis of the subject sinc it appear that our simpl impress are prior to their correspond idea and that the except are veri rare method seem to requir we should examin our impress befor we consid our idea impress may be divid into two kind those of sensat and those of reflect the first kind aris in the soul origin from unknown caus the second is deriv in a great measur from our idea and that in the follow order an impress first strike upon the sens and make us perceiv heat or cold thirst or hunger pleasur or pain of some kind or other of thi impress there is a copi taken by the mind which remain after the impress ceas and thi we call an idea thi idea of pleasur or pain when it return upon the soul produc the new impress of desir and avers hope and fear which may properli be call impress of reflect becaus deriv from it these again are copi by the memori and imagin and becom idea which perhap in their turn give rise to other impress and idea so that the impress of reflect are onli anteced to their correspond idea but posterior to those of sensat and deriv from them the examin of our sensat belong more to anatomist and natur philosoph than to moral and therefor shall not at present be enter upon and as the impress of reflect viz passion desir and emot which princip deserv our attent aris mostli from idea twill be necessari to revers that method which at first sight seem most natur and in order to explain the natur and principl of the human mind give a particular account of idea befor we proceed to impress for thi reason i have here chosen to begin with idea sect iii of the idea of the memori and imagin we find by experi that when ani impress ha been present with the mind it again make it appear there as an idea and thi it may do after two differ way either when in it new appear it retain a consider degre of it first vivac and is somewhat intermedi betwixt an impress and an idea or when it entir lose that vivac and is a perfect idea the faculti by which we repeat our impress in the first manner is call the memori and the other the imagin it is evid at first sight that the idea of the memori are much more live and strong than those of the imagin and that the former faculti paint it object in more distinct color than ani which are employ by the latter when we rememb ani past event the idea of it flow in upon the mind in a forcibl manner wherea in the imagin the percept is faint and languid and can not without difficulti be preserv by the mind steadi and uniform for ani consider time here then is sensibl differ betwixt one speci of idea and anoth but of thi more fulli hereaft part iii sect there is anoth differ betwixt these two kind of idea which is no less evid name that though neither the idea of the memori nor imagin neither the live nor faint idea can make their appear in the mind unless their correspond impress have gone befor to prepar the way for them yet the imagin is not restrain to the same order and form with the origin impress while the memori is in a manner tie down in that respect without ani power of variat it is evid that the memori preserv the origin form in which it object were present and that wherev we depart from it in recollect ani thing it proce from some defect or imperfect in that faculti an historian may perhap for the more conveni carri on of hi narrat relat an event befor anoth to which it wa in fact posterior but then he take notic of thi disord if he be exact and by that mean replac the idea in it due posit it is the same case in our recollect of those place and person with which we were formerli acquaint the chief exercis of the memori is not to preserv the simpl idea but their order and posit in short thi principl is support by such a number of common and vulgar phenomenon that we may spare ourselv the troubl of insist on it ani farther the same evid follow us in our sacond principl of the liberti of the imagin to transpos and chang it idea the fabl we meet with in poem and romanc put thi entir out of question natur there is total confound and noth mention but wing hors fieri dragon and monstrou giant nor will thi liberti of the fanci appear strang when we consid that all our idea are copi from our impress and that there are not ani two impress which are perfectli insepar not to mention that thi is an evid consequ of the divis of idea into simpl and complex wherev the imagin perceiv a differ among idea it can easili produc a separ sect iv of the connect or associ of idea as all simpl idea may be separ by the imagin and may be unit again in what form it pleas noth would be more unaccount than the oper of that faculti were it not guid by some univers principl which render it in some measur uniform with itself in all time and place were idea entir loos and unconnect chanc alon would join them and it is imposs the same simpl idea should fall regularli into complex one as they commonli do without some bond of union among them some associ qualiti by which one idea natur introduc anoth thi unit principl among idea is not to be consid as an insepar connect for that ha been alreadi exclud from the imagin nor yet are we to conclud that without it the mind can not join two idea for noth is more free than that faculti but we are onli to regard it as a gentl forc which commonli prevail and is the caus whi among other thing languag so nearli correspond to each other natur in a manner point out to everi one those simpl idea which are most proper to be unit into a complex one the qualiti from which thi associ aris and by which the mind is after thi manner convey from one idea to anoth are three viz resembl contigu in time or place and caus and effect i believ it will not be veri necessari to prove that these qualiti produc an associ among idea and upon the appear of one idea natur introduc anoth it is plain that in the cours of our think and in the constant revolut of our idea our imagin run easili from one idea to ani other that resembl it and that thi qualiti alon is to the fanci a suffici bond and associ it is likewis evid that as the sens in chang their object are necessit to chang them regularli and take them as they lie contigu to each other the imagin must by long custom acquir the same method of think and run along the part of space and time in conceiv it object as to the connect that is made by the relat of caus and effect we shall have occas afterward to examin it to the bottom and therefor shall not at present insist upon it it is suffici to observ that there is no relat which produc a stronger connect in the fanci and make one idea more readili recal anoth than the relat of caus and effect betwixt their object that we may understand the full extent of these relat we must consid that two object are connect togeth in the imagin not onli when the one is immedi resembl contigu to or the caus of the other but also when there is interpos betwixt them a third object which bear to both of them ani of these relat thi may be carri on to a great length though at the same time we may observ that each remov consider weaken the relat cousin in the fourth degre are connect by causat if i may be allow to use that term but not so close as brother much less as child and parent in gener we may observ that all the relat of blood depend upon caus and effect and are esteem near or remot accord to the number of connect caus interpos betwixt the person of the three relat abovement thi of causat is the most extens two object may be consid as place in thi relat as well when one is the caus of ani of the action or motion of the other as when the former is the caus of the exist of the latter for as that action or motion is noth but the object itself consid in a certain light and as the object continu the same in all it differ situat it is easi to imagin how such an influenc of object upon one anoth may connect them in the imagin we may carri thi farther and remark not onli that two object are connect by the relat of caus and effect when the one produc a motion or ani action in the other but also when it ha a power of produc it and thi we may observ to be the sourc of all the relat of interest and duti by which men influenc each other in societi and are place in the tie of govern and subordin a master is suchaon as by hi situat aris either from forc or agreement ha a power of direct in certain particular the action of anoth whom we call servant a judg is one who in all disput case can fix by hi opinion the possess or properti of ani thing betwixt ani member of the societi when a person is possess of ani power there is no more requir to convert it into action but the exert of the will and that in everi case is consid as possibl and in mani as probabl especi in the case of author where the obedi of the subject is a pleasur and advantag to the superior these are therefor the principl of union or cohes among our simpl idea and in the imagin suppli the place of that insepar connect by which they are unit in our memori here is a kind of attract which in the mental world will be found to have as extraordinari effect as in the natur and to show itself in as mani and as variou form it effect are everi where conspicu but as to it caus they are mostli unknown and must be resolv into origin qualiti of human natur which i pretend not to explain noth is more requisit for a true philosoph than to restrain the intemper desir of search into caus and have establish ani doctrin upon a suffici number of experi rest content with that when he see a farther examin would lead him into obscur and uncertain specul in that case hi enquiri would be much better employ in examin the effect than the caus of hi principl amongst the effect of thi union or associ of idea there are none more remark than those complex idea which are the common subject of our thought and reason and gener aris from some principl of union among our simpl idea these complex idea may be divid into relat mode and substanc we shall briefli examin each of these in order and shall subjoin some consider concern our gener and particular idea befor we leav the present subject which may be consid as the element of thi philosophi sect v of relat the word relat is commonli use in two sens consider differ from each other either for that qualiti by which two idea are connect togeth in the imagin and the one natur introduc the other after the manner aboveexplain or for that particular circumst in which even upon the arbitrari union of two idea in the fanci we may think proper to compar them in common languag the former is alway the sens in which we use the word relat and it is onli in philosophi that we extend it to mean ani particular subject of comparison without a connect principl thu distanc will be allow by philosoph to be a true relat becaus we acquir an idea of it by the compar of object but in a common way we say that noth can be more distant than such or such thing from each other noth can have less relat as if distanc and relat were incompat it may perhap be esteem an endless task to enumer all those qualiti which make object admit of comparison and by which the idea of philosoph relat are produc but if we dilig consid them we shall find that without difficulti they may be compris under seven gener head which may be consid as the sourc of all philosoph relat the first is resembl and thi is a relat without which no philosoph relat can exist sinc no object will admit of comparison but what have some degre of resembl but though resembl be necessari to all philosoph relat it doe not follow that it alway produc a connect or associ of idea when a qualiti becom veri gener and is common to a great mani individu it lead not the mind directli to ani one of them but by present at onc too great a choic doe therebi prevent the imagin from fix on ani singl object ident may be esteem a second speci of relat thi relat i here consid as appli in it strictest sens to constant and unchang object without examin the natur and foundat of person ident which shall find it place afterward of all relat the most univers is that of ident be common to everi be whose exist ha ani durat after ident the most univers and comprehens relat are those of space and time which are the sourc of an infinit number of comparison such as distant contigu abov below befor after etc all those object which admit of quantiti or number may be compar in that particular which is anoth veri fertil sourc of relat when ani two object possess the same qualiti in common the degre in which they possess it form a fifth speci of relat thu of two object which are both heavi the one may be either of greater or less weight than with the other two color that are of the same kind may yet be of differ shade and in that respect admit of comparison the relat of contrarieti may at first sight be regard as an except to the rule that no relat of ani kind can subsist without some degre of resembl but let us consid that no two idea are in themselv contrari except those of exist and nonexist which are plainli resembl as impli both of them an idea of the object though the latter exclud the object from all time and place in which it is suppos not to exist all other object such as fire and water heat and cold are onli found to be contrari from experi and from the contrarieti of their caus or effect which relat of caus and effect is a seventh philosoph relat as well as a natur one the resembl impli in thi relat shall be explain afterward it might natur be expect that i should join differ to the other relat but that i consid rather as a negat of relat than as ani thing real or posit differ is of two kind as oppos either to ident or resembl the first is call a differ of number the other of kind sect vi of mode and substanc i would fain ask those philosoph who found so much of their reason on the distinct of substanc and accid and imagin we have clear idea of each whether the idea of substanc be deriv from the impress of sensat of reflect if it be convey to us by our sens i ask which of them and after what manner if it be perceiv by the eye it must be a color if by the ear a sound if by the palat a tast and so of the other sens but i believ none will assert that substanc is either a color or sound or a tast the idea of substanc must therefor be deriv from an impress of reflect if it realli exist but the impress of reflect reslov themselv into our passion and emot none of which can possibl repres a substanc we have therefor no idea of substanc distinct from that of a collect of particular qualiti nor have we ani other mean when we either talk or reason concern it the idea of a substanc as well as that of a mode is noth but a collect of simpl idea that are unit by the imagin and have a particular name assign them by which we are abl to recal either to ourselv or other that collect but the differ betwixt these idea consist in thi that the particular qualiti which form a substanc are commonli refer to an unknown someth in which they are suppos to inher or grant thi fiction should not take place are at least suppos to be close and insepar connect by the relat of contigu and causat the effect of thi is that whatev new simpl qualiti we discov to have the same connect with the rest we immedi comprehend it among them even though it did not enter into the first concept of the substanc thu our idea of gold may at first be a yellow color weight malleabl fusibl but upon the discoveri of it dissolubl in aqua regia we join that to the other qualiti and suppos it to belong to the substanc as much as if it idea had from the begin made a part of the compound one the principl of union be regard as the chief part of the complex idea give entranc to whatev qualiti afterward occur and is equal comprehend by it as are the other which first present themselv that thi can not take place in mode is evid from consid their natur the simpl idea of which mode are form either repres qualiti which are not unit by contigu and causat but are dispers in differ subject or if they be all unit togeth the unit principl is not regard as the foundat of the complex idea the idea of a danc is an instanc of the first kind of mode that of beauti of the second the reason is obviou whi such complex idea can not receiv ani new idea without chang the name which distinguish the mode sect vii of abstract idea a veri materi question ha been start concern abstract or gener idea whether they be gener or particular in the mind concept of them a dr berkeley great philosoph ha disput the receiv opinion in thi particular and ha assert that all gener idea are noth but particular one annex to a certain term which give them a more extens signif and make them recal upon occas other individu which are similar to them as i look upon thi to be one of the greatest and most valuabl discoveri that ha been made of late year in the republ of letter i shall here endeavor to confirm it by some argument which i hope will put it beyond all doubt and controversi it is evid that in form most of our gener idea if not all of them we abstract from everi particular degre of quantiti and qualiti and that an object ceas not to be of ani particular speci on account of everi small alter in it extens durat and other properti it may therefor be thought that here is a plain dilemma that decid concern the natur of those abstract idea which have afford so much specul to philosoph the abstract idea of a man repres men of all size and all qualiti which it is conclud it can not do but either by repres at onc all possibl size and all possibl qualiti or by repres no particular one at all now it have been esteem absurd to defend the former proposit as impli an infinit capac in the mind it ha been commonli infer in favor of the latter and our abstract idea have been suppos to repres no particular degre either of quantiti or qualiti but that thi infer is erron i shall endeavor to make appear first by prove that it is utterli imposs to conceiv ani quantiti or qualiti without form a precis notion of it degre and secondli by show that though the capac of the mind be not infinit yet we can at onc form a notion of all possibl degre of quantiti and qualiti in such a manner at least as howev imperfect may serv all the purpos of reflect and convers to begin with the first proposit that the mind can not form ani notion of quantiti or qualiti without form a precis notion of degre of each we may prove thi by the three follow argument first we have observ that whatev object are differ are distinguish and that whatev object are distinguish are separ by the thought and imagin and we may here add that these proposit are equal true in the invers and that whatev object are separ are also distinguish and that whatev object are distinguish are also differ for how is it possibl we can separ what is not distinguish or distinguish what is not differ in order therefor to know whether abstract impli a separ we need onli consid it in thi view and examin whether all the circumst which we abstract from in our gener idea be such as are distinguish and differ from those which we retain as essenti part of them but it is evid at first sight that the precis length of a line is not differ nor distinguish from the line itself nor the precis degre of ani qualiti from the qualiti these idea therefor admit no more of separ than they do of distinct and differ they are consequ conjoin with each other in the concept and the gener idea of a line notwithstand all our abstract and refin ha in it appear in the mind a precis degre of quantiti and qualiti howev it may be made to repres other which have differ degre of both secondli it is confess that no object can appear to the sens or in other word that no impress can becom present to the mind without be determin in it degre both of quantiti and qualiti the confus in which impress are sometim involv proce onli from their faint and unsteadi not from ani capac in the mind to receiv ani impress which in it real exist ha no particular degre nor proport that is a contradict in term and even impli the flattest of all contradict viz that it is possibl for the same thing both to be and not to be now sinc all idea are deriv from impress and are noth but copi and represent of them whatev is true of the one must be acknowledg concern the other impress and idea differ onli in their strength and vivac the forego conclus is not found on ani particular degre of vivac it can not therefor be affect by ani variat in that particular an idea is a weaker impress and as a strong impress must necessarili have a determin quantiti and qualiti the case must be the same with it copi or repres thirdli it is a principl gener receiv in philosophi that everi thing in natur is individu and that it is utterli absurd to suppos a triangl realli exist which ha no precis proport of side and angl if thi therefor be absurd in fact and realiti it must also be absurd in idea sinc noth of which we can form a clear and distinct idea is absurd and imposs but to form the idea of an object and to form an idea simpli is the same thing the refer of the idea to an object be an extran denomin of which in itself it bear no mark or charact now as it is imposs to form an idea of an object that is possess of quantiti and qualiti and yet is possess of no precis degre of either it follow that there is an equal imposs of form an idea that is not limit and confin in both these particular abstract idea are therefor in themselv individu howev they may becom gener in their represent the imag in the mind is onli that of a particular object though the applic of it in our reason be the same as if it were univers thi applic of idea beyond their natur proce from our collect all their possibl degre of quantiti and qualiti in such an imperfect manner as may serv the purpos of life which is the second proposit i propos to explain when we have found a resembl among sever object that often occur to us we appli the same name to all of them whatev differ we may observ in the degre of their quantiti and qualiti and whatev other differ may appear among them after we have acquir a custom of thi kind the hear of that name reviv the idea of one of these object and make the imagin conceiv it with all it particular circumst and proport but as the same word is suppos to have been frequent appli to other individu that are differ in mani respect from that idea which is immedi present to the mind the word not be abl to reviv the idea of all these individu but onli touch the soul if i may be allow so to speak and reviv that custom which we have acquir by survey them they are not realli and in fact present to the mind but onli in power nor do we draw them all out distinctli in the imagin but keep ourselv in a readi to survey ani of them as we may be prompt by a present design or necess the word rais up an individu idea along with a certain custom and that custom produc ani other individu one for which we may have occas but as the product of all the idea to which the name may be appli is in most case imposs we abridg that work by a more partial consider and find but few inconveni to aris in our reason from that abridg for thi is one of the most extraordinari circumst in the present affair that after the mind ha produc an individu idea upon which we reason the attend custom reviv by the gener or abstract term readili suggest ani other individu if by chanc we form ani reason that agre not with it thu should we mention the word triangl and form the idea of a particular equilater one to correspond to it and should we afterward assert that the three angl of a triangl are equal to each other the other individu of a scalenum and isocel which we overlook at first immedi crowd in upon us and make us perceiv the falsehood of thi proposit though it be true with relat to that idea which we had form if the mind suggest not alway these idea upon occas it proce from some imperfect in it faculti and such a one as is often the sourc of fals reason and sophistri but thi is princip the case with those idea which are abstrus and compound on other occas the custom is more entir and it is seldom we run into such error nay so entir is the custom that the veri same idea may be annex to sever differ word and may be employ in differ reason without ani danger of mistak thu the idea of an equilater triangl of an inch perpendicular may serv us in talk of a figur of a rectilin figur of a regular figur of a triangl and of an equilater triangl all these term therefor are in thi case attend with the same idea but as they are wont to be appli in a greater or lesser compass they excit their particular habit and therebi keep the mind in a readi to observ that no conclus be form contrari to ani idea which are usual compris under them befor those habit have becom entir perfect perhap the mind may not be content with form the idea of onli one individu but may run over sever in order to make itself comprehend it own mean and the compass of that collect which it intend to express by the gener term that we may fix the mean of the word figur we may revolv in our mind the idea of circl squar paralelogram triangl of differ size and proport and may not rest on one imag or idea howev thi may be it is certain that we form the idea of individu whenev we use ani gener term that we seldom or never can exhaust these individu and that those which remain are onli repres by mean of that habit by which we recal them whenev ani present occas requir it thi then is the natur of our abstract idea and gener term and it is after thi manner we account for the forego paradox that some idea are particular in their natur but gener in their represent a particular idea becom gener by be annex to a gener term that is to a term which from a customari conjunct ha a relat to mani other particular idea and readili recal them in the imagin the onli difficulti that can remain on thi subject must be with regard to that custom which so readili recal everi particular idea for which we may have occas and is excit by ani word or sound to which we commonli annex it the most proper method in my opinion of give a satisfactori explic of thi act of the mind is by produc other instanc which are analog to it and other principl which facilit it oper to explain the ultim caus of our mental action is imposs it is suffici if we can give ani satisfactori account of them from experi and analog first then i observ that when we mention ani great number such as a thousand the mind ha gener no adequ idea of it but onli a power of produc such an idea by it adequ idea of the decim under which the number is comprehend thi imperfect howev in our idea is never felt in our reason which seem to be an instanc parallel to the present one of univers idea secondli we have sever instanc of habit which may be reviv by one singl word as when a person who ha by rote ani period of a discours or ani number of vers will be put in remembr of the whole which he is at a loss to recollect by that singl word or express with which they begin thirdli i believ everi one who examin the situat of hi mind in reason will agre with me that we do not annex distinct and complet idea to everi term we make use of and that in talk of govern church negoti conquest we seldom spread out in our mind all the simpl idea of which these complex one are compos it is howev observ that notwithstand thi imperfect we may avoid talk nonsens on these subject and may perceiv ani repugn among the idea as well as if we had a full comprehens of them thu if instead of say that in war the weaker have alway recours to negoti we should say that they have alway recours to conquest the custom which we have acquir of attribut certain relat to idea still follow the word and make us immedi perceiv the absurd of that proposit in the same manner as one particular idea may serv us in reason concern other idea howev differ from it in sever circumst fourthli as the individu are collect togeth and place under a gener term with a view to that resembl which they bear to each other thi relat must facilit their entranc in the imagin and make them be suggest more readili upon occas and inde if we consid the common progress of the thought either in reflect or convers we shall find great reason to be satisfi in thi particular noth is more admir than the readi with which the imagin suggest it idea and present them at the veri instant in which they becom necessari or use the fanci run from one end of the univers to the other in collect those idea which belong to ani subject one would think the whole intellectu world of idea wa at onc subject to our view and that we did noth but pick out such as were most proper for our purpos there may not howev be ani present besid those veri idea that are thu collect by a kind of magic faculti in the soul which though it be alway most perfect in the greatest genius and is properli what we call a geniu is howev inexplic by the utmost effort of human understand perhap these four reflect may help to remov all difficulti to the hypothesi i have propos concern abstract idea so contrari to that which ha hitherto prevail in philosophi but to tell the truth i place my chief confid in what i have alreadi prove concern the imposs of gener idea accord to the common method of explain them we must certainli seek some new system on thi head and there plainli is none besid what i have propos if idea be particular in their natur and at the same time finit in their number it is onli by custom they can becom gener in their represent and contain an infinit number of other idea under them befor i leav thi subject i shall employ the same principl to explain that distinct of reason which is so much talk of and is so littl understood in the school of thi kind is the distinct betwixt figur and the bodi figur motion and the bodi move the difficulti of explain thi distinct aris from the principl abov explain that all idea which are differ are separ for it follow from thenc that if the figur be differ from the bodi their idea must be separ as well as distinguish if they be not differ their idea can neither be separ nor distinguish what then is meant by a distinct of reason sinc it impli neither a differ nor separ to remov thi difficulti we must have recours to the forego explic of abstract idea it is certain that the mind would never have dream of distinguish a figur from the bodi figur as be in realiti neither distinguish nor differ nor separ did it not observ that even in thi simplic there might be contain mani differ resembl and relat thu when a globe of white marbl is present we receiv onli the impress of a white color dispos in a certain form nor are we abl to separ and distinguish the color from the form but observ afterward a globe of black marbl and a cube of white and compar them with our former object we find two separ resembl in what formerli seem and realli is perfectli insepar after a littl more practic of thi kind we begin to distinguish the figur from the color by a distinct of reason that is we consid the figur and color togeth sinc they are in effect the same and undistinguish but still view them in differ aspect accord to the resembl of which they are suscept when we would consid onli the figur of the globe of white marbl we form in realiti an idea both of the figur and color but tacitli carri our eye to it resembl with the globe of black marbl and in the same manner when we would consid it color onli we turn our view to it resembl with the cube of white marbl by thi mean we accompani our idea with a kind of reflect of which custom render us in a great measur insens a person who desir us to consid the figur of a globe of white marbl without think on it color desir an imposs but hi mean is that we should consid the color and figur togeth but still keep in our eye the resembl to the globe of black marbl or that to ani other globe of whatev color or substanc part ii of the idea of space and time sect i of the infinit divis of our idea of space and time whatev ha the air of a paradox and is contrari to the first and most unprejud notion of mankind is often greedili embrac by philosoph as show the superior of their scienc which could discov opinion so remot from vulgar concept on the other hand ani thing propos to us which caus surpris and admir give such a satisfact to the mind that it indulg itself in those agreeabl emot and will never be persuad that it pleasur is entir without foundat from these disposit in philosoph and their discipl aris that mutual complais betwixt them while the former furnish such plenti of strang and unaccount opinion and the latter so readili believ them of thi mutual complais i can not give a more evid instanc than in the doctrin of infinit divis with the examin of which i shall begin thi subject of the idea of space and time it is univers allow that the capac of the mind is limit and can never attain a full and adequ concept of infin and though it were not allow twoud be suffici evid from the plainest observ and experi it is also obviou that whatev is capabl of be divid in infinitum must consist of an infinit number of part and that it is imposs to set ani bound to the number of part without set bound at the same time to the divis it requir scarc ani induct to conclud from henc that the idea which we form of ani finit qualiti is not infinit divis but that by proper distinct and separ we may run up thi idea to inferior one which will be perfectli simpl and indivis in reject the infinit capac of the mind we suppos it may arriv at an end in the divis of it idea nor are there ani possibl mean of evad the evid of thi conclus it is therefor certain that the imagin reach a minimum and may rais up to itself an idea of which it can not conceiv ani subdivis and which can not be diminish without a total annihil when you tell me of the thousandth and ten thousandth part of a grain of sand i have a distinct idea of these number and of their differ proport but the imag which i form in my mind to repres the thing themselv are noth differ from each other nor inferior to that imag by which i repres the grain of sand itself which is suppos so vastli to exceed them what consist of part is distinguish into them and what is distinguish is separ but whatev we may imagin of the thing the idea of a grain of sand is not distinguish nor separ into twenti much less into a thousand ten thousand or an infinit number of differ idea it is the same case with the impress of the sens as with the idea of the imagin put a spot of ink upon paper fix your eye upon that spot and retir to such a distanc that at last you lose sight of it it is plain that the moment befor it vanish the imag or impress wa perfectli indivis it is not for want of ray of light strike on our eye that the minut part of distant bodi convey not ani sensibl impress but becaus they are remov beyond that distanc at which their impress were reduc to a minimum and were incap of ani farther diminut a microscop or telescop which render them visibl produc not ani new ray of light but onli spread those which alway flow from them and by that mean both give part to impress which to the nake eye appear simpl and uncompound and advanc to a minimum what wa formerli impercept we may henc discov the error of the common opinion that the capac of the mind is limit on both side and that it is imposs for the imagin to form an adequ idea of what goe beyond a certain degre of minut as well as of great noth can be more minut than some idea which we form in the fanci and imag which appear to the sens sinc there are idea and imag perfectli simpl and indivis the onli defect of our sens is that they give us disproport imag of thing and repres as minut and uncompound what is realli great and compos of a vast number of part thi mistak we are not sensibl of but take the impress of those minut object which appear to the sens to be equal or nearli equal to the object and find by reason that there are other object vastli more minut we too hastili conclud that these are inferior to ani idea of our imagin or impress of our sens thi howev is certain that we can form idea which shall be no greater than the smallest atom of the anim spirit of an insect a thousand time less than a mite and we ought rather to conclud that the difficulti lie in enlarg our concept so much as to form a just notion of a mite or even of an insect a thousand time less than a mite for in order to form a just notion of these anim we must have a distinct idea repres everi part of them which accord to the system of infinit divis is utterli imposs and accord to that of indivis part or atom is extrem difficult by reason of the vast number and multipl of these part sect ii of the infinit divis of space and time wherev idea are adequ represent of object the relat contradict and agreement of the idea are all applic to the object and thi we may in gener observ to be the foundat of all human knowledg but our idea are adequ represent of the most minut partsof extens and through whatev divis and subdivis we may suppos these part to be arriv at they can never becom inferior to some idea which we form the plain consequ is that whatev appear imposs and contradictori upon the comparison of these idea must be realli imposs and contradictori without ani farther excus or evas everi thing capabl of be infinit divid contain an infinit number of part otherwis the divis would be stop short by the indivis part which we should immedi arriv at if therefor ani finit extens be infinit divis it can be no contradict to suppos that a finit extens contain an infinit number of part and vice versa if it be a contradict to suppos that a finit extens contain an infinit number of part no finit extens can be infinit divis but that thi latter supposit is absurd i easili convinc myself by the consider of my clear idea i first take the least idea i can form of a part of extens and be certain that there is noth more minut than thi idea i conclud that whatev i discov by it mean must be a real qualiti of extens i then repeat thi idea onc twice thrice etc and find the compound idea of extens aris from it repetit alway to augment and becom doubl tripl quadrupl etc till at last it swell up to a consider bulk greater or smaller in proport as i repeat more or less the same idea when i stop in the addit of part the idea of extens ceas to augment and were i to carri on the addit in infinitum i clearli perceiv that the idea of extens must also becom infinit upon the whole i conclud that the idea of an infinit number of part is individu the same idea with that of an infinit extens that no finit extens is capabl of contain an infinit number of part and consequ that no finit extens is infinit divis it ha been object to me that infinit divis suppos onli an infinit number of proport not of aliquot part and that an infinit number of proport part doe not form an infinit extens but thi distinct is entir frivol whether these part be call aliquot or proport they can not be inferior to those minut part we conceiv and therefor can not form a less extens by their conjunct i may subjoin anoth argument propos by a note author mon malez which seem to me veri strong and beauti it is evid that exist in itself belong onli to uniti and is never applic to number but on account of the unit of which the number is compos twenti men may be said to exist but it is onli becaus one two three four etc are exist and if you deni the exist of the latter that of the former fall of cours it is therefor utterli absurd to suppos ani number to exist and yet deni the exist of unit and as extens is alway a number accord to the common sentiment of metaphysician and never resolv itself into ani unit or indivis quantiti it follow that extens can never at all exist it is in vain to repli that ani determin quantiti of extens is an unit but suchaon as admit of an infinit number of fraction and is inexhaust in it subdivis for by the same rule these twenti men may be consid as an unit the whole globe of the earth nay the whole univers may be consid as an unit that term of uniti is mere a fictiti denomin which the mind may appli to ani quantiti of object it collect togeth nor can such an uniti ani more exist alon than number can as be in realiti a true number but the uniti which can exist alon and whose exist is necessari to that of all number is of anoth kind and must be perfectli indivis and incap of be resolv into ani lesser uniti all thi reason take place with regard to time along with an addit argument which it may be proper to take notic of it is a properti insepar from time and which in a manner constitut it essenc that each of it part succe anoth and that none of them howev contigu can ever be coexist for the same reason that the year can not concur with the present year everi moment must be distinct from and posterior or anteced to anoth it is certain then that time as it exist must be compos of indivis moment for if in time we could never arriv at an end of divis and if each moment as it succe anoth were not perfectli singl and indivis there would be an infinit number of coexist moment or part of time which i believ will be allow to be an arrant contradict the infinit divis of space impli that of time as is evid from the natur of motion if the latter therefor be imposs the former must be equal
