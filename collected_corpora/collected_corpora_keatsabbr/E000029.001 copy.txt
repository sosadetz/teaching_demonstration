conclud introduct field third great novel ha been the subject of much more discord judgment than either of it forerunn if we take the period sinc it appear as cover four gener we find the greatest author in the earliest johnson speak of it with someth more nearli approach to enthusiasm than he allow himself in refer to ani other work of an author to whom he wa on the whole so unjust the greatest man of letter of the next gener scott whose attitud to field wa rather undecid and seem to speak a mixtur of intellectu admir and moral dislik or at least failur in sympathi pronounc it on the whole unpleas and regard it chiefli as a sequel to tom jone show what is to be expect of a libertin and thoughtless husband but he too is enthusiast over the heroin thackeray whom in thi special connect at ani rate it is scarc too much to call the greatest man of the third gener overflow with predilect for it but chiefli as it would seem becaus of hi affect for amelia herself in which he practic agre with scott and johnson it would be invidi and is noway need to singl out ani critic of our own time to place besid these great men but it can not be deni that the book now as alway ha incur a consider amount of hint fault and hesit dislik even mr dobson note some thing in it as unsatisfactori mr goss with evid conscious of temer ventur to ask whether it is not a littl dull the veri absenc of episod on the ground that miss matthewss stori is too close connect with the main action to be fairli call an episod and of introductori dissert ha been brought against it as the presenc of these thing wa brought against it forerunn i have sometim wonder whether amelia pay the penalti of an audac which a priori it most unfavour critic would indignantli deni to be a fault it begin instead of end with the marriagebel and though critic after critic of novel ha exhaust hi indign and hi satir over the folli of insist on these as a final i doubt whether the demand is not too deepli root in the english nay in the human mind to be safe neglect the essenc of all romanc is a quest the quest most perenni and univers interest to man is the quest of a wife or a mistress and the chapter deal with what come later have an inevit flavour of tame and of the day after the feast it is not common nowaday to meet anybodi who think tommi moor a great poet one ha to encount either a suspicion of philistin or a suspicion of paradox if one tri to vindic for him even hi due place in the poetic hierarchi yet i suspect that no poet ever put into word a more univers critic of life than he did when he wrote i saw from the beach with it moral of— give me back give me back the wild fresh of morning—h smile and her tear are worth even best light if we discard thi fallaci boldli and ask ourselv whether amelia is or is not as good as joseph andrew or tom jone we shall i think be inclin to answer rather in the affirm than in the neg it is perhap a littl more easi to find fault with it charact than with their or rather though no one of these charact ha the defect of blifil or of allworthi it is easi to say that no one of them ha the charm of the best personag of the earlier book the idolat of amelia would of cours exclaim at thi sentenc as it regard that amiabl ladi and i am myself by no mean dispos to rank amiabl low in the scale of thing excel in woman but though she is by no mean what her namesak and spiritu granddaught miss sedley must i fear be pronounc to be an amiabl fool there is realli too much of the milk of human kind unrefresh and unreliev of it mawkish by the rum or whiski of human frailti in her one could have better pardon her forgiv of her husband if she had in the first place been a littl more consciou of what there wa to forgiv and in the second a littl more romant in her attach to him as it is he wa son homm he wa handsom he had broad shoulder he had a sweet temper he wa the father of her children and that wa enough at least we are allow to see in mr booth no qualiti other than these and in her no imagin even of ani other qualiti to put what i mean out of reach of cavil compar imogen and amelia and the differ will be felt but field wa a prose writer write in london in the eighteenth centuri while shakespear wa a poet write in all time and all space so that the comparison is lumin in more way than one i do not think that in the special scheme which the novelist set himself here he can be accus of ani failur the life is as vivid as ever the minor sketch may be even call a littl more vivid dr harrison is not perfect i do not mean that he ha ethic fault for that is a merit not a defect but he is not quit perfect in art hi altern persecut and patronag of booth though use to the stori repeat the earlier fault of allworthi and are someth of a blot but he is individu much more natur than allworthi and inde is someth like what dr johnson would have been if he had been rather better bred less crotcheti and bless with more health miss matthew in her earlier scene ha touch of great which a thousand french novelist lavish candour and reckless of exagger have not equal and i believ that field kept her at a distanc dure the later scene of the stori becaus he could not trust himself not to make her more interest than amelia of the peer more wick and less wick there is inde not much good to be said the peer of the eighteenthcenturi writer even when as in field case there wa no reason whi they should mention him with kor as policeman x ha it is almost alway a faint type of good or wicked dress out with star and ribbon and coachesandsix onli swift by combin of experi and geniu ha given us live lord in lord sparkish and lord smart but mr ellison and mr atkinson are veri women and the serjeant though the touch of sensibl is on him is excel and dr harrison countri friend and hi prig of a son are capit and bondum and the author and robinson and all the minor charact are as good as they can be it is howev usual to detect a lack of vivac in the book an evid of declin health and year it may be so it is at least certain that field dure the composit of amelia had much less time to bestow upon elabor hi work than he had previous had and that hi health wa break but are we perfectli sure that if the chronolog order had been differ we should have pronounc the same verdict had amelia come between joseph and tom how mani of us might have commit ourselv to some such sentenc as thi in amelia we see the youth exuber of joseph andrew correct by a higher art the adjust of plot and charact arrang with a fuller craftsmanship the geniu which wa to find it fullest exemplif in tom jone alreadi display matur and do we not too often forget that a veri short time—in fact bare three years—pass between the appear of tom jone and the appear of amelia that although we do not know how long the earlier work had been in prepar it is extrem improb that a man of field tempera of hi want of hi known habit and histori would have kept it when onc finish long in hi desk and that consequ between some scene of tom jone and some scene of amelia it is not improb that there wa no more than a few month interv i do not urg these thing in mitig of ani unfavour judgment against the later novel i onli ask—how much of that unfavour judgment ought in justic to be set down to the fallaci connect with an imperfect appreci of fact to me it is not so much a question of decid whether i like amelia less and if so how much less than the other as a question what part of the gener concept of thi great writer it suppli i do not think that we could fulli understand field without it i do not think that we could deriv the full quantiti of pleasur from him without it the exuber romant faculti of joseph andrew and it pleasant satir the mighti craftsmanship and the vast scienc of life of tom jone the ineff ironi and logic grasp of jonathan wild might have left us with a slight sens of hard a vagu desir for unction if it had not been for thi complet of the pictur we should not have known for in the other book with the possibl except of mr fitzpatrick the charact are a littl too determin goat and sheep how field could draw nuanc how he could project a mix personag on the screen if we had not had miss matthew and mr atkinson—th last especi a figur full of the finest stroke and as a rule insuffici done justic to by critic and i have purpos left to the last a group of personag about whom inde there ha been littl question but who are among the triumph of field art—th two colonel and their connectinglink the wife of the one and the sister of the other colonel bath ha necessarili unit all suffrag he is of cours a veri littl stagey he remind us that hi author had had a long theatric apprenticeship he is someth too much dune piec but as a studi of the brave man who is almost more braggart than brave of the gener man who will sacrific not onli generos but bare justic to a hogo of honour he is admir and up to hi time almost uniqu ordinari writer and ordinari reader have never been quit content to admit that braveri and braggadocio can go togeth that the man of honour may be a selfish pedant peopl have been unwil to tell and to hear the whole truth even about wolf and nelson who were both favour specimen of the type but field the infal saw that type in it quidditi and knew it and regist it for ever less amus but more delic faith and true are colonel jame and hi wife they are both veri good sort of peopl in a way who live in a lax and frivol age who have plenti of money no particular principl no strong affect for each other and littl individu charact they might have been—mr jame to some extent is—quit estim and harmless but even as it is they are not to be wholli ill spoken of be what they are field ha taken them and with a relentless which swift could hardli have exceed and a goodnatur which swift rare or never attain ha held them up to us as dissect prepar of halfinnoc mean scoundrel and vaniti such as are hardli anywher els to be found i have use the word prepar and it in part indic field virtu a virtu shown i think in thi book as much as anywher but it doe not fulli

chapter i — contain the exordium c the variou accid which befel a veri worthi coupl after their unit in the state of matrimoni will be the subject of the follow histori the distress which they wade through were some of them so exquisit and the incid which produc these so extraordinari that they seem to requir not onli the utmost malic but the utmost invent which superstit hath ever attribut to fortun though whether ani such be interf in the case or inde whether there be ani such be in the univers is a matter which i by no mean presum to determin in the affirm to speak a bold truth i am after much matur deliber inclin to suspect that the public voic hath in all age done much injustic to fortun and hath convict her of mani fact in which she had not the least concern i question much whether we may not by natur mean account for the success of knave the calam of fool with all the miseri in which men of sens sometim involv themselv by quit the direct of prudenc and follow the blind guidanc of a predomin passion in short for all the ordinari phenomena which are imput to fortun whom perhap men accus with no less absurd in life than a bad player complain of ill luck at the game of chess but if men are sometim guilti of lay improp blame on thi imaginari be they are altogeth as apt to make her amend by ascrib to her honour which she as littl deserv to retriev the ill consequ of a foolish conduct and by struggl man with distress to subdu it is one of the noblest effort of wisdom and virtu whoever therefor call such a man fortun is guilti of no less improprieti in speech than he would be who should call the statuari or the poet fortun who carv a venu or who writ an iliad life may as properli be call an art as ani other and the great incid in it are no more to be consid as mere accid than the sever member of a fine statu or a nobl poem the critic in all these are not content with see anyth to be great without know whi and how it came to be so by examin care the sever gradat which conduc to bring everi model to perfect we learn truli to know that scienc in which the model is form as histori of thi kind therefor may properli be call model of human life so by observ minut the sever incid which tend to the catastroph or complet of the whole and the minut caus whenc those incid are produc we shall best be instruct in thi most use of all art which i call the art of life chapter ii — the histori set out observ on the excel of the english constitut and curiou examin befor a justic of peac on the first of april in the year —— the watchmen of a certain parish i know not particularli which within the liberti of westminst brought sever person whom they had apprehend the preced night befor jonathan thrasher esq one of the justic of the peac for that liberti but here reader befor we proceed to the trial of these offend we shall after our usual manner premis some thing which it may be necessari for thee to know it hath been observ i think by mani as well as the celebr writer of three letter that no human institut is capabl of consumm perfect an observ which perhap that writer at least gather from discov some defect in the politi even of thi wellregul nation and inde if there should be ani such defect in a constitut which my lord coke long ago told us the wisdom of all the wise men in the world if they had all met togeth at one time could not have equal which some of our wisest men who were met togeth long befor said wa too good to be alter in ani particular and which nevertheless hath been mend ever sinc by a veri great number of the said wise men if i say thi constitut should be imperfect we may be allow i think to doubt whether ani such faultless model can be found among the institut of men it will probabl be object that the small imperfect which i am about to produc do not lie in the law themselv but in the ill execut of them but with submiss thi appear to me to be no less an absurd than to say of ani machin that it is excel made though incap of perform it function good law should execut themselv in a wellregul state at least if the same legislatur which provid the law doth not provid for the execut of them they act as graham would do if he should form all the part of a clock in the most exquisit manner yet put them so togeth that the clock could not go in thi case sure we might say that there wa a small defect in the constitut of the clock to say the truth graham would soon see the fault and would easili remedi it the fault inde could be no other than that the part were improperli dispos perhap reader i have anoth illustr which will set my intent in still a clearer light befor you figur to yourself then a famili the master of which should dispos of the sever econom offic in the follow manner viz should put hi butler in the coachbox hi steward behind hi coach hi coachman in the butleri and hi footman in the stewardship and in the same ridicul manner should misemploy the talent of everi other servant it is easi to see what a figur such a famili must make in the world as ridicul as thi may seem i have often consid some of the lower offic in our civil govern to be dispos in thi veri manner to begin i think as low as i well can with the watchmen in our metropoli who be to guard our street by night from thiev and robber an offic which at least requir strength of bodi are chosen out of those poor old decrepit peopl who are from their want of bodili strength render incap of get a livelihood by work these men arm onli with a pole which some of them are scarc abl to lift are to secur the person and hous of hi majesti subject from the attack of gang of young bold stout desper and wellarm villain quae non viribu isti munera conveniunt if the poor old fellow should run away from such enemi no one i think can wonder unless it be that they were abl to make their escap the higher we proceed among our public offic and magistr the less defect of thi kind will perhap be observ mr thrasher howev the justic befor whom the prison abov mention were now brought had some few imperfect in hi magistrat capac i own i have been sometim inclin to think that thi offic of a justic of peac requir some knowledg of the law for thi simpl reason becaus in everi case which come befor him he is to judg and act accord to law again as these law are contain in a great varieti of book the statut which relat to the offic of a justic of peac make of themselv at least two larg volum in folio and that part of hi jurisdict which is found on the common law be dispers in abov a hundr volum i can not conceiv how thi knowledg should by acquir without read and yet certain it is mr thrasher never read one syllabl of the matter thi perhap wa a defect but thi wa not all for where mere ignor is to decid a point between two litig it will alway be an even chanc whether it decid right or wrong but sorri am i to say right wa often in a much wors situat than thi and wrong hath often had five hundr to one on hi side befor that magistr who if he wa ignor of the law of england wa yet well vers in the law of natur he perfectli well understood that fundament principl so strongli laid down in the institut of the learn rochefoucault by which the duti of selflov is so strongli enforc and everi man is taught to consid himself as the centr of graviti and to attract all thing thither to speak the truth plainli the justic wa never indiffer in a caus but when he could get noth on either side such wa the justic to whose tremend bar mr gotob the constabl on the day abov mention brought sever delinqu who as we have said had been apprehend by the watch for divers outrag the first who came upon hi trial wa as bloodi a spectr as ever the imagin of a murder or a tragic poet conceiv thi poor wretch wa charg with a batteri by a much stouter man than himself inde the accus person bore about him some evid that he had been in an affray hi cloath be veri bloodi but certain open sluic on hi own head suffici shew whenc all the scarlet stream had issu wherea the accus had not the least mark or appear of ani wound the justic ask the defend what he meant by break the king peace——to which he answered——upon my shoul i do love the king veri well and i have not been after break anyth of hi that i do know but upon my shoul thi man hath brake my head and my head did brake hi stick that is all gra he then offer to produc sever wit against thi improb accus but the justic present interrupt him say sirrah your tongu betray your guilt you are an irishman and that is alway suffici evid with me the second crimin wa a poor woman who wa taken up by the watch as a streetwalk it wa alleg against her that she wa found walk the street after twelv oclock and the watchman declar he believ her to be a common strumpet she plead in her defenc as wa realli the truth that she wa a servant and wa sent by her mistress who wa a littl shopkeep and upon the point of deliveri to fetch a midwif which she offer to prove by sever of the neighbour if she wa allow to send for them the justic ask her whi she had not done it befor to which she answer she had no money and could get no messeng the justic then call her sever scurril name and declar she wa guilti within the statut of streetwalk order her to bridewel for a month a genteel young man and woman were then set forward and a veri gravelook person swore he caught them in a situat which we can not as particularli describ here as he did befor the magistr who have receiv a wink from hi clerk declar with much warmth that the fact wa incred and imposs he present discharg the accus parti and wa go without ani evid to commit the accus for perjuri but thi the clerk dissuad him from say he doubt whether a justic of peac had ani such power the justic at first differ in opinion and said he had seen a man stand in the pillori about perjuri nay he had known a man in gaol for it too and how came he there if he wa not commit thither whi that is true sir answer the clerk and yet i have been told by a veri great lawyer that a man can not be commit for perjuri befor he is indict and the reason is i believ becaus it is not against the peac befor the indict make it so whi that may be cri the justic and inde perjuri is but scandal word and i know a man can not have no warrant for those unless you put for riot footnot opu est interpret by the law of england abus word are not punish by the magistr some commission of the peac therefor when one scold hath appli to them for a warrant against anoth from a too eager desir of do justic have constru a littl harmless scold into a riot which is in law an outrag breach of the peac commit by sever person by three at the least nor can a less number be convict of it under thi word riot or riot for i have seen it spelt both way mani thousand of old women have been arrest and put to expens sometim in prison for a littl intemper use of their tongu thi practic began to decreas in the year them into the warrant the wit wa now about to be discharg when the ladi whom he had accus declar she would swear the peac against him for that he had call her a whore sever time oho you will swear the peac madam will you cri the justic give her the peac present and pray mr constabl secur the prison now we have him while a warrant is made to take him up all which wa immedi perform and the poor wit for want of secur wa sent to prison a young fellow whose name wa booth wa now charg with beat the watchman in the execut of hi offic and break hi lanthorn thi wa depos by two wit and the shatter remain of a broken lanthorn which had been long preserv for the sake of it testimoni were produc to corrobor the evid the justic perceiv the crimin to be but shabbili drest wa go to commit him without ask ani further question at length howev at the earnest request of the accus the worthi magistr submit to hear hi defenc the young man then alledg as wa in realiti the case that as he wa walk home to hi lodg he saw two men in the street cruelli beat a third upon which he had stopt and endeavour to assist the person who wa so unequ attack that the watch came up dure the affray and took them all four into custodi that they were immedi carri to the roundhous where the two origin assail who appear to be men of fortun found mean to make up the matter and were discharg by the constabl a favour which he himself have no money in hi pocket wa unabl to obtain he utterli deni have assault ani of the watchmen and solemnli declar that he wa offer hi liberti at the price of half a crown though the bare word of an offend can never be taken against the oath of hi accus yet the matter of thi defenc wa so pertin and deliv with such an air of truth and sincer that had the magistr been endu with much sagac or had he been veri moder gift with anoth qualiti veri necessari to all who are to administ justic he would have employ some labour in crossexamin the watchmen at least he would have given the defend the time he desir to send for the other person who were present at the affray neither of which he did in short the magistr had too great an honour for truth to suspect that she ever appear in sordid apparel nor did he ever sulli hi sublim notion of that virtu by unit them with the mean idea of poverti and distress there remain now onli one prison and that wa the poor man himself in whose defenc the lastment culprit wa engag hi trial took but a veri short time a caus of batteri and broken lanthorn wa institut against him and prove in the same manner nor would the justic hear one word in defenc but though hi patienc wa exhaust hi breath wa not for against thi last wretch he pour forth a great mani volley of menac and abus the delinqu were then all dispatch to prison under a guard of watchmen and the justic and the constabl adjourn to a neighbour alehous to take their morn repast chapter iii — contain the insid of a prison mr booth for we shall not troubl you with the rest wa no sooner arriv in the prison than a number of person gather round him all demand garnish to which mr booth not make a readi answer as inde he did not understand the word some were go to lay hold of him when a person of appar digniti came up and insist that no one should affront the gentleman thi person then who wa no less than the master or keeper of the prison turn toward mr booth acquaint him that it wa the custom of the place for everi prison upon hi first arriv there to give someth to the former prison to make them drink thi he said wa what they call garnish and conclud with advis hi new custom to draw hi purs upon the present occas mr booth answer that he would veri readili compli with thi laudabl custom wa it in hi power but that in realiti he had not a shill in hi pocket and what wa wors he had not a shill in the world—oho if that be the case cri the keeper it is anoth matter and i have noth to say upon which he immedi depart and left poor booth to the merci of hi companion who without loss of time appli themselv to uncas as they term it and with such dexter that hi coat wa not onli stript off but out of sight in a minut mr booth wa too weak to resist and too wise to complain of thi usag as soon therefor as he wa at liberti and declar free of the place he summon hi philosophi of which he had no inconsider share to hi assist and resolv to make himself as easi as possibl under hi present circumst could hi own thought inde have suffer him a moment to forget where he wa the disposit of the other prison might have induc him to believ that he had been in a happier place for much the greater part of hi fellowsuffer instead of wail and repin at their condit were laugh sing and divert themselv with variou kind of sport and gambol the first person who accost him wa call blearey moll a woman of no veri come appear her eye for she had but one whenc she deriv her nicknam wa such as that nicknam bespok besid which it had two remark qualiti for first as if natur had been care to

discern nose she had none for venu enviou perhap at her former charm had carri off the gristli part and some earthli damsel perhap from the same envi had level the bone with the rest of her face inde it wa far beneath the bone of her cheek which rose proport higher than is usual about half a dozen eboni teeth fortifi that larg and long canal which natur had cut from ear to ear at the bottom of which wa a chin preposter short natur have turn up the bottom instead of suffer it to grow to it due length her bodi wa well adapt to her face she measur full as much round the middl as from head to foot for besid the extrem breadth of her back her vast breast had long sinc forsaken their nativ home and had settl themselv a littl below the girdl i wish certain actress on the stage when they are to perform charact of no amiabl cast would studi to dress themselv with the proprieti with which blearey moll wa now array for the sake of our squeamish reader we shall not descend to particular let it suffic to say noth more rag or more dirti wa ever empti out of the roundhous at st giless we have taken the more pain to describ thi person for two remark reason the one is that thi unlov creatur wa taken in the fact with a veri pretti young fellow the other which is more product of moral lesson is that howev wretch her fortun may appear to the reader she wa one of the merriest person in the whole prison blearey moll then came up to mr booth with a smile or rather grin on her counten and ask him for a dram of gin and when booth assur her that he had not a penni of money she replied—d—n your eye i thought by your look you had been a clever fellow and upon the snaffl lay footnot a cant term for robberi on the highway at least but d—n your bodi and eye i find you are some sneak budg footnot anoth cant term for pilfer rascal she then launch forth a volley of dread oath interlard with some languag not proper to be repeat here and wa go to lay hold on poor booth when a tall prison who had been veri earnestli eye booth for some time came up and take her by the shoulder flung her off at some distanc curs her for a b—h and bid her let the gentleman alon thi person wa not himself of the most invit aspect he wa longvisag and pale with a red beard of abov a fortnight growth he wa attir in a brownishblack coat which would have shew more hole than it did had not the linen which appear through it been entir of the same colour with the cloth thi gentleman whose name wa robinson address himself veri civilli to mr booth and told him he wa sorri to see one of hi appear in that place for as to your be without your coat sir say he i can easili account for that and inde dress is the least part which distinguish a gentleman at which word he cast a signific look on hi own coat as if he desir they should be appli to himself he then proceed in the follow manner i perceiv sir you are but just arriv in thi dismal place which is inde render more detest by the wretch who inhabit it than by ani other circumst but even these a wise man will soon bring himself to bear with indiffer for what is is and what must be must be the knowledg of thi which simpl as it appear is in truth the heighth of all philosophi render a wise man superior to everi evil which can befal him i hope sir no veri dread accid is the caus of your come hither but whatev it wa you may be assur it could not be otherwis for all thing happen by an inevit fatal and a man can no more resist the impuls of fate than a wheelbarrow can the forc of it driver besid the oblig which mr robinson had confer on mr booth in deliv him from the insult of blearey moll there wa someth in the manner of robinson which notwithstand the mean of hi dress seem to distinguish him from the crowd of wretch who swarm in those region and abov all the sentiment which he had just declar veri nearli coincid with those of mr booth thi gentleman wa what they call a freethink that is to say a deist or perhap an atheist for though he did not absolut deni the exist of a god yet he entir deni hi provid a doctrin which if it is not downright atheism hath a direct tendenc toward it and as dr clark observ may soon be driven into it and as to mr booth though he wa in hi heart an extrem wellwish to religion for he wa an honest man yet hi notion of it were veri slight and uncertain to say truth he wa in the waver condit so fine describ by claudian labefacta cadelat religio causaeque—viam non spont sequebar alteriu vacua quae currer semina motu affirmat magnumqu nova fer inan figur fortuna non art regi quae numina sensu ambiguo vel nulla futat vel nescia nostri — thi way of think or rather of doubt he had contract from the same reason which claudian assign and which had induc brutu in hi latter day to doubt the exist of that virtu which he had all hi life cultiv in short poor booth imagin that a larger share of misfortun had fallen to hi lot than he had merit and thi led him who though a good classic scholar wa not deepli learn in religi matter into a disadvantag opinion of provid a danger way of reason in which our conclus are not onli too hasti from an imperfect view of thing but we are likewis liabl to much error from partial to ourselv view our virtu and vice as through a perspect in which we turn the glass alway to our own advantag so as to diminish the one and as greatli to magnifi the other from the abov reason it can be no wonder that mr booth did not declin the acquaint of thi person in a place which could not promis to afford him ani better he answer him therefor with great courtesi as inde he wa of a veri good and gentl disposit and after express a civil surpriz at meet him there declar himself to be of the same opinion with regard to the necess of human action ad howev that he did not believ men were under ani blind impuls or direct of fate but that everi man act mere from the forc of that passion which wa uppermost in hi mind and could do no otherwis a discours now ensu between the two gentlemen on the necess aris from the impuls of fate and the necess aris from the impuls of passion which as it will make a pretti pamphlet of itself we shall reserv for some futur opportun when thi wa end they set forward to survey the gaol and the prison with the sever case of whom mr robinson who had been some time under confin undertook to make mr booth acquaint chapter iv — disclos further secret of the prisonhous the first person whom they pass by were three men in fetter who were enjoy themselv veri merrili over a bottl of wine and a pipe of tobacco these mr robinson inform hi friend were three streetrobb and were all certain of be hang the ensu session so inconsider an object said he is miseri to light mind when it is at ani distanc a littl farther they beheld a man prostrat on the ground whose heavi groan and frantic action plainli indic the highest disord of mind thi person wa it seem commit for a small feloni and hi wife who then layin upon hear the news had thrown herself from a window two pair of stair high by which mean he had in all probabl lost both her and hi child a veri pretti girl then advanc toward them whose beauti mr booth could not help admir the moment he saw her declar at the same time he thought she had great innoc in her counten robinson said she wa commit thither as an idl and disorderli person and a common streetwalk as she past by mr booth she damn hi eye and discharg a volley of word everi one of which wa too indec to be repeat they now beheld a littl creatur sit by herself in a corner and cri bitterli thi girl mr robinson said wa commit becaus her fatherinlaw who wa in the grenadi guard had sworn that he wa afraid of hi life or of some bodili harm which she would do him and she could get no sureti for keep the peac for which reason justic thrasher had commit her to prison a great nois now aros occas by the prison all flock to see a fellow whipt for petti larceni to which he wa condemn by the court of quartersess but thi soon end in the disappoint of the spectat for the fellow after be stript have advanc anoth sixpenc wa discharg untouch thi wa immedi follow by anoth bustl blearey moll and sever of her companion have got possess of a man who wa commit for certain odiou unmanlik practic not fit to be name were give him variou kind of disciplin and would probabl have put an end to him had he not been rescu out of their hand by author when thi bustl wa a littl allay mr booth took notic of a young woman in rag sit on the ground and support the head of an old man in her lap who appear to be give up the ghost these mr robinson inform him were father and daughter that the latter wa commit for steal a loaf in order to support the former and the former for receiv it know it to be stolen a welldrest man then walk surlili by them whom mr robinson report to have been commit on an indict found against him for a most horrid perjuri but say he we expect him to be bail today good heaven cri booth can such villain find bail and is no person charit enough to bail that poor father and daughter oh sir answer robinson the offenc of the daughter be feloni is held not to be bailabl in law wherea perjuri is a misdemeanor onli and therefor person who are even indict for it are nevertheless capabl of be bail nay of all perjuri that of which thi man is indict is the worst for it wa with an intent of take away the life of an innoc person by form of law as to perjuri in civil matter they are not so veri crimin they are not said booth and yet even these are a most flagiti offenc and worthi the highest punish sure they ought to be distinguish answer robinson from the other for what is take away a littl properti from a man compar to take away hi life and hi reput and ruin hi famili into the bargain—i hope there can be no comparison in the crime and i think there ought to be none in the punish howev at present the punish of all perjuri is onli pillori and transport for seven year and as it is a travers and bailabl offenc method are found to escap ani punish at allfootnot by remov the indict by certiorari into the king bench the trial is so long postpon and the cost are so highli encreas that prosecutor are often tire out and some incapacit from pursu verbum sapienti booth exprest great astonish at thi when hi attent wa suddenli divert by the most miser object that he had yet seen thi wa a wretch almost nake and who bore in hi counten join to an appear of honesti the mark of poverti hunger and diseas he had moreov a wooden leg and two or three scar on hi forehead the case of thi poor man is inde unhappi enough said robinson he hath serv hi countri lost hi limb and receiv sever wound at the sieg of gibraltar when he wa discharg from the hospit abroad he came over to get into that of chelsea but could not immedi as none of hi offic were then in england in the mean time he wa one day apprehend and commit hither on suspicion of steal three her from a fishmong he wa tri sever month ago for thi offenc and acquit inde hi innoc manifestli appear at the trial but he wa brought back again for hi fee and here he hath lain ever sinc booth exprest great horror at thi account and declar if he had onli so much money in hi pocket he would pay hi fee for him but ad that he wa not possess of a singl farth in the world robinson hesit a moment and then said with a smile i am go to make you sir a veri odd propos after your last declar but what say you to a game at card it will serv to pass a tediou hour and may divert your thought from more unpleas specul i do not imagin booth would have agre to thi for though some love of game had been formerli amongst hi fault yet he wa not so egregi addict to that vice as to be tempt by the shabbi plight of robinson who had if i may so express myself no charm for a gamest if he had howev ani such inclin he had no opportun to follow them for befor he could make ani answer to robinson propos a strap wench came up to booth and take hold of hi arm ask him to walk asid with her say what a pox are you such a fresh cull that you do not know thi fellow whi he is a gambler and commit for cheat at play there is not such a pickpocket in the whole quadfootnot a cant word for a prison a scene of alterc now ensu between robinson and the ladi which end in a bout at fisticuff in which the ladi wa greatli superior to the philosoph while the two combat were engag a gravelook man rather better drest than the major of the compani came up to mr booth and take him asid said i am sorri sir to see a gentleman as you appear to be in such intimaci with that rascal who make no scrupl of disown all reveal religion as for crime they are human error and signifi but littl nay perhap the wors a man is by natur the more room there is for grace the spirit is activ and love best to inhabit those mind where it may meet with the most work whatev your crime be therefor i would not have you despair but rather rejoic at it for perhap it may be the mean of your be call he ran on for a consider time with thi cant without wait for an answer and end in declar himself a methodist just as the methodist had finish hi discours a beauti young woman wa usher into the gaol she wa genteel and well drest and did not in the least resembl those femal whom mr booth had hitherto seen the constabl had no sooner deliv her at the gate than she ask with a command voic for the keeper and when he arriv she said to him well sir whither am i to be conduct i hope i am not to take up my lodg with these creatur the keeper answer with a kind of surli respect madam we have room for those who can afford to pay for them at these word she pull a handsom purs from her pocket in which mani guinea chink say with an air of indign that she wa not come thither on account of poverti the keeper no sooner view the purs than hi featur becam all soften in an instant and with all the courtesi of which he wa master he desir the ladi to walk with him assur her that she should have the best apart in hi hous mr booth wa now left alon for the methodist had forsaken him have as the phrase of the sect is search him to the bottom in fact he had thoroughli examin everi one of mr booth pocket from which he had convey away a penknif and an iron snuffbox these be all the moveabl which were to be found booth wa stand near the gate of the prison when the young ladi abov mention wa introduc into the yard he view her featur veri attent and wa persuad that he knew her she wa inde so remark handsom that it wa hardli possibl for ani who had ever seen her to forget her he enquir of one of the underkeep if the name of the prison late arriv wa not matthew to which he wa answer that her name wa not matthew but vincent and that she wa commit for murder the latter part of thi inform made mr booth suspect hi memori more than the former for it wa veri possibl that she might have chang her name but he hardli thought she could so far have chang her natur as to be guilti of a crime so veri incongru with her former gentl manner for miss matthew had both the birth and educ of a gentlewoman he conclud therefor that he wa certainli mistaken and rest satisfi without ani further enquiri chapter v — contain certain adventur which befel mr booth in the prison the remaind of the day mr booth spent in melancholi contempl on hi present condit he wa destitut of the common necessari of life and consequ unabl to subsist where he wa nor wa there a singl person in town to whom he could with ani reason hope appli for hi deliveri grief for some time banish the thought of food from hi mind but in the morn natur began to grow uneasi for want of her usual nourish for he had not eat a morsel dure the last forti hour a penni loaf which is it seem the ordinari allow to the prison in bridewel wa now deliv him and while he wa eat thi a man brought him a littl packet seal up inform him that it came by a messeng who said it requir no answer mr booth now open hi packet and after unfold sever piec of blank paper success at last discov a guinea wrapt with great care in the inmost paper he wa vastli surpriz at thi sight as he had few if ani friend from whom he could expect such a favour slight as it wa and not one of hi friend as he wa appriz knew of hi confin as there wa no direct to the packet nor a word of write contain in it he began to suspect that it wa deliv to the wrong person and be one of the most untaint honesti he found out the man who gave it him and again examin him concern the person who brought it and the messag deliv with it the man assur booth that he had made no mistak say if your name is booth sir i am posit you are the gentleman to whom the parcel i gave you belong the most scrupul honesti would perhap in such a situat have been well enough satisfi in find no owner for the guinea especi when proclam had been made in the prison that mr booth had receiv a packet without ani direct to which if ani person had ani claim and would discov the content he wa readi to deliv it to such claimant no such claimant be found i mean none who knew the content for mani swore that they expect just such a packet and believ it to be their properti mr booth veri calmli resolv to appli the money to hi own use the first thing after redempt of the coat which mr booth hungri as he wa thought of wa to suppli himself with snuff which he had long to hi great sorrow been without on thi occas he present miss that iron box which the methodist had so dexter convey out of hi pocket as we mention in the last chapter he no sooner miss thi box than he immedi suspect that the gambler wa the person who had stolen it nay so well wa he assur of thi man guilt that it may perhap be improp to say he bare suspect it though mr booth wa as we have hint a man of a veri sweet disposit yet wa he rather overwarm have therefor no doubt concern the person of the thief he eagerli sought him out and veri bluntli charg him with the fact the gambler whom i think we should now call the philosoph receiv thi charg without the least visibl emot either of mind or muscl after a short paus of a few moment he answer with great solemn as follow young man i am entir unconcern at your groundless suspicion he that censur a stranger as i am to you without ani caus make a wors compliment to himself than to the stranger you know yourself friend you know not me it is true inde you heard me accus of be a cheat and a gamest but who is my accus look at my apparel friend do thiev and gamest wear such cloath as these play is my folli not my vice it is my impuls and i have been a martyr to it would a gamest have ask anoth to play when he could have lost eighteenp and won noth howev if you are not satisfi you may search my pocket the outsid of all but one will serv your turn and in that one there is the eighteenp i told you of he then turn up hi cloath and hi pocket entir resembl the pitcher of the belid booth wa a littl stagger at thi defenc he said the real valu of the iron box wa too inconsider to mention but that he had a caprici valu for it for the sake of the person who gave it him for though it is not said he worth sixpenc i would willingli give a crown to ani one who would bring it me again robinson answer if that be the case you have noth more to do but to signifi your intent in the prison and i am well convinc you will not be long without regain the possess of your snuffbox thi advic wa immedi follow and with success the methodist present produc the box which he said he had found and should have return it befor had he known the person to whom it belong ad with uplift eye that the spirit would not suffer him knowingli to detain the good of anoth howev inconsider the valu wa whi so friend said robinson have i not heard you often say the wicked ani man wa the better provid he wa what you call a believ you mistak me cri cooper for that wa the name of the methodist no man can be wick after he is possess by the spirit there is a wide differ between the day of sin and the day of grace i have been a sinner myself i believ thee cri robinson with a sneer i care not answer the other what an atheist believ i suppos you would insinu that i stole the snuffbox but i valu not your malic the lord know my innoc he then walk off with the reward and booth turn to robinson veri earnestli ask pardon for hi groundless suspicion which the other without ani hesit accord him say you never accus me sir you suspect some gambler with whose charact i have no concern i should be angri with a friend or acquaint who should give a hasti credit to ani alleg against me but i have no reason to be offend with you for believ what the woman and the rascal who is just gone and who is commit here for a pickpocket which you did not perhap know told you to my disadvantag and if you thought me to be a gambler you had just reason to suspect ani ill of me for i myself am confin here by the perjuri of one of those villain who have cheat me of my money at play and hear that i intend to appli to a magistr against him himself began the attack and obtain a warrant against me of justic thrasher who without hear one

game at card at first for halfpenc and afterward for shill when fortun so favour robinson that he did not leav the other a singl shill in hi pocket a surpriz run of luck in a gamest is often mistaken for somewhat els by person who are not overzeal believ in the divin of fortun i have known a stranger at bath who hath happen fortun i might almost say unfortun to have four by honour in hi hand almost everi time he dealt for a whole even shun univers by the whole compani the next day and certain it is that mr booth though of a temper veri littl inclin to suspicion began to waver in hi opinion whether the charact given by mr robinson of himself or that which the other gave of him wa the truer in the morn hunger paid him a second visit and found him again in the same situat as befor after some deliber therefor he resolv to ask robinson to lend him a shill or two of that money which wa late hi own and thi experi he thought would confirm him either in a good or evil opinion of that
