she wa work with mr charlton in her dress room her maid hastili enter it and with a smile that seem announc welcom news said lord maam here is fidel and at the same moment she wa follow by the dog who jumpt upon cecilia in a transport of delight good heaven cri she all amaz who ha brought him whenc doe he come a countri man brought him maam but he onli put him in and would not stay a minut but whom did he enquir for who saw him what did he say he saw ralph maam ralph then wa instantli call and these question be repeat he said maam it wa a man i never saw befor but he onli bid me take care to deliv the dog into your own hand and said you would have a letter about him soon and then went away i want him to stay till i came up stair but he wa off at onc cecilia quit confound by thi account could make neither comment nor answer but as soon as the servant had left the room mr charlton entreat to know to whom the dog had belong convinc by her extrem agit that someth interest and uncommon must relat to him thi wa no time for disguis astonish and confus bereft cecilia of all power to attempt it and after a veri few evas she briefli commun her situat with respect to delvil hi leav her hi motiv and hi mother evid concurr for these were all so connect with her knowledg of fidel that she led to them unavoid in tell what she knew of him veri littl penetr wa requisit to gather from her manner all that wa unit in her narr of her own feel and disappoint in the cours of thi affair and mr charlton who had hitherto believ the whole world at her dispos and that she continu singl from no reason but her own difficulti of choic wa utterli amaz to find that ani man exist who could withstand the unit allur of so much beauti sweet and fortun she felt herself sometim inclin to hate and at other time to piti him yet conclud that her own extrem cold wa the real caus of hi flight and warmli blame a reserv which had thu ruin her happi cecilia wa in the extremest perplex and distress to conjectur the mean of so unaccount a present and so strang a messag delvil she knew had desir the dog might follow him to bristol hi mother alway pleas to oblig him would now less than ever neglect ani opportun she could not therefor doubt that she had sent or taken him thither and thenc accord to all appear he must now come but wa it like delvil would take such a liberti wa it probabl when so late he had almost exhort her to forget him he would even wish to present her with such a remembr of himself and what wa the letter she wa bid to expect whenc and from whom wa it to come all wa inexplic the onli thing she could surmis with ani semblanc of probabl wa that the whole wa some frolic of ladi honoria pemberton who had persuad delvil to send her the dog and perhap assur him she had herself request to have him provok by thi suggest her first thought wa instantli have him convey to the castl but uncertain what the whole affair meant and hope some explan in the letter she wa promis she determin to wait till it came or at least till she heard from mr delvil befor she took ani measur herself in the busi mutual account of their safe arriv at bristol and in suffolk had alreadi pass between them and she expect veri soon to have further intellig though she wa now by the whole behavior of mr delvil convinc she wish not again to have her an inmat of her hous and that the rest of her minor might pass without opposit in the hous of mr charlton day after day howev pass and yet she heard noth more a week a fortnight elaps and still no letter came she now conclud the promis wa a decept and repent that she had wait a moment with ani such expect her peac dure thi time wa greatli disturb thi present made her fear she wa thought meanli of by mr delvil the silenc of hi mother gave her apprehens for hi health and her own irresolut how to act kept her in perpetu inquietud she tri in vain to behav as if thi incid had not happen her mind wa uneasi and the same action produc not the same effect when she now work or read the sight of fidel by her side distract her attent when she walk it wa the same for fidel alway follow her and though in visit her old acquaint she forbor to let him accompani her she wa secretli plan the whole time the content of some letter which she expect to meet with on return to mr charlton those gentlemen in the countri who dure the lifetim of the dean had paid their address to cecilia again wait upon her at mr charlton and renew their propos they had now howev still less chanc of success and their dismiss wa brief and decis among these came mr biddulph and to him cecilia wa involuntarili most civil becaus she knew him to be the friend of delvil yet hi convers increas the uneasi of her suspens for after speak of the famili in gener which she had left he enquir more particularli concern delvil and then ad i am inde greatli griev to find by all the account i receiv of him that he is now in a veri bad state of health thi speech gave her fresh subject for apprehens and in proport as the silenc of mr delvil grew more alarm her regard for her favorit fidel becam more partial the affection anim seem to mourn the loss of hi master and while sometim she indulg herself in fanci tell him her fear she imagin she read in hi counten the faithfullest sympathi one week of her minor wa now all that remain and she wa soon wholli occupi in

thu far that you will proceed a littl farther and send back the dog to the person from whom you receiv him no not i manag him all your own way if you choos to accept dog from gentlemen you know it is your affair and not mine if you realli will not return him yourself you must at least pardon me should you hear that i do in your ladyship name ladi honoria for some time onli laugh and ralli without come to ani explan but when she had exhaust all the sport she could make she frankli own that she had herself order the dog to be privat stolen and then sent a man with him to mr charlton but you know she continu i realli owe you a spite for be so illnatur as to run away after send me to call mortim to comfort and take leav of you do you dream ladi honoria when did i send you whi you know you look

abl to find or trace you he took it all for my own invent and wa it not your own invent whi that is noth to the purpos i want him to believ you sent me for i knew els he would not come your ladyship wa a great deal too good whi now suppos i had brought you togeth what possibl harm could have happen from it it would mere have given each of you some notion of a fever and agu for first you would both have been hot and then you would both have been cold and then you would both have turn red and then you would both have turn white and then you would both have pretend to simper at the trick and then there would have been an end of it thi is a veri easi way of settl it all cri cecilia laugh howev you must be content to abid by your own theft for you can not in conscienc expect i should take it upon myself you are terribl ungrat i see said her ladyship for all the troubl and contriv and expens i have been at mere to oblig you while the whole time poor mortim i dare say ha had hi sweet pet

way i could do no good with my littl lord derford he pretend to find out i wa onli laugh at him and so he mind noth i told him i dare say howev hi father made the detect for i am sure he had not wit enough to discov it himself cecilia then veri serious began to entreat that she would return the dog herself and confess her frolic remonstr in strong term upon the mischiev tendenc and consequ of such inconsider flight well cri she rise thi is all vastli true but i have no time to hear ani more of it just now besid it is onli forestal my next lectur from mr delvil for you talk so much alik that it is realli veri perplex to me to rememb which is which she then hurri away protest she had alreadi outstay her father patienc and declar the delay of anoth minut would occas half a dozen express to know whether she wa gone toward scotland or flander thi visit howev wa both pleasant and consolatori to cecilia who wa now reliev from her suspens and reviv in her spirit by the intellig that delvil had no share in send her a present which from him would have been humili and impertin she regret inde that she had not instantli return it to the castl which she wa now convinc wa the measur she ought to have pursu but to make all possibl repar she determin that her own servant should set out with him the next morn to bristol and take a letter to mr delvil to explain what had happen sinc to conceal it from ani delicaci to ladi honoria would be to expos herself to suspicion the most mortifi for which that gay and careless young ladi would never thank her she gave order therefor to her servant to get readi for the journey when she commun these littl transact to mr charlton that kindheart old ladi who knew her fond for fidel advis her not yet to part with him but mere
