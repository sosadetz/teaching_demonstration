she wa yet both provok and concern to be suspect at all an attack so earnest from almost ani other person could hardli have fail be veri offens to her but in the manner of young delvil good breed wa so happili blend with frank that hi freedom seem mere to result from the open of hi disposit and even in it veri act plead it own excus her reveri wa at length interrupt by mr delvil desir to know in what he could serv her she told him she had present occas for l and hope he would not object to her take up that sum six hundr pound said he after some deliber is rather an extraordinari demand for a

said she stammer no not all for that i have some other i have a particular occas but what bill at all cri he with much surpris can a young ladi have with a booksel the spectat tatler and guardian would make librari suffici for ani femal in the kingdom nor do i think it like a gentlewoman to have more besid if you alli yourself in such a manner as i shall approv and recommend you will in all probabl find alreadi collect more book than there can ever be ani possibl occas for you to look into and let me counsel you to rememb that a ladi whether so call from birth or onli from fortun should never degrad herself by be put on a level with writer and such sort of peopl cecilia thank him for hi advic but confess that upon the present occas it came too late as the book were now actual in her

appar indign he said i interced i becom an agent cecilia amaz to find him thu violent irrit made a veri earnest apolog for her request but without pay her ani attent he walk up and down the room exclaim an agent and to mr brigg thi is an affront i could never have expect whi did i degrad myself by accept thi humili offic i ought to have known better then turn to cecilia child he ad for whom is it you take me and for what cecilia again though affront in her turn began some protest of respect but haughtili interrupt her he said if of me and of my rank in life you judg by mr brigg or by mr harrel i may be subject to propos such as these everi day suffer me therefor for your better inform to hint to you that the head of an ancient and honor hous is apt to think himself somewhat superior to peopl but just rise from dust and obscur thunderstruck by thi imperi reproof she could attempt no further vindic but when he observ her constern he wa somewhat appeas and hope he had now impress her with a proper sens of hi digniti he more gentli said you did not i believ intend to insult me good heaven sir no cri cecilia noth wa more distant from my thought if my express have been faulti it

yet as she left the room gracious said think no more of my displeasur for it is over i see you were not were of the extraordinari thing you propos i am sorri i can not possibl assist you on ani other occas you may depend upon my servic but you know mr brigg you have seen him yourself judg then how a man of ani fashion is to accommod himself with such a pon cecilia concur and courtsi took her leav ah thought she in her way home how happi is it for me that i follow the advic of mr monckton els i had sure made interest to becom an inmat of that hous and then inde as he wise foresaw i should inevit have been overwhelm by thi pompou insol no famili howev amiabl could make amend for such a master of it chap iii an admonit the harrel and mr arnott wait the return of cecilia with the utmost impati she told them with much concern the failur of her embassi which mr harrel heard with visibl resent and disent while mr arnott entreat him not to think of it again made an offer of hi servic and declar he would disregard all person inconveni for the pleasur of make him and hi sister easi cecilia wa much mortifi that she had not the power to act the same part and ask mr harrel whether he believ hi own influenc with mr brigg would be more success no no answer he the old curmudgeon would but the rather refus i know hi reason and therefor am sure all plea will be vain he ha deal in the alley and i dare say game with your money as if it were hi own there is inde one way but i do not think you would like it though i protest i hardli know whi not howev it is as well let alon cecilia insist upon hear what he meant and after some hesit he hint that there were mean by which with veri littl inconveni she might borrow the money cecilia with that horror natur to all unpractis mind at the first idea of contract a voluntari debt start at thi suggest and seem veri ill dispos to listen to it mr harrel perceiv her repugn turn to mr arnott and said well my good brother i hardli know how to suffer you to sell out at such a loss but yet my present necess is so urgent dont mention it cri mr arnott i am veri sorri i let you know it be certain howev that while i have ani thing it is your and my sister the two gentlemen were then retir togeth but cecilia shock for mr arnott though unmov by mr harrel stop them to enquir what wa the way by which it wa meant she could borrow the money mr harrel seem avers to answer but she would not be refus and then he mention a jew of whose honesti he had made undoubt trial and who as she wa so near be of age would accept veri trifl interest for whatev she should like to take up the heart of cecilia recoil at the veri mention of a jew and take up money upon interest but impel strongli by her own generos to emul that of mr arnott she agre after some hesit to have recours to thi method mr harrel then made some faint denial and mr arnott protest he had a thousand time rather sell out at ani discount than consent to her take such a measur but when her first reluct wa conquer all that he urg serv but to show hi worthi in a stronger light and onli increas her desir of save him from such repeat imposit her total ignor in what manner to transact thi busi made her next put it wholli into the hand of mr harrel whom she beg to take up l upon such term as he thought equit and to which whatev they might be she would sign her name he seem somewhat surpris at the sum but without ani question or object undertook the commiss and cecilia would not lessen it becaus unwil to do more for the secur of the luxuri mr harrel than for the distress of the labori hill noth could be more speedi than the execut of thi affair mr harrel wa dilig and expert the whole wa settl that morn and give to the jew her bond for the payment at the interest he requir she put into the hand of mr harrel l for which he gave hi receipt and she kept the rest for her own purpos she intend the morn after thi transact to settl her account with the booksel when she went into the parlour to breakfast she wa somewhat surpris to see mr harrel seat there in earnest discours with hi wife fear of interrupt a tete a tete so uncommon she would have retir but mr harrel

old aaron to come hither directli with the money but it so happen that he went out of town the moment he had done with us yesterday and will not be back again thi week now i dont believ there is anoth jew in the kingdom who will let me have money upon the same term they are such notori rascal that i hate the veri thought of employ them cecilia who could not but understand what thi meant wa too much displeas both by hi extravag and hi indelicaci to feel at all inclin to chang the destin of the money she had just receiv and therefor coolli agre that it wa unfortun but ad noth more o it is provok inde cri he for the extrainterest i must pay one of those extortion is absolut so much money thrown away cecilia still without notic these hint began her breakfast mr harrel then said he would take hi tea with them and while he wa butter some dri toast exclaim as if from sudden recollect o lord now i think of it i believ miss beverley you can lend me thi money yourself for a day or two the moment old aaron come to town i will pay you cecilia whose generos howev extens wa neither thoughtless nor indiscrimin found someth so repuls in thi gross procedur that instead of assent to hi request with her usual alacr she answer veri grave that the money she had just receiv wa alreadi appropri to a particular purpos and she knew not how to defer make use of it mr harrel wa extrem chagrin by thi repli which wa by no mean what he expect but toss down a dish of tea he began hum an air and soon recov hi usual unconcern in a few minut ring hi bell he desir a servant to go to mr zackeri and inform him that he want to speak with him immedi and now said he with a look in which vexat seem struggl with careless the thing is done i dont like inde to get into such hand for it is hard ever to get out

cecilia now grew a littl disturb she look at mr harrel who seem also uneasi and then with some hesit said have you realli never sir employ thi man befor never in my life never ani but old aaron i dread the whole race i have a sort of superstiti notion that if onc i get into their clutch i shall never be my own man again and that induc me to beg your assist howev it is no great matter she then began to waver she fear there might be futur mischief as well as present inconveni in hi appli to new usur and know she had now the power to prevent him thought herself half cruel in refus to exert it she wish to consult mr monckton but found it necessari to take her measur immedi as the jew wa alreadi sent for and must in a few moment be either employ or discard much perplex how to act between a desir of do good and a fear of encourag evil she weigh each side hastili but while still uncertain which ought to preponder her kind for mr harrel interf and in the hope of rescu her husband from further bad practic she said she would postpon her own busi for the few day he mention rather than see him compel to open ani new account with so danger a set of men he thank her in hi usual neglig manner and accept the l gave her hi receipt for it and a promis she should be paid in a week mr harrel howev seem more grate and with mani embrac spoke her sens of thi friendli good natur cecilia happi from believ she had reviv in her some spark of sensibl determin to avail herself of so favor a symptom and enter at onc upon the disagre task she had set herself of repres to her the danger of
