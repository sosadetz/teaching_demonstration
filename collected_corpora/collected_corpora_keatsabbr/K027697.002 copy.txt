the life and opinion of tristram shandi gentleman vol ii the second edit london print for r and j dodsley in pall mall mdcclx the life and opinion of tristram shandi gent chap i i have begun a new book on purpos that i might have room enough to explain the natur of the perplex in which my uncl tobi wa involv from the mani discours and interrog about the sieg of namur where he receiv hi wound i must remind the reader in case he ha read the histori of king william war but if he ha not i then inform him that one of the most memor attack in that sieg wa that which wa made by the english and dutch upon the point of the advanc counterscarp befor the gate of st nicola which enclos the great sluic or waterstop where the english were terribl expos to the shot of the counterguard and demibast of st roch the issu of which hot disput in three word wa thi that the dutch lodg themselv upon the counterguard and that the english made themselv master of the cover way befor st nicolass gate notwithstand the gallantri of the french offic who expos themselv upon the glaci sword in hand as thi wa the princip attack of which my uncl tobi wa an eyewit at namur the armi of the besieg be cut off by the confluenc of the mae and sambr from see much of each other oper my uncl tobi wa gener more eloqu and particular in hi account of it and the mani perplex he wa in aros out of the almost insurmount difficulti he found in tell hi stori intellig and give such clear idea of the differ and distinct between the scarp and counterscarp the glaci and cover way the half moon and ravelin as to make hi compani fulli comprehend where and what he wa about writer themselv are too apt to confound these term so that you will the less wonder if in hi endeavor to explain them and in opposit to mani misconcept that my uncl tobi did often time puzzl hi visit and sometim himself too to speak the truth unless the compani my father led up stair were toler clearhead or my uncl tobi wa in one of hi best explanatori mood twa a difficult thing do what he could to keep the discours free from obscur what render the account of thi affair the more intric to my uncl tobi wa thi that in the attack of the counterscarp befor the gate of st nicola extend itself from the bank of the mae quit up to the great waterstop the ground wa cut and crosscut with such a multitud of dyke drain rivulet and sluic on all side and he would get so sadli bewild and set fast amongst them that frequent he could neither get backward or forward to save hi life and wa often time oblig to give up the attack upon that veri account onli these perplex rebuff gave my uncl tobi shandi more perturb than you would imagin and as my father kind to him wa continu drag up fresh friend and fresh inquir he had but a veri uneasi task of it no doubt my uncl tobi had great command of himself and could guard appear i believ as well as most men yet ani one may imagin that when he could not retreat out of the ravelin without get into the half moon or get out of the cover way without fall down the counterscarp nor cross the dyke without danger of slip into the ditch but that he must have fret and fume inwardli he did so and these littl and hourli vexat which may seem trifl and of no account to the man who ha not read hippocr yet whoever ha read hippocr or dr jame mackenzi and ha consid well the effect which the passion and affect of the mind have upon the digest whi not of a wound as well as of a dinner may easili conceiv what sharp parox and exacerb of hi wound my uncl tobi must have undergon upon that score onli my uncl tobi could not philosoph upon it twa enough he felt it wa so and have sustain the pain and sorrow of it for three month togeth he wa resolv some way or other to extric himself he wa one morn lie upon hi back in hi bed the anguish and natur of the wound upon hi groin suffer him to lie in no other posit when a thought came into hi head that if he could purchas such a thing and have it past down upon a board as a larg map of the fortif of the town and citadel of namur with it environ it might be a mean of give him eas i take notic of hi desir to have the environ along with the town and citadel for thi reason becaus my uncl tobi wound wa got in one of the travers about thirti tois from the return angl of the trench opposit to the salient angl of the demibast of st roch so that he wa pretti confid he could stick a pin upon the ident spot of ground where he wa stand in when the stone struck him all thi succeed to hi wish and not onli freed him from a world of sad explan but in the end it prove the happi mean as you will read of procur my uncl tobi hi hobbyhors chap ii there is noth so foolish when you are at the expens of make an entertain of thi kind as to order thing so badli as to let your critic and gentri of refin tast run it down nor is there ani thing so like to make them do it as that of leav them out of the parti or what is full as offens of bestow your attent upon the rest of your guest in so particular a way as if there wa no such thing as a critic by occup at tabl i guard against both for in the first place i have left half a dozen place purpos open for them and in the next place i pay them all court gentlemen i kiss your hand i protest no compani could give me half the pleasur by my soul i am glad to see you i beg onli you will make no stranger of yourselv but sit down without ani ceremoni and fall on heartili i said i had left six place and i wa upon the point of carri my complais so far as to have left a seventh open for them and in thi veri spot i stand on but be told by a critic though not by occup but by natur that i had acquit myself well enough i shall fill it up directli hope in the mean time that i shall be abl to make a great deal of more room next year how in the name of wonder could your uncl tobi who it seem wa a militari man and whom you have repres as no fool be at the same time such a confus puddinghead muddlehead fellow as go look so sir critic i could have repli but i scorn it it is languag unurban and onli befit the man who can not give clear and satisfactori account of thing or dive deep enough into the first caus of human ignor and confus it is moreov the repli valiant and therefor i reject it for though it might have suit my uncl tobi charact as a soldier excel well and had he not accustom himself in such attack to whistl the lillabullero as he want no courag it is the veri answer he would have given yet it would by no mean have done for me you see as plain as can be that i write as a man of erudit that even my simili my allus my illustr my metaphor are erudit and that i must sustain my charact properli and contrast it properli too els what would becom of me whi sir i should be undon at thi veri moment that i am go here to fill up one place against a critic i should have made an open for a coupl therefor i answer thu pray sir in all the read which you have ever read did you ever read such a book as lock essay upon the human understand dont answer me rashli becaus mani i know quot the book who have not read it and mani have read it who understand it not if either of these is your case as i write to instruct i will tell you in three word what the book is it is a histori a histori of who what where when dont hurri yourself it is a historybook sir which may possibl recommend it to the world of what pass in a man own mind and if you will say so much of the book and no more believ me you will cut no contempt figur in a metaphys circl but thi by the way now if you will ventur to go along with me and look down into the bottom of thi matter it will be found that the caus of obscur and confus in the mind of man is threefold dull organ dear sir in the first place secondli slight and transient impress made by object when the said organ are not dull and thirdli a memori like unto a siev not abl to retain what it ha receiv call down dolli your chambermaid and i will give you my cap and bell along with it if i make not thi matter so plain that dolli herself shall understand it as well as malbranch when dolli ha indict her epistl to robin and ha thrust her arm into the bottom of her pocket hang by her rightsid take that opportun to recollect that the organ and faculti of percept can by noth in thi world be so aptli typifi and explain as by that one thing which dolli hand is in search of your organ are not so dull that i should inform you it is an inch sir of red sealwax when thi is melt and drop upon the letter if dolli fumbl too long for her thimbl till the wax is over harden it will not receiv the mark of her thimbl from the usual impuls which wa wont to imprint it veri well if dolli wax for want of better is beeswax or of a temper too soft though it may receiv it will not hold the impress how hard soever dolli thrust against it and last of all suppos the wax good and eke the thimbl but appli thereto in careless hast as her mistress ring the bell in ani one of these three case the print left by the thimbl will be as unlik the prototyp as a brassjack now you must understand that not one of these wa the true caus of the confus in my uncl tobi discours and it is for that veri reason i enlarg upon them so long after the manner of great physiologist to show the world what it did not aris from what it did aris from i have hint abov and a fertil sourc of obscur it is and ever will be and that is the unsteadi use of word which have perplex the clearest and most exalt understand it is ten to one at arthur whether you have ever read the literari histori of past age if you have what terribl battl yclept logomachi have they occas and perpetu with so much gall and inksh that a good natur man can not read the account of them without tear in hi eye gentl critic when thou have weigh all thi and consid within thyself how much of thi own knowledg discours and convers ha been pester and disord at one time or other by thi and thi onli what a pudder and racket in council about and and in the school of the learn about power and about spirit about essenc and about quintess about substanc and about space what confus in greater theater from word of littl mean and as indetermin a sens when thou consid thi thou will not wonder at my uncl tobi perplex thou will drop a tear of piti upon hi scarp and hi counterscarp hi glaci and hi coveredway hi ravelin and hi half moon twa not by idea by heaven hi life wa put in jeopardi by word chap iii when my uncl tobi got hi map of namur to hi mind he began immedi to appli himself and with the utmost dilig to the studi of it for noth be of more import to him than hi recoveri and hi recoveri depend as you have read upon the passion and affect of hi mind it behov him to take the nicest care to make himself so far master of hi subject as to be abl to talk upon it without emot in a fortnight close and pain applic which by the bye did my uncl tobi wound upon hi groin no good he wa enabl by the help of some margin document at the feet of the eleph togeth with gobesiuss militari architectur and pyroballog translat from the flemish to form hi discours with passabl perspicu and befor he wa two full month gone he wa right eloqu upon it and could make not onli the attack of the advanc counterscarp with great order but have by that time gone much deeper into the art than what hi first motiv made necessari my uncl tobi wa abl to cross the mae and sambr make divers as far as vauban line the abbey of salsin etc and give hi visit as distinct a histori of each of their attack as of that of the gate of st nicola where he had the honor to receiv hi wound but the desir of knowledg like the thirst of rich increas ever with the acquisit of it the more my uncl tobi pore over hi map the more he took a like to it by the same process and electr assimil as i told you through which i ween the soul of connoisseur themselv by long friction and incumbit have the happi at length to get all bevirtud bepicturd bebutterfli and befiddl the more my uncl tobi drank of thi sweet fountain of scienc the greater wa the heat and impati of hi thirst so that befor the first year of hi confin had well gone round there wa scarc a fortifi town in itali or flander of which by one mean or other he had not procur a plan read over as he got them and care collat therewith the histori of their sieg their demolit their improv and new work all which he would read with that intens applic and delight that he would forget himself hi wound hi confin hi dinner in the second year my uncl tobi purchas ramelli and cataneo translat from the italian likewis stevinu maroli the chevali de vill lorini cochorn sheeter the count de pagan the marshal vauban mon blondel with almost as mani more book of militari architectur as don quixot wa found to have of chivalri when the curat and barber invad hi librari toward the begin of the third year which wa in august ninetynin my uncl tobi found it necessari to understand a littl of projectil and have judg it best to draw hi knowledg from the fountainhead he began with n tartaglia who it seem wa the first man who detect the imposit of a canonbal do all that mischief under the notion of a right line thi n tartaglia prove to my uncl tobi to be an imposs thing endless is the search of truth no sooner wa my uncl tobi satisfi which road the cannonbal did not go but he wa insens led on and resolv in hi mind to enquir and find out which road the ball did go for which purpos he wa oblig to set off afresh with old maltu and studi him devoutli he proceed next to gallileo and torricelliu wherein by certain geometr rule infal laid down he found the precis path to be a parabola or els an hyperbola and that the paramet or latu rectum of the conic section of the said path wa to the quantiti and amplitud in a direct ratio as the whole line to the sine of doubl the angl of incid form by the breech upon an horizont plane and that the semiparamet stop my dear uncl tobi stop go not one foot further into thi thorni and bewild track intric are the step intric are the mase of thi labyrinth intric are the troubl which the pursuit of thi bewitch phantom knowledg will bring upon thee o my uncl fli fli fli from it as from a serpent is it fit goodnatur man thou should fit up with the wound upon thi groin whole night bake thi blood with hectic watch ala twill exasper thi symptom check thi perspir evapor thi spirit wast thi anim strength dri up thi radic moistur bring thee into a costiv habit of bodi impair thi health and hasten all the infirm of thi old age o my uncl my uncl tobi chap iv i would not give a groat for that man knowledg in pencraft who doe not understand thi that the best plain narr in the world tack veri close to the last spirit apostroph to my uncl tobi would have felt both cold and vapid upon the reader palat therefor i forthwith put an end to the chapter though i wa in the middl of my stori writer of my stamp have one principl in common with painter where an exact copi make our pictur less strike we choos the less evil deem it even more pardon to trespass against truth than beauti thi is to be understood cum grano sali but be it as it will as the parallel is made more for the sake of let the apostroph cool than ani thing els it is not veri materi whether upon ani other score the reader approv of it or not in the latter end of the third year my uncl tobi perceiv that the paramet and semiparamet of the conic section anger hi wound he left off the studi of projectil in a kind of a huff and betook himself to the practic part of fortif onli the pleasur of which like a spring held back return upon him with redoubl forc it wa in thi year that my uncl began to break in upon the daili regular of a clean shirt to dismiss hi barber unshaven and to allow hi surgeon scarc time suffici to dress hi wound concern himself so littl about it as not to ask him onc in seven time dress how it went on when lo all of a sudden for the chang wa as quick as lighten he began to sigh heavili for hi recoveri complain to my father grew impati with the surgeon and one morn as he heard hi foot come up stair he shut up hi book and thrust asid hi instrument in order to expostul with him upon the protract of hi cure which he told him might sure have been accomplish at least by that time he dwelt long upon the miseri he had undergon and the sorrow of hi four year melancholi imprison ad that had it not been for the kind look and fratern chear of the best of brother he had long sinc sunk under hi misfortun my father wa by my uncl tobi eloqu brought tear into hi eye twa unexpect my uncl tobi by natur wa not eloqu it had the greater effect the surgeon wa confound not that there want ground for such or greater mark of impati but twa unexpect too in the four year he had attend him he had never seen ani thing like it in my uncl tobi carriag he had never onc drop one fret or discont word he had been all patienc all submiss we ose the right of complain sometim by forbear it but we often trebl the forc the surgeon wa astonish but much more so when he heard my uncl tobi go on and peremptorili insist upon hi heal up the wound directli or send for monsieur ronjat the king serjeantsurgeon to do it for him the desir of life and health is implant in man natur the love of liberti and enlarg is a sisterpass to it these my uncl tobi had in common with hi speci and either of them had been suffici to account for hi earnest desir to get well and out of door but i have told you befor that noth wrought with our famili after the common way and from the time and manner in which thi eager desir show itself in the present case the penetr reader will suspect there wa some other caus or crotchet for it in my uncl tobi head there wa so and it is the subject of the next chapter to set forth what that caus and crotchet wa i own when that is done twill be time to return back to the parlour firesid where we left my uncl tobi in the middl of hi sentenc chap v when a man give himself up to the govern of a rule passion or in other word when hi hobbyhors grow headstrong farewel cool reason and fair discret my uncl tobi wound wa near well and as soon as the surgeon recov hi surpris and could get leav to say as much he told him twa just begin to incarn and that if no fresh exfoli happen which there wa no sign of it would be dri up in five or six week the sound of as mani olympiad twelv hour befor would have convey an idea of shorter durat to my uncl tobi mind the success of hi idea wa now rapid he broil with impati to put hi design in execut and so without consult further with ani soul live which by the bye i think is right when you are predetermin to take no one soul advic he privat order trim hi man to pack up a bundl of lint and dress and hire a chariot and four to be at the door exactli by twelv oclock that day when he knew my father would be upon chang so leav a banknot upon the tabl for the surgeon care of him and a letter of tender thank for hi brother he pack up hi map hi book of fortif hi instrument etc and by the help of a crutch on one side and trim on the other my uncl tobi embark for shandyhal the reason or rather the rise of thi sudden demigr wa as follow the tabl in my uncl tobi room and at which the night befor thi chang happen he wa sit with hi map etc about him be somewhat of the smallest for that infin of great and small instrument of knowledg which usual lay crowd upon it he had the accid in reach over for hi tobaccobox to throw down hi compass and in stoop to take the compass up with hi sleev he threw down hi case of instrument and snuffer and as the dice took a run against him in hi endeavor to catch the snuffer in fall he thrust monsieur blondel off the tabl and count de pagan otop of him twa to no purpos for a man lame as my uncl tobi wa to think of redress all these evil by himself he rung hi bell for hi man trim trim quoth my uncl tobi prithe see what confus i have here been make i must have some better contriv trim can not thou take my rule and measur the length and breadth of thi tabl and then go and bespeak me one as big again ye an pleas your honor repli trim make a bow but i hope your honor will be soon well enough to get down to your countri seat where as your honor take so much pleasur in fortif we could manag thi matter to a t i must here inform you that thi servant of my uncl tobi who went by the name of trim had been a corpor in my uncl own compani hi real name wa jame butler but have got the nicknam of trim in the regiment my uncl tobi unless when he happen to be veri angri with him would never call him by ani other name the poor fellow had been disabl for the servic by a wound on hi left knee by a musketbullet at the battl of landen which wa two year befor the affair of namur and as the fellow wa well belov in the regiment and a handi fellow into the bargain my uncl tobi took him for hi servant and of excel use wa he attend my uncl tobi in the camp and in hi quarter as valet groom barber cook sempster and nurs and inde from first to last wait upon him and serv

trim quoth my uncl tobi leap up upon one leg quit overcom with raptur and thrust a guinea into trim hand trim said my uncl tobi say no more but go down trim thi moment my lad and bring up my supper thi instant trim ran down and brought up hi master supper to no purpos trim plan of oper ran so in my uncl tobi head he could not tast it trim quoth my uncl tobi get me tobe twa all one corpor trim descript had fire hi imagin my uncl tobi could not shut hi eye the more he consid it the more bewitch the scene appear to him so that two full hour befor daylight he had come to a final determin and had concert the whole plan of hi and corpor trim decamp my uncl tobi had a littl neat countri hous of hi own in the villag where my father estat lay at shandi which had been left him by an old uncl with a small estat of about one hundr pound a year behind thi hous and contigu to it wa a kitchengarden of about half an acr and at the bottom of the garden and cut off from it by a tall yew hedg wa a bowlinggreen contain just about as much ground as corpor trim wish for so that as trim utter the word a rood and a half of ground to do what they would with thi ident bowlinggreen instantli present itself and becam curious paint all at onc upon the retina of my uncl tobi fanci which wa the physic caus of make him chang color or at least of heighten hi blush to that immoder degre i spoke of never did lover post down to a belov mistress with more heat and expect than my uncl tobi did to enjoy thi selfsam thing in privat i say in privat for it wa shelter from the hous as i told you by a tall yew hedg and wa cover on the other three side from mortal sight by rough holli and thickset flower shrub so that the idea of not be seen did not a littl contribut to the idea of pleasur preconceiv in my uncl tobi mind vain thought howev thick it wa plant about or privat soever it might seem to think dear uncl tobi of enjoy a thing which took up a whole rood and a half of ground and not have it known how my uncl tobi and corpor trim manag thi matter with the histori of their campaign which were no way barren of event may make no uninterest underplot in the epitasi and work up of thi drama at present the scene must drop and chang for the parlour firesid chap vi what can they be do brother said my father i think repli my uncl tobi take as i told you hi pipe from hi mouth and strike the ash out of it as he began hi sentenc i think repli he it would not be amiss brother if we rung the bell pray what is all that racket over our head obadiah quoth my father my brother and i can scarc hear ourselv speak sir answer obadiah make a bow toward hi leftshould my mistress is taken veri badli and where is susannah run down the garden there as if they were go to ravish her sir she is run the shortest cut into the town repli obadiah to fetch the old midwif then saddl a hors quoth my father and do you go directli for dr slop the manmidwif with all our servic and let him know your mistress is fallen into labor and that i desir he will return with you with all speed it is veri strang say my father address himself to my uncl tobi as obadiah shut the door as there is so expert an oper as dr slop so near that my wife should persist to the veri last in thi obstin humor of her in trust the life of my child who ha had one misfortun alreadi to the ignor of an old woman and not onli the life of my child brother but her own life and with it the live of all the children i might peradventur have begot out of her hereaft mayhap brother repli my uncl tobi my sister doe it to save the expens a pud end repli my father the doctor must be paid the same for inact as action if not better to keep him in temper then it can be out of noth in the whole world quoth my uncl tobi in the simplic of hi heart but modesti my sister i dare say ad he doe not care to let a man come so near her i will not say whether my uncl tobi had complet the sentenc or not it is for hi advantag to suppos he had as i think he could have ad no one word which would have improv it if on the contrari my uncl tobi had not fulli arriv at hi period end then the world stand indebt to the sudden snap of my father tobaccopip for one of the neatest exampl of that ornament figur in oratori which rhetorician style the aposiopesi just heaven how doe the poco piu and the poco meno of the italian artist the insens more or less determin the precis line of beauti in the sentenc as well as in the statu how do the slight touch of the chifel the pencil the pen the fiddlestick et caetera give the true swell which give the true pleasur o my countrymen be nice be cautiou of your languag and never o never let it be forgotten upon what small particl your eloqu and your fame depend my sister mayhap quoth my uncl tobi doe not choos to let a man come so near her make thi dash it is an aposiopesi take the dash away and write backsid it is bawdi scratch backsid out and put coverdway in it is a metaphor and i dare say as fortif ran so much in my uncl tobi head that if he had been left to have ad one word to the sentenc that word wa it but whether that wa the case or not the case or whether the snap of my father tobaccopip so critic happen through accid or anger will be seen in due time chap vii though my father wa a good natur philosoph yet he wa someth of a moral philosoph too for which reason when hi tobaccopip snappd short in the middl he had noth to do as such but to have taken hold of the two piec and thrown them gentli upon the back of the fire he did no such thing he threw them with all the violenc in the world and to give the action still more emphasi he start up upon both hi leg to do it thi look someth like heat and the manner of hi repli to what my uncl tobi wa say prove it wa so not choos quoth my father repeat my uncl tobi word to let a man come so near her by heaven brother tobi you would tri the patienc of a job and i think i have the plagu of one alreadi without it whi where wherein wherefor upon what account repli my uncl tobi in the utmost astonish to think said my father of a man live to your age brother and know so littl about women i know noth at all about them repli my uncl tobi and i think continu he that the shock i receiv the year after the demolit of dunkirk in my affair with widow wadman which shock you know i should not have receiv but from my total ignor of the sex ha given me just caus to say that i neither know nor do pretend to know ani thing about em or their concern either methink brother repli my father you might at least know so much as the right end of a woman from the wrong it is said in aristotl masterpiec that when a man doe think of ani thing which is past he look down upon the ground but that when he think of someth which is to come he look up toward the heaven my uncl tobi i suppos thought of neither for he look horizont right end quoth my uncl tobi mutter the two word low to himself and fix hi two eye insens as he mutter them upon a small crevic form by a bad joint in the chimneypiec right end of a woman i declar quoth my uncl i know no more which it is than the man in the moon and if i wa to think continu my uncl tobi keep hi eye still fix upon the bad joint thi month togeth i am sure i should not be abl to find it out then brother tobi repli my father i will tell you everi thing in thi world continu my father fill a fresh pipe everi thing in thi earthli world my dear brother tobi ha two handl not alway quoth my uncl tobi at least repli my father everi one ha two hand which come to the same thing now if a man wa to sit down cooli and consid within himself the make the shape the construct comat and conveni of all the part which constitut the whole of that anim call woman and compar them analog i never understood rightli the mean of that word quoth my uncl tobi analog repli my father is the certain relat and agreement which differ here a devil of a rap at the door snappd my father definit like hi tobacco pipe in two and at the same time crush the head of as notabl and curiou a dissert as ever wa engend in the womb of specul it wa some month befor my father could get an opportun to be safe deliv of it and at thi hour it is a thing full as problemat as the subject of the dissert itself consid the confus and distress of our domest misadventur which are now come thick one upon the back of anoth whether i shall be abl to find a place for it in the third volum or not chap viii it is about an hour and a half toler good read sinc my uncl tobi rung the bell when obadiah wa order to saddl a hors and go for dr slop the manmidwif so that no one can say with reason that i have not allow obadiah time enough poetic speak and consid the emerg too both to go and come though moral and truli speak the man perhap ha scarc had time to get on hi boot if the hypercrit will go upon thi and is resolv after all to take a pendulum and measur the true distanc betwixt the ring of the bell and the rap at the door and after find it to be no more than two minut thirteen second and three fifth should take upon him to insult over me for such a breach in the uniti or rather probabl of time i would remind him that the idea of durat and of it simpl mode is got mere from the train and success of our idea and is the true scholast pendulum and by which as a scholar i will be tri in thi matter abjur and detest the jurisdict of all other pendulum whatev i would therefor desir him to consid that it is but poor eight mile from shandyhal to dr slop the man midwif hous and that whilst obadiah ha been go those said mile and back i have brought my uncl tobi from namur quit across all flander into england that i have had him ill upon my hand near four year and have sinc travel him and corpor trim in a chariot and four a journey of near two hundr mile down into yorkshir all which put togeth must have prepar the reader imagin for the entranc of dr slop upon the stage as much at least i hope as a danc a song or a concerto between the act if my hypercrit is intract alleg that two minut and thirteen second are no more than two minut and thirteen second when i have said all i can about them and that thi plea though it might save me dramat will damn me biograph render my book from thi veri moment a profess romanc which befor wa a book apocryph if i am thu press i then put an end to the whole object and controversi about it all at onc by acquaint him that obadiah had not got abov threescor yard from the stableyard befor he met with dr slop and inde he gave a dirti proof that he had met with him and wa within an ace of give a tragic one too imagin to yourself but thi had better begin a new chapter chap ix imagin to yourself a littl squat uncourtli figur of a doctor slop of about four feet and a half perpendicular height with a breadth of back and a sesquiped of belli which might have done honor to a sergeant in the horseguard such were the outlin of dr slop figur which if you have read hogarth analysi of beauti and if you have not i wish you would you must know may as certainli be caracaturd and convey to the mind by three stroke as three hundr imagin such a one for such i say were the outlin of dr slop figur come slowli along foot by foot waddl through the dirt upon the vertebra of a littl diminut poni of a pretti color but of strength alack scarc abl to have made an ambl of it under such a fardel had the road been in an ambl condit they were not imagin to yourself obadiah mount upon a strong monster of a coachhors prick into a full gallop and make all practic speed the advers way pray sir let me interest you a moment in thi descript had dr slop beheld obadiah a mile off post in a narrow lane directli toward him at that monstrou rate splash and plung like a devil through thick and thin as he approach would not such a phenomenon with such a vortex of mud and water move along with it round it axi have been a subject of juster apprehens to dr slop in hi situat than the worst of whiston comet to say noth of the nucleu that is of obadiah and the coachhors in my idea the vortex alon of em wa enough to have involv and carri if not the doctor at least the doctor poni quit away with it what then do you think must the terror and hydrophobia of dr slop have been when you read which you are just go to do that he wa advanc thu warili along toward shandyhal and had approach to within sixti yard of it and within five yard of a sudden turn made by an acut angl of the garden wall and in the dirtiest part of a dirti lane when obadiah and hi coachhors turn the corner rapid furiou pop full upon him noth i think in natur can be suppos more terribl than such a rencount so imprompt so ill prepar to stand the shock of it as dr slop wa what could dr slop do he cross himself pugh but the doctor sir wa a papist no matter he had better have kept hold of the pummel he had so nay as it happen he had better have done noth at all for in cross himself he let go hi whip and in attempt to save hi whip betwixt hi knee and hi saddl skirt as it slip he lost hi stirrup in lose which he lost hi seat and in the multitud of all these loss which by the bye show what littl advantag there is in cross the unfortun doctor lost hi presenc of mind so that without wait for obadiah onset he left hi poni to it destini tumbl off it diagon someth in the style and manner of a pack of wool and without ani other consequ from the fall save that of be left as it would have been with the broadest part of him sunk about twelv inch deep in the mire obadiah pull off hi cap twice to dr slop onc as he wa fall and then again when he saw him seat illtim complais had not the fellow better have stop hi hors and got off and help him sir he did all that hi situat would allow but the momentum of the coachhors wa so great that obadiah could not do it all at onc he rode in a circl three time round dr slop befor he could fulli accomplish it ani how and at the last when he did stop hi beast twa done with such an explos of mud that obadiah had better have been a leagu off in short never wa a dr slop so belut and so transubstanti sinc that affair came into fashion chap x when dr slop enter the backparlour where my father and my uncl tobi were discours upon the natur of women it wa hard to determin whether dr slop figur or dr slop presenc occas more surpris to them for as the accid happen so near the hous as not to make it worth while for obadiah to remou him obadiah had led him in as he wa unwip unappoint unan with all hi stain and blotch on him he stood like hamlet ghost motionless and speechless for a full minut and a half at the parlour door obadiah still hold hi hand with all the majesti of mud hi hinder part upon which he had receiv hi fall total besmear and in everi other part of him blotch over in such a manner with obadiah explos that you would have sworn without mental reserv that everi grain of it had taken effect here wa a fair opportun for my uncl tobi to have triumph over my father in hi turn for no mortal who had beheld dr slop in that pickl could have dissent from so much at least of my uncl tobi opinion that mayhap hi sister might not care to let such a dr slop come so near her but it wa the argumentum ad hominem and if my uncl tobi wa not veri expert at it you may think he might not care to use it no the reason wa twa not hi natur to insult dr slop presenc at that time wa no less problemat than the mode of it though it is certain one moment reflect in my father might have solv it for he had appriz dr slop but the week befor that my mother wa at her full reckon and as the doctor had heard noth sinc twa natur and veri polit too in him to have taken a ride to shandyhal as he did mere to see how matter went on but my father mind took unfortun a wrong turn in the investig run like the hypercrit altogeth upon the ring of the bell and the rap upon the door measur their distanc and keep hi mind so intent upon the oper as to have power to think of noth els commonplac infirm of the greatest mathematician work with might and main at the demonstr and so wast all their strength upon it that they have none left in them to draw the corollari to do good with the ring of the bell and the rap upon the door struck likewis strong upon the sensorium of my uncl tobi but it excit a veri differ train of thought the two irreconcil pulsat instantli brought stevinu the great engin along with them into my uncl tobi mind what busi stevinu had in thi affair is the greatest problem of all it shall be solv but not in the next chapter chap xi write when properli manag as you may be sure i think mine is is but a differ name for convers as no one who know what he is about in good compani would ventur to talk all so no author who understand the just boundari of decorum and good breed would presum to think all the truest respect which you can pay to the reader understand is to halv thi matter amic and leav him someth to imagin in hi turn as well as yourself for my own part i am etern pay him compliment of thi kind and do all that lie in my power to keep hi imagin as busi as my own it is hi turn now i have given an ampl descript of dr slop sad overthrow and of hi sad appear in the back parlour hi imagin must now go on with it for a while let the reader imagin then that dr slop ha told hi tale and in what word and with what aggrav hi fanci choos let him suppos that obadiah ha told hi tale also and with such rueful look of affect concern as he think will best contrast the two figur as they stand by each other let him imagin that my father ha step up stair to see my mother and to conclud thi work of imagin let him imagin the doctor wash rub down condol with felicit got into a pair of obadiah pump step forward toward the door upon the veri point of enter upon action truce truce good dr slop stay thi obstetr hand return it safe into thi bosom to keep it warm littl do thou know what obstacl littl do thou think what hidden caus retard it oper have thou dr slop have thou been entrust with the secret articl of thi solemn treati which ha brought thee into thi place art thou awar that at thi instant a daughter of lucina is put obstetr over thi head ala it is too true besid great son of pilumnu what can thou do thou have come forth unarm thou have left thi tire tete thi newinv forcep thi crotchet thi squirt and all thi instrument of salvat and deliver behind thee by heaven at thi moment they are hang up in a green bay bag betwixt thi two pistol at thi bed head ring call send obadiah back upon the coachhors to bring them with all speed make great hast obadiah quoth my father and i will give thee a crown and quoth my uncl tobi i will give him anoth chap xii your sudden and unexpect arriv quoth my uncl tobi address himself to dr slop all three of them sit down to the fire togeth as my uncl tobi began to speak instantli brought the great stevinu into my head who you must know is a favorit author with me then ad my father make use of the argument ad crumenam i will lay twenti guinea to a singl crown piec which will serv to give away to obadiah when he get back that thi same stevinu wa some engin or other or ha wrote someth or other either directli or indirectli upon the scienc of fortif he ha so repli my uncl tobi i knew it said my father though for the soul of me i can not see what kind of connect there can be betwixt dr slop sudden come and a discours upon fortif yet i fear it talk of what we will brother or let the occas be never so foreign or unfit for the subject you are sure to bring it in i would not brother tobi continu my father i declar i would not have my head so full of curtin and hornwork that i dare say you would not quoth dr slop interrupt him and laugh most immoder at hi pun denni the critic could not detest and abhor a pun or the insinu of a pun more cordial than my father he would grow testi upon it at ani time but to be broke in upon by one in a seriou discours wa as bad he would say as a fillip upon the nose he saw no differ sir quoth my uncl tobi address himself to dr slop the curtin my brother shandi mention here have noth to do with bedstead though i know du cang say that bedcurtain in all probabl have taken their name from them nor have the hornwork he speak of ani thing in the world to do with the hornwork of cuckoldom but the curtin sir is the word we use in fortif for that part of the wall or rampart which lie between the two bastion and join them besieg seldom offer to carri on their attack directli against the curtin for thi reason becaus they are so well flank it is the case of other curtin quoth dr slop laugh howev continu my uncl tobi to make them sure we gener choos to place ravelin befor them take care onli to extend them beyond the foss or ditch the common men who know veri littl of fortif confound the ravelin and the half moon togeth though they are veri differ thing not in their figur or construct for we make them exactli alik in all point for they alway consist of two face make a salient angl with the gorg not straight but in form of a crescent where then lie the differ quoth my father a littl testili in their situat answer my uncl tobi for when a ravelin brother stand befor the curtin it is a ravelin and when a ravelin stand befor a bastion then the ravelin is not a ravelin it is a half moon a half moon likewis is a half moon and no more so long as it stand befor it bastion but wa it to chang place and get befor the curtin twould be no longer a half moon a half moon in that case is not a half moon it is no more than a ravelin i think quoth my father that the nobl scienc of defens ha it weak side as well as other as for the hornwork high ho sigh my father which continu my uncl tobi my brother wa speak of they are a veri consider part of an outwork they are call by the french engin ouvrag a corn and we gener make them to cover such place as we suspect to be weaker than the rest it is form by two epaul or demibast they are veri pretti and if you will take a walk i will engag to show you one well worth your troubl i own continu my uncl tobi when we crown them they are much stronger but then they are veri expens and take up a great deal of ground so that in my opinion they are most of use to cover or defend the head of a camp otherwis the doubl tenail by the mother who bore us brother tobi quoth my father not abl to hold out ani longer you would provok a saint here have you got us i know not how not onli sous into the middl of the old subject again but so full is your head of these confound work that though my wife is thi moment in the pain of labor and you hear her cri out yet noth will serv you but to carri off the manmidwif accoucheur if you pleas quoth dr slop with all my heart repli my father i dont care what they call you but i wish the whole scienc of fortif with all it inventor at the devil it ha been the death of thousand and it will be mine in the end i would not i would not brother tobi have my brain so full of sap mine blind gabion palisado ravelin halfmoon and such trumperi to be proprietor of namur and of all the town in flander with it my uncl tobi wa a man patient of injuri not from want of courag i have told you in the fifth chapter of thi second book that he wa a man of courag and will add here that where just occas present or call it forth i know no man under whose arm i would sooner have taken shelter nor did thi aris from ani insens or obtus of hi intellectu part for he felt thi insult of my father as feelingli as a man could do but he wa of a peac placid natur no jar element in it all wa mix up so kindli within him my uncl tobi had scarc a heart to retali upon a fli go say he one day at dinner to an overgrown one which had buzz about hi nose and torment him cruelli all dinnertim and which after infinit attempt he had caught at last as it flew by him i will not hurt thee say my uncl tobi rise from hi chair and go across the room with the fli in hi hand i will not hurt a hair of thi head go say he lift up the sash and open hi hand as he spoke to let it escap go poor devil get thee gone whi should i hurt thee thi world sure is wide enough to hold both thee and me i wa but ten year old when thi happen but whether it wa that the action itself wa more in unison to my nerv at that age of piti which instantli set my whole frame into one vibrat of most pleasur sensat or how far the manner and express of it might go toward it or in what degre or by what secret magic a tone of voic and harmoni of movement attun by merci might find a passag to my heart i know not thi i know that the lesson of univers good will then taught and imprint by my uncl tobi ha never sinc been worn out of my mind and though i would not depreci what the studi of the litera humanior at the univers have done for me in that respect or discredit the other help of an expens educ bestow upon me both at home and abroad sinc yet i often think that i owe one half of my philanthropi to that one accident impress thi is to serv for parent and governor instead of a whole volum upon the subject i could not give the reader thi stroke in my uncl tobi pictur by the instrument with which i drew the other part of it that take in no more than the mere hobbyhors like thi is a part of hi moral charact my father in thi patient endur of wrong which i mention wa veri differ as the reader must long ago have note he had a much more acut and quick sensibl of natur attend with a littl sore of temper though thi never transport him to ani thing which look like malign yet in the littl rub and vexat of life twa apt to show itself in a drollish and witti kind of peevish he wa howev frank and gener in hi natur at all time open to convict and in the littl ebullit of thi subacid humor toward other but particularli toward my uncl tobi whom he truli love he would feel more pain ten time told except in the affair of my aunt dinah or where an hypothesi wa concern than what he ever gave the charact of the two brother in thi view of them reflect light upon each other and appear with great advantag in thi affair which aros about stevinu i need not tell the reader if he keep a hobbyhors that a man hobbyhors is as tender a part as he ha about him and that these unprovok stroke at my uncl tobi could not be unfelt by him no as i said abov my uncl tobi did feel them and veri sensibl too pray sir what said he how did he behav oh sir it wa great for as soon as my father had done insult hi hobbyhors he turn hi head without the least emot from dr slop to whom he wa address hi discours and look up into my father face with a counten spread over with so much good natur so placid so fratern so inexpress tender toward him it penetr my father to hi heart he rose up hastili from hi chair and seiz hold of both my uncl tobi hand as he spoke brother tobi said he i beg thi pardon forgiv i pray thee thi rash humor which my mother gave me my dear dear brother answer my uncl tobi rise up by my father help say no more about it you are heartili welcom had it been ten time as much brother but it is ungener repli my father to hurt ani man a brother wors but to hurt a brother of such gentl manner so unprovok and so unres it is base by heaven it is cowardli you are heartili welcom brother quoth my uncl tobi had it been fifti time as much besid what have i to do my dear tobi cri my father either with your amus or your pleasur unless it wa in my power which it is not to increas their measur brother shandi answer my uncl tobi look wist in hi face you are much mistaken in thi point for you do increas my pleasur veri much in beget children for the shandi famili at your time of life but by that sir quoth dr slop mr shandi increas hi own not a jot quoth my father chap xiii my brother doe it quoth my uncl tobi out of principl in a familyway i suppos quoth dr slop pshaw said my father it is not worth talk of chap xiv at the end of the last chapter my father and my uncl tobi were left both stand like brutu and cassiu at the close of the scene make up their account as my father spoke the three last word he sat down my uncl tobi exactli follow hi exampl onli that befor he took hi chair he rung the bell to order corpor trim who wa in wait to step home for stevinu my uncl tobi hous be no further off than the opposit side of the way some men would have drop the subject of stevinu but my uncl tobi had no resent in hi heart and he went on with the subject to show my father that he had none your sudden appear dr slop quoth my uncl resum the discours instantli brought stevinu into my head my father you may be sure did not offer to lay ani more wager upon stevinuss head becaus continu my uncl tobi the celebr sail chariot which belong to princ mauric and wa of such wonder contriv and veloc as to carri half a dozen peopl thirti german mile in i dont know how few minut wa invent by stevinu that great mathematician and engin you might have spare your servant the troubl quoth dr slop as the fellow is lame of go for stevinuss account of it becaus in my return from leyden through the hagu i walk as far as schevl which is two long mile on purpos to take a view of it that is noth repli my uncl tobi to what the learn peireskiu did who walk a matter of five hundr mile reckon from pari to schevl and from schevl to pari back again in order to see it and noth els some men can not bear to be outgon the more fool peireskiu repli dr slop but mark twa out of no contempt of peireskiu at all but that peireskiuss indefatig labor in trudg so far on foot out of love for the scienc reduc the exploit of dr slop in that affair to noth the more fool peireskiu said he again whi so repli my father take hi brother part not onli to make repar as fast as he could for the insult he had given him which sat still upon my father mind but partli that my father began realli to interest himself in the discours whi so said he whi is peireskiu or ani man els to be abus for an appetit for that or ani other morsel of sound knowledg for notwithstand i know noth of the chariot in question continu he the inventor of it must have had a veri mechan head and though i can not guess upon what principl of philosophi he ha achiev it yet certainli hi machin ha been construct upon solid one be they what they will or it could not have answer at the rate my brother mention it answer repli my uncl tobi as well if not better for as peireskiu elegantli express it speak of the veloc of it motion tam citu erat quam erat ventu which unless i have forgot my latin is that it wa as swift as the wind itself but pray dr slop quoth my father interrupt my uncl though not without beg pardon for it at the same time upon what principl wa thi selfsam chariot set ago upon veri pretti principl to be sure repli dr slop and i have often wonder continu he evad the question whi none of our gentri who live upon larg plain like thi of our especi they whose wive are not past childbear attempt noth of thi kind for it would not onli be infinit expediti upon sudden call to which the sex is subject if the wind onli serv but would be excel good husbandri to make use of the wind which cost noth and which eat noth rather than hors which the devil take em both cost and eat a great deal for that veri reason repli my father becaus they cost noth and becaus they eat noth the scheme is bad it is the consumpt of our product as well as the manufactur of them which give bread to the hungri circul trade bring in money and support the valu of our land and though i own if i wa a princ i would gener recompens the scientif head which brought forth such contriv yet i would as peremptorili suppress the use of them my father here had got into hi element and wa go on as prosper with hi dissert upon trade as my uncl tobi had befor upon hi of fortif but to the loss of much sound knowledg the destini in the morn had decre that no dissert of ani kind should be spun by my father that day for as he open hi mouth to begin the next sentenc chap xv in poppd corpor trim with stevinu but twa too late all the discours had been exhaust without him and wa run into a new channel you may take the book home again trim said my uncl tobi nod to him but prithe corpor quoth my father droll look first into it and see if thou can spi aught of a sail chariot in it corpor trim by be in the servic had learn to obey and not to remonstr so take the book to a sidet and run over the leav an pleas your honor said trim i can see no such thing howev continu the corpor droll a littl in hi turn i will make sure work of it an pleas your honor so take hold of the two cover of the book one in each hand and let the leav fall down as he bent the cover back he gave the book a good sound shake there is someth fallen out howev said trim an pleas your honor but it is not a chariot or ani thing like one prithe corpor said my father smile what is it then i think answer trim stoop to take it up it is more like a sermon for it begin with a text of scriptur and the chapter and vers and then goe on not as a chariot but like a sermon directli the compani smile i can not conceiv how it is possibl quoth my uncl tobi for such a thing as a sermon to have got into my stevinu i think it is a sermon repli trim but if it pleas your honor as it is a fair hand i will read you a page for trim you must know love to hear himself read almost as well as talk i have ever a strong propens said my father to look into thing which cross my way by such strang fatal as these and as we have noth better to do at least till obadiah get back i should be oblig to you brother if dr slop ha no object to it to order the corpor to give us a page or two of it if he is as abl to do it as he seem will an pleas your honor quoth trim i offici two whole campaign in flander as clerk to the chaplain of the regiment he can read it quoth my uncl tobi as well as i can trim i assur you wa the best scholar in my compani and should have had the next halberd but for the poor fellow misfortun corpor trim laid hi hand upon hi heart and made an humbl bow to hi master then lay down hi hat upon the floor and take up the sermon in hi left hand in order to have hi right at liberti he advanc noth doubt into the middl of the room where he could best see and be best seen by hi audienc chap xvi if you have ani object said my father address himself to dr slop not in the least repli dr slop for it doe not appear on which side of the question it is wrote it may be a composit of a divin of our church as well as your so that we run equal risk it is wrote upon neither side quoth trim for it is onli upon conscienc an pleas your honor trim reason put hi audienc into good humor all but dr slop who turn hi head about toward trim look a littl angri begin trim and read distinctli quoth my father i will an pleas your honor repli the corpor make a bow and bespeak attent with a slight movement of hi right hand chap xvii but befor the corpor begin i must first give you a descript of hi attitud otherwis he will natur stand repres by your imagin in an uneasi postur stiff perpendicular divid the weight of hi bodi equal upon both leg hi eye fix as if on duti hi look determin clinch the sermon in hi left hand like hi firelock in a word you would be apt to paint trim as if he wa stand in hi platoon readi for action hi attitud wa as unlik all thi as you can conceiv he stood befor them with hi bodi sway and bent forward just so far as to make an angl of degre and a half upon the plain of the horizon which sound orat to whom i address thi know veri well to be the true persuas angl of incid in ani other angl you may talk and preach it is certain and it is done everi day but with what effect i leav the world to judg the necess of thi precis angl of degre and a half to a mathemat exact doe it not show us by the way how the art and scienc mutual befriend each other how the duce corpor trim who knew not so much as an acut angl from an obtus one came to hit it so exactli or whether it wa chanc or natur or good sens or imit etc shall be comment upon in that part of thi cyclopaedia of art and scienc where the instrument part of the eloqu of the senat the pulpit the bar the coffeehous the bedchamb and firesid fall under consider he stood for i repeat it to take the pictur of him in at one view with hi bodi sway and somewhat bent forward hi rightleg firm under him sustain seveneighth of hi whole weight the foot of hi leftleg the defect of which wa no disadvantag to hi attitud advanc a littl not later nor forward but in a line betwixt them hi knee bent but that not violent but so as to fall within the limit of the line of beauti and i add of the line of scienc too for consid it had one eighth part of hi bodi to bear up so that in thi case the posit of the leg is determin becaus the foot could be no further advanc or the knee more bent than what would allow him mechan to receiv an eighth part of hi whole weight under it and to carri it too thi i recommend to painter need i add to orat i think not for unless they practic it they must fall upon their nose so much for corpor trim bodi
