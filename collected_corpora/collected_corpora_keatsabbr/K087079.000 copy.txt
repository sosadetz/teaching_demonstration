to which we are oblig by the frame of our natur and by the relat we bear to god and to the subject of hi govern for my part i confess that mani have been the fail of my life and great the defect of my

comfort my self and when it ha not been in my power to reliev i have griev for the scanti accommod of other mani troublesom and expens offic i have undertaken to do good to men and ever social and free have i been in my demeanor easi and smooth in my address and therefor i trust that whenev i am remov from thi horizon it will be from a dark and cloudi state to that of joy light and full revel thi felicit my everi day let what will happen from without thi support me under everi afflict and enabl me to mentain a habit of satisfact and joy in the gener cours of my life went to the univers in the thing of my childhood are not worth set down and therefor i commenc my life from the first month of the seventeenth year of my age when i wa sent to the univers and enter a pension though i had a larger yearli allow than ani fellowcommon of my colleg i wa resolv to read there and determin to improv my natur faculti to the utmost of my power natur i wa sensibl had bestow no geniu on me thi and understand are onli the privileg of extraordinari person who receiv from heaven the happi conjunct of qualiti that they may execut great and nobl design and acquir the highest pitch of excel in the profess they turn to if they will take the pain to perfect the unit qualiti by art and care avoid run into capric and paradox the rock on which mani a geniu ha split but then i had a toler share of natur understand and from my infanc wa teachabl and alway attent to the direct of good sens thi i knew might rise with some labor to a half merit though it could never gain immort upon ani account and thi wa enough for me i want onli to acquir such degre of perfect as lay within the small sphere natur had chalk out for me a collegelif to thi purpos i devot my collegelif to book and for five year that i resid in the univers convers so much with the dead that i had veri littl intercours with the live so total had letter engag my mind that i wa but littl affect toward most other thing walk and music were my favorit recreat and almost the onli one i delight in i had hardli a thought at that time of the foolish chois and pursuit of men those fatal choic and pursuit which are owe to fals judgment and to a habit of act precipitantli without examin the fanci and appetit and therefor veri rare went into the pleasur and divers which men of fortun in a univers too commonli indulg in my relax after studi wa my germanflut and the convers of some ingeni sober friend gener my privat tutor who wa a bright and excel man and if the weather permit i walk out into the countri sever mile at thi exercis i had often one or other with me but for the most part wa oblig to go alon my dog and my gun howev were divers enough on the way and they frequent led me into scene of entertain which last longer than the day some of them you will find in thi journal the histori of the beauti harriot noel you shall have by and by a cours of read in a colleg at present my scheme requir me to set down the method i pursu in my read and let my reader know the issu of my studi my time i devot to philosophi cosmographi mathemat and the languag for four year and the fifth i gave to histori of mr lock essay the first book i took into my hand after receiv my note of admiss wa the essay of that fine geniu mr lock and i wa so pleas with thi clear and accur writer that i look into noth els by read it three time over i had made a thorough acquaint with my own understand he taught me to examin my abil and enabl me to see what object my mind wa fit to deal with he led me into the sanctuari of vaniti and ignor and show me how greatli true knowledg depend on a right mean of word and a just signific of express in sum from the essay my understand receiv veri great benefit and to it i owe what improv i have made in the reason given me if i could i would persuad all young gentlemen to read it over and over with great attent and i am sure they would find themselv veri richli reward for their pain in read it they would acquir that just and truth of understand which is the great perfect of ration be natur philosophi when i had done for a time with thi admir essay i then began to studi the first principl of thing the structur of the univers the contextur of human bodi the properti of beast the virtu of plant and the qualiti of metal and wa quit charm with the contempl of the beauti order and wise final caus of natur in all her law and product the studi had a delight influenc on the temper of my mind and inspir into it a love of order in my heart and in my outward manner it likewis led me to the great first caus and in repeat view of harmoni wisdom and good in all the work of natur rivit upon my mind a fix convict that all is under the administr of a gener mind as far remot from all malic as from all weak whether in respect of understand or of power thi gave me a due affect toward the infinit perfect parent of natur and as i contempl hi gloriou work i wa oblig in transport to confess that he deserv our love and admir thi did also satisfi me that whatev the order of the world produc is in the main both just and good and of consequ that we ought in the best manner to support whatev hardship are to be endur for virtu sake that acquiesc and complac with respect to ill accid ill men and injuri ought to be our part under a perfect administr and with benign and constanc we must ever act if there be a settl persuas that all thing are frame and govern by a univers mind such wa the effect the studi of natur philosophi had upon my soul it set beyond all doubt befor me the moral perfect of the creator and governor of the univers and if thi almighti god i said is perfect wisdom and virtu doe it not follow that he must approv and love those who are at due pain to improv in wisdom and what he love and delight in must he not make happi thi is an evid truth it render the caus of virtu quit triumphant moral philosophi but upon ethic or moral philosophi i dwelt the longest thi is the proper food of the soul and what perfect her in all the virtu and qualif of a gentleman thi scienc i collect in the first place from the ancient sage and philosoph and studi all the moral writer of greec and rome with great pleasur i saw that these immort author had delin as far as human reason can go that cours of life which is most accord to the intent of natur and most happi had shown that thi univers and human natur in particular wa form by the wisdom and counsel of a deiti and that from the constitut of our natur variou duti aros that sinc god is the origin independ be complet in all possibl perfect of boundless power wisdom and good the creator contriv and governor of thi world to whom mankind are indebt for innumer benefit most gratuit bestow we ought to manifest the most ardent love and vener toward the deiti and worship him with affect of soul suit to the preemin and infinit grandeur of the origin caus of all ought to obey him as far as human weak can go and humbl submit and resign ourselv and all our interest to hi will continu confid in hi good and constantli imit him as far as our weak natur is capabl thi is due to that origin most graciou power who form us and with a liber hand suppli us with all thing conduc to such pleasur and happi as our natur can receiv that in respect of mankind our natur sens of right and wrong point out to us the duti to be perform toward other and the kind affect implant by natur excit us to the discharg of them that by the law of our constitut and natur justic and benevol are prescrib and aid and an intercours of mutual offic requir not onli to secur our pleasur and happi but to preserv ourselv in safeti and in life that the law of natur or natur right forbid everi instanc of injustic a violat of life liberti health properti and the exercis of our honor kind power are not onli a spring of vigor effort to do good to other and therebi secur the common happi but they realli procur us a joy and peac an inward applaus and extern advantag while injustic and malic anger hatr envi and reveng are often matter of shame and remors and contain noth joy noth gloriou in the greatest affluenc the savag men are miser that as to ourselv the voic of reason declar that we ought to employ our abil and opportun in improv our mind to an extens knowledg of natur in the scienc and by dilig medit and observ acquir that prudenc justic temper and fortitud which should constantli govern our live that solid prudenc which abhor rash inconsider a foolish selfconfid and craft and under a high sens of moral excel consid and doe what is realli advantag in life that justic which constantli regard the common interest and in subservi to it give to each one whatev is due to him upon ani natur claim that temper which restrain and regul the lower appetit and display the grace and beauti of manner and that fortitud which repress all vain and excess fear give us a superior to all the extern accid of our mortal state and strengthen the soul against all toil or danger we may be expos to in discharg of our duti as an earli and pain death with virtu and honor is highli prefer to the longest ignomini life and no advantag can be compar in point of happi with the approb of god and of our own heart that if in thi manner we live prepar for ani honor servic to god our fellow and ourselv and practic pieti toward god good will toward men and immedi aim at our own perfect then we may expect notwithstand our be involv in manifold weak and disord of soul that the divin good and clemenc will have merci on such as sincer love him and desir to serv him with duti and gratitud will be propiti and placabl to the penit and all who exert their utmost endeavor in the pursuit of virtu and sinc the perfect of virtu must constitut the suprem felic of man our effort to attain it must be effectu in obtain complet felic or at least some lower degre of it of reveal religion thi beauti moral philosophi i found scatter in the wtite of the old theist philosoph and with great pain reduc the variou lesson to a system of activ and virtuou offic but thi i knew wa what the major of mankind were incap of do and if they could do it i saw it wa far inferior to revel everi sunday i appropri to the studi of revel religion and perceiv as i read the sacr record that the work of plato and cicero and epictetu and all the uninspir sage of antiqu were but weak rule in respect of the divin oracl it is the merci and power of god in the triumph of grace that restor mankind from the bondag and ignor of idolatri to thi the sinner owe the convers of hi soul it is the statut of the lord that rejoic the heart and enlighten the eye what are all the reason of the philosoph to the melodi of that heavenli voic which cri continu come unto me all ye that travel and are heavi laden and i will refresh you and what could their lesson avail without those express promis of grace and spiritu assist which the blood of the new coven confirm to mankind the philosophi of greec and rome wa admir for the time and men but it admit of no comparison with the divin lesson of our holi religion and the charter of god pardon grant to us by hi bless son besid the philosoph were in some degre dark and doubt in respect of death and futur and in relat to thi world there is not a power in their discours to preserv us from be undon by allur in the midst of plenti and to secur our peac against the casualti of fortun and the torment of disappoint to save us from the care and sollicitud which attend upon larg possess and give us a mind capabl of relish the good thing befor us to make us easi and satisfi as to the present and render us secur and void of fear as to the futur these thing we learn from revel and are inform by the sacr record onli that if we are place here in the midst of mani fear and sorrow and are often perplex with evil in thi world yet they are so mani warn not to set up our rest here but to keep a steadfast eye upon the thing which god ha prepar for those who love him it is the gospel inform us there is anoth scene prepar for the moral world and that justic onli wait to see the full proof of the righteous or unright of men that that scene will open with the judgment seat of christ and we shall either receiv glori and immort if we have obey the call of grace to virtu and holi or be doom to the most dread miseri if we reject the counsel of god and live quit thoughtless of the great concern of etern these consider made me prefer revel religion in the begin of my ration life the moral of the ancient philosoph i admir with delight i studi their write and receiv i grate confess much improv from them but the religion of our bless lord i declar for and look on the promis messiah as the most consumm bless god could bestow or man receiv god have rais up hi son jesu sent him to bless you in turn everi one of you from your iniqu and would men but hear and obey thi lifegiv redeem hi gospel would restor reason and religion to their right author over mankind and make all virtu and true good flourish in the earth of fals religion but i must observ that by the religion of the new testament i do not mean ani of those modern scheme of religion which discov the evid mark and signatur of superstit and enthusiasm or of knaveri and impostur those system which even miracl can not prove to be true becaus the pieti are absurd inconsist and contradictori the notion that are not character by the reason of thing and the moral fit of action i consid as repugn to the verac wisdom and good of the almighti and conclud that that onli could be christian religion which bear the visibl mark and signatur of benevol social happi and moral fit and wa brought down from heaven to instruct mankind in the worship of one etern mind and bring them to repent and amend of life thi wa the religion i found in my bibl i saw with pleasur as i thought went through the divin page that natur religion is the foundat and support of revel suppli the defect of natur but never attempt to overthrow the establish principl of it cast new light upon the dictat of reason but never overthrow them pure theism and christ the appoint mediat advoc and judg by a commiss from god the father to me appear to be the gospel and the direct of the holi spirit to believ in one suprem independ first caus and worship in spirit and truth thi one god and father of all in the name of christ jesu as the discipl of the messiah to copi after the life of our bless savior and to the utmost of our abil obey all hi command thi wa the religion i found in the write of the apostl and i then determin to regard onli thi gospeldoctrin cosmographi and mathemat the manner of my studi cosmographi and mathemat is not worth set down as there wa noth uncommon in it in the one i onli learn to distinguish climat latitud and the four divis of the world the provinc nation kingdom and republ compris therein and to be abl to discours upon them and in the other i went no further than to make myself a master of vulgar and decim arithmet the doctrin of infinit seri and the applic of algebra to the higher geometri of curv algebra i wa charm with and found so much pleasur in resolv it question that i have often sat till morn at the engag work without a notion of it be day till i open the shutter of my closet i recommend thi studi in particular to young

those state and kingdom their action militari and civil the charact and action of the great men that flourish under them and the law the art learn and manner i care mark down and observ not onli how the first govern were form but what the progress wa of industri and properti which may be call the gener principl of empir when i had done with ancient histori i sat down to the best modern stori i could get and read of distant nation befor i began to studi my countri constitut histori and law when i had finish the histori of franc and spain and itali and germani and mani more then i turn to great britain and in the first place took a view of the english constitut and govern in the ancient book of the common law and some more modern writer who out of them have given an account of thi govern from thenc i proceed to our histori and with it join in everi king reign the law then made thi gave me an insight into the reason of our statut and show me the true ground upon which they came to be made and what weight they ought to have by thi mean i read the histori of my countri with intellig and wa abl to examin into the excel or defect of it govern and to judg of the fit or unfit of it order and law by thi method i did likewis know enough of the law for an english gentleman though quit ignor of the chican or wrangl and captiou part of the law and wa well acquaint with the true measur of right and wrong the art how to avoid do right and to secur one self in do wrong i never look into a reflect on histori thu did i read histori and mani nobl lesson i learn from it just notion of true worth true great and solid happi it taught me to place merit where it onli lie not in birth not in beauti not in rich not in extern show and magnific not in voluptu but in a firm adher to truth and rectitud in an untaint heart that would not pollut or prostitut it integr in ani degre to gain the highest worldli honor or to ward off the greatest worldli miseri thi is true magnanim and

govern and religion the case howev is that the gener of mankind are too corrupt to be govern by the great univers law of social natur and to gratifi ambit avaric and the like employ a cun or power to seiz the natur right and properti of other and therefor to natur virtu ground on the reason and fit of thing in themselv the first and princip mean of secur the peac and happi of societi it wa necessari to add two other grand principl civil govern and religion and so have three conduc mean to social happi these three are necessari to the be of a public and of them religion as i take it is of the first consequ for the choic few onli mind a natur virtu or benevol flow from the reason natur and fit of thing and civil govern can not alway secur the happi of mankind in particular case but religion rightli understood and fix upon it true and proper foundat might do the work in conjunct with the other two principl and secur the happi of societi if mankind were brought to the belief and worship of one onli true god and to a sincer obedi to hi will as we have it discov in revel i think appetit and passion would ceas to invad by violenc or fraud or set up for privat interest in opposit to the public stock or common good but ala religion is so far from be rightli understood that it is render by some explain the most doubt and disput thing in the world they have given it more phase than the moon and made it everi thing and noth while they are scream or forc the peopl into their sever faction thi destroy the moment of religion and the multitud are therebi wander into endless maze and perplex and render a hair stare wrath rabbl instead of be transform into such christian as fill the first church at jerusalem christian who acknowledg and worship god the father almighti in the name of christ that is under a belief of that author and power which the father of the univers ha for the good of mankind confer upon him and in humil and meek in mortif and selfdeni in a renunci of the spirit wisdom and honor of thi world in a love of god and desir of do god will and seek onli hi honor were by the gospel made like unto christ golden religion golden age the doctrin of christian wa then a restor of true religion the practic of christian a restor of human natur but now ala too mani explain are employ in darken and make doubt the revel will of god and by paraphras exposit commentari note and gloss have almost render revel useless what do we see in the vast territori of poperi but a perfect diabol in the place of the religion of our lord doctrin the most impiou and absurd the most inconsist and contradictori in themselv the most hurt and mischiev in their consequ the whole support by persecut by the sophistri of learn knave and the trick of juggl priest and if we turn our eye from these region of impostur and cruelti to the realm of protest do we not find some learn christian criti and expositor reduc the inspir write to a dark scienc without regard to the natur and intrins charact of their doctrin do they not advanc notion as true and divin which have not one appear of divin author but on the contrari mililit with the reason of thing and the moral fit of action and are so far from be plain and clear free from all doubt or ambigu and suit to the understand and capac of men that the dark of them render such pretend revel of littl servic and impeach the verac wisdom and good of god ala too mani explain are clamor under the infal strength of their own persuas and exert everi power to unman us into believ how the apostl argu for the great excel and digniti of christian is not with them the question so far as i am abl to judg from their learn write but the father and our spiritu superior have put upon the sacr write the proper explic and we must receiv the truth as they dispens it to us thi is not right in my concept i own it doe not seem to answer the end of the messiah come which wa to restor reason and religion to their right author over mankind and to make all virtu and true good flourish in the earth the most perfect bless to be sure that god could bestow on man or man receiv from god thi bless we must miss if human author is to pin us down to what it pleas to call sens of scriptur and will set up the judgment of fallibl men as the test of christian the christian laiti are miser inde if they be put under an oblig to find that to be truth which is taught by these leader in truth we should be unhappi men with a revel in our church and our closet if the leader had a right to make their own faith pass for the faith of the apostl or if we refus it might lanc the weapon of thi world at their peopl what must we do then as true christian i think for my self that we ought to form our judgment in matter of faith upon a strict seriou and imparti examin of the holi scriptur without ani regard to the judgment of other or human author whatev that we ought to open the sacr record without mind ani system and from the revel word of god learn that christian doe not consist in a jingl of unintellig sound and new fundament hewn out by craft enthusiasm or bigotri and maintain with an outrag of uncharit zeal which deliv christian to the flame of an etern hell but that the heavenli religion of our lord consist in look on the promis messiah as the most consumm bless god could bestow or man receiv and that jesu is that messiah in act accord to the rule of the gospel and in studi to imit god who is the most perfect understand natur in all hi moral perfect in becom the children of god by be accord to our capac perfect as he is perfect and holi as he is holi and merci as he is merci and in our whole moral behavior as like to him as possibl in a word to flee injustic oppress intemper impur pride unmerci reveng to practic justic pieti temper chastiti humil benefic placabl to turn from our iniqu to the practic of all virtu and through the alon mediat of the onlybegotten son of god believ in and worship the etern mind the one suprem spirit in hope of a gloriou immort through the sanctif of the holi ghost these are the thing the lord came down to teach mankind for the new testament itself then we must declar and look upon it as the onli guid or rule of faith it is now the onli deliver of the declar of our lord and the rule in our enquiri is that everi thing necessari to be believ by a christian is in those book not left to be gather by consequ or implic but the thing necessari to obtain the favor of god promis to christian are expressli declar if thi wa not the case if thing absolut necessari were not expressli proclaim to be so the gospel revel would be no rule at all to the plain and satisfactori method of seek for the faith in the sacr book there are mani adversari and mani object rais there are say a great man a veri numer bodi of christian who know no other guid but the live guid of the present church and acknowledg no other faith for the faith onc deliv to the saint but that which is now deliv to them by their present ruler as such to establish thi point the greater part of these lay down the infal of the present church and of everi man of the past age through whose mouth or by whose hand the present tradit of faith have descend to them and thi inde would be a veri good method if that singl proof of infal could be prove but thi is a point so gross and so utterli void of all proof that a great bodi of the christian world have broke loos from the power of thi monster and declar for the new testament itself as the onli guid or rule of faith the onli deliver of the faith to us of later age when thi come howev to be put in practic too mani of the same person who set the scriptur up as the onli guid turn round on a sudden and let us know that they mean by it not these sacr origin write themselv but the interpret or sens put upon them by our spiritu superior to which we are bound to submit and put under an oblig to find that to be the truth which is taught by these leader but to thi we repli with reason that though we ought to pay a regard of seriou attent to those whose busi it is to find out and dispens the truth and show the respect of a due examin of what they affirm yet we must not yield the submiss due onli to infal it is our glori not to submit to the voic of ani man we must reserv that regard for god and for christ in matter of faith onc deliv to the saint other again of the reform tell us that the surer way of know what wa deliv near eighteen hundr year ago is to take the origin faith from the council and father grave and good men who met and writ for the settl of the faith and to thi we answer that these wise and good men can not give so good an account of the faith contain in the origin book as the book themselv which contain it to give an exampl to the purpos if we would know the doctrin of the church of england at the reform it is not the write of ani particular divin mani year after that period that we must consult or ani assembl of them but the authent act and declar and sermon made and record at the time for mani of the doctrin thought essenti at the reform have been sinc chang by gradual alter by explain use their own style and manner of express and introduc their own scheme of philosophi and judgment in comment into the scheme of doctrin to be explain thi produc great variat from what wa onc settl what wa onc esteem fundament is therebi alter let thi be appli to the first christian writer after the apostl were depart and as their languag and philosophi were variou and they differ from one anoth great variat must creep into the doctrin deliv by them it follow then that noth but what is record in the first origin book themselv can be firm and stabl to us in point of faith in the origin book onli we can find the faith without that confus and dark which human explic and addit have brought in by way of light the stori of harriot noel but it is time to tell my reader the stori of the beauti harriot noel which i promis in my third memorandum on the gloriou first of august befor the beast were rous from their lodg or the bird had soar upward to pour forth their morn harmoni while the mountain and the grove were overshadow by a dun obscur and the dawn still dappl the drowsi east with spot of gray in short befor the sun wa up or with hi auspici presenc began to anim inferior natur i left my chamber and

likewis babbl along and even hebru stray not round thrace with a purer and cooler stream fon etiam rivo dare nomen idoneu ut nec frigidior thracam nec purior ambiat hebru a countri seat in thi sweet and delici solitud i crept on for some time by the side of the murmur stream and follow as it wind through the vale till i came to a littl harmonick build that had everi charm and proport architectur could give it it wa situat on a rise ground in a broad part of the fruit valley and surround with a garden that invit a pensiv wander to roam in it delight retreat and walk amazingli beauti everi side of thi fine spot wa plant thick with underwood and kept so low as not to prevent a prospect to everi pleas remot object find one of the garden door left open i enter immedi and to screen my self from the scorch beam of the sun got into an imbow way that led me to a larg fountain in a ring or circular open and from thenc by a gradual easi shadi ascent to a semicircular amphitheatr of evergreen that wa quit charm in thi were sever seat for eas repast or retir and at either end of it a rotunda or templ of the ionick order one of them wa convert into a grotto or shellhous in which a polit of fanci had produc and blend the greatest beauti of natur and decor the other wa a librari fill with the finest book and a vast varieti of mathemat instrument here i saw miss noel sit and so intent at write that she did not take ani notic of me as i stood at the window in astonish look at the thing befor me and especi at the amaz beauti of her face and the splendour of her eye as she rais them now and then from the paper she writ on to look into a hebrew bibl that lay open upon a small desk befor her the whole scene wa so veri uncommon and so vastli amaz that i thought my self for a while on some spot of magic ground and almost doubt the realiti of what my eye beheld till miss noel by accid look full at me and then came forward to the open window to know who i want befor i could answer i found a vener old gentleman stand by my side and he seem much more surpris at the sight of me than hi daughter wa for as thi young ladi told me afterward she guess at onc the whole affair see me with my gun and dog in a shoot dress and knew it wa a natur curios brought me into the garden and stope me at the window when i saw her in such an attitud and in such a place thi i assur them wa the truth of my case with thi small addit howev that i wa readi to perish for want of someth to eat have been from four in the morn at hard exercis and had not yet broke my fast if thi be the case say the good old man you are welcom sir to edenpark and you shall soon have the best breakfast our hous afford upon thi mr noel brought me into hi hous and the love harriot made tea for me and had such plenti of fine

manner and a social good so charm in her talk and temper that it wa unspeak delight to sit at tabl with her she ask me a number of question relat to thing and book and peopl and there wa so much good sens in everi inquiri so much good humor in her reflect and replic that i wa entir charm with her mind and lost in admir when i contempl the wonder of her face and the beauti of her person when breakfast wa over it wa time for me to depart and i made half a dozen attempt to rise from my chair but without her lay a rosi finger on me thi illustri maid had so total subdu my soul and depriv me of all motiv power that i sat like the renown princ of the massaget who wa stiffen by enchant in the apart of the princess phedima as we read in amadi de gaul thi miss noel saw veri plain and in compass to my misfortun gener threw in a hint now and then for a littl farther convers to color my unreason delay but thi could not have been of servic much longer as the clock had struck twelv if the old gentleman her father had not return to us and told me he insist on my stay to dine with him for he love to take a glass after dinner with a faceti companion and would be oblig to me for my compani at present mr noel continu you will excus me sir as busi engag me till we dine but my daughter will chat the hour away with you and show you the curios of her librari and grott harriot will suppli my place thi wa a delight invit inde and after return my hearti thank to the old gentleman for the favor he did me i address my self to miss noel when her father wa gone and we were walk back to the librari in the garden and told her ingenu that though i could not be posit as to the situat of my soul whether i wa in love with her or not as i never had experienc the passion befor nor knew what it wa to admir a woman have live till that morn in a state of indiffer to her sex yet i found veri strang emot within me and i wa sure i could not leav her without the most live and afflict inquietud you will pardon i hope madam thi effus of my heart and suffer me to demonstr by a thousand and a thousand action that i honor you in a manner unutter and from thi time can imagin no happi but with you a convers with miss noel in relat to the languag of adam and the primaev of the hebrew tongu sir thi inimit maid repli you are an entir stranger to me and to declar a passion on a few hour acquaint must be either to tri my weak or becaus you think a young woman is incap of relish ani thing but such stuff when alon in convers with a gentleman i beg then i may hear no more of thi and as i am sure you can talk upon mani more ration subject request your favor to give me your opinion on some articl in thi hebrew bibl you see lie open on the tabl in thi room my father sir among other thing he ha taken great pain to instruct me in for sever year that i have live with him in a kind of solitari state sinc the death of my mother whom i lost when i wa veri young ha taught me to read and understand thi inspir hebrew book and say we must ascrib primaev and sacr prerog to thi languag for my part i have some doubt as to thi matter which i dare not mention to my father tell me if you pleas what you think of the thing miss noel i answer sinc it is your command that i should be silent as to that flame your gloriou eye and understand have light up in my soul like some superior natur befor whom i am noth silent i will be and tell you what i fanci on a subject i am certain you understand much better than i do my knowledg of the hebrew is but small though i have learn to read and understand the old testament in the antebabel languag my opinion on your question is that the biblic hebrew wa the languag of paradis and continu to be spoken by all men down to and at the time of mose write the pentateuch and long after abraham though bred in chaldea could convers freeli with the egyptian the sodomit and the king of gerar nor do we find that ani varieti of speech interrupt the commerc of hi son isaac with the sever nation around or that it ever stop jacob in hi travel nay the israelit in their journey through the desert of arabia after they had been some hundr year in egypt though join by a mix multitud and meet with divers kind of peopl had not corrupt their languag and were easili understood becaus it wa then the univers one the simplic and distinct of the hebrew tongu preserv it puriti so long and so univers it could not well be degener till the knowledg of natur wa lost as it word consist but of two or three letter and are perfectli well suit to convey sensibl and strong idea it wa at the captiv the captiv began at nebuzaradan take and burn the citi and templ of jerusalem and send zedekiah the last king in chain to nebuchadnezzar who order hi children to be butcher befor hi face hi eye to be put out and then thrown into a dungeon where he die thi happen befor our lord year after the flood of the world in the space of seventi year that the jew by temporis with the ignor victor so far neglect the usag of their own tongu that none but the scribe or learn men could understand mosess book thi i confess miss noel said is a plausibl account of the primaev and preemin of the sacr hebrew but i think it is not necessari the account should be allow as fact as to it be the languag in paradis thi is not veri probabl as a compass of year must have chang the first languag veri greatli by an increas of word and new inflect applic and construct of them the few first inhabit of the earth were occupi in few thing and want not a varieti of word but when their descend invent art and improv scienc they were oblig to coin new word and technic term and by extend and transfer their word to new subject and use them figur were forc to multipli the sens of those alreadi in use the languag to be sure wa thu gradual cultiv and everi age improv it all live languag are liabl to such chang i therefor conclud that the languag which serv the first pair would not do for succeed gener it becam vastli more copiou and extens when the number of mankind were great and their languag must serv convers and the end of life and answer all the purpos of intellig and correspond new word and new term of speech from time to time were necessari to give true idea of the thing action offic place and time peculiar to the hebrew even hutchinson allow there wa some coinag some new word frame we find in the latter prophet word not to be met with in the pentateuch and from thenc we may suppos that mose use word unknown to nimrod and heber and that the men at shinaar shinaar comprehend the plain of chaldea or babylonia in asia and the men of shinaar were the first coloni that noah sent out from ararat the mountain of armenia where the ark rest after the flood to settl in the grand plain of babylonia mile from ararat thi wa in the day of peleg year after the flood when the eight had increas to sixti thousand which made a remov of part of them necessari had word which the peopl befor the flood were stranger to even in the seventeenth centuri there must have been a great alter in the languag of adam and when the vener patriarch and hi famili came into a new world that wa in a differ state from the earth befor the delug and saw a vast varieti of thing without preced in the old world the alter in natur and diet must introduc a multitud of new term in thing of common experi and usag as after that amaz revolut in the natur world not onli the cloud and meteor were differ and the soul that were save had a new and astonish view of the ruin and repair of the system but noah did then begin to be an husbandman he plant a vineyard he invent wine and to him the first grant wa given of eat flesh all these thing requir as it were a new languag and the term to be sure with mankind increas the noachic languag must be quit anoth thing after the great event of the flood had methuselah who convers mani year with adam who receiv from hi mouth the histori of the creation and fall and who live year with noah to commun to him all the knowledg he got from adam had thi antediluvian wise man been rais from the dead to convers with the postdiluvian father or even with noah the year he die that is year after the flood is it not credibl from what i have said that he would have heard a languag veri differ from that tongu he use in hi convers with adam even in the th year of the first man longev of the antediluvian the extraordinari longev of the antideluvian is account utterli incred by mani modern but it did not appear so unnatur to the earli age of pagan let no one say josephu upon compar the live of the ancient with our live and with the few year which we now live think that what we have said of them is fals i have for wit to what i have said all those who have written antiqu both among the greek and barbarian for even manetho who wrote the egyptian histori and berosu who collect the chaldean monument and mochu and hostiaeu and besid these hieronymu the egyptian and those who compos the phoenician histori agre to what i here say hesiod also and hecutaeu and hallanicu and acusilau and besid these ephoru and nicolau of damascu relat that the ancient live year the ancient latin author likewis confirm the sacr histori in thi branch and varro in particular made an enquiri what the reason wa that the ancient live a year see a continu of thi th note in the appendix i imagin methuselah would not have been abl to have talk with noah at the time i have mention of the circumst that then made the case of mankind and of the thing of common experi and usag he must have been unabl to convers at hi first appear what you say madam i repli is not onli veri probabl but afford a satisfact unexpect in a subject on which we are oblig for want of data to use conjectur i offer up to your superior sens the notion that the scriptur were wrote in the languag of paradis most certain it is that even in respect of
