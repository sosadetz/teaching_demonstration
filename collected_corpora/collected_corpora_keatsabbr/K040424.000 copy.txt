northumberland and those detach part of the counti of durham call norhamshir islandshir and bedlingtonshir it is bound on the east by the german ocean mile west by roxburghshir and cumberland north by berwickshir south by the counti of durham make the whole circumfer mile it is situat between the latitud of degre min and degre min north and longitud of degre min and degre min west from london it greatest length from north to south is mile and breadth and contain squar mile which may be divid into land that are or may be cultiv by the plough acr and mountain district improp for tillag make in the whole sect divis the counti of northumberland is divid into six ward viz tindal ward coquetdal ward glendal ward bamborough ward morpeth ward and castl ward the three first are situat in the western part of the counti and includ the whole of the mountain district with a consider portion of enclos cultiv countri the three latter adjoin the sea coast and be exempt from mountain district have been long under cultiv the vast resourc of coal castl ward in particular possess and the increas popul the coal trade occas give them a decid prefer in point of rich and popul though in point of magnitud consider the smallest occupi less than one fourth of the counti norhamshir and islandshir are situat at the northern extrem of the counti of northumberland and comprehend a triangular space the two side of which are form by the river tweed and german ocean and the base the northern boundari of glendal and bambro ward it contain about squar mile of wellinclos cultiv countri bedlingtonshir is situat at the southeast corner of castl ward bound on the east by the german ocean and on the north and south by the river wansbeck and blyth and contain about squar mile sect climat the climat in regard to temperatur is subject to great variat upon the mountain snow will often continu for sever month and may frequent be seen there of a consider depth when there is none in the lower district the weather is veri inconst but mostli run in extrem in the spring month the cold pierc easterli wind are most preval and our longest drought are alway accompani by them in some place they have acquir the name of seapin from the slow progress veget make whenev they continu for a few week rain is of littl use while they prevail from the great cold which alway attend them the mild western and southern breez rare take place befor june they are certain harbing of rain and vigor veget and are the most prevail wind through the summer and autumn in the latter season they often blow with tempestu furi dash out the corn and disappoint the just hope of the industri farmer our greatest fall of snow or rain are from the south or southeast and whenev we have a veri high west wind it is a certain sign that a great quantiti of rain is fall to the westward in cumberland and roxburghshir sect soil and surfac a strong fertil clayey loam occupi the level tract of countri along the coast and reach as far up in gener as the great post road it is well adapt to the cultur of wheat puls clover and graze sandi gravelli and dri loam or what is here more gener understood by turnip soil is found on the bank of the tyne from newburn to haltwhistl on the coquet about and abov rothburi on the aln from it mouth to alnwick and down tweedsid but the greatest quantiti of thi kind of soil is found in

district are of the varieti call cake coal which melt in the fire burn to a strong cinder in the open air and the best kind produc veri few ash and the most numer and thickest seam from whenc those vast quantiti are export which suppli the great consumpt of the london market as well as the coast and foreign trade thi coal trade is the foundat of the commerc of the counti and the princip sourc of it wealth as well as a neversail nurseri for some of the best seamen in the british navi of the quantiti of coal rais in thi counti we have not been abl to form a probabl conjectur for want of suffici data to estim the quantiti use at home but have obtain what are export from the river tyne in which a consider portion rais in the counti of durham is includ and which may probabl come near a balanc for those consum in thi counti some idea of the magnitud of thi trade may be form by the follow statement of the export of coal from newcastl in newcastl chaldron thi is the onli year in which we find the quantiti rais in northumberland and durham are kept distinct and which are in the counti of northumberland chaldron in the counti of durham in all from henc it appear that thi trade is increas at an amaz rate there be not less than onethird more coal export now than were export year sinc from hartley and blyth there are export yearli between and chaldron if these be ad to the averag export

lengthway upon sleeper of wood sss and the thick of the rail abov the plane of the rest of the road and at the exact distanc of the wagon wheel from each other as it is upon those rail the wheel run a new waggonway includ timber level gravel and workmanship will cost about s per yard or l per mile and the expens of keep it in repair is gener about d per chaldron on a quantiti of chaldron annual or l s d per mile it ha been suggest that a waggonway might be substitut in lieu of turnpik road for the convey of heavi good but we presum that the expens of first make lay out in nearli a level line or so as to have littl or no ascent and keep in repair would greatli overbal the addit weight to be drawn by one hors as the wood rot and wast nearli as much by a small quantiti of carriag pass along it

wagon to move by the power of graviti the hors is taken out and follow behind and where the descent are such that the wagon would move with too great rapid by it own weight or run amain the motion is regul by a crook piec of wood call a convey come over the top of one of the hind wheel upon which the waggonman press with such forc as he find requisit to regul the motion of the wagon thi mode of convey ha been use here upward of year in ha been assert that the coal in thi counti are inexhaust mr william in hi natur histori of the miner kingdom is of a differ opinion and think it a matter of such import as to deserv the seriou attent of the legislatur toward elucid thi point it may be of some use to estim what number of acr are wrought yearli in thi counti to suppli the abov quantiti of

afford a newcastl chaldron therefor divid by give newcastl chaldron per acr the coal export yearli from the river tyne and wear with hartley and blyth amount to about chaldron from newcastl chaldron sunderland ditto in all which with the home consumpt of the two counti of northumberland and durham will make the quantiti of coal rais yearli about chaldron and the chaldron rais yearli divid by the chaldron per acr give acr nearli per year clear of coal yd thick and by estim the breadth occupi by the cake coal to be on an averg mile broad and mile long in the two counti we shall find there will be about squar mile or acr of coal proper for export then the whole area divid by the yearli consumpt year the time befor thi space will be wrought out but there are some reason to think that a thick of seam equal to yard will not be obtain over an extent of squar mile probabl not more on an averag than yard in which case the coal will be exhaust in year and if the aggreg thick of the seam to be obtain should prove onli three yard then littl more than year will be the term of continu but it is probabl that befor the half of that time be elaps the price to the consum will be consider increas from the increas expens of obtain them and the increas length of carriag from the pit to the river thi last we presum may be reduc in some situat by adopt canal instead of waggonway which we have often wonder have never yet been attempt from the abov investig it appear that mr williamss apprehens are not so chimer at have been repres how far it may be right for the legislatur to interfer we leav to the consider of those more convers in polit specul of the coal found all through bambro ward islandshir and those part of glendal ward east of the river till the seam are veri thin mostli from to feet thick and of a veri inferior qualiti yield a great quantiti of ash and neither cake in the fire nor burn to a cinder they are use onli for homeconsumpt and for burn lime for the latter purpos they are well adapt by their properti of neither cake nor burn to a cinder and it luckili happen that through all thi district the coal and lime are gener found togeth a circumst which greatli facilit and lessen the expens of burn lime if a line be drawn from alemouth to a littl west of bywel on the river tyne veri littl of thi kind of coal and limeston will be found to the east of it and from thi line to the sea coast no limeston whatev appear except a small patch of a differ limeston that put in at whitley near tynemouth and run from thenc in a southwesterli direct through the counti of durham etc in thi space betwixt these two rang of limeston lie the cake coal of superior qualiti abov describ and the same breadth of coal may be trace through the counti of durham stretch in the same direct and bound on the east and west in a similar manner by stretch of limeston of differ kind it would be a curiou investig to trace these miner through the differ counti across the island and show where the strata of each speci rise to the surfac and the deviat caus in them by cross vein or dyke etc we believ it will be found that veri littl or no coal lie to the east of thi line and that no chalk lie to the west limeston of an excel qualiti abound through all bambro ward islandshir and that part of glendal ward situat on the east side of the river till it stretch from henc in a southwesterli direct through the central part of the counti and is found at shilbottl longframlington hartburn rial corbridg etc and at numberless other place to the westward of these but the southeast quarter which is so rich in coal is destitut of lime except a small patch at whitley near tynemouth as is also that part of glendal ward west of the river till stone marl abound in mani place near tweedsid and shell marl is found in a few place in glendal ward the greatest quantiti is at wark and sunnylaw where it ha been form by a deposit of variou kind of shell both univalv and bivalv mani of which are yet perfect form a stratum sever feet in depth of pure calcar earth but the exact depth of thi bed of marl ha never yet been ascertain for want of a proper level to carri off the water it probabl may afford matter of specul to some reader to be inform that in the middl of thi marl there is an horizont stratum of sand about inch thick and also that a few year sinc a red deer stag in the attitud of run and in everi part complet wa found embed in the marl horn of the same anim have been found at differ time in perfect preserv and a part of the scalp with the core of a

want yet the core wa inch long and inch circumfer at the root and when in a perfect state and cover with the outsid shell must have been about inch diamet their form is a gentl curv and have all the appear of a pair of bull horn but probabl of a differ breed of cattl to ani we have at present clay marl is also found in small quantiti but in situat where it could not be conveni use with effect lead ore ha hitherto never been found in ani quantiti but in the mountain district on the southwest part of the counti toward the head of that branch of south tyne call allendal and a small quantiti at fallowfield a littl to the north of hexham the lead mine in allendal produc about bing of lead ore annual which at l s od per bing is upward of l a year in thi counti lead ore is wrought by the

the alendal lead ore is smelt and refin at dukesfield smeltmil and produc about or ounc of silver from each fother of lead what is got at fallowfield contain so littl silver that it will not pay the

call pig of cwt each pig lead is sold by the fother a quantiti contain cwt which is reckon to sell at a fair price when at l or l per fother in it wa as low as l and in the begin of it wa l s in it rose gradual to l s per fother which wa sever pound higher than it wa ever sold at befor but in the follow year it sell to l or l per fother which show the fluctuat price of thi articl the ore of zink is found in great abund embed with spar in most of the vein produc lead ore but it distanc from ani brass manufactur and from water carriag render it of littl valu in these mine are also found great

have an offer of their farm or year befor the expir of the leas which is a mutual benefit to both landlord and tenant and is attend with so mani advantag that it is in a fair way of be gener adopt on some estat the practic of let farm by secret propos is still in use thi is a dark and mysteri mode which frequent defeat the end it is intend to accomplish and instead of obtain an excess high rent the prize ha been often gain at a veri inferior valu and in the languag of the turf where onli one ha enter the list by walk the cours and we have known some of the first farmer in the counti forego

thresh machin are now becom gener in the northern part of the countri they are all upon the principl of the flax mill which principl wa first introduc into thi counti for thresh corn by mr edward gregson near year sinc the machin he use wa work by a man who could thresh with it bushel of wheat in a day but be hard work and mr gregson die soon after it wa neglect mr wm menzi who wa servant with mr gregson at the time say that hi master took the idea from a small flax mill which a scotchman travel the countri with for the purpos of swingl the flax which the farmer grew for their own use thi portabl flax mill wa carri in a cart from one farmhous to anoth be a cylind of or feet diamet and inch wide the switcher were driven by hi foot with a crank like a cutler wheel and that the thresh machin mr gregson had wa made at that time and exactli the same as the said flax mill mr tho gregson think that hi brother edward had seen someth of a similar natur in scotland probabl the same which mr d meldrum give an account of about the same time in a letter to mr william charg of cleasbi in the counti of york which he describ as be the same as the flax mill that it thresh bushel of oat a day which drop through a skreen into a winnow machin that dress at the same time some time after thi mr oxley erect a thresh machin at flodden move by hors in which the corn wa fedin betwixt two flute roller and struck by switcher place as those are in the present machin onli they are hung on hing those in use now are fix as were those of mr gregson the complaint of mr oxley machin wa that it did not thresh common oat clean probabl for want of veloc for it is found in the machin now use that if the switcher move with a veloc of feet per minut they will not thresh clean and experi ha prove that to thresh common oat clean requir a veloc of feet per minut mr ilderton erect two thresh machin one at ilderton and anoth at hawkhil work by hors the principl of which wa to rub the grain out by project piec of wood on the circumfer of a larg cylind rub against sever flute roller he use it mani year but it wa frequent necessari to put the straw twice through befor it wa perfectli clean we were inform by the late sir franci kinlock bart of gilmerton scotland that while he wa attempt to perfect mr ilderton machin he saw a portabl flax mill made for the use of poor famili work by a man it struck him that it would thresh corn and he got one made with the addit of two smooth roller for take in the corn the work be too hard for a man he sent it to mr mickl mill to have it tri by water soon after mr mickl son built a thresh mill at kilbogi and after ten or twelv had been erect in the neighborhood by other workmen he appli to mr kinlock to take out a patent who told him that he did not look upon it as an origin invent and that a patent would not be of ani use some time after thi mr mickl took out a patent for england onli in hi own name for the purpos we suppos of secur to himself hi own combin of wheel etc for movement of the variou part as the lead principl of the machin had been appli to the same purpos at least year befor mr mickl is a veri ingeni mechan and though it appear he ha not the merit of be the origin inventor yet he ha ad mani use improv at their first introduct into thi counti the corn and straw were thrown out togeth upon the floor and caus great confus to remedi thi a skreen wa ad through which the grain drop into a winnow machin and from off the skreen the straw wa taken by a man but a circular rake invent about eight year
