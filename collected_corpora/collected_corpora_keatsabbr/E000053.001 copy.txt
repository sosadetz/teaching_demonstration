if they are thi own that i refer myself but if they are taken upon trust from other it is no great matter what they are they are not follow truth but some meaner consider and it is not worth while to be concern what he say or think who say or think onli as he is direct by anoth if thou judgest for thyself i know thou wilt judg candidli and then i shall not be harm or offend whatev be thi censur for though it be certain that there is noth in thi treatis of the truth whereof i am not fulli persuad yet i consid myself as liabl to mistak as i can think thee and know that thi book must stand or fall with thee not by ani opinion i have of it but thi own if thou findest littl in it new or instruct to thee thou art not to blame me for it it wa not meant for those that had alreadi master thi subject and made a thorough acquaint with their own understand but for my own inform and the satisfact of a few friend who acknowledg themselv not to have suffici consid it were it fit to troubl thee with the histori of thi essay i should tell thee that five or six friend meet at my chamber and discours on a subject veri remot from thi found themselv quickli at a stand by the difficulti that rose on everi side after we had awhil puzzl ourselv without come ani nearer a resolut of those doubt which perplex us it came into my thought that we took a wrong cours and that befor we set ourselv upon inquiri of that natur it wa necessari to examin our own abil and see what object our understand were or were not fit to deal with thi i propos to the compani who all readili assent and thereupon it wa agre that thi should be our first inquiri some hasti and undigest thought on a subject i had never befor consid which i set down against our next meet gave the first entranc into thi discours which have been thu begun by chanc wa continu by intreati written by incoher parcel and after long interv of neglect resum again as my humour or occas permit and at last in a retir where an attend on my health gave me leisur it wa brought into that order thou now seest it thi discontinu way of write may have occas besid other two contrari fault viz that too littl and too much may be said in it if thou findest anyth want i shall be glad that what i have written give thee ani desir that i should have gone further if it seem too much to thee thou must blame the subject for when i put pen to paper i thought all i should have to say on thi matter would have been contain in one sheet of paper but the further i went the larger prospect i had new discoveri led me still on and so it grew insens to the bulk it now appear in i will not deni but possibl it might be reduc to a narrow compass than it is and that some part of it might be contract the way it ha been writ in by catch and mani long interv of interrupt be apt to caus some repetit but to confess the truth i am now too lazi or too busi to make it shorter i am not ignor how littl i herein consult my own reput when i knowingli let it go with a fault so apt to disgust the most judici who are alway the nicest reader but they who know sloth is apt to content itself with ani excus will pardon me if mine ha prevail on me where i think i have a veri good one i will not therefor alleg in my defenc that the same notion have differ respect may be conveni or necessari to prove or illustr sever part of the same discours and that so it ha happen in mani part of thi but waiv that i shall frankli avow that i have sometim dwelt long upon the same argument and express it differ way with a quit differ design i pretend not to publish thi essay for the inform of men of larg thought and quick apprehens to such master of knowledg i profess myself a scholar and therefor warn them beforehand not to expect anyth here but what be spun out of my own coars thought is fit to men of my own size to whom perhap it will not be unaccept that i have taken some pain to make plain and familiar to their thought some truth which establish prejudic or the abstracted of the idea themselv might render difficult some object had need be turn on everi side and when the notion is new as i confess some of these are to me or out of the ordinari road as i suspect they will appear to other it is not one simpl view of it that will gain it admitt into everi understand or fix it there with a clear and last impress there are few i believ who have not observ in themselv or other that what in one way of propos wa veri obscur anoth way of express it ha made veri clear and intellig though afterward the mind found littl differ in the phrase and wonder whi one fail to be understood more than the other but everyth doe not hit alik upon everi man imagin we have our understand no less differ than our palat and he that think the same truth shall be equal relish by everi one in the same dress may as well hope to feast everi one with the same sort of cookeri the meat may be the same and the nourish good yet everi one not be abl to receiv it with that season and it must be dress anoth way if you will have it go down with some even of strong constitut the truth is those who advis me to publish it advis me for thi reason to publish it as it is and sinc i have been brought to let it go abroad i desir it should be understood by whoever give himself the pain to read it i have so littl affect to be in print that if i were not flatter thi essay might be of some use to other as i think it ha been to me i should have confin it to the view of some friend who gave the first occas to it my appear therefor in print be on purpos to be as use as i may i think it necessari to make what i have to say as easi and intellig to all sort of reader as i can and i had much rather the specul and quicksight should complain of my be in some part tediou than that ani one not accustom to abstract specul or prepossess with differ notion should mistak or not comprehend my mean it will possibl be censur as a great piec of vaniti or insol in me to pretend to instruct thi our know age it amount to littl less when i own that i publish thi essay with hope it may be use to other but if it may be permit to speak freeli of those who with a feign modesti condemn as useless what they themselv write methink it savour much more of vaniti or insol to publish a book for ani other end and he fail veri much of that respect he owe the public who print and consequ expect men should read that wherein he intend not they should meet with anyth of use to themselv or other and should noth els be found allow in thi treatis yet my design will not ceas to be so and the good of my intent ought to be some excus for the worthless of my present it is that chiefli which secur me from the fear of censur which i expect not to escap more than better writer men principl notion and relish are so differ that it is hard to find a book which pleas or displeas all men i acknowledg the age we live in is not the least know and therefor not the most easi to be satisfi if i have not the good luck to pleas yet nobodi ought to be offend with me i plainli tell all my reader except half a dozen thi treatis wa not at first intend for them and therefor they need not be at the troubl to be of that number but yet if ani one think fit to be angri and rail at it he may do it secur for i shall find some better way of spend my time than in such kind of convers i shall alway have the satisfact to have aim sincer at truth and use though in one of the meanest way the commonwealth of learn is not at thi time without masterbuild whose mighti design in advanc the scienc will leav last monument to the admir of poster but everi one must not hope to be a boyl or a sydenham and in an age that produc such master as the great huygeniu and the incompar mr newton with some other of that strain it is ambit enough to be employ as an underlabour in clear the ground a littl and remov some of the rubbish that lie in the way to knowledgewhich certainli had been veri much more advanc in the world if the endeavour of ingeni and industri men had not been much cumber with the learn but frivol use of uncouth affect or unintellig term introduc into the scienc and there made an art of to that degre that philosophi which is noth but the true knowledg of thing wa thought unfit or incap to be brought into wellbr compani and polit convers vagu and insignific form of speech and abus of languag have so long pass for mysteri of scienc and hard and misappli word with littl or no mean have by prescript such a right to be mistaken for deep learn and height of specul that it will not be easi to persuad either those who speak or those who hear them that they are but the cover of ignor and hindranc of true knowledg to break in upon the sanctuari of vaniti and ignor will be i suppos some servic to human understand though so few are apt to think they deceiv or are deceiv in the use of word or that the languag of the sect they are of ha ani fault in it which ought to be examin or correct that i hope i shall be pardon if i have in the third book dwelt long on thi subject and endeavour to make it so plain that neither the inveter of the mischief nor the preval of the fashion shall be ani excus for those who will not take care about the mean of their own word and will not suffer the signific of their express to be inquir into i have been told that a short epitom of thi treatis which wa print in wa by some condemn without read becaus innat idea were deni in it they too hastili conclud that if innat idea were not suppos there would be littl left either of the notion or proof of spirit if ani one take the like offenc at the entranc of thi treatis i shall desir him to read it through and then i hope he will be convinc that the take away fals foundat is not to the prejudic but advantag of truth which is never injur or endang so much as when mix with or built on falsehood in the second edit i ad as followeth the booksel will not forgiv me if i say noth of thi new edit which he ha promis by the correct of it shall make amend for the mani fault commit in the former he desir too that it should be known that it ha one whole new chapter concern ident and mani addit and amend in other place these i must inform my reader are not all new matter but most of them either further confirm of what i had said or explic to prevent other be mistaken in the sens of what wa formerli print and not ani variat in me from it i must onli except the alter i have made in book ii chap xxi what i had there written concern liberti and the will i thought deserv as accur a view as i am capabl of those subject have in all age exercis the learn part of the world with question and difficulti that have not a littl perplex moral and divin those part of knowledg that men are most concern to be clear in upon a closer inspect into the work of men mind and a stricter examin of those motiv and view they are turn by i have found reason somewhat to alter the thought i formerli had concern that which give the last determin to the will in all voluntari action thi i can not forbear to acknowledg to the world with as much freedom and readi as i at first publish what then seem to me to be right think myself more concern to quit and renounc ani opinion of my own than oppos that of anoth when truth appear against it for it is truth alon i seek and that will alway be welcom to me when or from whencesoev it come but what forward soever i have to resign ani opinion i have or to reced from anyth i have writ upon the first evid of ani error in it yet thi i must own that i have not had the good luck to receiv ani light from those except i have met with in print against ani part of my book nor have from anyth that ha been urg against it found reason to alter my sens in ani of the point that have been question whether the subject i have in hand requir often more thought and attent than cursori reader at least such as are prepossess are will to allow or whether ani obscur in my express cast a cloud over it and these notion are made difficult to other apprehens in my way of treat them so it is that my mean i find is often mistaken and i have not the good luck to be everywher rightli understood of thi the ingeni author of the discours concern the natur of man ha given me a late instanc to mention no other for the civil of hi express and the candour that belong to hi order forbid me to think that he would have close hi prefac with an insinu as if in what i had said book ii ch xxvii concern the third rule which men refer their action to i went about to make virtu vice and vice virtu unless he had mistaken my mean which he could not have done if he had given himself the troubl to consid what the argument wa i wa then upon and what wa the chief design of that chapter plainli enough set down in the fourth section and those follow for i wa there not lay down moral rule but show the origin and natur of moral idea and enumer the rule men make use of in moral relat whether these rule were true or fals and pursuant thereto i tell what is everywher call virtu and vice which alter not the natur of thing though men gener do judg of and denomin their action accord to the esteem and fashion of the place and sect they are of if he had been at the pain to reflect on what i had said bk i ch ii sect and bk ii ch xxviii sect and he would have known what i think of the etern and unalter natur of right and wrong and what i call virtu and vice and if he had observ that in the place he quot i onli report as a matter of fact what other call virtu and vice he would not have found it liabl to ani great except for i think i am not much out in say that one of the rule made use of in the world for a ground or measur of a moral relat isthat esteem and reput which sever sort of action find various in the sever societi of men accord to which they are there call virtu or vice and whatev author the learn mr lowd place in hi old english dictionari i daresay it nowher tell him if i should appeal to it that the same action is not in credit call and count a virtu in one place which be in disreput pass for and under the name of vice in anoth the take notic that men bestow the name of virtu and vice accord to thi rule of reput is all i have done or can be laid to my charg to have done toward the make vice virtu or virtu vice but the good man doe well and as becom hi call to be watch in such point and to take the alarm even at express which stand alon by themselv might sound ill and be suspect ti to thi zeal allow in hi function that i forgiv hi cite as he doe these word of mine ch xxviii sect ii even the exhort of inspir teacher have not fear to appeal to common reput philip iv without take notic of those immedi preced which introduc them and run thu wherebi even in the corrupt of manner the true boundari of the law of natur which ought to be the rule of virtu and vice were pretti well preserv so that even the exhort of inspir teacher c by which word and the rest of that section it is plain that i brought that passag of st paul not to prove that the gener measur of what men call virtu and vice throughout the world wa the reput and fashion of each particular societi within itself but to show that though it were so yet for reason i there give men in that way of denomin their action did not for the most part much stray from the law of natur which is that stand and unalter rule by which they ought to judg of the moral rectitud and graviti of their action and accordingli denomin them virtu or vice had mr lowd consid thi he would have found it littl to hi purpos to have quot thi passag in a sens i use it not and would i imagin have spare the applic he subjoin to it as not veri necessari but i hope thi second edit will give him satisfact on the point and that thi matter is now so express as to show him there wa no caus for scrupl though i am forc to differ from him in these apprehens he ha express in the latter end of hi prefac concern what i had said about virtu and vice yet we are better agre than he think in what he say in hi third chapter p concern natur inscript and innat notion i shall not deni him the privileg he claim p to state the question as he pleas especi when he state it so as to leav noth in it contrari to what i have said for accord to him innat notion be condit thing depend upon the concurr of sever other circumst in order to the soul exert them all that he say for innat imprint impress notion for of innat idea he say noth at all amount at last onli to thisthat there are certain proposit which though the soul from the begin or when a man is born doe not know yet by assist from the outward sens and the help of some previou cultiv it may afterward come certainli to know the truth of which is no more than what i have affirm in my first book for i suppos by the soul exert them he mean it begin to know them or els the soul exert of notion will be to me a veri unintellig express and i think at best is a veri unfit one in thi it mislead men thought by an insinu as if these notion were in the mind befor the soul exert them i e befor they are knownwherea truli befor they are known there is noth of them in the mind but a capac to know them when the concurr of those circumst which thi ingeni author think necessari in order to the soul exert them bring them into our knowledg p i find him express it thu these natur notion are not so imprint upon the soul as that they natur and necessarili exert themselv even in children and idiot without ani assist from the outward sens or without the help of some previou cultiv here he say they exert themselv as p that the soul exert them when he ha explain to himself or other what he mean by the soul exert innat notion or their exert themselv and what that previou cultiv and circumst in order to their be exert areh will i suppos find there is so littl of controversi between him and me on the point bate that he call that exert of notion which i in a more vulgar style call know that i have reason to think he brought in my name on thi occas onli out of the pleasur he ha to speak civilli of me which i must grate acknowledg he ha done everywher he mention me not without confer on me as some other have done a titl i have no right to there are so mani instanc of thi that i think it justic to my reader and myself to conclud that either my book is plainli enough written to be rightli understood by those who perus it with that attent and indiffer which everi one who will give himself the pain to read ought to employ in read or els that i have written mine so obscur that it is in vain to go about to mend it whichev of these be the truth it is myself onli am affect therebi and therefor i shall be far from troubl my reader with what i think might be said in answer to those sever object i have met with to passag here and there of my book sinc i persuad myself that he who think them of moment enough to be concern whether they are true or fals will be abl to see that what is said is either not well found or els not contrari to my doctrin when i and my oppos come both to be well understood if ani other author care that none of their good thought should be lost have publish their censur of my essay with thi honour done to it that they will not suffer it to be an essay i leav it to the public to valu the oblig they have to their critic pen and shall not wast my reader time in so idl or illnatur an employ of mine as to lessen the satisfact ani one ha in himself or give to other in so hasti a confut of what i have written the booksel prepar for the fourth edit of my essay gave me notic of it that i might if i had leisur make ani addit or alter i should think fit whereupon i thought it conveni to advertis the reader that besid sever correct i had made here and there there wa one alter which it wa necessari to mention becaus it ran through the whole book and is of consequ to be rightli understood what i thereupon said wa thi clear and distinct idea are term which though familiar and frequent in men mouth i have reason to think everi one who use doe not perfectli understand and possibl ti but here and there one who give himself the troubl to consid them so far as to know what he himself or other precis mean by them i have therefor in most place chose to put determin or determin instead of clear and distinct as more like to direct men thought to my mean in thi matter by those denomin i mean some object in the mind and consequ determin i e such as it is there seen and perceiv to be thi i think may fitli be call a determin or determin idea when such as it is at ani time object in the mind and so determin there it is annex and without variat determin to a name or articul sound which is to be steadili the sign of that veri same object of the mind or determin idea to explain thi a littl more particularli by determin when appli to a simpl idea i mean that simpl appear which the mind ha in it view or perceiv in itself when that idea is said to be in it by determin when appli to a complex idea i mean such an one as consist of a determin number of certain simpl or less complex idea join in such a proport and situat as the mind ha befor it view and see in itself when that idea is present in it or should be present in it when a man give a name to it i say should be becaus it is not everi one nor perhap ani one who is so care of hi languag as to use no word till he view in hi mind the precis determin idea which he resolv to make it the sign of the want of thi is the caus of no small obscur and confus in men thought and discours i know there are not word enough in ani languag to answer all the varieti of idea that enter into men discours and reason but thi hinder not but that when ani one use ani term he may have in hi mind a determin idea which he make it the sign of and to which he should keep it steadili annex dure that present discours where he doe not or can not do thi he in vain pretend to clear or distinct idea it is plain hi are not so and therefor there can be expect noth but obscur and confus where such term are made use of which have not such a precis determin upon thi ground i have thought determin idea a way of speak less liabl to mistak than clear and distinct and where men have got such determin idea of all that they reason inquir or argu about they will find a great part of their doubt and disput at an end the greatest part of the question and controversi that perplex mankind depend on the doubt and uncertain use of word or which is the same indetermin idea which they are made to stand for i have made choic of these term to signifi some immedi object of the mind which it perceiv and ha befor it distinct from the sound it use as a sign of it that thi idea thu determin ie which the mind ha in itself and know and see there be determin without ani chang to that name and that name determin to that precis idea if men had such determin idea in their inquiri and discours they would both discern how far their own inquiri and discours went and avoid the greatest part of the disput and wrangl they have with other besid thi the booksel will think it necessari i should advertis the reader that there is an addit of two chapter wholli new the one of the associ of idea the other of enthusiasm these with some other larger addit never befor print he ha engag to print by themselv after the same manner and for the same purpos as wa done when thi essay had the second impress in the sixth edit there is veri littl ad or alter the greatest part of what is new is contain in the twentyfirst chapter of the second book which ani one if he think it worth while may with a veri littl labour transcrib into the margin of the former edit essay concern human understand introduct an inquiri into the understand pleasant and use sinc it is the understand that set man abov the rest of sensibl be and give him all the advantag and dominion which he ha over them it is certainli a subject even for it nobl worth our labour to inquir into the understand like the eye whilst it make us see and perceiv all other thing take no notic of itself and it requir and art and pain to set it at a distanc and make it it own object but whatev be the difficulti that lie in the way of thi inquiri whatev it be that keep us so much in the dark to ourselv sure i am that all the light we can let in upon our mind all the acquaint we can make with our own understand will not onli be veri pleasant but bring us great advantag in direct our thought in the search of other thing design thi therefor be my purposeto inquir into the origin certainti and extent of human knowledg togeth with the ground and degre of belief opinion and assenti shall not at present meddl with the physic consider of the mind or troubl myself to examin wherein it essenc consist or by what motion of our spirit or alter of our bodi we come to have ani sensat by our organ or ani idea in our

now upon it shall suffic to my present purpos to consid the discern faculti of a man as they are employ about the object which they have to do with and i shall imagin i have not wholli misemploy myself in the thought i shall have on thi occas if in thi histor plain method i can give ani account of the way wherebi our understand come to attain those notion of thing we have and can set down ani measur of the certainti of our knowledg or the ground of those persuas which are to be found amongst men so variou differ and wholli contradictori and yet assert somewher or other with such assur and confid that he that shall take a view of the opinion of mankind observ their opposit and at the same time consid the fond and devot wherewith they are embrac the resolut and eager wherewith they are maintain may perhap have reason to suspect that either there is no such thing as truth at all or that mankind hath no suffici mean to attain a certain knowledg of it method it is therefor worth while to search out the bound between opinion and knowledg and examin by what measur in thing whereof we have no certain knowledg we ought to regul our assent and moder our persuas in order whereunto i shall pursu thi follow method first i shall inquir into the origin of those idea notion or whatev els you pleas to call them which a man observ and is consciou to himself he ha in hi mind and the way wherebi the understand come to be furnish with them secondli i shall endeavour to show what knowledg the understand hath by those idea and the certainti evid and extent of it thirdli i shall make some inquiri into the natur and ground of faith or opinion wherebi i mean that assent which we give to ani proposit as true of whose truth yet we have no certain knowledg and here we shall have occas to examin the reason and degre of assent use to know the extent of our comprehens if by thi inquiri into the natur of the understand i can discov the power thereof how far they reach to what thing they are in ani degre proportion and where they fail us i suppos it may be of use to prevail with the busi mind of man to be more cautiou in meddl with thing exceed it comprehens to stop when it is at the utmost extent of it tether and to sit down in a quiet ignor of those thing which upon examin are found to be beyond the reach of our capac we should not then perhap be so forward out of an affect of an univers knowledg to rais question and perplex ourselv and other with disput about thing to which our understand are not suit and of which we can not frame in our mind ani clear or distinct percept or whereof as it ha perhap too often happen we have not ani notion at all if we can find out how far the understand can extend it view how far it ha faculti to attain certainti and in what case it can onli judg and guess we may learn to content ourselv with what is attain by us in thi state our capac suit to our state and concern for though the comprehens of our understand come exceed short of the vast extent of thing yet we shall have caus enough to magnifi the bounti author of our be for that proport and degre of knowledg he ha bestow on us so far abov all the rest of the inhabit of thi our mansion men have reason to be well satisfi with what god hath thought fit for them sinc he hath given them as st peter say word in greek whatsoev is necessari for the conveni of life and inform of virtu and ha put within the reach of their discoveri the comfort provis for thi life and the way that lead to a better how short soever their knowledg may come of an univers or perfect comprehens of whatsoev is it yet secur their great concern that they have light enough to lead them to the knowledg of their maker and the sight of their own duti men may find matter suffici to busi their head and employ their hand with varieti delight and satisfact if they will not boldli quarrel with their own constitut and throw away the bless their hand are fill with becaus they are not big enough to grasp everyth we shall not have much reason to complain of the narrow of our mind if we will but employ them about what may be of use to us for of that they are veri capabl and it will be an unpardon as well as childish peevish if we undervalu the advantag of our knowledg and neglect to improv it to the end for which it wa given us becaus there are some thing that are set out of the reach of it it will be no excus to an idl and untoward servant who would not attend hi busi by candl light to plead that he had not broad sunshin the candl that is set up in us shine bright enough for all our purpos the discoveri we can make with thi ought to satisfi us and we shall then use our understand right when we entertain all object in that way and proport that they are suit to our faculti and upon those ground they are capabl of be propos to us and not peremptorili or intemper requir demonstr and demand certainti where probabl onli is to be had and which is suffici to govern all our concern if we will disbeliev everyth becaus we can not certainli know all thing we shall do much what as wise as he who would not use hi leg but sit still and perish becaus he had no wing to fli knowledg of our capac a cure of sceptic and idl when we know our own strength we shall the better know what to undertak with hope of success and when we have well survey the power of our own mind and made some estim what we may expect from them we shall not be inclin either to sit still and not set our thought on work at all in despair of know anyth nor on the other side question everyth and disclaim all knowledg becaus some thing are not to be understood it is of great use to the sailor to know the length of hi line though he can not with it fathom all the depth of the ocean it is well he know that it is long enough to reach the bottom at such place as are necessari to direct hi voyag and caution him against run upon shoal that may ruin him our busi here is not to know all thing but those which concern our conduct if we can find out those measur wherebi a ration creatur put in that state in which man is in thi world may and ought to govern hi opinion and action depend thereon we need not to be troubl that some other thing escap our knowledg occas of thi essay thi wa that which gave the first rise to thi essay concern the understand for i thought that the first step toward satisfi sever inquiri the mind of man wa veri apt to run into wa to take a survey of our own understand examin our own power and see to what thing they were adapt till that wa done i suspect we began at the wrong end and in vain sought for satisfact in a quiet and sure possess of truth that most concern us whilst we let loos our thought into the vast ocean of be as if all that boundless extent were the natur and undoubt possess of our understand wherein there wa noth exempt from it decis or that escap it comprehens thu men extend their inquiri beyond their capac and let their thought wander into those depth where they can find no sure foot it is no wonder that they rais question and multipli disput which never come to ani clear resolut are proper onli to continu and increas their doubt and to confirm them at last in perfect sceptic wherea were the capac of our understand well consid the extent of our knowledg onc discov and the horizon found which set the bound between the enlighten and dark part of thing between what is and what is not comprehens by us men would perhap with less scrupl acquiesc in the avow ignor of the one and employ their thought and discours with more advantag and satisfact in the other what idea stand for thu much i thought necessari to say concern the occas of thi inquiri into human understand but befor i proceed on to what i have thought on thi subject i must here in the entranc beg pardon of my reader for the frequent use of the word idea which he will find in the follow treatis it be that term which i think serv best to stand for whatsoev is the object of the understand when a man think i have use it to express whatev is meant by phantasm notion speci or whatev it is which the mind can be employ about in think and i could not avoid frequent use it i presum it will be easili grant me that there are such idea in men mind everi one is consciou of them in himself and men word and action will satisfi him that they are in other our first inquiri then shall behow they come into the mind book ineith principl nor idea are innat chapter ino innat specul principl the way shown how we come by ani knowledg suffici to prove it not innat it is an establish opinion amongst some men that there are in the understand certain innat principl some primari notion koivai evvoiai charact as it were stamp upon the mind of man which the soul receiv in it veri first be and bring into the world with it it would be suffici to convinc unprejud reader of the fals of thi supposit if i should onli show as i hope i shall in the follow part of thi discours how men bare by the use of their natur faculti may attain to all the knowledg they have without the help of ani innat impress and may arriv at certainti without ani such origin notion or principl for i imagin ani one will easili grant that it would be impertin to suppos the idea of colour innat in a creatur to whom god hath given sight and a power to receiv them by the eye from extern object and no less unreason would it be to attribut sever truth to the impress of natur and innat charact when we may observ in ourselv faculti fit to attain as easi and certain knowledg of them as if they were origin imprint on the mind but becaus a man is not permit without censur to follow hi own thought in the search of truth when they lead him ever so littl out of the common road i shall set down the reason that made me doubt of the truth of that opinion as an excus for my mistak if i be in one which i leav to be consid by those who with me dispos themselv to embrac truth wherev they find it gener assent the great argument there is noth more commonli taken for grant than that there are certain principl both specul and practic for they speak of both univers agre upon by all mankind which therefor they argu must need be the constant impress which the soul of men receiv in their first be and which they bring into the world with them as necessarili and realli as they do ani of their inher faculti univers consent prove noth innat thi argument drawn from univers consent ha thi misfortun in it that if it were true in matter of fact that there were certain truth wherein all mankind agre it would not prove them innat if there can be ani other way shown how men may come to that univers agreement in the thing they do consent in which i presum may be done what is is and it is possibl for the same thing to be and not to be not univers assent to but which is wors thi argument of univers consent which is made use of to prove innat principl seem to me a demonstr that there are none such becaus there are none to which all mankind give an univers assent i shall begin with the specul and instanc in those magnifi principl of demonstr whatsoev is is and it is imposs for the same thing to be and not to be which of all other i think have the most allow titl to innat these have so settl a reput of maxim univers receiv that it will no doubt be thought strang if ani one should seem to question it but yet i take liberti to say that these proposit are so far from have an univers assent that there are a great part of mankind to whom they are not so much as known not on mind natur imprint becaus not known to children idiot c for first it is evid that all children and idiot have not the least apprehens or thought of them and the want of that is enough to destroy that univers assent which must need be the necessari concomit of all innat truth it seem to me near a contradict to say that there are truth imprint on the soul which it perceiv or understand not imprint if it signifi anyth be noth els but the make certain truth to be perceiv for to imprint anyth on the mind without the mind perceiv it seem to me hardli intellig if therefor children and idiot have soul have mind with those impress upon them they must unavoid perceiv them and necessarili know and assent to these truth which sinc they do not it is evid that there are no such impress for if they are not notion natur imprint how can they be innat and if they are notion imprint how can they be unknown to say a notion is imprint on the mind and yet at the same time to say that the mind is ignor of it and never yet took notic of it is to make thi impress noth no proposit can be said to be in the mind which it never yet knew which it wa never yet consciou of for if ani one may then by the same reason all proposit that are true and the mind is capabl ever of assent to may be said to be in the mind and to be imprint sinc if ani one can be said to be in the mind which it never yet knew it must be onli becaus it is capabl of know it and so the mind is of all truth it ever shall know nay thu truth may be imprint on the mind which it never did nor ever shall know for a man may live long and die at last in ignor of mani truth which hi mind wa capabl of know and that with certainti so that if the capac of know be the natur impress contend for all the truth a man ever come to know will by thi account be everi one of them innat and thi great point will amount to no more but onli to a veri improp way of speak which whilst it pretend to assert the contrari say noth differ from those who deni innat principl for nobodi i think ever deni that the mind wa capabl of know sever truth the capac they say is innat the knowledg acquir but then to what end such contest for certain innat maxim if truth can be imprint on the understand without be perceiv i can see no differ there can be between ani truth the mind is capabl of know in respect of their origin they must all be innat or all adventiti in vain shall a man go about to distinguish them he therefor that talk of innat notion in the understand can not if he intend therebi ani distinct sort of truth mean such truth to be in the understand as it never perceiv and is yet wholli ignor of for if these word to be in the understand have ani proprieti they signifi to be understood so that to be in the understand and not to be understood to be in the mind and never to be perceiv is all one as to say anyth is and is not in the mind or understand if therefor these two proposit whatsoev is is and it is imposs for the same thing to be and not to be are by natur imprint children can not be ignor of them infant and all that have soul must necessarili have them in their understand know the truth of them and assent to it that men know them when they come to the use of reason answer to avoid thi it is usual answer that all men know and assent to them when they come to the use of reason and thi is enough to prove them innat i answer doubt express that have scarc ani signif go for clear reason to those who be prepossess take not the pain to examin even what they themselv say for to appli thi answer with ani toler sens to our present purpos it must signifi one of these two thing either that as soon as men come to the use of reason these suppos nativ inscript come to be known and observ by them or els that the use and exercis of men reason assist them in the discoveri of these principl and certainli make them known to them if reason discov them that would not prove them innat if they mean that by the use of reason men may discov these principl and that thi is suffici to prove them innat their way of argu will stand thu viz that whatev truth reason can certainli discov to us and make us firmli assent to those are all natur imprint on the mind sinc that univers assent which is made the mark of them amount to no more but thisthat by the use of reason we are capabl to come to a certain knowledg of and assent to them and by thi mean there will be no differ between the maxim of the mathematician and theorem they deduc from them all must be equal allow innat they be all discoveri made by the use of reason and truth that a ration creatur may certainli come to know if he appli hi thought rightli that way it is fals that reason discov them but how can these men think the use of reason necessari to discov principl that are suppos innat when reason if we may believ them is noth els but the faculti of deduc unknown truth from principl or proposit that are alreadi known that certainli can never be thought innat which we have need of reason to discov unless as i have said we will have all the certain truth that reason ever teach us to be innat we may as well think the use of reason necessari to make our eye discov visibl object as that there should be need of reason or the exercis thereof to make the understand see what is origin engraven on it and can not be in the understand befor it be perceiv by it so that to make reason discov those truth thu imprint is to say that the use of reason discov to a man what he knew befor and if men have those innat impress truth origin and befor the use of reason and yet are alway ignor of them till they come to the use of reason it is in effect to say that men know and know them not at the same time no use made of reason in the discoveri of these two maxim it will here perhap be said that mathemat demonstr and other truth that are not innat are not assent to as soon as propos wherein they are distinguish from these maxim and other innat truth i shall have occas to speak of assent upon the first propos more particularli by and by i shall here onli and that veri readili allow that these maxim and mathemat demonstr are in thi differ that the one have need of reason use of proof to make them out and to gain our assent but the other as soon as understood are without ani the least reason embrac and assent to but i withal beg leav to observ that it lay open the weak of thi subterfug which requir the use of reason for the discoveri of these gener truth sinc it must be confess that in their discoveri there is no use made of reason at all and i think those who give thi answer will not be forward to affirm that the knowledg of thi maxim that it is imposs for the same thing to be and not to be is a deduct of our reason for thi would be to destroy that bounti of natur they seem so fond of whilst they make the knowledg of those principl to depend on the labour of our thought for all reason is search and cast about and requir pain and applic and how can it with ani toler sens be suppos that what wa imprint by natur as the foundat and guid of our reason should need the use of reason to discov it and if there were thi would prove them not innat those who will take the pain to reflect with a littl attent on the oper of the understand will find that thi readi assent of the mind to some truth depend not either on nativ inscript or the use of reason but on a faculti of the mind quit distinct from both of them as we shall see hereaft reason therefor have noth to do in procur our assent to these maxim if by say that men know and assent to them when they come to the use of reason be meant that the use of reason assist us in the knowledg of these maxim it is utterli fals and were it true would prove them not to be innat the come of the use of reason not the time we come to know these maxim if by know and assent to them when we come to the use of reason be meant that thi is the time when they come to be taken notic of by the mind and that as soon as children come to the use of reason they come also to know and assent to these maxim thi also is fals and frivol first it is fals becaus it is evid these maxim are not in the mind so earli as the use of reason and therefor the come to the use of reason is fals assign as the time of their discoveri how mani instanc of the use of reason may we observ in children a long time befor they have ani knowledg of thi maxim that it is imposs for the same thing to be and not to be and a great part of illiter peopl and savag pass mani year even of their ration age without ever think on thi and the like gener proposit i grant men come not to the knowledg of these gener and more abstract truth which are thought innat till they come to the use of reason and i add nor then neither which is so becaus till after they come to the use of reason those gener abstract idea are not frame in the mind about which those gener maxim are which are mistaken for innat principl but are inde discoveri made and veriti introduc and brought into the mind by the same way and discov by the same step as sever other proposit which nobodi wa ever so extravag as to suppos innat thi i hope to make plain in the sequel of thi discours i allow therefor a necess that men should come to the use of reason befor they get the knowledg of those gener truth but deni that men come to the use of reason is the time of their discoveri by thi they are not distinguish from other knowabl truth in the mean time it is observ that thi say that men know and assent to these maxim when they come to the use of reason amount in realiti of fact to no more but thisthat they are never known nor taken notic of befor the use of reason but may possibl be assent to some time after dure a man life but when is uncertain and so may all other knowabl truth as well as these which therefor have no advantag nor distinct from other by thi note of be known when we come to the use of reason nor are therebi prove to be innat but quit the contrari if come to the use of reason were the time of their discoveri it would not prove them innat but secondli were it true that the precis time of their be known and assent to were when men come to the use of reason neither would that prove them innat thi way of argu is as frivol as the supposit itself is fals for by what kind of logic will it appear that ani notion is origin by natur imprint in the mind in it first constitut becaus it come first to be observ and assent to when a faculti of the mind which ha quit a distinct provinc begin to exert itself and therefor the come to the use of speech if it were suppos the time that these maxim are first assent to which it may be with as much truth as the time when men come to the use of reason would be as good a proof that they were innat as to say they are innat becaus men assent to them when they come to the use of reason i agre then with these men of innat principl that there is no knowledg of these gener and selfevid maxim in the mind till it come to the exercis of reason but i deni that the come to the use of reason is the precis time when they are first taken notic of and if that were the precis time i deni that it would prove them innat all that can with ani truth be meant by thi proposit that men assent to them when they come to the use of reason is no more but thisthat the make of gener abstract idea and the understand of gener name be a concomit of the ration faculti and grow up with it children commonli get not those gener idea nor learn the name that stand for them till have for a good while exercis their reason about familiar and more particular idea they are by their ordinari discours and action with other acknowledg to be capabl of ration convers if assent to these maxim when men come to the use of reason can be true in ani other sens i desir it may be shown or at least how in thi or ani other sens it prove them innat the step by which the mind attain sever truth the sens at first let in particular idea and furnish the yet empti cabinet and the mind by degre grow familiar with some of them they are lodg in the memori and name got to them afterward the mind proceed further abstract them and by degre learn the use of gener name in thi manner the mind come to be furnish with idea and languag the materi about which to exercis it discurs faculti and the use of reason becom daili more visibl as these materi that give it employ increas but though the have of gener idea and the use of gener word and reason usual grow togeth yet i see not how thi ani way prove them innat the knowledg of some truth i confess is veri earli in the mind but in a way that show them not to be innat for if we will observ we shall find it still to be about idea not innat but acquir it be about those first which are imprint by extern thing with which infant have earliest to do which make the most frequent impress on their sens in idea thu got the mind discov that some agre and other differ probabl as soon as it ha ani use of memori as soon as it is abl to retain and perceiv distinct idea but whether it be then or no thi is certain it doe so long befor it ha the use of word or come to that which we commonli call the use of reason for a child know as certainli befor it can speak the differ between the idea of sweet and bitter ie that sweet is not bitter as it know afterward when it come to speak that wormwood and sugarplum are not the same thing assent to suppos innat truth depend on have clear and distinct idea of what their term mean and not on their innat a child know not that three and four are equal to seven till he come to be abl to count seven and ha got the name and idea of equal and then upon explain those word he present assent to or rather perceiv the truth of that proposit but neither doe he then readili assent becaus it is an innat truth nor wa hi assent want till then becaus he want the use of reason but the truth of it appear to him as soon as he ha settl in hi mind the clear and distinct idea that these name stand for and then he know the truth of that proposit upon the same ground and by the same mean that he knew befor that a rod and a cherri are not the same thing and upon the same ground also that he may come to know afterward that it is imposs for the same thing to be and not to be as shall be more fulli shown hereaft so that the later it is befor ani one come to have those gener idea about which those maxim are or to know the signif of those gener term that stand for them or to put togeth in hi mind the idea they stand for the later also will it be befor he come to assent to those maximswhos term with the idea they stand for be no more innat than those of a cat or a weasel he must stay till time and observ have acquaint him with them and then he will be in a capac to know the truth of these maxim upon the first occas that shall make him put togeth those idea in hi mind and observ whether they agre or disagre accord as is express in those proposit and therefor it is that a man know that eighteen and nineteen are equal to thirtyseven by the same selfevid that he know one and two to be equal to three yet a child know thi not so soon as the other not for want of the use of reason but becaus the idea the word eighteen nineteen and thirtyseven stand for are not so soon got as those which are signifi by one two and three assent as soon as propos and understood prove them not innat thi evas therefor of gener assent when men come to the use of reason fail as it doe and leav no differ between those suppos innat and other truth that are afterward acquir and learnt men have endeavour to secur an univers assent to those they call maxim by say they are gener assent to as soon as propos and the term they are propos in understood see all men even children as soon as they hear and understand the term assent to these proposit they think it is suffici to prove them innat for sinc men never fail after they have onc understood the word to acknowledg them for undoubt truth they would infer that certainli these proposit were first lodg in the understand which without ani teach the mind at the veri first propos immedi close with and assent to and after that never doubt again if such an assent be a mark of innat then that one and two are equal to three that sweet if not bitter and a thousand the like must be inat in answer to thi i demand whether readi assent given to a proposit upon first hear and understand the term be a certain mark of an innat principl if it be not such a gener assent is in vain urg as a proof of them if it be said that it is a mark of innat they must then allow all such proposit to be innat which are gener assent to as soon as heard wherebi they will find themselv plenti store with innat principl for upon the same ground viz of assent at first hear and understand the term that men would have those maxim pass for innat they must also admit sever proposit about number to be innat and thu that one and two are equal to three that two and two are equal to four and a multitud of other the like proposit in number that everybodi assent to at first hear and understand the term must have a place amongst these innat axiom nor is thi the prerog of number alon and proposit made about sever of them but even natur philosophi and all the other scienc afford proposit which are sure to meet with assent as soon as they are understood that two bodi can not be in the same place is a truth that nobodi ani more stick at than at these maxim that it is imposs for the same thing to be and not to be that white is not black that a squar is not a circl that bitter is not sweet these and a million of such other proposit as mani at least as we have distinct idea of everi man in hi wit at first hear and know what the name stand for must necessarili assent to if these men will be true to their own rule and have assent at first hear and understand the term to be a mark of innat they must allow not onli as mani innat proposit as men have distinct idea but as mani as men can make proposit wherein differ idea are deni one of anoth sinc everi proposit wherein one differ idea is deni of anoth will as certainli find assent at first hear and understand the term as thi gener one it is imposs for the same thing to be and not to be or that which is the foundat of it and is the easier understood of the two the same is not differ by which account they will have legion of innat proposit of thi one sort without mention ani other but sinc no proposit can be innat unless the idea about which it is be innat thi will be to suppos all our idea of colour sound tast figur c innat than which there can not be anyth more opposit to reason and experi univers and readi assent upon hear and understand the term is i grant a mark of selfevid but selfevid depend not on innat impress but on someth els as we shall show hereaft belong to sever proposit which nobodi wa yet so extravag as to pretend to be innat such less gener proposit known befor these univers maxim nor let it be said that those more particular selfevid proposit which are assent to at first hear as that one and two are equal to three that green is not red c are receiv as the consequ of those more univers proposit which are look on as innat principl sinc ani one who will but take the pain to observ what pass in the understand will certainli find that these and the like less gener proposit are certainli known and firmli assent to by those who are utterli ignor of those more
