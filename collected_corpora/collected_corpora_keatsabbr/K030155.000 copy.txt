upon hi useless occup and would intim the degrad it wa to him to hear hi frivol talent spoken of in all compani henri believ hi brother much wiser than himself and suffer shame that he wa not more worthi of such a relat to consol himself for the familiar friend whom he now perceiv he had entir lost he search for one of a softer natur he marri chapter vi as henri despair of receiv hi brother approb of hi choic he never mention the event to him but william be told of it by a third person inquir of henri who confirm the truth of the intellig and acknowledg that in take a wife hi sole view had been to obtain a kind companion and friend who would bear with hi fail and know how to esteem hi few qualif therefor he had chosen one of hi own rank in life and who have a tast for music and as well as himself an oblig to the art and is it possibl cri the dean that what ha been hint to me is true is it possibl that you have marri a public finger she is as good as myself return henri i did not wish her to be better for fear she should despis me as to despis answer the dean heaven forbid that we should despis ani one that would be act unlik a christian but do you imagin i can ever introduc her to my intend wife who is a woman of famili henri had receiv in hi life mani insult from hi brother but as he wa not a vain man he gener thought hi brother in the right and consequ submit with patienc but though he had littl selflov he had for hi wife an unbound affect on the present occas therefor he began to rais hi voic and even in the coars express of clownish anger to lift hi hand but the sudden and affect recollect of what he had done for the dean of the pain the toil the hope and the fear he had experienc when solicit hi prefer thi recollect overpow hi speech weaken hi arm and depriv him of everi activ forc but that of fli out of the dean hous in which they then were as swift as lightn while the dean sat proudli contempl that he had done hi duti for sever day henri did not call as wa hi custom to see hi brother william marriag drew near and he sent a formal card to invit him on that day but not have had the condescens to name hi sisterinlaw in the invit henri took no notic of it and the joy event wa celebr without hi presenc but the ardour of the bridegroom wa not so vehement as to overcom everi other sensat he miss hi brother that heartfelt cheer with which henri had ever given him joy upon everi happi occas even amidst all the polit congratul of hi other friend seem to the dean mourn want thi derog from hi felic he wa resolv to resent and for a whole year these brother whom advers had entwin close togeth prosper separ though henri on hi marriag paid so much attent to hi brother prejudic as to take hi wife from her public employ thi had not so entir remov the scrupl of william as to permit him to think her a worthi companion for ladi clementina the daughter of a poor scotch earl whom he had chosen mere that he might be proud of her famili though in return he should suffer that famili to be asham of hi if henri wife wa not fit compani for ladi clementina it is to be hope she wa compani for angel she die within the first year of her marriag a faith an affection wife and a mother when william heard of her death he felt a sudden shock and a kind of fleet thought glanc across hi mind that had he known she had been so near her dissolut she might have been introduc to ladi clementina and he himself would have call her sister that is if he had defin hi fleet idea they would have had no object to have met thi poor woman for the last time and would have descend to the familiar of kindr in order to have wish her a good journey to the other world or is there in death someth that so rais the abject of the poor that on their approach to it shelter abod the arrog believ feel the equal he had befor deni and trembl chapter vii the wife of henri had been dead near six week befor the dean heard the news a month then elaps in thought by himself and consult with ladi clementina how he should conduct himself on thi occurr her advic wa that as henri wa the youngest and by their station in everi sens the dean inferior he ought first to make overtur of reconcili the dean answer he had no doubt of hi brother good will to him but that he had reason to think from the knowledg of hi temper he would be more like to come to him upon an occas to bestow comfort than to receiv it for instanc if i had suffer the misfortun of lose you my brother i have no doubt would have forgotten hi resent and she wa offend that the loss of the vulgar wife of henri should be compar to the loss of her she lament her indiscret in form an allianc with a famili of no rank and implor the dean to wait till hi brother should make some concess to him befor he renew the acquaint though ladi clementina had mention on thi occas her indiscret she wa of a prudent age she wa near forti yet possess rather a handsom face and person she would not have impress the spectat with an idea that she wa near so old had she not constantli attempt to appear much younger her dress wa fantast fashion her manner affect all the variou passion of youth and her convers wa perpetu embellish with accus upon her own heedless thoughtless careless and childish there is perhap in everi individu one parent motiv to everi action good or bad be that as it will it wa evid that with ladi clementina all she said or did all she thought or look had but one foundat vaniti if she wa nice or if she wa neglig vaniti wa the caus of both for she would contempl with the highest degre of selfcomplac what such a one would say of her eleg precis or what such a one would think of her interest neglect if she complain she wa ill it wa with the certainti that her languor would be admir if she boast she wa well it wa that the spectat might admir her glow health if she laugh it wa becaus she thought it made her look pretti if she cri it wa becaus she thought it made her look prettier still if she scold her servant it wa from vaniti to show her superior knowledg to their and she wa kind to them from the same vice that her benevol might excit their admir forward and impertin in the compani of her equal from the vaniti of suppos herself abov them she wa bash even to shamefaced in the presenc of her superior becaus her vaniti told her she engross all their observ through vaniti she had no memori for she constantli forgot everi thing she heard other say from the minut attent which she paid to everi thing she said herself she had becom an old maid from vaniti believ no offer she receiv worthi of her desert and when her power of farther conquest began to be doubt she marri from vaniti to repair the charact of her fade charm in a word her vaniti wa of that magnitud that she had no idea but that she wa humbl in her own opinion and it would have been imposs to have convinc her that she thought well of herself becaus she thought so well as to be assur that her own thought undervalu her chapter viii that which in a weak woman is call vaniti in a man of sens is term pride make one a degre stronger or the other a degre weaker and the dean and hi wife were infect with the selfsam folli yet do not let the reader suppos that thi fail howev despic had eras from either bosom all trace of human they are human creatur who are meant to be pourtray in thi littl book and where is the human creatur who ha not some good qualiti to soften if not counterbal hi bad one the dean with all hi pride could not wholli forget hi brother nor erad from hi remembr the friend he had been to him he resolv therefor in spite of hi wife advic to make him some overtur which he had no doubt but henri good natur would instantli accept the more he becam acquaint with all the vain and selfish propens of ladi clementina the more he felt a return affect for hi brother but littl did he suspect how much he love him till after send to variou place to enquir for him he

a mind of singular sensibl but william had not discern till then that everi act of henri wa of the same descript and more than all hi everi act toward him he stagger when he heard the tide at first thought them untru but quickli recollect that henri wa capabl of surpris deed he recollect with a forc that gave him tortur the benevol hi brother had ever shown toward him the favor he had heap upon him the insult he had patient endur in requit in the first emot which thi intellig gave the dean he forgot the digniti of hi walk and gestur he ran with frantic enthusiasm to everi corner of hi hous

had given him he even took up a musicbook of hi brother with delight nor would hi poor violin had it been there have then excit anger when hi grief becam more calm he sat in deep and melancholi medit call to mind when and where he saw hi brother last the recollect gave him fresh caus of regret he rememb they had part on hi refus to suffer ladi clementina to admit the acquaint of henri wife both henri and hi wife he now contempl beyond the reach of hi pride and he felt the mean of hi triumph to add to hi selfreproach he beheld in hi torment memori the counten of hi brother at their last
