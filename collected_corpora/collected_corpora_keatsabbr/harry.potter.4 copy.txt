two hundr mile away the boy call harri potter woke with a start chapter two ­ the scar harri lay flat on hi back breath hard as though he had been run he had awoken from a vivid dream with hi hand press over hi face the old scar on hi forehead which wa shape like a bolt of lightn wa burn beneath hi finger as though someon had just press a white­hot wire to hi skin he sat up one hand still on hi scar the other hand reach out in the dark for hi glass which were on the bedsid tabl he put them on and hi bedroom came into clearer focu lit by a faint misti orang light that wa filter through the curtain from the street lamp outsid the window harri ran hi finger over the scar again it wa still pain he turn on the lamp besid him scrambl out of bed cross the room open hi wardrob and peer into the mirror on the insid of the door a skinni boy of fourteen look back at him hi bright green eye puzzl under hi untidi black hair he examin the lightning­bolt scar of hi reflect more close it look

cube had slip down into hi stomach at the veri thought he close hi eye tightli and tri to rememb what voldemort had look like but it wa impossibleal harri knew wa that at the moment when voldemort chair had swung around and he harri had seen what wa sit in it he had felt a spasm of horror which had awoken himor had that been the pain in hi scar and who had the old man been for there had definit been an old man harri had watch him fall to the ground it wa all becom confus harri put hi face into hi hand block out hi bedroom tri to hold on to the pictur of that dimli lit room but it wa like tri to keep water in hi cup hand the detail were now trickl away as fast as he tri to hold on to themvoldemort and wormtail had been talk about someon they had kill though harri could not rememb the nameand they had been plot to kill someon elsehim harri took hi face out of hi hand open hi eye and stare around hi bedroom as though expect to see someth unusu there as it happen there wa an extraordinari number of unusu thing in thi room a larg wooden trunk stood open at the foot of hi bed reveal a cauldron broomstick black robe and assort spellbook roll of parchment litter that part of hi desk that wa not taken up by the larg empti cage in which hi snowi owl hedwig usual perch on the floor besid hi bed a book lay open harri had been read it befor he fell asleep last night the pictur in thi book were all move men in bright orang robe were zoom in and out of sight on broomstick throw a red ball to one anoth harri walk over to the book pick it up and watch on of the wizard score a spectacular goal by put the ball through a fifty­foot­high hoop then he snap the book shut even quidditch ­­ in harri opinion the best sport in the world ­­ couldnt distract him at the moment he place fli with the cannon on hi bedsid tabl cross to the window and drew back the curtain to survey the street below privet drive look exactli as a respect suburban street would be expect to look inth earli hour of saturday morn all the curtain were close as far as harri could see through the dark there wasnt a live creatur in sight not even a cat and yetand yetharri went restlessli back to the bed and sat down on it run a finger over hi scar again it wasnt the pain that bother him harri wa no stranger to pain and injuri he had lost all the bone from hi right arm onc and had them pain regrown in a night the same arm had been pierc by a venem foot­long fang not long afterward onli last year harri had fallen fifti feet from an airborn broomstick he wa use to bizarr accid and injuri they were unavoid if you attend hogwart school of witchcraft and wizardri and had a knack for attract a lot of troubl no the thing that wa bother harri wa the last time hi scar had hurt him it had been becaus voldemort had been close bybut voldemort couldnt be here nowth idea of voldemort lurk in privet drive wa absurd imposs harri listen close to the silenc around him wa he half expect to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak and then he jump slightli as he heard hi cousin dudley give a tremend grunt snore from the next room harri shook himself mental he wa be stupid there wa no one in the hous with him except uncl vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainli still asleep their dream untroubl and painless asleep wa the way harri like the dursley best it wasnt as though they were ever ani help to him awak uncl vernon aunt petunia and dudley were harri onli live rel they were muggl who hate and despis magic in ani form which meant that harri wa about as welcom in their hous as dri rot they had explain away harri long absenc at hogwart over the last three year by tell everyon that he went to st brutuss secur center for incur crimin boy they knew perfectli well that as an underag wizard harri wasnt allow to use magic outsid hogwart but they were still apt to blame him for anyth that went wrong about the hous harri had never been abl to confid in them or tell them anyth about hi life in the wizard world the veri idea of go to them when they awok and tell them about hi scar hurt him and about hi worri about voldemort wa laughabl and yet it wa becaus of voldemort that harri had come to live with the dursley in the first place if it hadnt been for voldemort harri would not have had the lightn scar on hi forehead if it hadnt been for voldemort harri would still have had parent harri had been a year old the night that voldemort ­­ the most power dark wizard for a centuri a wizard who had been gain power steadili for eleven year ­­ arriv at hi hous and kill hi father and mother voldemort had then turn hi wand on harri he had perform the curs that had dispos of mani full­grown witch and wizard in hi steadi rise to power ­­ and incred it had not work instead of kill the small boy the curs had rebound upon voldemort harri had surviv with noth but a lightning­shap cut on hi forehead and voldemort had been reduc to someth bare aliv hi power gone hi life almost extinguish voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret commun of witch and wizard had live for so long had lift voldemort follow had disband and harri potter had becom famou it had been enough of a shock for harri to discov on hi eleventh birthday that he wa a wizard it had been even more disconcert to find out that everyon in the hidden wizard world knew hi name harri had arriv at hogwart to find that head turn and whisper follow him wherev he went but he wa use to it now at the end of thi summer he would be start hi fourth year at hogwart and harri wa alreadi count the day until he would be back at the castl again but there wa still a fortnight to go befor he went back to school he look hopelessli around hi room again and hi eye paus on the birthday card hi two best friend had sent him at the end of juli what would they say if harri wrote to them and told them about hi scar hurt at onc hermion granger voic seem to fill hi head shrill and panicki your scar hurt harri that realli seriou write to professor dumbledor and ill go and check common magic ailment and afflict mayb there someth in there about curs scar ye that would be hermion advic go straight to the headmast of hogwart and in the meantim consult a book harri stare out of the window at the inki blue­black sky he doubt veri much whether a book could help him now as far as he knew he wa the onli live person to have surviv a curs like voldemort it wa highli unlik therefor that he would find hi symptom list in common magic ailment and afflict as for inform the headmast harri had no idea where dumbledor went dure the summer holiday he amus himself for a moment pictur dumbledor with hi long silver beard full length wizard robe and point hat stretch out on a beach somewher rub suntan lotion onto hi long crook nose wherev dumbledor wa though harri wa sure that hedwig would be abl to find him harri owl had never yet fail to deliv a letter to anyon even without an address but what would he write dear professor dumbledor sorri to bother you but my scar hurt thi morn your sincer harri potter even insid hi head the word sound stupid and so he tri to imagin hi other best friend ron weasley reaction and in a moment ron red hair and long­nos freckl face seem to swim befor harri wear a bemus express your scar hurt but but you­know­who cant be near you now can he i mean youd know wouldnt you hed be tri to do you in again wouldnt be i dunno harri mayb curs scar alway twing a bit ill ask dad mr weasley wa a fulli qualifi wizard who work in the misus of muggl artifact offic at the ministri of magic but he didnt have ani particular expertis in the matter of curs as far as harri knew in ani case harri didnt like the idea of the whole weasley famili know that he harri wa get jumpi about a few moment pain mr weasley would fuss wors than hermion and fred and georg ron sixteen­ year­old twin brother might think harri wa lose hi nerv the weasley were harri favorit famili in the world he wa hope that they might invit him to stay ani time now ron had mention someth about the quidditch world cup and he somehow didnt want hi visit punctuat with anxiou inquiri about hi scar harri knead hi forehead with hi knuckl what he realli want and it felt almost shame to admit it to himself wa someon like ­ someon like a parent an adult wizard whose advic he could ask without feel stupid someon who care about him who had had experi with dark magic and then the solut came to him it wa so simpl and so obviou that he couldnt believ it had taken so long ­ siriu harri leapt up from the bed hurri across the room and sat down at hi desk he pull a piec of parchment toward him load hi eagle­feath quill with ink wrote dear siriu then paus wonder how best to phrase hi problem still marvel at the fact that he hadnt thought of siriu straight away but then perhap it wasnt so surpris ­ after all he had onli found out that siriu wa hi godfath two month ago there wa a simpl reason for siriuss complet absenc from harri life until then ­ siriu had been in azkaban the terrifi wizard jail guard by creatur call dementor sightless soul­suck fiend who had come to search for siriu at hogwart when he had escap yet siriu had been innoc ­ the murder for which he had been convict had been commit by wormtail voldemort support whom nearli everybodi now believ dead harri ron and hermion knew otherwis howev they had come face­to­fac with wormtail onli the previou year though onli professor dumbledor had believ their stori for one gloriou hour harri had believ that he wa leav the dursley at last becaus siriu had offer him a home onc hi name had been clear but the chanc had been snatch away from him ­ wormtail had escap befor they could take him to the ministri of magic and siriu had had to flee for hi life harri had help him escap on the back of a hippogriff call buckbeak and sinc then siriu had been on the run the home harri might have had if wormtail had not escap had been haunt him all summer it had been doubli hard to return to the dursley know that he had so nearli escap them forev nevertheless siriu had been of some help to harri even if he couldnt be with him it wa due to siriu that harri now had all hi school thing in hi bedroom with him the dursley had never allow thi befor their gener wish of keep harri as miser as possibl coupl with their fear of hi power had led them to lock hi school trunk in the cupboard under the stair everi summer prior to thi but their attitud had chang sinc they had found out that harri had a danger murder for a godfath ­ for harri had conveni forgotten to tell them that siriu wa innoc harri had receiv two letter from siriu sinc he had been back at privet drive both had been deliv not by owl as wa usual with wizard but by larg brightli color tropic bird hedwig had not approv of these flashi intrud she had been most reluct to allow them to drink from her water tray befor fli off again harri on the other hand had like them they put him in mind of palm tree and white sand and he hope that wherev siriu wa siriu never said in case the letter were intercept he wa enjoy himself somehow harri found it hard to imag dementor
