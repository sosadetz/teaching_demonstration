thought necessari and that i had never seen six truli love ladi in my life to be brief she went in and after a littl while came out again the ladi sir is retir to her closet so you may go in and look

the cloth if we suppos those who have the best opportun to be good less perfect than other peopl for my part i dont love profession ani more than nation reflect but i keep the ladi in her closet my gout make me rude then up from my seat stump i what do you call these windowcurtain madam stuffdamask sir it look mighti well truli i like it better than silk it is warmer to be sure and much fitter

propos a parson to me by way of compromis i told them the condit my spous had made me swear to and which she held me to in order i said to induc me the sooner to be reconcil to her relat i own that thi restraint made me sometim readi to fli out and mr moor wa so good as to declar that she did not much wonder at it thou art a veri good sort of woman mr moor thought i as miss how ha actual detect our mother and might possibl find some way still to acquaint her friend with her discoveri i thought it proper to prepossess them in mr sinclair favor and in that of her two niec i said they were gentlewomen born had not bad heart that inde my spous did not love them they have onc jointli taken the liberti to blame her for her overnic with regard to me peopl i said even good peopl who knew themselv to be guilti of a fault they had no inclin to mend were too often least patient when told of it as they could less bear than other to be thought indiffer of too often the case they own mr sinclair hous wa a veri handsom hous and fit to receiv the first qualiti true enough jack mr sinclair wa a woman veri easi in her circumst a widowgentlewoman as you mr moor are let lodg as you mr moor do onc had better prospect as you mr moor may have had the relict of colonel sinclair you mr moor might know colonel sinclair he had lodg at hamstead she had heard of the name o he wa relat to the best famili in scotland and hi widow is not to be reflect upon becaus she let lodg you know mr moor you know miss rawlin veri true and veri true and they must need say it did not look quit so pretti in such a ladi as my spous to be so censori a foundat here thought i to procur these women help to get back the fugit or their conniv at least at my do so as well as for anticip ani futur inform from miss how i gave them a charact of that virago and intin that for a head to contriv mischief and a heart to execut it she had hardli her equal in her sex to thi miss how it wa mr moor said she suppos that my spous wa so desir to dispatch a man and hors by daydawn with a letter she wrote befor she went to bed last night propos to stay no longer than till she had receiv an answer to it the veri same said i i knew she would have immedi recours to her i should have been but too happi could i have prevent such a letter from pass or so to have manag as to have it given into mr how hand instead of her daughter women who had live some time in the world knew better than to encourag such skittish prank in young wive let me just stop to tell thee while it is in my head that i have sinc given will hi cue to find out where the man live who is gone with the fair fugit letter and if possibl to see him on hi return befor he see her i told the women that i despair it would ever be better with us while miss how had so strang a predomin over my spous and remain herself unmarri and until the reconcili with her friend could be effect or a still happier event as i should think it who am the last male of my famili and which my foolish vow and her rigor had hitherto here i stop and look modest turn my diamond ring round my finger while goodi moor look mighti signific call it a veri particular case and the maiden ladi fan away and primmd and pursd to show that what i said need no farther explan i told them the occas of our present differ avow the realiti of the fire but own that i would have made no scrupl of break the unnatur oath she had bound me in have an husband right of my side when she wa so accident fright into my arm and i blame myself excess that i did not sinc she thought fit to carri her resent so high and had the injustic to suppos the fire to be a contriv of mine nay for that matter mr moor said as we were marri and madam wa so odd everi gentleman would not and there stop mr moor to suppos i should have recours to such a poor contriv said i when i saw the dear creatur everi hour wa not thi a bold put jack a most extraordinari case truli the maiden ladi fan yet come in with her wellbut and her sift praysir and her restrain enoughsir fli from the question to the question her seat nowandthen uneasi for fear my want of delicaci should hurt her abund modesti and yet it wa difficult to satisfi her superabund curios my belov jealousi which of itself to femal mind account for a thousand unaccount and the imput of her halfphrensi brought upon her by her father wick curs and by the previou persecut she had undergon from all her famili were what i dwelt upon in order to provid against what might happen in short i own against myself most of the offens which i did not doubt but she would charg me with in their hear and as everi caus ha a black and a white side i gave the worst part of our stori the gentlest turn and when i had done gave them some partial hint of the content of captain tomlinson letter which i had left with her with a caution to be guard against the inquiri of jame harlow and of captain singleton or of ani sailorlook men thi thou will see from the letter itself wa necessari to be done here therefor thou may read it and a charm letter to my purpos if thou give the least attent to it content will thou find it to be to robert lovelac esquir dear sir wedn june although i am oblig to be in town tomorrow or next day at farthest yet i would not dispens with write to you by one of my servant whom i send up befor me upon a particular occas in order to advertis you that it is probabl you will hear from some of your own relat on your suppos what is between hook thou may suppos jack i sunk upon the women in the account i gave them of the content of thi letter nuptial one of the person mr lilburn by name to whom i hint my belief of your marriag happen to be acquaint with mr spurrier ladi betti lawranc steward and not be under ani restrict mention it to mr spurrier and he to ladi betti as a thing certain and thi though i have not the honor to be person known to her ladyship brought on an inquiri from her ladyship to me by her gentleman who come to me in compani with mr lilburn i had no way but to confirm the report and i understand that ladi betti take it amiss that she wa not acquaint with so desir a piec of news from yourself her ladyship it seem ha busi that call her to town and you will possibl choos to put her right if you do it will i presum be in confid that noth may perspir from your own famili to contradict what i have given out i have ever been of opinion that truth ought to be strictli adher to on all occas and am concern that i have depart though with so good a view from my old maxim but my dear friend mr john harlow would have it so yet i never knew a departur of thi kind a singl departur but to make the best of it now allow me sir onc more to beg the ladi as soon as possibl to authent the report given out when you both join in the acknowleg it will be impertin in ani one to be inquisit as to the day or week and if as privat celebr as you intend while the gentlewomen with whom you lodg are properli instruct as you say they are and who actual believ you were marri long ago who shall be abl to give a contradict to my report and yet it is veri probabl that minut inquiri will be made and thi is what render precaut necessari for mr jame harlow will not believ that you are marri and is sure he say that you both live togeth when mr hickman applic wa made to mr john harlow and if you live togeth ani time unmarri he infer from your charact mr lovelac that it is not probabl that you would ever marri and he leav it to hi two uncl to decid if you even should be marri whether there be not room to believ that hi sister wa first dishonor and if so to judg of the titl she will have to their favor or to the forgiv of ani of her famili i believ sir thi part of my letter had best to be kept from the ladi what make young mr harlow the more earnest to find thi out and find it out he is resolv and to come at hi sister speech too and for that purpos set out tomorrow as i am wellinform with a larg attend arm and mr solm is to be of the parti is thi mr john harlow ha told the whole famili that he will alter and newsettl hi will mr antoni harlow is resolv to do the same by hi for it seem he ha now given over all thought of chang hi condit have late been disappoint in a view he had of that sort with mr how these two brother gener act in concert and mr jame harlow dread and let me tell you that he ha reason for it on my mr harlow account that hi younger sister will be at last more benefit than he wish for by the alter intend he ha alreadi been endeavor to sound hi uncl harlow on thi subject and want to know whether ani new applic had been made to him on hi sister part mr harlow avoid a direct answer and express hi wish for a gener reconcili and hi hope that hi niec wa marri thi offend the furiou young man and he remind hi uncl of engag they had all enter into at hi sister go away not to be reconcil but by gener consent mr john harlow complain to me often of the uncontroul of hi nephew and say that now that the young man ha not anybodi of whose superior sens he stand in awe he observ not decenc in hi behavior to ani of them and thi make my mr harlow still more desir than ever of bring hi younger niec into favor again i will not say all i might of thi young man extraordinari rapaci but one would think that these grasp men expect to live for ever i took the liberti but within these two hour to propos to set on foot and offer my cover to a correspond between my friend and hi daughterniec as he still sometim fondli call her she wa mistress of so much prudenc i said that i wa sure she could better direct everi thing to it desir end than anybodi els could but he said he did
