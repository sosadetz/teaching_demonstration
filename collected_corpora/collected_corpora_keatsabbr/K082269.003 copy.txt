forbor to seek herself when one morn while she wa sit with miss belfield her maid told her that young mr delvil wa in the drawingroom and beg the honor of see her for a few moment cecilia though she start and chang color with surpris at thi messag wa unconsci she did either from the yet greater surpris she receiv by the behavior of miss belfield who hastili aris exclaim good god mr delvil do you know mr delvil madam doe mr delvil visit at thi hous sometim not often answer cecilia but whi i dont know noth madam i onli ask by accid i believ but it is veri it is extrem i did not know and color

absenc of mind and told her he had onli call to acquaint her that the command with which she had honor him were now obey and he hope to her satisfact cecilia who knew not she had ever given him ani wait hi further explan and he then inform her he had that veri morn introduc mr belfield to the earl of vannelt who had alreadi heard him veri advantag spoken of by some gentlemen to whom he had been known at the univers and who wa so much pleas with him upon thi first interview that he meant after a few enquiri which could not but turn out to hi credit to commit hi eldest son to hi trust in make the tour of europ cecilia thank him for her share in the troubl he had taken in thi transact and then ask if mr delvil continu well ye answer he with a smile half reproach as well as one who have ever hope your favor can easili be after find that hope disappoint but much as she ha taught her son there is one lesson she might perhap learn from him to fli not seek those danger indulg of which the

he allud should be fli a danger indulg she could not understand sinc he had so littl reason to fear ani repuls in continu to seek it sorri howev for the abrupt manner in which she had left miss belfield she lost not a moment in hasten back to her but when she came into the room she found her employ in look out of the window her eye follow some object with such earnest of attent that she perceiv not her return cecilia who could not doubt the motiv of her curios had no great difficulti in forbear to offer her ani interrupt she drew her head back in a few minut and cast it upward with her hand clasp softli whisper heaven ever shield and bless him and o may he never feel such pain as i do she then again look out but soon draw herself in said in the same soft accent oh whi art thou gone sweetest and noblest of men whi might i not see thee longer when under heaven there is no other bless i wish for a sigh which at these word escap cecilia made her start and turn toward the door the deepest blush overspread the cheek of both as their eye met each other and while miss belfield trembl in everi limb at the discoveri she had made cecilia herself wa hardli abl to stand a pain and most embarrass silenc succeed which wa onli broken by miss belfield burst into tear cecilia extrem move forgot for a moment her own interest in what wa pass and tenderli approach embrac her with the

make ani opposit embrac her again and suffer her quietli to depart her own mind wa now in a state of the utmost confus the rectitud of her heart and the sound of her judgment had hitherto guard her both from error and blame and except dure her recent suspens had preserv her tranquil inviol but her commerc with the world had been small and confin and her action had had littl refer but to herself the case wa now alter and she wa suddenli in a conjunctur of all other the most delic that of accident discov a rival in a favorit friend the fond she had conceiv for miss belfield and the sincer of her intent as well as promis to serv her made the detect of thi secret peculiarli cruel she had late felt no pleasur but in her societi and look forward to much futur comfort from the continu of her regard and from their constantli live togeth but now thi wa no longer even to be desir sinc the utter annihil of the wish of both by young delvil be dispos of to a third person could alon render elig their dwell under the same roof her piti howev for miss belfield wa almost wholli unallay by jealousi she harbor not ani suspicion that she wa love by young delvil whose aspir spirit led her infinit more to fear some higher rival than to believ he bestow even a thought upon the poor henrietta but still she wish with the utmost ardour to know the length of their acquaint how often they had met when they had convers what notic he had taken of her and how so danger a prefer had invad her heart but though thi curios wa both natur and power her princip concern wa the arrang of her own conduct the next day miss belfield wa to tell her everi thing by a voluntari promis but she doubt if she had ani right to accept such a confid miss belfield she wa sure knew not she wa interest in the tale sinc she had not even imagin that delvil wa known to her she might hope therefor not onli for advic but assist and fanci that while she repos her secret in the bosom of a friend she secur herself her best offic and best wish for ever would she obtain them no the most romant generos would revolt from such a demand for howev precari wa her own chanc with young delvil miss belfield she wa sure could not have ani neither her birth nor educ fit her for hi rank in life and even were both unexception the small of her fortun as mr monckton had instruct her would be an obstacl insurmount would it not be a kind of treacheri to gather from her everi thing yet aid her in noth to take advantag of her unsuspici open in order to learn all that relat to one whom she yet hope would belong ultim to herself and gratifi an interest curios at the expens of a candor not more simpl than amiabl no cri cecilia art that i could never forgiv i never will practic thi sweet but unhappi girl shall tell me noth

of my futur solicitud the sympathi of our situat will not then divid but unit us and i will take her to my bosom hear all her sorrow and calm her troubl spirit by particip in her sensibl but if on the contrari thi mysteri end more happili for myself if mr delvil ha now no other engag and hereaft clear hi conduct to my satisfact i will not be aecessori to load her futur recollect with the shame of a confid she then can not but repent nor with an injuri to her delicaci that may wound it for ever she determin therefor care to avoid the subject for the present sinc she could offer no advic for which she might not hereaft be suspect of selfish motiv but yet from a real regard to the tenderheart girl to give all the tacit discourag that wa in her power to a passion which she firmli believ would be product of noth but miseri onc from the frank natur to her disposit she thought not mere of receiv but return her confid her better judgment howev soon led her from so hazard a plan which could onli have expos them both to a romant humili by which in the end their mutual expect might prove sourc of mutual distrust when miss belfield therefor the next morn her air unusu timid and her whole face cover with blush made her visit cecilia not seem to notic her confus told her she wa veri sorri she wa oblig to go out herself and contriv under variou pretens to keep her maid in the room miss

herself had refer to her son now a littl reviv and endeavor to bear some part in the convers everi bodi one meet cri ladi honoria dispos of miss beverley to some new person yet the common opinion is that sir robert floyer will be the man but upon my word for my own part i can not conjectur how she will manag among them for mr marriot declar he is determin he will not be refus and sir robert vow that he will never give her up so we none of us know how it will end but i am vastli glad she keep them so long in suspens if there is ani suspens said cecilia i am at least sure it must be wil but whi should your ladyship rejoic in it o becaus it help to torment them and keep someth go forward besid we are all look in the newspap everi day to see when they will fight anoth duel for you anoth
