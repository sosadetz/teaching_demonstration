wa assert that it wa now time to declar cultur independ as well the american peopl would never be truli autonom otherwis howev they may boast of independ and the freedom of their govern wrote noah webster lexicograph historian and the nationalist most brilliant spokesman yet their opinion are not suffici independ instead of liber themselv from the influenc of english cultur as they had from england arm and govern the xiv american were continu to manifest an astonish respect for the art and literatur of their parent countri and a blind imit of it manner while such habitu respect for england wa onc understand even laudabl it had becom an impedi to creat an independ american charact and therefor pose danger for the futur cultur nation wa almost inevit in the aftermath of a revolut that seem to requir american to defin not onli their polit ident but their spiritu ident as well such nation manifest itself in a varieti of way in literatur and the art scienc and educ in it superfici manifest it testifi to an american inferior complex consist mainli of defens protest against the notion common in eighteenthcenturi europ that the new world wa a physic and moral debas version of the old and of mushi effus of patriot sentiment over ani product of american literatur art or scienc thu one comment gush over ramsay the histori of the revolut of southcarolina say that it reflect honour on thi countri and give room for hope that her literari will in time equal her militari reput and rev jame madison enthus that the work dress is altogeth american anoth review prais the histori of the american resolut observ that it is a necess that the histori of the american revolut be written in our own countri by a person of suitabl abil who ha wit the incid attend on that great event thu did patriot pass for cultur and ramsay work obvious measur up on a more sophist level some cultur nationalists—ramsay among them—develop greater insight into the idea of american xv cultur ident these nationalist recogn that along with the richli deserv celebr and selfcongratul the new nation need a strong unifi cultur without a cultur that articul the fundament tenet of liberti constitution virtu and simplic the principl of the american revolut would soon becom corrupt such corrupt could come from without through the peopl continu relianc on english cultur valu it could also come from within through the disintegr forc alreadi oper to dissolv the new nation into a multitud of dispar fragment thi realiz prompt the nationalist anxious to develop a notion of american ident that rest on two major premis that polit cultur and societi were inextric intertwin so that a chang in ani one would subtli alter the other and that cultur wa a signific forc in shape human conscious an idea which offer a power incent to use literatur as a mean of exhort like all the historian of the revolutionari era ramsay saw histor write as a vehicl for foster nationhood an instrument for promot the kind of uniti even homogen that the cultur nationalist desir almost all the lead cultur nationalist were also polit nationalist the surest sign of which wa that they saw the constitut as the great vehicl for both creat and preserv american uniti and although it wa possibl to be a nationalist cultur while oppos the constitut for polit reason as the historian poet and playwright merci oti warren made clear ramsay reason for write a peculiarli consensu or nation histori were intim tie to hi federalist polit view those reason were motiv by ramsay percept that the new nation face two sort of danger on the one hand the danger of polit divis between the state and within each state divis which had alreadi given rise to faction with compet econom interest and on the other the threat of social and cultur xvi divis among the peopl of the sever state and region which could readili lead to insular and hostil thu for exampl he wrote in polit term about hi fellow south carolinian who put local interest ahead of nation uniti and oppos ratif of the constitut to write to speak or even to think of a separ of the state is polit blasphemi he wrote to jedidiah mors one indivis is my motto he even postpon public of hi histori of the revolut until the fate of the constitut had been decid for the revolut can not be said to be complet till that or someth equival is establish but ramsay continu to fear the potenti for disun even after the constitut had been oper for year we should abov all thing studi to promot the union and harmoni of the differ state he caution in we should consid the peopl of thi countri … as form one whole the interest of which should be prefer to that of everi part while it is imposs to separ hi polit from hi cultur motiv ramsay wa at hi best when he spoke of the import of histor write with hi cultur concern in mind in fact in hi federalist pamphlet an address to the freemen of southcarolina he cast one of hi strongest polit argument for the constitut in cultur term he call upon hi fellow carolinian to consid the peopl of all the thirteen state as a band of brethren speak the same languag profess the same religion inhabit one undivid countri and design by heaven to be one xvii peopl ramsay wa as sensit as ani intellectu of hi era to the kind of divis real and potenti that tend to separ american and undermin the uniti he sought even ratif of the constitut wa less a culmin than a begin less a sign of uniti than a foundat for it we are too wide dissemin over an extens countri too much diversifi by differ custom form of govern to feel as one peopl which we are he confid to john eliot in but through histor write such as jeremi belknap histori of new hampshir we might becom better acquaint with each other in that intim familiar manner which would wear away prejudices—rub off asper mould us into a homogen peopl belknap achiev wa all the more remark for belknap had written about a singl state yet hi work breath a nation spirit in short even in ostens local histori it wa possible—inde necessary—to write of the nation and it charact for such write tend to unifi the peopl i long to see dr hugh williamson histori of north carolina ramsay wrote to belknap in inde i wish to see a histori of everi state in the union written in the stile and manner of your williamss histori of vermont we do not know half enough of each other enthusiast as i am for the uniti of our republ i wish for everi thing that tend to unit us as one peopl who know esteem love each other in ramsay own the histori of southcarolina would join the list of nationalist state histori ramsay passion for uniti and hi fear of fragment prompt him to invent a nation past character by consensu thi is not to say that ramsay wa a dissembl or deceiv who creat a past out of whole cloth it is rather to emphas that for ramsay as for all the historian of the revolut histor write wa not so much an end in itself as it wa a mean to cultiv the polit xviii and moral conscious of the present and futur gener sensit to divis within america—polit ethnic racial religi economic—ramsay genuin fear chao and hi experi in both state and confeder polit led him to believ that onli by gener a constel of commonli held valu and principl could the nation resist the forc that tend to pull it apart ramsay did not invent those valu and assumpt he drew them out of the intellectu climat of revolutionari america and found clue to them in america past but he focus upon them and mold them into the stori of the new nation so that hi version of the past appear to be inevit thu when ramsay spoke of use histori as an instrument of nation uniti he meant to incit futur gener to commit themselv to the principl of revolutionari republican ramsay even more than hi contemporari historian wa experienc in polit knowledg about world affair sensit to the econom and polit interest of hi compatriot and had access to a vast number of histor record he knew that america past had been mark by tension that from time to time had erupt into open conflict yet he purpos creat an imag of the coloni past that diminish the import of conflict and portray the colonist as revolutionaries—an imag of consensu uniti and an unfalt commit to republican principl in short he attempt to creat a nation futur by invent a consensu past—to provid an instant tradit for a revolutionari peopl ramsay princip strategi wa to establish a republican lineag an unbroken success of american gener that were strenuous commit to the principl of revolutionari republican from the moment of settlement in the seventeenth centuri the colonist chief characterist wa that they form an intellectu even spiritu consensu on three major principl they were polit dedic to an order liberti within the context of law and balanc repres govern they were ethic commit xix to the oblig of conscienc and the public good so that social life wa simpl and felicit and individu conduct mark by industri and prudenc and they were convinc philosoph that peopl are free and efficaci be who are respons for their action and for the consequ their action bring about it wa thi constel of fundament principl that constitut the american nation charact as ramsay depict it and it wa to thi constel that he point when he exhort member of hi own and futur gener to develop cultur uniti as a bulwark against divis again ramsay insist that these principl were not new to the revolutionari gener the conflict between the american and the british dure the s and s had mere call forth the origin settler charact the complex coincid of geographi polit social arrang and valu in coloni america had produc a warm love for liberti a high sens of the right of human natur and a predilect for independ from their first settlement the english provinc receiv impress favour to democrat form of govern colon gener coincid with the struggl in england between parliament and the crown so that the issu of popular govern base on consent as contrast with the divin right of king wa a current topic of debat the colonist who emigr to the new world consist mainli of peopl who were hostil to the claim of monarch prerog they were from their first settlement in america devot to liberti on english idea and english principl crucial these idea were not mere abstract the colonist not onli conceiv themselv to inherit the privileg of englishmen but though in a coloni situat actual possess them by show that republican principl and practic had been deepli ingrain in the peopl for gener ramsay vivifi the imag of a revolutionari past so far as to suggest that the colonist xx had been independ from the begin the circumst under which newengland wa plant would a few centuri ago have entitl them from their first settlement to the privileg of independ the colonist had set out at their own expens with no prospect other than hard work to build home and plant civil in a wilder they purchas their land from the nativ proprietor and exert themselv to reap the bounti of natur one hardli need john lock to make the argument that peopl who expend their own labor paid for their own land and voluntarili form their own govern owe no oblig to britain except those that result from their voluntari assent as reveal in express or impli compact and those were manifestli limit the peopl knew that govern rest upon contract freeli enter that taxat and represent were indissolubl join that they held and alien their properti onli by consent that the end of govern wa the happi of the peopl that the peopl were free to assembl and petit the govern for redress of grievanc and that all proxim mean fail the peopl had the natur right to rebel against tyrann rule thu did the colon gener consist of protorevolutionari the colonist were not onli republican in polit they were also dedic to person and social practic that conduc to individu happi and to the public good the state of societi in the coloni favour a spirit of liberti and independ ramsay wrote here the inhabit were all of one rank king nobl and bishop were unknown to them the peopl were unaccustom to that distinct of rank which character european societi and they were strongli impress with an opinion that all men are by natur equal the colonist religi practic also nurtur a love for liberti the major were protest ramsay note and all protestant is found on a strong claim to natur liberti and the right of privat judgment there were of cours numer sect but they all agre in the communion of liberti and all reprob the courtli doctrin of passiv obedi and nonresist nor were the colonist subject to the pernici effect xxi of the luxuri and opul indulg in by the court of europ instead inur from their earli year to the toil of a countri life they dwell in the midst of rural plenti coloni american societi in short wa character by simplic of manner and habit of industri prudenc and moral the colonist experi thu gave a cast of independ to the manner of the peopl and diffus among them the exalt sentiment of liberti given the colonist ingrain polit and social valu and their commit to the principl of liberti and democrat govern it wa obviou that the american revolut wa not a sudden upsurg of resent against particular act of parliament resist and revolut were the inevit and justifi respons of a peopl long habitu to such valu the geniu of the americans—that is their origin republican habit and sentiments—had prepar them to resist encroach on their right and to form popular govern dure the revolutionari era thi wa the final element in ramsay messag to futur gener confront with arbitrari power the colonist had establish a tradit of show the courag of their convict resist inroad against their liberti and take respons for the futur but whi should ramsay have present thi manifestli onedimension imag of the colonist as strenuou republican commit to simplic industri prudenc equal and natur right to some extent he actual did see them as american revolutionari in the make for so power wa the republican synthesi in hi own day that it shape hi idea and experi and predispos xxii him to see all of histori in it term yet thi will not entir explain ramsay oversimplif which seem drastic insofar as hi histori contain littl or no intercoloni rivalri popular upris against proprietari governor polit strife among compet interest group ethnic tension religi intoler or class divis even slaveri appear in ramsay histori as a mitig evil which while manifestli wrong at least had produc sentiment of liberti and independ among the master if for five or six xxiii gener the american had held the deepli ingrain polit social moral and philosoph principl that ramsay describ and if they had experienc a minimum of conflict then whi did ramsay have to remind hi reader of the american tradit abov all els the answer contain three part first as note earlier there were ramsay apprehens he fear that disun would rend the fabric of the new nation—inde that without share assumpt principl and valu as well as a feder constitut america might even separ into thirteen autonom state or into two or three region govern in either case it would becom prey to the great european power even if it did not destroy itself from within second ramsay fear that the great tradit particularli it power moral element had been badli damag by the war throughout the war year and into the s ramsay express hi doubt whether the peopl had suffici moral courag to make a republican experi work within a year of deliv hi stir vision of an american republican futur in hi orat on the advantag of american independ he wrote to william henri drayton that a spirit of moneymak ha eaten up our patriot to benjamin rush he ad i most devoutli wish for peac our moral are more depreci than our currenc that is bad enough by he wa worri that thi revolut ha introduc so much anarchi that it will take half a centuri to erad the licenti of the peopl i wish for the honor of human natur that in these last age of the world it may appear that mankind are capabl of enjoy the bless of freedom without the extravag that usual accompani it by the theme of intern

govern … dure the war we thought the termin of that would end all our troubl it is now end three year our public situat is as bad as ever the third part of the answer is that histor write like fourth of juli orat sermon and all the power of eloqu had the capac to shape thought and thu historian like minist and politician had an oblig to use their write to counteract that ruinou propens we have for foreign superflu to excit us to the long neglect virtu of industri frugal histori in short wa a moral art that wa whi ramsay prais belknap and williamss histori that wa whi he believ that john eliot

inde ramsay onc drew an instruct analog between histori and fiction novelist take fiction make it a vehicl of their opinion on a varieti of subject he observ i take truth the fact of histori for the same purpos ramsay wa well awar that he wa use art in the servic of histori and histori in the servic of moral and nation uniti had i a voic that could be heard from new hampshir to georgia he said in

made hi home for the rest of hi life charleston wa then a lead southern citi with some inhabit a grow commerc and a welldefin social hierarchi that divid white from one anoth along class line and white from black along racial lines—clear evid of the divis in societi to which he wa so sensit and which he deemphas in hi histori yet within a year of hi arriv thi outsid from pennsylvania the son of immigr and a presbyterian in the midst of an anglican elit had marri sabina elli daughter of a promin merchant and within three year he wa elect to the south carolina assembl by ramsay had a seat

career howev xxvii seem to satisfi hi intellectu curios ramsay turn to histor write he explain to thoma jefferson when i wa in confin in st augustin in the year and it ha employ my leisur hour ever sinc but ramsay wa drawn to histori and to hi nation vision by hi polit experi which convinc him that state govern wa by turn too timid and too wild to solv mani of the problem that aros in the postrevolutionari era there is a languor in the state that forebod ruin he complain to rush in he also note the temporis of the southern state in particular and fear the disintegr of the unit state if the constitut convent did not produc an effici feder govern polit and govern were no better in south carolina they may have been wors the eight year of war in carolina were follow by eight year of disorgan which produc such an amount of civil distress as diminish with some their respect for liberti and independ sever apprehend that the same scene which had taken place in england in the seventeenth centuri after a long and bloodi civil war would be act over again in america by a fickl peopl who had neither the fortitud nor the wisdom to govern themselv … peac and liberti were found inadequ to promot public happi without the aid of energet govern the state legislatur either languish and did noth or legisl too much the best and most courag act perform by state offici final wa to

than knowledg wherea eloqu is the child of a free state america he predict will produc poet orat critick and historian equal to the most celebr of the ancient commonwealth of greec and itali despit hi optim about the prospect of cultur in the new nation ramsay soon face a grim realiti although he becam known as america tacitu and polybiu he learn all too quickli that the trade of an author is a veri poor one in our new world concern the histori of the revolut of southcarolina he lament to fellow historian william gordon my advanc will not be replac till i have sold copi my debt contract and yet unpaid will requir the sale of more the edit ha cost me dollar the printer bill is dollar the engrav the bind a copi in short i have no brilliant pecuniari prospect befor me yet despit the financi failur of hi south carolina histori ramsay immers himself in the histori of the american revolut dure hi tenur in the continent congress here he had access to peopl promin on a nation level and to an enorm archiv he predict to rush that i can write the gener histori of the revolut with more eas than i have wrote a part of it inde i have got the fact alreadi collect he had readi to hand he said a great mani document from my access to paper … and the regular of record in the offic of congress i have been enabl to do a great deal in a littl time hi fact may have been xxix substanti collect but ramsay made the effort to pose numer detail question to sever peopl about variou aspect of the revolut he wrote to rush on sever occas to elia boudinot commissari gener of prison for the continent armi and a member of congress for five year to gouverneur morri member of the new york provinci congress and for four year an assist minist of financ under robert morri to charl thomson secretari of the continent congress from to and to john adam he also sent hi manuscript to charl thomson who read it made comment on it and promis to circul it among other knowledg reader no doubt these inquiri made for a better histori but ramsay fare almost as poorli on thi work as he had on the previou one he had problem with hi printer robert aitken whose work said ramsay offend against everi principl of good print the print the spell the ink the form of the line are in mani case execr in addit ask the outrag ramsay what think you of hi stop the work on the pretenc of want of money though dollar were advanc in the time of the work the whole of which wa onli to cost dollar he also complain that he had been cheat by booksel printer who were take far too much of the proce of the sale in xxx advertis ramsay wa eventu reduc to barter if my book that are unsold could be exchang for a copi of your state law or of the law of the neighbor state he wrote to john eliot i would be most pleas i would exchang them for ani good book rather than that they should remain on hand final ramsay had to swallow the fact that hi histori had been pirat by john stockdal in london it wa bad enough that the error blunder of aitken edit are mani and can not be correct he wrote to john eliot wors yet stockdal ha print one in london without my consent mani of the copi of aitken edit are yet on hand ramsay had not yet seen the london edit in april nor had he ani knowledg of it till it wa nearli execut needless to say he realiz no profit on stockdal edit or on the sever that were base on it ramsay reput

of the annual regist went through numer edit and circul wide in america ramsay did in fact lift passag verbatim from the annual regist though libbi certainli exagger in suggest that ramsay plagiar a

on the western side of the river delawar and south of pennsylvania which wa form into a separ govern and is now the state of delawar notwithstand these charter mr penn did not think himself invest with the right of the soil till he had purchas it from the nativ proprietor in the charter of pennsylvania there wa no express stipul as had been insert in all other coloni patent that the

it wa also stipul that no custom or other contribut should be laid on the inhabit or their estat unless by the consent of the proprietari or governor and assembl or by act of parliament in england the omiss of the first claus the insert of the second and the reserv in favor of parliament in the last may have been occas by difficulti which had then arisen about the right of the colonist and the power of parliament over them massachusett had befor that time question the author of parliament to tax them and legisl for them the gener claus that the colonist should retain all the privileg of englishmen had alreadi been made the basi of claim against which some in the mother countri had mani object perhap the rule power of england were sensibl that they had previous deleg too much of independ to their coloni and intend to be more guard in futur but their caution wa too late had it been serious intend to control the natur order of event by the feebl forc of word and claus in a

had qualifi itself constitut for the exercis of such right by admit repres from the peopl to be tax in the rapid manner just relat wa the english north american contin parcel out into distinct govern littl did the wisdom of the two preced centuri forese of the consequ both good and evil that were to result to the old world from discov and colonis the new when we consid the immens flood of gold and silver which have flow from it into europe—th subsequ increas of industri and popul the prodigi extens of commerc manufactur and navig and the influenc of the whole on manner and arts—w see such an accumul of good as lead us to rank columbu among the greatest benefactor of the human race but when we view the injustic done the nativ the extirp of mani of their numer nation whose name are no more heard—th havoc made among the first settlers—th slaveri of the african to which america ha furnish the temptat and the mani long and bloodi war which it ha occas we behold such a crowd of woe as excit an apprehens that the evil ha outweigh the good in vain do we look among ancient nation for exampl of coloni establish on principl of polici similar to those of the coloni of greatbritain england did not like the republ of greec oblig her son to form distant commun in the wild of the earth like rome she did not give land as a gratuiti to soldier who becam a militari forc for the defenc of her frontier she did not like carthag subdu the neighbour state in order to acquir an exclus right to their commerc no conquest wa ever attempt over the aborigin of america their right to the soil wa disregard and their countri look upon as a wast which wa open to the occup and use of other nation it wa consid that settlement might be there form for the advantag of those who should migrat thither as well as of the mother countri the right and interest of the nativ proprietor were all thi time deem of no account what wa the extent of oblig by which coloni plant under these circumst were bound to the mother countri is a subject of nice discuss whether these aros from natur and the constitut or from compact is a question necessarili connect with mani other while the friend of union contend that the king of england had a properti in the soil of america by virtu of a right deriv from prior discoveri and that hi subject by migrat from one part of hi dominion to anoth did not lessen their oblig to obey the suprem power of the nation it wa infer that the emigr to english america continu to owe the same obedi to the king and parliament as if they had never quit the land of their nativ but if as other contend the indian were the onli law proprietor of the countri in which their creator had place them and they sold their right to emigr who as men had a right to leav their nativ countri and as subject had obtain charter permiss to do so it follow from these premis that the oblig of the colonist to their parent state must have result more from compact and the prospect of reciproc advantag than from natur oblig the latter opinion seem to have been adopt by sever of the colonist particularli in newengland sundri person of influenc in that countri alway held that birth wa no necessari caus of subject for that the subject of ani princ or state had a natur right to remov to ani other state or quarter of the globe especi if depriv of liberti of conscienc and that upon such remov hi subject ceas the valid of charter about which the emigr to america were univers anxiou rest upon the same foundat if the right of the sovereign of england to the soil of america wa ideal and contrari to natur justic and if no one can give what is not hi own their charter were on sever account a nulliti in the eye of reason and philosophi they could give no right to american territori the onli valid which such grant could have wa that the grante had from their sovereign a permiss to depart from their nativ countri and negoti with the proprietor for the purchas of the soil and thereupon to acquir a power of jurisdict subject to hi crown these were the opinion of mani of the settler in
