am persuad the public will be as thoroughli convinc as thi gentleman wa when they shall see the poem and that some will think notwithstand the disadvantag with which the work ascrib to ossian appear it would be a veri uncommon instanc of selfdeni in me to disown them were they realli of my composit i would not have dwelt so long upon thi subject especi as i have answer all reason object to the genuin of the poem in the dissert were it not on account of the prejudic of the present age against the ancient inhabit of britain who are thought to have been incap of the gener sentiment to be met with in the poem of ossian if we err in prais too much the time of our forefath it is also as repugn to good sens to be altogeth blind to the imperfect of our own if our father had not so much wealth they had certainli fewer vice than the present age their tabl it is true were not so well provid neither were their bed so soft as those of modern time and thi in the eye of men who place their ultim happi in those conveni of life give us a great advantag over them i shall not enter farther into thi subject but onli observ that the gener poverti of a nation ha not the same influenc that the indig of individu in an opul countri ha upon the manner of the commun the idea of mean which is now connect with a narrow fortun had it rise after commerc had thrown too much properti into the hand of a sew

especi those of ossian the son of fingal who wa the best as well as most ancient of those who are celebr in tradit for their poetic geniu i undertook thi journey more from a desir of compli with the request of my friend than from ani hope i had of answer their expect i wa not unsucess consid how much the composit of ancient time have been neglect for some time past in the north of scotland sever gentlemen in the highland and isl gener gave me all the assist in their power and it wa by their mean i wa enabl to complet the epic poem how far it come up to the rule of the epopaea is the provinc

one can not help think it the genuin histori of fingal expedit embellish by poetri in that case the composit of ossian are not less valuabl for the light they throw on the ancient state of scotland and ireland than they are for their poetic merit succeed gener found on them all their tradit concern that period and they magnifi or vari them in proport as they were sway by credul or design the bard of ireland by ascrib to ossian composit which are evid their own have occas a gener belief in that countri that fingal wa of irish extract and not of the ancient caledonian as is said in the genuin poem of ossian the inconsist between those spuriou piec prove the ignor of their author in one of them ossian is made to mention himself as baptiz by st patrick in anoth he speak of the famou crusad which wa not begun in europ for mani centuri after though thi anachron quit destroy the author of the bard with respect to fingal yet their desir to make him their countryman show how famou he wa in ireland as well as in the north of scotland had the senachi of ireland been as well acquaint with the antiqu of their nation as they pretend they might deriv as much honor from fingal be a caledonian as if he had been an irishman for both nation were almost the same peopl in the day of that hero the celta who inhabit britain and ireland befor the invas of the roman though they were divid into numer tribe yet as the same languag and custom and the memori of their common origin remain among them they consid themselv as one nation after south britain becam a provinc of rome and it inhabit begun to adopt the languag and custom of their conqueror the celta beyond the pale of the empir consid them as a distinct peopl and consequ treat them as enemi on the other hand the strictest amiti subsist between the irish and scot celta for mani age and the custom and ancient languag of both still remain leav no room to doubt that they were of old one and the same nation it wa at first intend to prefix to ossian poem a discours concern the ancient inhabit of britain but as a gentleman in the north of scotland who ha thoroughli examin the antiqu of thi island and is perfectli acquaint with all the branch of the celtic tongu is just now prepar for the press a work on that subject the curiou are refer to it a dissert concern the antiqu etc of the poem of ossian the son of fingal inquiri into the antiqu of nation afford more pleasur than ani real advantag to mankind the ingeni may form system of histori on probabl and a few fact but at a great distanc of time their account must be vagu and uncertain the infanc of state and kingdom is as destitut of great event as of the mean of transmit them to poster the art of polish life by which alon fact can be preserv with certainti are the product of a well form commun it is then historian begin to write and public transact to be worthi remembr the action of former time are left in obscur or magnifi by uncertain tradit henc it is that we find so much of the mavel in the origin of everi nation poster be alway readi to believ ani thing howev fabul that reflect honor on their ancestor the greek and roman were remark for thi weak they swallow the most absurd fabl concern the high antiqu of their respect nation good historian howev rose veri earli amongst them and transmit with luster their great action to poster it is to them that they owe that unrival fame they now enjoy while the great action of other nation are involv in fabl or lost in obscur the celtic nation afford a strike instanc of thi kind they though onc the master of europ from the mouth of the river obi in russia to cape finister the western point of gallicia in spain are veri littl mention in histori lin l they trust their fame to tradit and the song of their bard which by the vicissitud of human affair are long sinc lost their ancient languag is the onli monument that remain of them and the trace of it be found in place so wide distant of each other serv onli to show the extent of their ancient power but throw veri littl light on their histori of all the celtic nation that which possess old gaul is the most renown not perhap on account of worth superior to the rest but for their war with a peopl who had historian to transmit the fame of their enemi as well as their own to poster britain wa first peopl by them accord to the testimoni of the best author cae l tac agric l c it situat in respect to gaul make the opinion probabl but what put it beyond all disput is that the same custom and languag prevail among the inhabit of both in the day of juliu caesar caesar pomp mel tacitu the coloni from gaul possess themselv at first of that part of britain which wa next to their own countri and spread northward by degre as they increas in number peopl the whole island some adventur pass over from those part of britain that are within sight of ireland were the founder of the irish nation which is a more probabl stori than the idl fabl of milesian and gallician coloni diodoru siculu mention it dio sic l as a thing well known in hi time that the inhabit of ireland were origin briton and hi testimoni is unquestion when we consid that for mani age the languag and custom of both nation were the same tacitu wa of opinion that the ancient caledonian were of german extract by the languag and custom which alway prevail in the north of scotland and which are undoubtedli celtic one would be tempt to differ in opinion from that celebr writer the german properli so call were not the same with the ancient celta the manner and custom of the two nation were similar but their languag differ strabo the german are the genuin descend of the ancient daae afterward well known by the name of daci and pass origin into europ by the way of the northern countri and settl beyond the danub toward the vast region of transylvania wallachia and moldavia and from thenc advanc by degre into germani cae l live l tac de mor germ the celta it is certain sent mani coloni into that countri all of whom retain their own law languag and custom and it is of them if ani coloni came from germani into scotland that the ancient caledonian were descend but whether the caledonian were a coloni of the celtic german or the same with the gaul that first possess themselv of britain is a matter of no moment at thi distanc of time whatev their origin wa we find them veri numer in the time of juliu agricola which is a presumpt that they were long befor settl in the countri the form of their govern wa a mixtur of aristocraci and monarchi as it wa in all the countri where the druid bore the chief sway thi order of men seem to have been form on the same system with the dactyli idaei and curet of the ancient their pretend intercours with heaven their magic and divin were the same the knowledg of the druid in natur caus and the properti of certain thing the fruit of the experi of age gain them a mighti reput among the peopl the esteem of the populac soon increas into a vener for the order which a cun and ambiti tribe of men took care to improv to such a degre that they in a manner engross the manag of civil as well as religi matter it is gener allow that they did not abus thi extraordinari power the preserv their charact of sanctiti wa so essenti to their influenc that they never broke out into violenc or oppress the chief were allow to execut the law but the legisl power wa entir in the hand of the druid cae l it wa by their author that the tribe were unit in time of the greatest danger under one head thi temporari king or vergobretu fergubreth the man to judg wa chosen by them and gener laid down hi offic at the end of the war these priest enjoy long thi extraordinari privileg among the celtic nation who lay beyond the pale of the roman empir it wa in the begin of the second centuri that their power among the caledonian begun to declin the poem that celebr trathal and cormac ancestor to fingal are full of particular concern the fall of the druid which account for the total silenc concern their religion in the poem that are now given to the public the continu war of the caledonian against the roman hinder the nobil from initi themselv as the custom formerli wa into the order of the druid the precept of their religion were confin to a few and were not much attend to by a peopl inur to war the vergobretu or chief magistr wa chosen without the concurr of the hierarchi or continu in hi offic against their will continu power strengthen hi interest among the tribe and enabl him to send down as hereditari to hi poster the offic he had onli receiv himself by elect on occas of a new war against the king of the world as the poem emphat call the roman emperor the druid to vindic the honor of the order began to resum their ancient privileg of choos the vergobretu garmal the son of tarno be deput by them came to the grandfath of the celebr fingal who wa then vergobretu and command him in the name of the whole order to lay down hi offic upon hi refus a civil war commenc which soon end in almost the total extinct of the religi order of the druid a few that remain retir to the dark recess of their grove and the cave they had formerli use for their medit it is then we find them in the circl of stone and unheed by the world a total disregard for the order and utter abhorr of the druidic rite ensu under thi cloud of public hate all that had ani knowledg of the religion of the druid becam extinct and the nation sell into the last degre of ignor of their rite and ceremoni it is no matter of wonder then that fingal and hi son ossian make so littl if ani mention of the druid who were the declar enemi to their success in the suprem magistraci it is a singular case it must be allow that there are no trace of religion in the poem ascrib to ossian as the poetic composit of other nation are so close connect with their mytholog it is hard to account for it to those who are not made acquaint with the manner of the old scottish bard that race of men carri their notion of martial honor to an extravag pitch ani aid given their hero in battl wa thought to derog from their fame and the bard immedi transfer the glori of the action to him who had given that aid had ossian brought down god as often as homer ha done to assist hi hero thi poem had not consist of elogium on hi friend but of hymn to these superior be to thi day those that write in the galic languag seldom mention religion in their profan poetri and when they professedli write of religion they never interlard with their composit the action of their hero thi custom alon even though the religion of the druid had not been previous extinguish may in some measur account for ossian silenc concern the religion of hi own time to say that a nation is void of all religion is the same thing as to say that it doe not consist of peopl endu with reason the tradit of their father and their own observ on the work of natur togeth with that superstit which is inher in the human frame have in all age rais in the mind of men some idea of a superior be henc it is that in the darkest time and amongst the most barbar nation the veri populac themselv had some faint notion at least of a divin it would be do injustic to ossian who upon no occas show a narrow mind to think that he had not open hi concept to that primit and greatest of all truth but let ossian religion be what it will it is certain he had no knowledg of christian as there is not the least allus to it or ani of it rite in hi poem which absolut fix him to an era prior to the introduct of that religion the persecut begun by dioclesian in the year is the most probabl time in which the first dawn of christian in the north of britain can be fix the human and mild charact of constantiu chloru who command then in britain induc the persecut christian to take refug under him some of them through a zeal to propag their tenet or through fear went beyond the pale of the roman empir and settl among the caledonian who were the more readi to hearken to their doctrin as the religion of the druid had been explod so long befor these missionari either through choic or to give more weight to the doctrin they advanc took possess of the cell and grove of the druid and it wa from thi retir life they had the name of culde which in the languag of the countri culdich signifi sequest person it wa with one of the culde that ossian in hi extrem old age is said to have disput concern the christian religion thi disput is still extant and is couch in vers accord to the custom of the time the extrem ignor on the part of ossian of the christian tenet show that that religion had onli been late introduc as it is not easi to conceiv how one of the first rank could be total unacquaint with a religion that had been known for ani time in the countri the disput bear the genuin mark of antiqu the obsolet phrase and express peculiar to the time prove it to be no forgeri if ossian then live at the introduct of christian as by all appear he did hi epoch will be the latter end of the third and begin of the fourth centuri what put thi point beyond disput is the allus in hi poem to the histori of the time the exploit of fingal against caracul carachl terribl eye the son of the king of the world are among the first brave action of hi youth a complet poem which relat to thi subject is print in thi collect in the year the emperor severu after return from hi expedit against the caledonian at york fell into the tidiou ill of which he afterward die the caledonian and maiata resum courag from hi indisposit took arm in order to recov the possess they had lost the enrag emperor command hi armi to march into their countri and to destroy it with fire and sword hi order were but ill execut for hi son caracalla wa at the head of the armi and hi thought were entir taken up with the hope of hi father death and with scheme to supplant hi brother geta he scarc had enter the enemi countri when news wa brought him that severu wa dead a sudden peac is patch up with the caledonian and as it appear from dion cassiu the countri they had lost to severu wa restor to them the caracul of fingal is no other than caracalla who as the son of severu the emperor of rome whose dominion were extend almost over the known world wa not without reason call in the poem of ossian the son of the king of the world the space of time between the year severu die and the begin of the fourth centuri is not so great but ossian the son of fingal might have seen the christian whom the persecut under dioclesian had driven beyond the pale of the roman empir ossian in one of hi mani lament on the death of hi belov son oscar mention among hi great action a battl which he fought against caro king of ship on the bank of the wind carun caravon wind river it is more than probabl that the caro mention here is the same with the note usurp carausiu who assum the purpl in the year and seiz on britain defeat the emperor maximian herculiu in sever naval engag which give proprieti to hi be call in ossian poem the king of ship the wind carun is that small river retain still the name of carron and run in the neighborhood of agricola wall which carausiu repair to obstruct the incurs of the caledonian sever other passag in the poem allud to the war of the roman but the two just mention clearli fix the epoch of fingal to the third centuri and thi account agre exactli with the irish histori which place the death of fingal the son of comhal in the year and that of oscar and their own celebr cairbr in the year some peopl may imagin that the allus to the roman histori might have been industri insert into the poem to give them the appear of antiqu thi fraud must then have been commit at least three age ago as the passag in which the allus are made are allud to often in the composit of those time everi one know what a cloud of ignor and barbar overspread the north of europ three hundr year ago the mind of men addict to superstit contract a narrow that destroy geniu accordingli we find the composit of those time trivial and pueril to the last degre but let it be allow that amidst all the untoward circumst of the age a geniu might aris it is not easi to determin what could induc him to give the honor of hi composit to an age so remot we find no fact that he ha advanc to favor ani design which could be entertain by ani man who live in the fifteenth centuri but should we suppos a poet through humor or for reason which can not be seen at thi distanc of time would ascrib hi own composit to ossian it is next to imposs that he could impos upon hi countrymen when all of them were so well acquaint with the tradit poem of their ancestor the strongest object to the authent of the poem now given to the public under the name of ossian is the improb of their be hand down by tradit through so mani centuri age of barbar some will say could not produc poem abound with the disinterest and gener sentiment so conspicu in the composit of ossian and could these age produc them it is imposs but they must be lost or altogeth corrupt in a long success of barbar gener these object natur suggest themselv to men unacquaint with the ancient state of the northern part of britain the bard who were an inferior order of the druid did not share their bad fortun they were spare by the victori king as it wa through their mean onli he could hope for immort to hi fame they attend him in the camp and contribut to establish hi power by their song hi great action were magnifi and the populac who had no abil to examin into hi charact narrowli were dazzl with hi fame in the rhime of the bard in the mean time men assum sentiment that are rare to be met with in an age of barbar the bard who were origin the discipl of the druid had their mind open and their idea enlarg by be initi in the learn of that celebr order they could form a perfect hero in their own mind and ascrib that charact to their princ the inferior chief made thi ideal charact the model of their conduct and by degre brought their mind to that gener spirit which breath in all the poetri of the time the princ flatter by hi bard and rival by hi own hero who imit hi charact as describ in the eulog of hi poet endeavor to excel hi peopl in merit as he wa abov them in station thi emul continu form at last the gener charact of the nation happili compound of what is nobl in barbar and virtuou and gener in a polish peopl when virtu in peac and braveri in war are the characterist of a nation their action becom interest and their fame worthi of immort a gener spirit is warm with nobl action and becom ambiti of perpetu them thi is the true sourc of that divin inspir to which the poet of all age pretend when they found their theme inadequ to the warmth of their imagin they varnish them over with fabl suppli by their own fanci or furnish by absurd tradit these fabl howev ridicul had their abettor poster either implicitli believ them or through a vaniti natur to mankind pretend that they did they love to place the founder of their famili in the day of fabl when poetri without the fear of contradict could give what charact she pleas of her hero it is to thi vaniti that we owe the preserv of what remain of the work of ossian hi poetic merit made hi hero famou in a countri where heroism wa much esteem and admir the poster of these hero or those who pretend to be descend from them heard with pleasur the culogium of their ancestor bard were employ to repeat the poem and to record the connect of their patron with chief so renown everi chief in process of time had a bard in hi famili and the offic becam at last hereditari by the success of these bard the poem concern the ancestor of the famili were hand down from gener to gener they were repeat to the whole clan on solemn occas and alway allud to in the new composit o the bard thi custom came down near to our own time and after the bard were discontinu a great number in a clan retain by memori or commit to write their composit and found the antiqu of their famili on the author of their poem the use of letter wa not known in the north of europ till long after the institut of the bard the record of the famili of their patron their own and more ancient poem were hand down by tradit their poetic composit were admir contriv for that purpos they were adapt to music and the most perfect harmoni observ each vers wa so connect with those which

uncorrupt it is much more probabl that the ancient scot a peopl so free of intermixtur with foreign and so strongli attach to the memori of their ancestor had the work of their bard hand down with great puriti it will seem strang to some that poem admir for mani centuri in one part of thi kingdom should be hitherto unknown in the other and that the british who have care trace out the work of geniu in other nation should so long remain stranger to their own thi in a great measur is to be imput to those who understood both languag and never attempt a translat they from be acquaint but with detach piec or from a modesti which perhap the present translat ought in prudenc to have follow despair of make the composit of their bard agreeabl to an english reader the manner of those composit is so differ from other poem and the idea so confin to the most earli state of societi that it wa thought they had not enough of varieti to pleas a polish age thi wa long the opinion of the translat of the follow collect and though he admir the poem in the origin veri earli and gather part of them from tradit for hi own amus yet he never had the smallest hope of see them in an english dress he wa sensibl that the strength and manner of both languag were veri differ and that it wa next to imposs to translat the galic poetri into ani thing of toler english vers a prose translat he could never

tri it at hi desir and the specimen wa approv other gentlemen were earnest in exhort him to bring more to the light and it is to their uncommon zeal that the world owe the galic poem if they have ani merit it wa at first intend to make a gener collect of all the ancient piec of geniu to be found in the galic languag but the translat had hi reason for confin himself to the remain of the work of

but except the present poem those piec are irrecover lost and there onli remain a few fragment in the hand of the translat tradit ha still preserv in mani place the stori of the poem and mani now live have heard them in their youth repeat the complet work now print would in a short time have share the fate of the rest the geniu of the highland ha suffer a great chang within these few year the commun with the rest of the island is open and the introduct of trade and manufactur ha destroy that leisur which wa formerli dedic to hear and repeat the poem of ancient time mani have now learn to leav their mountain and seek their fortun in a milder climat and though a certain amor patria may sometim bring them back they have dure their absenc imbib enough of foreign manner to despis the

it is that the tast for their ancient poetri is at a low ebb among the highland they have not howev thrown off the good qualiti of their ancestor hospit still subsist and an uncommon civil to stranger friendship is inviol and reveng less blindli follow than formerli to say ani thing concern the poetic merit of the poem would be an anticip on the judgment of the public the poem which stand first in the collect is truli epic the charact are strongli mark and the sentiment breath heroism the subject of it is an invas of ireland by swaran king of lochlin which is the name of scandinavia in the galic languag cuchullin gener of the irish tribe in the minor of cormac king of ireland upon intellig of the invas assembl hi forc near tura a castl on the coast of ulster the poem open with the land

thi war which continu but six day and as mani night is includ the episod the whole stori of the poem the scene is the heath of lena near a mountain call cromleach in ulster all that can be said of the translat is that it is liter and that simplic is studi the arrang of the word in the origin is imit and the invers of the style observ as the translat claim no merit from hi version he hope for the indulg of the public where he fail he wish that the imperfect semblanc he draw may not prejudic the world against an origin which contain what is beauti in simplic and grand in the sublim fingal an
