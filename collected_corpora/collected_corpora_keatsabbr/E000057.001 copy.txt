accomplish to fit him for the largest and accord to the world the happiest and most flourish societi the follow fabl in which what i have said is set forth at larg wa print abov eighta year ago in a six penni pamphlet calld the grumbl hive or knave turnd honest and be soon after pirat cryd about the street in a halfpenni sheet sinc the first publish of it i have met with sever that either wil or ignorantli mistak the v design would have it that the scope of it wa a satyr upon virtu and moral and the whole wrote for the encouragementc of vice thi made me resolv whenev it should be reprint some way or other to inform the reader of the real intent thi littl poem wa wrote with i do not dignifi these few loos line with the name of poem that i would have the reader expect ani poetri in them but bare becaus they are rhime and i am in realiti puzzl what name to give them for they are neither heroick nor pastor satyr burlesqu nor heroicomick to be a tale they want probabl and the whole is rather too long for a fabl all i can say of them is that they are a stori told in dogrel which without the least design of be witti i have endeavourd to do in as easi and familiar a manner as i wa abl the reader shall be welcom to call them what he pleas twa said of montagn that he wa pretti well versd in the defect of manvikind but unacquaint with the excel of human natur if i fare no wors i shall think my self well use what countri soever in the univers is to be understood by the beehiv repres here it is evid from what is said of the law and constitut of it the glori wealth power and industri of it inhabit that it must be a larg rich and warlik nation that is happili governd by a limit monarchi the satyr therefor to be met with in the follow line upon the sever profess and call and almost everi degre and station of peopl wa not made to injur and point to a particular person but onli to shew the vile of the ingredi that all togetherb compos the wholesom mixtur of a wellorderd societi in order to extol the wonder power of polit wisdom by the help of which so beauti a machin is raisd from the most contempt branch viifor the main design of the fabl as it is briefli explaind in the moral is to shew the imposs of enjoy all the most eleg comfort of life that are to be met with in an industri wealthi and power nation and at the same time be blessd with all the virtu and innoc that can be wishd for in a golden age from thenc to expos the unreason and folli of those that desir of be an opul and flourish peopl and wonder greedi after all the benefit they can receiv as such are yet alway murmur at and exclaim against those vice and inconveni that from the begin of the world to thi present day have been insepar from all kingdom and state that ever were famd for strength rich and polit at the same time to do thi i first slightli touch upon some of the fault and corrupt the sever profess and call are gener charg with after that i shew that those veri vice of everi particular person by skil manag were made subservi to the grandeur and worldli happi of the whole lastli by set forth what of necess must be the consequ of gener honesti and virtu and nation temper innoc and content i demonstr that if mankind could be cure of the fail they are natur guilti of they would ceas to be capabl of be raisd into such vast potent and polit societi as they have been under the sever great commonwealth and monarchi that have flourishd sinc the creation if you ask me whi i have done all thi cui bono and what good these notion will produc truli besid the reader divers i believ none at all but if ia wa askd what natur ought to be expect from em i woud answer that in the first place the peopl who continu find fault with other by read them would beix taught to look at home and examin their own conscienc be made ashamd of alway rail at what they are more or less guilti of themselv and that in the next those who are so fond of the eas and comfort and reap all the benefit that are the consequ of a great and flourish nation would learn more patient to submit to those inconveni which no govern upon earth can remedi when they should see the imposs of enjoy ani great share of the first without partak likewis of the latter thi i say ought natur to be expect from the publish of these notion if peopl were to be made better by ani thing that could be said to them but mankind have for so mani age remaind still the same notwithstand the mani instruct and elabor write by which their amend ha been endeavourd i am not so vain as to hope for betxter success from so inconsider a trifl have allowd the small advantag thi littl whim is like to produc i think my self obligd to shew that it can not be prejudici to ani for what is publish if it doe no good ought at least to do no harm in order to thi i have made some explanatori note to which the reader will find himself referrd in those passag that seem to be most liabl to except the censori that never saw the grumbl hive will tell me that whatev i may talk of the fabl it not take up a tenth part of the book wa onli contrivd to introduc the remark that instead of clear up the doubt or obscur place i have onli pitchd upon such as i had a mind to expati upon and that far from strive to extenu the error commit befor i have made bad wors and shewn my self a more barefac champion for vice in the ramxibl digress than i had done in the fabl it self i shall spend no time in answer these accus where men are prejud the best apolog are lost and i know that those who think it crimin to suppos a necess of vice in ani case whatev will never be reconcild to ani part of the perform but if thi be thoroughli examind all the offenc it can give must result from the wrong infer that may perhap be drawn from it and which i desir no bodi to make when i assert that vice are insepar from great and potent societi and that it is imposs their wealth and grandeur should subsist without i do not say that the particular member of them who are guilti of ani should not be continu reprovd or not be punishd for them when they grow into crime there are i believ few peopl in london of those that are at ani time a forcd to go afoot but what could wish the xiistreet of it much cleaner than gener they are while they regard noth but their own cloth and privat conveni but when onc they come to consid that what offend them is the result of the plenti great traffick and opul of that mighti citi if they have ani concern in it welfar they will hardli ever wish to see the street of it less dirti for if we mind the materi of all sort that must suppli such an infinit number of trade and handicraft as are alway go forward the vast quantiti of victual drink and fewel that are daili consumd in it theb wast and superflu that must be produc from them the multitud of hors and other cattl that are alway dawb the street the cart coach and more heavi carriag that are perpetu wear and break the pavement of them and abov all the numberless swarmsc of peopl that are continu harass and trampl through everi part xiiiof them if i say we mind all these we shall find that everi moment must produc new filth and consid how far distant the great street are from the river side what cost and care soever be bestowd to remov the nasti almost as fast as tisa made it is imposs london should be more cleanli befor it is less flourish now would i ask if a good citizen in consider of what ha been said might not assert that dirti street are a necessari evil insepar from the felic of london without be the least hindranc to the clean of shoe or sweep of street and consequ without ani prejudic either to the blackguard or the scaving but if without ani regard to the interest or happi of the citi the question wa put what place i thought most pleasant to walk in no bodi can doubt but befor the stink street of london i would esteem a fragrant garden or a shadi grove in the countri xivin the same manner if lay asid all worldli great and vainglori i should be askd where i thought it wa most probabl that men might enjoy true happi i would prefer a small peaceabl societi in which men neither envyd nor esteemd by neighbour should be content to live upon the natur product of the spot they inhabit to a vast multitud abound in wealth and power that should alway be conquer other by their arm abroad and debauch themselv by foreign luxuri at homea thu much i hadb said to the reader in the first editionc and have ad noth by way of prefac in the second but sinc that a violent outcri ha been made against the

the forego poem but there be some passag in it seemingli paradox i have in the prefac promis some explanatori remark on it which to render more use i have thought fit to enquir how man no better qualifyd might yet by hi own imperfect be taught to distinguish between virtu and vice and here i must desir the reader onc for all to take notic that when i say men i mean neither jew nor christian but meer man in the state of natur and ignor of the true deiti an enquiri into the origin of moral virtu all untaught anim are onli sollicit of pleas themselv and natur follow the bent of their own inclin without consid the good or harm that from their be pleas will accru to other thi is the reason that in the wild state of natur those creatur are fittest to live peaceabl togeth in great number that discov the least of understand and have the fewest appetit to gratifi and consequ no speci of anim is without the curb of govern less capabl of agre long togeth in multitud than that of man yet such are hi qualiti whether good or bad i shall not determin that no creatur besid himself can ever be made sociabl but be an extraordinari selfish and headstrong as well as cun anim howev he may be subdu by superior strength it is imposs by forc alon to make him tractabl and receiv the improv he is capabl of the chief thing therefor which lawgiv and other wise men that have labour for the establish of societi have endeavourd ha been to make the peopl they were to govern believ that it wa more benefici for everi bodi to conquer than indulg hi appetit and much better to mind the publick than what seemd hi privat interest as thi ha alway been a veri difficult task so no wit or eloqu ha been left untri to compass it and the moralist and philosoph of all age employ their utmost skill to prove the truth of so use an assert but whether mankind would have ever a believd it or not it is not like that ani bodi could have persuad them to disapprov of their natur inclin or prefer the good of other to their own if at the same time he had not shewd them an equival to be enjoyd as a reward for the violenc which by so do they of necess must commit upon themselv those that have undertaken to civil mankind were not ignor of thi but be unabl to give so mani real reward as would satisfi all person for everi individu action they were forcd to contriv an imaginari one that as a gener

if it had been in their power wherea if reason in man wa of equal weight with hi pride he could never be pleasd with prais which he is consciou he dont deserv by honour in it proper and genuin signif we mean noth els but the good opinion of other which is count more or less substanti the more or less nois or bustl there is made about the demonstr of it and when we say the sovereign is the fountain of honour it signifi that he ha the power by titl or ceremoni or both togeth to stamp a mark upon whom he pleas that shall be as current as hi coin and procur the owner the good opinion of everi bodi whether he deserv it or not the revers of honour is dishonour or ignomini which consist in the bad opinion and contempt of other and as the first is count a reward for good action so thi is esteemd a punish for bad one and the more or less publick or heinou the manner is in which thi contempt of other is shewn the more or less the person so suffer is degrad by it thi ignomini is likewis call shame from the effect it produc for tho the good and evil of honour and dishonour are imaginari yet there is a realiti in shame as it signifi a passion that ha it proper symptom overrul our reason and requir as much labour and selfdeni to be subdu as ani of the rest and sinc the most import action of life often are regul accord to the influenc thi passion ha upon us a thorough understand of it must help to illustr the notion the world ha of honour and ignomini i shall therefor describ it at larg first to defin the passion of shame i think it may be calld a sorrow reflexion on our own unworthi proceed from an apprehens that other either do or might if they knew all deservedli despis us the onli object of weight that can be raisd against thi definit is that innoc virgin are often ashamd and blush when they are guilti of no crime and can give no manner of reason for thi frailti and that men are often ashamd for other for or with whom they have neither friendship or affin and consequ that there may be a thousand instanc of shame given to which the word of the definit are not applic to answer thi i would have it first considerd that the modesti of womena is the result of custom and educ by which all unfashion denud and filthi express are renderd fright and abomin to them and that notwithstand thi the most virtuou young woman aliv will often in spite of her teeth have thought and confusd idea of thing aris in her imagin which she would not reveal to some peopl for a thousand world then i say that when obscen word are spoken in the presenc of an unexperienc virgin she is afraid that some bodi will reckon her to understand what they mean and consequ that she understand thi and that and sever thing which she desir to be thought ignor of the reflect on thi and that thought are form to her disadvantag bring upon her that passion which we call shame and whatev can fling her tho never so remot from lewd upon that set of thought i hint and which she think crimin will have the same effect especi befor men as long as her modesti last to tri the truth of thi let them talk as much bawdi as they pleas in the room next to the same virtuou young woman where she is sure that she is undiscoverd and she will hear if not hearken to it without blush at all becaus then she look upon herself as no parti concernd and if the discours should stain her cheek with red whatev her innoc may imagin it is certain that what occas her colour is a passion not half so mortifi as that of shame but if in the same place she hear someth said of her self that must tend to her disgrac or ani thing is name of which she is secretli guilti then ti ten to one but shell be asham and blush tho no bodi see her becaus she ha room to fear that she is or if all wa known should be thought of contempt that we are often ashamd and blush for other which wa the second part of the object is noth els but that sometim we make the case of other too nearli our own so peopl shriek out when they see other in danger whilst we are reflect with too much earnest on the effect which such a blameabl action if it wa our would produc in us the spirit and consequ the blood are insens move after the same manner as if the action wa our own and so the same symptom must appear the shame that raw ignor and illbr peopl tho seemingli without a caus discov befor their better is alway accompani with and proce from a conscious of their weak and inabl and the most modest man how virtuou know and accomplishd soever he might be wa never yet ashamd without some guilt or diffid such as out of rustic and want of educ are unreason subject to and at everi turn overcom by thi passion we call bash and those who out of disrespect to other and a fals opinion of their own suffici have learnd not to be affect with it when they should be are calld impud or shameless what strang contradict man is made of the revers of shame is pride see remark ma yet no bodi can be touchd with the first that never felt ani thing of the latter for that we have such an extraordinari concern in what other think of us can proceed from noth but the vast esteem we have for our selv that these two passion in which the seed of most virtu are contain are realiti in our frame and not imaginari qualiti is demonstr from the plain and differ effect that in spite of our reason are produc in us as soon as we are affect with either when a man is overwhelmd with shame he observ a sink of the spirit the heart feel cold and condens and the blood fli from it to the circumfer of the bodi the face glow the neck and part of the breast partak of the fire he is heavi as lead the head is hung down and the eye through a mist of confus are fixd on the ground no injuri can move him he is weari of hi be and heartili wish he could make himself invis but when gratifi hi vaniti he exult in hi pride he discov quit contrari symptom hi spirit swell and fan the arteri blood a more than ordinari warmth strengthen and dilat the heart the extrem are cool he feel light to himself and imagin he could tread on air hi head is held up hi eye rolld about with sprightli he rejoic at hi be is prone to anger and would be glad that all the world could take notic of hima it is incred how necessari an ingredi shame is to make us sociabl it is a frailti in our natur all the world whenev it affect them submit to it with regret and would prevent it if they could yet the happi of convers depend upon it and no societi could be polishd if the gener of mankind wereb not subject to it as therefor the sens of shame is troublesom and all creatur are ever labour for their own defenc it is probabl that man strive to avoid thi uneasi would in a great measur conquer hi shame by that he wa grown up but thi would be detriment to the societi and therefor from hi infanc throughout hi educ we endeavour to increas instead of lessen or destroy thi sens of shame and the onli remedi prescribd is a strict observ of certain rule to avoid those thing that might bring thi troublesom sens of shame upon him but as to rid or cure him of it the politician would sooner take away hi life the rule i speak of consist in a dextrou manag of our selv a stifl of our appetit and hide the real sentiment of our heart befor other those who are not instruct in these rule long befor they come to year of matur seldom make ani progress in them afterward to acquir and bring to perfect the accomplish i hint at noth is more assist than pride and good sens the greedi we have after the esteem of other and the raptur we enjoy in the thought of be like and perhap admir are equival that overpay the conquest of the strongest passion and consequ keep us at a great distanc from all such word or action that can bring shame upon us the passion we chiefli ought
