revis befor pass it again through the press unnecessari howev on read a few page and on compar them with the muchlov origin i no longer wonder as i had so often done whi le diabl boiteux wa so littl esteem by those who had onli known him in hi english dress while gil bla wa as great a favourit with the british public as ani of it own hero of stori to account for thi i will not dwell on the want of liter fidel in the old version although in some instanc that is amus enough but the total absenc of style and that too in the translat of a work by one of the greatest master of verbal melodi that ever exist wa so strike as to induc me rashli perhap to endeavour more worthili to interpret the witti and satir asmodeu for the benefit of those who have not the inestim pleasur of comprehend him in

after twenti other year ala the sparkl produc of champagn pour out in cup of crystal thi is suffici reason whi we should not troubl ourselv overmuch as to the earli life of le sage he wa young and handsom and as he march hi head upturn like a poet he met as he went along with those first love which one alway meet when the heart is honest and devot a charm woman love him and he let her love him to her heart content and without concern himself as to hi good fortun more than would master gil bla have done on a similar occas these first amour of our poet last just as long as such sort of amour ought to lastlong enough that they should leav no subject for regret not enough that they should evok hatr when therefor they had love each other as much as they could she and he they separ still to pleas themselv she found a husband of riper age and better off than her lover he took a wife more beauteou and less wealthi than hi mistress and bless on the amiabl and devot girl who consent with a joyou heart to encount all the risk all the vexat and also to expos herself to the seduc pleasur of a poetic life thu le sage enter almost without think of it into that labori life in which one must daili expend the rarest and most charm treasur of hi mind and soul as a commenc he made a translat of the letter of calisthen without imagin that he wa himself possess of more wit than all the greek of the fourth centuri the work had no success and it ought not to have had he who ha the geniu of le sage must creat origin work or not meddl in the craft to translat is a trade of manual skillto imit is one of plagiari howev the failur of thi first book render le sage less proud and haughti and he accept what he would never have done had he at onc succeed a pension from m labbé de lyonn thi pension amount to six hundr franc and thereupon the biograph of our author are in extaci at the generos of the abbé de lyonn six hundr franc and when we reflect that had le sage live in our day depend onli on hi théâtre de la foir he would have gain thirti thousand franc a year in our day a romanc like gil bla would not be worth less than five hundr thousand franc le diabl boiteux would have brought him a hundr thousand at least still we must not be angri with m labbé de lyonn for have bestow a pension of six hundr on the author of gil bla the abbé did more he open to le sage an admir treasur of wit of imagin and of poetri he taught him the spanish tongu that love and nobl instructress of the great corneil and it is doubtless no slight honour for the languag of cervant to have given birth in our land to the cid and to gil bla you may imagin with what delight le sage accept thi instruct and how perfectli at home he found himself in those eleg and graciou manner with what good will he studi that smile gallantri that loyal jealousi those duenna in appear so auster in realiti so access those love women their feet ensatin their head in the mantilla those charm mansion all carv without and within all silenc those excit window light by smile abov while concert murmur at their feet you may imagin if he adopt those live and coquetish waitingwomen those ingeni and rascal valet those enorm mantl so favour to love those ancient bower so friendli to it modest bliss thu when he had discov thi new world of poesi of which he wa about to be the pizarro and the fernando cort and of which corneil had been the christoph columbu rené le sage clap hi hand for joy in hi nobl pride he stamp hi feet on thi enchant land he began to read you may fanci with what delight that admir epic don quixot which he studi for it grace it charm it poetri it passion put for the time asid it satir and the sarcasm conceal in thi splendid drama as weapon for a later use when he should attack the financi certainli the abbé de lyonn never dreamt that he wa open to the light thi exhaustless mine for the man who wa to becom the first comic poet of francesinc molièr is one of those genius apart of whom all the nation of the earth all literari age claim alik with equal right the honour and the glori the first fruit of thi spanish cultiv wa a volum of comedi which le sage publish and in which he had translat some excel piec of the spanish stage it contain onli one from lopez de vega so ingeni and so fruit that wa certainli too few there wa in it not one of calderon de la barca and that wa as certainli not enough in thi book which i have read with care in search of some of those lumin ray which betoken the presenc of the man of geniu wherev he ha pass i have met with noth but the translat the origin writer doe not yet display himself it is becaus style is a thing which come but slowli it is becaus in thi heart of comedi more especi there are certain secret of trade which no talent can replac and which must be learn at whatev cost these secret le sage learn as everi thing is learn at hi own expens from a simpl translat as he wa he becam an arrang of dramat piec and in the eighteenth centuri had begun it cours but with timid step and none could have predict what it would becom le sage brought out at the théâtre françai a comedi in five act le point dhonneur it wa a mere imit from the spanish the imit had small success and le sage comprehend not thi lesson of the public he understood not that someth whisper to the pit so reserv in it applaus that there wa in thi translat an origin poet to aveng himself what did le sage he fell into a greater error still he set to work translatingwil you believ itth continu of don quixot as if don quixot could have a continu as if there were a person in the world even cervant himself who had the right to add a chapter to thi famou histori verili it is strang inde that with hi tast so pure hi judgment so correct le sage should have ever thought of thi unhappi continu thi time therefor again hi new attempt had no success the parisian public which whatev may be said to the contrari is a great judg wa more just for the verit quixot than le sage himself and he had onc more to begin anew howev he yet onc more attempt thi new road which could lead him to noth good he return to the charg still with a spanish comedi don césar ursin imit from calderon thi piec wa play for the first time at versail and applaud to the sky by the court which deceiv itself almost as often as the town le sage now thought that the battl at last wa won vain hope it wa again a battl lost for brought from versail to pari the comedi of don césar ursin wa hiss off the stage by the parisian pit which thu unmerci annihil the eulog of the court and the first victori of the author it wa now full time to yield to the forc of evid enlighten by these rude instruct le sage at last comprehend that it wa not permit to him to him less than to all other to be a plagiarist that origin wa one of the grand caus of success and that to confin himself for ever to thi servil imit of the spanish poet wa to becom a poet lost now therefor behold him determin in hi turn to be an origin poet thi time he no longer copi he invent he arrang hi fabl to hi mind and seek no further refug in the phantasmagoria of spain with origin idea come to him origin of style and he at last light on that wondrou and imperish dialogu which may be compar to the dialogu of molièr not for it eas perhap but unquestion for it grace and eleg he found at the same time to hi great joy now that he wa himselfthat he walk in the footstep of nobodi he found that the busi wa much more simpl thi time he wa at hi eas in hi plot which he dispos as it pleas him he breath freeli in the space which he had open to himself noth constrain hi march ani more than hi poetic capric well at last then we behold him the suprem moder of hi work we behold him such as the pit would have him such as we all hope he wa thi happi comedi which is beyond all doubt the first work of le sage is entitl crispin rival de son maîtr when he had finish it le sage grate for the recept which the court had given to don césar ursin wa desir that the court should also have the first hear of crispin rival de son maîtr he rememb with great delight that the first applaus he had receiv had been echo from versail behold him then produc hi new comedi befor the court but ala thi time the opinion of the court had chang without regard for the plaudit of versail the pit of the pari theatr had hiss don césar ursin versail in it turn and as if to take it reveng now hiss crispin rival de son maîtr we must allow that for a mind less strong here wa enough to confound a man for ever and to make him comprehend noth either as to the success or the failur of hi product happili le sage appeal from the public of versail to the pit of pari and as much as crispin rival de son maîtr had been hiss at versail so much wa thi charm comedi applaud at pari on thi occas it wa not alon to give the lie to the court that the pit applaud pari had refound in truth in thi new piec all the qualiti of true comedyth wit the grace the easi ironi the exhaustless pleasantri a nobl frank much bite satir and a moder season of love as to those who would turn into accus the hiss of versail they should recollect that more than one chefdoeuvr hiss at pari ha been rais again by the suffrag of versaillesl plaideur of racin for instanc which the court restor to the poet with extraordinari applaus with the burst laughter of loui xiv which come delici to troubl the repos of racin at five oclock in the morn happi time on the contrari when poet had to approv them to tri them thi doubl jurisdict when they could appeal from the censur of the court to the prais of the town from the hiss of versail to the plaudit of pari now we behold rené le sage to whom noth oppos he ha divin hi true vocat which is comedi he understand what may be made of the human race and by what light thread are suspend the human heart these thread of gold of silver or of brass he hold them at thi moment in hi hand and you will see with what skill he weav them alreadi in hi head which bear gil bla and hi fortun ferment the most charm recit of le diabl boiteux silenc turcaret is about to appearturcaret whom molièr would not have forgotten if turcaret had live in hi day but it wa necessari to wait till franc should have escap from the reign so decor of loui xiv to wit the come after the man of the church after the man of the sword thi man without heart and without mindth man of money in a societi like our own the man of money is one of those bastard and insol power which grow out of the affair of everi day as the mushroom grow out from the dunghil we know not whenc come thi inert forcew know not how it is maintain on the surfac of the world and noth tell how it disappear after have thrown it phosphoru of an instant it is necessari in truth that an epoch should be suffici corrupt and suffici stain with infami when it replac by money the sword of the warrior by money the sentenc of the judg by money the intellig of the legisl by money the sceptr of the king himself onc that a nation ha descend so low as to ador money on it kneesto requir neither fine art nor poesi nor love it is debas as wa the jewish peopl when it knelt befor the golden calf happili of all the ephemer power in the world money is the most ephemer we extend to it our right hand it is true but we buffet it with our left we prostrat ourselv befor it as it pass alongy but when it ha pass we kick it with our foot thi is what le sage marvel comprehend like a great comic poet as he wa he found the absurd and fright side of those gild men who divid our financ menial enrich overnight who more than onc by a perfectli natur mistak have mount behind their own coach and such is turcaret the poet ha load him with vice the most disgrac with folli the most dishonour he tear from thi heart debas by money everi natur affect and nevertheless even in thi fear pictur le sage ha confin himself within the limit of comedi and not onc in thi admir product doe contempt or indign take the place of laughter it wa then with good caus that the whole race of financi as soon as they had heard of turcaret cabal against thi chefdoeuvr the cri resound in all the rich saloon of pari it wa echo from the usur who lent their money to the nobl and reecho by the nobl who condescend to borrow from the usur it wa a gener hue and cri le tartuf of molièr never met with greater opposit among the devote than turcaret experienc from financi and to make use of the express of beaumarchai in refer to figaro it requir as much mind for le sage to caus hi comedi to be play as it did to write it but on thi occas again the public which is the allpow manag in these matter wa more potent than intrigu monseigneur le grand dauphin that princ so illustri by hi pieti and virtu protect the comedi of le sage as hi ancestor loui xiv had protect that of molièr on thi the financi perceiv that all wa lost as far as intrigu wa concern had recours to money which is the last reason of thi descript of upstart as cannon is the ultima ratio of king thi time again the attack avail not the great poet refus a fortun that hi comedi might be play and unquestion he made a good bargain by hi resolv prefer a hundr thousand time to all the fortun which have been made and lost in the rue quincampoix the success of turcaret wa immens the parisian enjoy with rare delight the spectacl of these grasp moneyhunt devot to the most cruel ridicul what if le sage had defer the product of thi masterpiec these men would have disappear to make room for other of the kind and they would have carri with them into oblivion the comedi they had paid for it would have been a chefdoeuvr lost to us for ever and never that we know of would the good men on chang have dealt us a more fatal blow in thi street in the famou projector law establish hi bank and the rage for specul which follow made it for a time the bours of pari a humpback man made a larg fortun by lend himself as a desk whereon the specul might sign their contract or the transfer of share the rue quincampoix is still a lead street for busi but it trade is now confin to more honest ware such as drug and groceri who would credit it howev after thi superb product which should have render him the master of french comedi le sage wa soon compel to abandon that ungrat theatr which understood him not he renouncedh the author of turcaretpur comedi to write as a pastim farc littl oneact piec mingl with couplet which made the life of the théâtre de la foir saint laurent and of the théâtre de la foir saint germain

as m scribe to wast hi time hi style and hi geniu upon that trifl comedi which a breath can hurri away and the french comedian were all unmov and hasten not to throw themselv at the feet of le sage to pray to supplic him to take under hi allpow protect that theatr elev by the geniu and by the toil of molièr but these senseless comedian were unabl to forese anyth nevertheless if he had renounc the théâtre françai le sage had not abandon true comedi all the comedi which throng hi brain he heap them up in that grand work which is call gil bla and which includ within itself alon the histori of the
