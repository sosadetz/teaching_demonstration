accord to the then present extent of the author view when in the investig of some flaw he had discov he found himself unexpectedli entangl in an unsuspect corner of the metaphys maze a suspens at first not apprehend to be more than a temporari one necessarili ensu suspens brought on cool and cool aid by other concurr caus ripen into disgust imperfect pervad the whole mass had alreadi been point out by the sincer of sever and discern friend and conscienc had certifi the just of their censur the inordin length of some of the chapter the appar inutil of other and the dri and metaphys turn of the whole suggest an apprehens that if publish in it present form the work would contend under great disadvantag for ani chanc it might on other account possess of be read and consequ of be of use but though in thi manner the idea of complet the present work slid insens asid that wa not by ani mean the case with the consider which had led him to engag in it everi open which promis to afford the

experienc in the attempt to find a place in hi system for that imaginari offens to some reader as a mean of help them to support the fatigu of wade through an analysi of such enorm length he would almost recommend the begin with those ten conclud page one good at least may result from the present public viz that the more he ha trespass on the patienc of the reader on thi occas the less need he will have so to do on futur one so that thi may do to those the offic which is done by book of pure mathemat to book of mix mathemat and natur philosophi the narrow the circl of reader is within which the present work may be condemn to confin itself the less limit may be the number of those to whom the fruit of hi succeed labour may be found access he may therefor in thi respect find himself in the condit of those philosoph of antiqu who are repres as have held two bodi of doctrin a popular and an occult one but with thi differ that in hi instanc the occult and the popular will he hope be found as consist as in those they were contradictori and that in hi product whatev there is of occult ha been the pure result of sad necess and in no respect of choic have in the cours of thi advertis had such frequent occas to allud to differ arrang as have been suggest by more extens and matur view it may perhap contribut to the satisfact of the reader to receiv a short intim of their natur the rather as without such explan refer made here and there to unpublish work might be product of perplex and mistak the follow then are the titl of the work by the public of which hi present design would

had he an unlimit power of draw upon time and everi other condit necessari it would be hi wish to postpon the public of each part to the complet of the whole in particular the use of the ten part

what the distinct and where the separ between a penal and a civil law what the distinct and where the separ between the penal and other branch of the law to give a complet and correct answer to these question it is but too evid that the relat and depend of everi part of the legisl system with respect to everi other must have been comprehend and ascertain but it is onli upon a view of these part themselv that such an oper could have been perform to the accuraci of such a survey one necessari condit would therefor be the complet exist of the fabric to be survey to the perform of thi condit no exampl is as yet to be met with ani where common law as it style itself in england judiciari law as it might aptli be style everi where that fictiti composit which ha no known person for it author no

to the art of legisl what the scienc of anatomi is to the art of medicin with thi differ that the subject of it is what the artist ha to work with instead of be what he ha to oper upon nor is the bodi

more a bodi of propos law how complet soever would be compar useless and uninstruct unless explain and justifi and that in everi tittl by a continu accompani a perpetu commentari of reason which

road for royal vaniti or a ptolemi a smoother one for royal indol there is no king road no stadthold gate to legisl ani more than to mathemat scienc chapter i of the principl of util i natur ha place mankind under the govern of two sovereign master pain and pleasur it is for them alon to point out what we ought to do as well as to determin what we shall do on the one hand the standard of right and wrong on the other the chain of caus and effect are fasten to their throne they govern us in all we do in all we say in all we think everi effort we can make to throw off our subject will serv but to demonstr and confirm it in word a man may pretend to abjur their empir but in realiti he will remain subject to it all the while the principl of util recogn thi subject and assum it for the foundat of that system the object of which is to rear the fabric of felic by the hand of reason and of law system which attempt to question it deal in sound instead of sens in capric instead of reason in dark instead of light but enough of metaphor and declam it is not by such mean that moral scienc is to be improv ii the principl of util is the foundat of the present work it will be proper therefor at the outset to give an explicit and determin account of what is meant by it by the principl of util is meant that principl which approv or disapprov of everi action whatsoev accord to the tendenc it appear to have to augment or diminish the happi of the parti whose interest is in question or what is the same thing in other word to promot or to oppos that happi i say of everi action whatsoev and therefor not onli of everi action of a privat individu but of everi measur of govern iii by util is meant that properti in ani object wherebi it tend to produc benefit advantag pleasur good or happi all thi in the present case come to the same thing or what come again to the same thing to prevent the happen of mischief pain evil or unhappi to the parti whose interest is consid if that parti be the commun in gener then the happi of the commun if a particular individu then the happi of that individu iv the interest of the commun is one of the most gener express that can occur in the phraseolog of moral no wonder that the mean of it is often lost when it ha a mean it is thi the commun is a fictiti bodi compos of the individu person who are consid as constitut as it were it member the interest of the commun then is what—th sum of the interest of the sever member who compos it v it is in vain to talk of the interest of the commun without understand what is the interest of the individu a thing is said to promot the interest or to be for the interest of an individu when it tend to add to the sum total of hi pleasur or what come to the same thing to diminish the sum total of hi pain vi an action then may be said to be conform to the principl of util or for short sake to util mean with respect to the commun at larg when the tendenc it ha to augment the happi of the commun is greater than ani it ha to diminish it vii a measur of govern which is but a particular kind of action perform by a particular person or person may be said to be conform to or dictat by the principl of util when in like manner the tendenc which it ha to augment the happi of the commun is greater than ani which it ha to diminish it viii when an action or in particular a measur of govern is suppos by a man to be conform to the principl of util it may be conveni for the purpos of discours to imagin a kind of law or dictat call a law or dictat of util and to speak of the action in question as be conform to such law or dictat ix a man may be said to be a partizan of the principl of util when the approb or disapprob he annex to ani action or to ani measur is determin by and proport to the tendenc which he conceiv it to have to augment or to diminish the happi of the commun or in other word to it conform or unconform to the law or dictat of util x of an action that is conform to the principl of util one may alway say either that it is one that ought to be done or at least that it is not one that ought not to be done one may say also that it is right it should be done at least that it is not wrong it should be done that it is a right action at least that it is not a wrong action when thu interpret the word ought and right and wrong and other of that stamp have a mean when otherwis they have none xi ha the rectitud of thi principl been ever formal contest it should seem that it had by those who have not known what they have been mean is it suscept of ani direct proof it should seem not for that which is use to prove everi thing els can not itself be prove a chain of proof must have their commenc somewher to give such proof is as imposs as it is needless xii not that there is or ever ha been that human creatur at breath howev stupid or pervers who ha not on mani perhap on most occas of hi life defer to it by the natur constitut of the human frame on most occas of their live men in gener embrac thi principl without think of it if not for the order of their own action yet for the tri of their own action as well as of those of other men there have been at the same time not mani perhap even of the most intellig who have been dispos to embrac it pure and without reserv there are even few who have not taken some occas or other to quarrel with it either on account of their not understand alway how to appli it or on account of some prejudic or other which they were afraid to examin into or could not bear to part with for such is the stuff that man is made of in principl and in practic in a right track and in a wrong one the rarest of all human qualiti is consist xiii when a man attempt to combat the principl of util it is with reason drawn without hi be awar of it from that veri principl itself hi argument if they prove ani thing prove not that the principl is wrong but that accord to the applic he suppos to be made of it it is misappli is it possibl for a man to move the earth ye but he must first find out anoth earth to stand upon xiv to disprov the proprieti of it by argument is imposs but from the caus that have been mention or from some confus or partial view of it a man may happen to be dispos not to relish it where thi is the case if he think the settl of hi opinion on such a subject worth the troubl let him take the follow step and at length perhap he may come to reconcil himself to it let him settl with himself whether he would wish to discard thi principl altogeth if so let him consid what it is that all hi reason in matter of polit especi can amount to if he would let him settl with himself whether he would judg and act without ani principl or whether there is ani other he would judg an act by if there be let him examin and satisfi himself whether the principl he think he ha found is realli ani separ intellig principl or whether it be not a mere principl in word a kind of phrase which at bottom express neither more nor less than the mere aver of hi own unfound sentiment that is what in anoth person he might be apt to call capric if he is inclin to think that hi own approb or disapprob annex to the idea of an act without ani regard to it consequ is a suffici foundat for him to judg and act upon let him ask himself whether hi sentiment is to be a standard of right and wrong with respect to everi other man or whether everi man sentiment ha the same privileg of be a standard to itself in the first case let him ask himself whether hi principl is not despot and hostil to all the rest of human race in the second case whether it is not anarchi and whether at thi rate there are not as mani differ standard of right and wrong as there are men and whether even to the same man the same thing which is right today may not without the least chang in it natur be wrong tomorrow and whether the same thing is not right and wrong in the same place at the same time and in either case whether all argument is not at an end and whether when two men have said i like thi and i dont like it they can upon such a principl have ani thing more to say if he should have said to himself no for that the sentiment which he propos as a standard must be ground on reflect let him say on what particular the reflect is to turn if on particular have relat to the util of the act then let him say whether thi is not desert hi own principl and borrow assist from that veri one in opposit to which he set it up or if not on those particular on what other particular if he should be for compound the matter and adopt hi own principl in part and the principl of util in part let him say how far he will adopt it when he ha settl with himself where he will stop then let him ask himself how he justifi to himself the adopt it so far and whi he will not adopt it ani farther admit ani other principl than the principl of util to be a right principl a principl that it is right for a man to pursu admit what is not true that the word right can have a mean without refer to util let him say whether there is ani such thing as a motiv that a man can have to pursu the dictat of it if there is let him say what that motiv is and how it is to be distinguish from those which enforc the dictat of util if not then lastli let him say what it is thi other principl can be good for chapter ii of principl advers to that of util if the principl of util be a right principl to be govern by and that in all case it follow from what ha been just observ that whatev principl differ from it in ani case must necessarili be a wrong one to prove ani other principl therefor to be a wrong one there need no more than just to show it to be what it is a principl of which the dictat are in some point or other differ from those of the principl of util to state it is to confut it ii a principl may be differ from that of util in two way by be constantli oppos to it thi is the case with a principl which may be term the principl of ascetic by be sometim oppos to it and sometim not as it may happen thi is the case with anoth which may be term the principl of sympathi and antipathi iii by the principl of ascetic i mean that principl which like the principl of util approv or disapprov of ani action accord to the tendenc which it appear to have to augment or diminish the happi of the parti whose interest is in question but in an invers manner approv of action in as far as they tend to diminish hi happi disapprov of them in as far as they tend to augment it iv it is evid that ani one who reprob ani the least particl of pleasur as such from whatev sourc deriv is pro tanto a partizan of the principl of ascetic it is onli upon that principl and not from the principl of util that the most abomin pleasur which the vilest of malefactor ever reap from hi crime would be to be reprob if it stood alon the case is that it never doe stand alon but is necessarili follow by such a quantiti of pain or what come to the same thing such a chanc for a certain quantiti of pain that the pleasur in comparison of it is as noth and thi is the true and sole but perfectli suffici reason for make it a ground for punish v there are two class of men of veri differ complexion by whom the principl of ascetic appear to have been embrac the one a set of moralist the other a set of religionist differ accordingli have been the motiv which appear to have recommend it to the notic of these differ parti hope that is the prospect of pleasur seem to have anim the former hope the aliment of philosoph pride the hope of honour and reput at the hand of men fear that is the prospect of pain the latter fear the offspr of superstiti fanci the fear of futur punish at the hand of a splenet and reveng deiti i say in thi case fear for of the invis futur fear is more power than hope these circumst character the two differ parti among the partisan of the principl of ascetic the parti and their motiv differ the principl the same vi the religi parti howev appear to have carri it farther than the philosoph they have act more consist and less wise the philosoph parti have scarc gone farther than to reprob pleasur the religi parti have frequent gone so far as to make it a matter of merit and of duti to court pain the philosoph parti have hardli gone farther than the make pain a matter of indiffer it is no evil they have said they have not said it is a good they have not so much as reprob all pleasur in the lump they have discard onli what they have call the gross that is such as are organ or of which the origin is easili trace up to such as are organ they have even cherish and magnifi the refin yet thi howev not under the name of pleasur to cleans itself from the sord of it impur origin it wa necessari it should chang it name the honour the gloriou the reput the becom the honestum the decorum it wa to be call in short ani thing but pleasur vii from these two sourc have flow the doctrin from which the sentiment of the bulk of mankind have all along receiv a tinctur of thi principl some from the philosoph some from the religi some from both men of educ more frequent from the philosoph as more suit to the elev of their sentiment the vulgar more frequent from the superstiti as more suit to the narrow of their intellect undil by knowledg and to the abject of their condit continu open to the attack of fear the tinctur howev deriv from the two sourc would natur intermingl insomuch that a man would not alway know by which of them he wa most influenc and they would often serv to corrobor and enliven one anoth it wa thi conform that made a kind of allianc between parti of a complexion otherwis so dissimilar and dispos them to unit upon variou occas against the common enemi the partizan of the principl of util whom they join in brand with the odiou name of epicurean viii the principl of ascetic howev with whatev warmth it may have been embrac by it partizan as a rule of privat conduct seem not to have been carri to ani consider length when appli to the busi of govern in a few instanc it ha been carri a littl way by the philosoph parti wit the spartan regimen though then perhap it mayb consid as have been a measur of secur and an applic though a precipit and pervers applic of the principl of util scarc in ani instanc to ani consider length by the religi for the variou monast order and the societi of the quaker dumpler moravian and other religionist have been free societi whose regimen no man ha been astrict to without the intervent of hi own consent whatev merit a man may have thought there would be in make himself miser no such notion seem ever to have occur to ani of them that it may be a merit much less a duti to make other miser although it should seem that if a certain quantiti of miseri were a thing so desir it would not matter much whether it were brought by each man upon himself or by one man upon anoth it is true that from the same sourc from whenc among the religionist the attach to the principl of ascetic took it rise flow other doctrin and practic from which miseri in abund wa produc in one man by the instrument of anoth wit the holi war and the persecut for religion but the passion for produc miseri in these case proceed upon some special ground the exercis of it wa confin to person of particular descript they were torment not as men but as heret and infidel to have inflict the same miseri on their fellow believ and fellowsectari would have been as blameabl in the eye even of these religionist as in those of a partizan of the principl of util for a man to give himself a certain number of stripe wa inde meritori but to give the same number of stripe to anoth man not consent would have been a sin we read of saint who for the good of their soul and the mortif of their bodi have voluntarili yield themselv a prey to vermin but though mani person of thi class have wield the rein of empir we read of none who have set themselv to work and made law on purpos with a view of stock the bodi polit with the breed of highwaymen housebreak or incendiari if at ani time they have suffer the nation to be prey upon by swarm of idl pension or useless placemen it ha rather been from neglig and imbecil than from ani settl plan for oppress and plunder of the peopl if at ani time they have sap the sourc of nation wealth by cramp commerc and drive the inhabit into emigr it ha been with other view and in pursuit of other end if they have declaim against the pursuit of pleasur and the use of wealth they have commonli stop at declam they have not like lycurgu made express ordin for the purpos of banish the preciou metal if they have establish idl by a law it ha been not becaus idl the mother of vice and miseri is itself a virtu but becaus idl say they is the road to holi if under the notion of fast they have join in the plan of confin their subject to a diet thought by some to be of the most nourish and prolif natur it ha been not for the sake of make them tributari to the nation by whom that diet wa to be suppli but for the sake of manifest their own power and exercis the obedi of the peopl if they have establish or suffer to be establish punish for the breach of celibaci they have done no more than compli with the petit of those delud rigorist who dupe to the ambiti and deeplaid polici of their ruler first laid themselv under that idl oblig by a vow ix the principl of ascetic seem origin to have been the reveri of certain hasti specul who have perceiv or fanci that certain pleasur when reap in certain circumst have at the long run been attend with pain more than equival to them took occas to quarrel with everi thing that offer itself under the name of pleasur have then got thu far and have forgot the point which they set out from they push on and went so much further as to think it meritori to fall in love with pain even thi we see is at bottom but the principl of util misappli x the principl of util is capabl of be consist pursu and it is but tautolog to say that the more consist it is pursu the better it must ever be for humankind the principl of ascetic never wa nor ever can be consist pursu by ani live creatur let but one tenth part of the inhabit of thi earth pursu it consist and in a day time they will have turn it into a hell xi among principl advers to that of util that which at thi day seem to have most influenc in matter of govern is what may be call the principl of sympathi and antipathi by the principl of sympathi and antipathi i mean that principl which approv or disapprov of certain action not on account of their tend to augment the happi nor yet on account of their tend to diminish the happi of the parti whose interest is in question but mere becaus a man find himself dispos to approv or disapprov of them hold up that approb or disapprob as a suffici reason for itself and disclaim the necess of look out for ani extrins ground thu far in the gener depart of moral and in the particular depart of polit measur out the quantum as well as determin the ground of punish by the degre of the disapprob xii it is manifest that thi is rather a principl in name than in realiti it is not a posit principl of itself so much as a term employ to signifi the negat of all principl what one expect to find in a principl is someth that point out some extern consider as a mean of warrant and guid the intern sentiment of approb and disapprob thi expect is but ill fulfil by a proposit which doe neither more nor less than hold up each of those sentiment as a ground and standard for itself xiii in look over the catalogu of human action say a partizan of thi principl in order to determin which of them are to be mark with the seal of disapprob you need but to take counsel of your own feel whatev you find in yourself a propens to condemn is wrong for that veri reason for the same reason it is also meet for punish in what proport it is advers to util or whether it be advers to util at all is a matter that make no differ in that same proport also is it meet for punish if you hate much punish much if you hate littl punish littl punish as you hate if you hate not at all punish not at all the fine feel of the soul are not to be overborn and tyrann by the harsh and rug dictat of polit util xiv the variou system that have been form concern the standard of right may all be reduc to the principl of sympathi and antipathi one account may serv for all of them they consist all of them in so mani contriv for avoid the oblig of appeal to ani extern standard and for prevail upon the reader to accept of the author sentiment or opinion as a reason for itself the phrase differ but the principl the same xv it is manifest that the dictat of thi principl will frequent coincid with those of util though perhap without intend ani such thing probabl more frequent than not and henc it is that the busi of penal justic is carri upon that toler sort of foot upon which we see it carri on in common at thi day for what more natur or more gener ground of hatr to a practic can there be than the mischiev of such practic what all men are expos to suffer by all men will be dispos to hate it is far yet howev from be a constant ground for when a man suffer it is not alway that he know what it is he suffer by a man may suffer grievous for instanc by a new tax without be abl to trace up the caus of hi suffer to the injustic of some neighbour who ha elud the payment of an old one xvi the principl of sympathi and antipathi is most apt to err on the side of sever it is for appli punish in mani case which deserv none in mani case which deserv some it is for appli more than they deserv there is no incid imagin be it ever so trivial and so remot from mischief from which thi principl may not extract a ground of punish ani differ in tast ani differ in opinion upon one subject as well as upon anoth no disagr so trifl which persever and alterc will not render seriou each becom in the other eye an enemi and if law permit a crimin thi is one of the circumst by which the human race is distinguish not much inde to it advantag from the brute creation xvii it is not howev by ani mean unexampl for thi principl to err on the side of leniti a near and percept mischief move antipathi a remot and impercept mischief though not less real ha no effect instanc in proof of thi will occur in number in the cours of the work it would be break in upon the order of it to give them here xviii it may be wonder perhap that in all thi no mention ha been made of the theolog principl mean that princip which profess to recur for the standard of right and wrong to the will of god but the case is thi is not in fact a distinct principl it is never ani thing more or less than one or other of the three beforement principl present itself under anoth shape the will of god here meant can not be hi reveal will as contain in the sacr write for that is a system which nobodi ever think of recur to at thi time of day for the detail of polit administr and even befor it can be appli to the detail of privat conduct it is univers allow by the most emin divin of all persuas to stand in need of pretti ampl interpret els to what use are the work of those divin and for the guidanc of these interpret it is also allow that some other standard must be assum the will then which is meant on thi occas is that which may be call the presumpt will that is to say that which is presum to be hi will by virtu of the conform of it dictat to those of some other principl what then may be thi other principl it must be one or other of the three mention abov for there can not as we have seen be ani more it is plain therefor that set revel out of the question no light can ever be thrown upon the standard of right and wrong by ani thing that can be said upon the question what is god will we may be perfectli sure inde that whatev is right is conform to the will of god but so far is that from answer the purpos of show us what is right that it is necessari to know first whether a thing is right in order to know from thenc whether it be conform to the will of god xix there are two thing which are veri apt to be confound but which it import us care to distinguish—th motiv or caus which by oper on the mind of an individu is product of ani act and the ground or reason which warrant a legisl or other bystand in regard that act with an eye of approb when the act happen in the particular instanc in question to be product of effect which we approv of much more if we happen to observ that the same motiv may frequent be product in other instanc of the like effect we are apt to transfer our approb to the motiv itself and to assum as the just ground for the approb we bestow on the act the circumst of it origin from that motiv it is in thi way that the sentiment of antipathi ha often been consid as a just ground of action antipathi for instanc in such or such a case is the caus of an action which is attend with good effect but thi doe not make it a right ground of action in that case ani more than in ani other still farther not onli the effect are good but the agent see beforehand that they will be so thi may make the action inde a perfectli right action but it doe not make antipathi a right ground of action for the same sentiment of antipathi if implicitli defer to may be and veri frequent is product of the veri worst effect antipathi therefor can never be a right ground of action no more therefor can resent which as will be seen more particularli hereaft is but a modif of antipathi the onli right ground of action that can possibl subsist is after all the consider of util which if it is a right principl of action and of approb in ani one case is so in everi other other principl in abund that is other motiv may be the reason whi such and such an act ha been done that is the reason or caus of it be done but it is thi alon that can be the reason whi it might or ought to have been done antipathi or resent requir alway to be regul to prevent it do mischief to be regul by what alway by the principl of util the principl of util neither requir nor admit of ani anoth regul than itself chapter iii of the four sanction or sourc of pain and pleasur i it ha been shown that the happi of the individu of whom a commun is compos that is their pleasur and their secur is the end and the sole end which the legisl ought to have in view the sole standard in conform to which each individu ought as far as depend upon the legisl to be made to fashion hi behaviour but whether it be thi or ani thing els that is to be done there is noth by which a man can ultim be made to do it but either pain or pleasur have taken a gener view of these two grand object viz pleasur and what come to the same thing immun from pain in the charact of final caus it will be necessari to take a view of pleasur and pain itself in the charact of effici caus or mean ii there are four distinguish sourc from which pleasur and pain are in use to flow consid separ they may be term the physic the polit the moral and the religi and inasmuch as the pleasur and pain belong to each of them are capabl of give a bind forc to ani law or rule of conduct they may all of them term sanction iii if it be in the present life and from the ordinari cours of natur not purpos modifi by the interposit of the will of ani human be nor by ani extraordinari interposit of ani superior invis be that the pleasur or the pain take place or is expect it may be said to issu from or to belong to the physic sanction iv if at the hand of a particular person or set of person in the commun who under name correspond to that of judg are chosen for the particular purpos of dispens it accord to the will of the sovereign or suprem rule power in the state it may be said to issu from the polit sanction v if at the hand of such chanc person in the commun as the parti in question may happen in the cours of hi life to have concern with accord to each man spontan disposit and not accord to ani settl or concert rule it may be said to issu from the moral or popular sanction vi if from the immedi hand of a superior invis be either in the present life or in a futur it may be said to issu from the religi sanction vii pleasur or pain which may be expect to issu from the physic polit or moral sanction must all of them be expect to be experienc if ever in the present life those which may be expect to issu from the religi sanction may be expect to be experienc either in the present life or in a futur viii those which can be experienc in the present life can of cours be no other than such as human natur in the cours of the present life is suscept of and from each of these sourc may flow all the pleasur or pain of which in the cours of the present life human natur is suscept with regard to these then with which alon we have in thi place ani concern those of them which belong to ani one of those sanction differ not ultim in kind from those which belong to ani one of the other three the onli differ there is among them lie in the circumst that accompani their product a suffer which befal a man in the natur and spontan cours of thing shall be style for instanc a calam in which case if it be suppos to befal him through ani imprud of hi it may be style a punish issu from the physic sanction now thi same suffer if inflict by the law will be what is commonli call a punish if incur for want of ani friendli assist which the misconduct or suppos misconduct of the suffer ha occas to be withholden a punish issu from the moral sanction if through the immedi interposit of a particular provid a punish issu from the religi sanction ix a man good or hi person are consum by fire if thi happen to him by what is call an accid it wa a calam if by reason of hi own imprud for instanc from hi neglect to put hi candl out it may be style a punish of the physic sanction if it happen to him by the sentenc of the polit magistr a punish belong to the polit sanction that is what is commonli call a punish if for want of ani assist which hi neighbour withheld from him out of some dislik to hi moral charact a punish of the moral sanction if by an immedi act of god displeasur manifest on account of some sin commit by him or through ani distract of mind occas by the dread of such displeasur a punish of the religi sanction x as to such of the pleasur and pain belong to the religi sanction as regard a futur life of what kind these may be we can not know these lie not open to our observ dure the present life they are matter onli of expect and whether that expect be deriv from natur or reveal religion the particular kind of pleasur or pain if it be differ from all those which lie open to our observ is what we can have no idea of the best idea we can obtain of such pain and pleasur are altogeth unliquid in point of qualiti in what other respect our idea of them may be liquid will be consid in anoth place xi of these four sanction the physic is altogeth we may observ the groundwork of the polit and the moral so is it also of the religi in as far as the latter bear relat to the present life it is includ in each of those other three thi may oper in ani case that is ani of the pain or pleasur belong to it may oper independ of them none of them can oper but by mean of thi in a word the power of natur may oper of themselv but neither the magistr nor men at larg can oper nor is god in the case in question suppos to oper but through the power of natur xii for these four object which in their natur have so much in common it seem of use to find a common name it seem of use in the first place for the conveni of give a name to certain pleasur and pain for which a name equal characterist could hardli otherwis have been found in the second place for the sake of hold up the efficaci of certain moral forc the influenc of which is apt not to be suffici attend to doe the polit sanction exert an influenc over the conduct of mankind the moral the religi sanction do so too in everi inch of hi career are the oper of the polit magistr liabl to be aid or imped by these two foreign power who one or other of them or both are sure to be either hi rival or hi alli doe it happen to him to leav them out in hi calcul he will be sure almost to find himself mistaken in the result of all thi we shall find abund proof in the sequel of thi work it behov him therefor to have them continu befor hi eye and that under such a name as exhibit the relat they bear to hi own purpos and design chapter iv valu of a lot of pleasur or pain how to be measur i pleasur then and the avoid of pain are the end that the legisl ha in view it behov him therefor to understand their valu pleasur and pain are the instrument he ha to work with it behov him therefor to understand their forc which is again in other word their valu ii to a person consid by himself the valu of a pleasur or pain consid by itself will be greater or less accord to the four follow circumst it intens it durat it certainti or uncertainti it propinqu or remot iii these are the circumst which are to be consid in estim a pleasur or a pain consid each of them by itself but when the valu of ani pleasur or pain is consid for the purpos of estim the tendenc of ani act by which it is produc there are two other circumst to be taken into the account these are it fecund or the chanc it ha of be follow by sensat of the same kind that is pleasur if it be a pleasur pain if it be a pain it puriti or the chanc it ha of not be follow by sensat of the opposit kind that is pain if it be a pleasur pleasur if it be a pain these two last howev are in strict scarc to be deem properti of the pleasur or the pain itself they are not therefor in strict to be taken into the account of the valu of that pleasur or that pain they are in strict to be deem properti onli of the act or other event by which such pleasur or pain ha been produc and accordingli are onli to be taken into the account of the tendenc of such act or such event iv to a number of person with refer to each of whom to the valu of a pleasur or a pain is consid it will be greater or less accord to seven circumst to wit the six preced one viz it intens it durat it certainti or uncertainti it propinqu or remot it fecund it puriti and one other to wit it extent that is the number of person to whom it extend or in other word who are affect by it v to take an exact account then of the gener tendenc of ani act by which the interest of a commun are affect proceed as follow begin with ani one person of those whose interest seem most immedi to be affect by it and take an account of the valu of each distinguish pleasur which appear to be produc by it in the first instanc of the valu of each pain which appear to be produc by it in the first instanc of the valu of each pleasur which appear to be produc by it after the first thi constitut the fecund of the first pleasur and the impur of the first pain of the valu of each pain which appear to be produc by it after the first thi constitut the fecund of the first pain and the impur of the first pleasur sum up all the valu of all the pleasur on the one side and those of all the pain on the other the balanc if it be on the side of pleasur will give the good tendenc of the act upon the whole with respect to the interest of that individu person if on the side of pain the bad tendenc of it upon the whole take an account of the number of person whose interest appear to be concern and repeat the abov process with respect to each sum up the number express of the degre of good tendenc which the act ha with respect to each individu in regard to whom the tendenc of it is good upon the whole do thi again with respect to each individu in regard to whom the tendenc of it is good upon the whole do thi again with respect to each individu in regard to whom the tendenc of it is bad upon the whole take the balanc which if on the side of pleasur will give the gener good tendenc of the act with respect to the total number or commun of individu concern if on the side of painth gener evil tendenc with respect to the same commun vi it is not to be expect that thi process should be strictli pursu previous to everi moral judgment or to everi legisl or judici oper it may howev be alway kept in view and as near as the process actual pursu on these occas approach to it so near will such process approach to the charact of an exact one vii the same process is alik applic to pleasur and pain in whatev shape they appear and by whatev denomin they are distinguish to pleasur whether it be call good which is properli the caus or instrument of pleasur or profit which is distant pleasur or the caus or instrument of distant pleasur or conveni or advantag benefit emolu happi and so forth to pain whether it be call evil which correspond to good or mischief or inconveni or disadvantag or loss or unhappi and so forth viii nor is thi a novel and unwarr ani more than it is a useless theori in all thi there is noth but what the practic of mankind wheresoev they have a clear view of their own interest is perfectli conform to an articl of properti an estat in land for instanc is valuabl on what account on account of the pleasur of all kind which it enabl a man to produc and what come to the same thing the pain of all kind which it enabl him to avert but the valu of such an articl of properti is univers understood to rise or fall accord to the length or short of the time which a man ha in it the certainti or uncertainti of it come into possess and the near or remot of the time at which if at all it is to come into possess as to the intens of the pleasur which a man may deriv from it thi is never thought of becaus it depend upon the use which each particular person may come to make of it which can not be estim till the particular pleasur he may come to deriv from it or the particular pain he may come to exclud by mean of it are brought to view for the same reason neither doe he think of the fecund or puriti of those pleasur thu much for pleasur and pain happi and unhappi in gener we come now to consid the sever particular kind of pain and pleasur chapter v pleasur and pain their kind i have repres what belong to all sort of pleasur and pain alik we come now to exhibit each by itself the sever sort of pain and pleasur pain and pleasur may be call by one gener word interest percept interest percept are either simpl or complex the simpl one are those which can not ani one of them be resolv into more complex are those which are resolv into diver simpl one a complex interest percept may accordingli be compos either of pleasur alon of pain alon or of a pleasur or pleasur and a pain or pain togeth what determin a lot of pleasur for exampl to be regard as one complex pleasur rather than as diver simpl one is the natur of the excit caus whatev pleasur are excit all at onc by the action of the same caus are apt to be look upon as constitut all togeth but one pleasur ii the sever simpl pleasur of which human natur is suscept seem to be as follow the pleasur of sens the pleasur of wealth the pleasur of skill the pleasur of amiti the pleasur of a good name the pleasur of power the pleasur of pieti the pleasur of benevol the pleasur of malevol the pleasur of memori the pleasur of imagin the pleasur of expect the pleasur depend on associ the pleasur of relief iii the sever simpl pain seem to be as follow the pain of privat the pain of the sens the pain of awkward the pain of enmiti the pain of an ill name the pain of pieti the pain of benevol the pain of malevol the pain of the memori the pain of the imagin the pain of expect the pain depend on associ iv the pleasur of sens seem to be as follow the pleasur of the tast or palat includ whatev pleasur are experienc in satisfi the appetit of hunger and thirst the pleasur of intox the pleasur of the organ of smell the pleasur of the touch the simpl pleasur of the ear independ of associ the simpl pleasur of the eye independ of associ the pleasur of the sexual sens the pleasur of health or the intern pleasur feel or flow of spirit as it is call which accompani a state of full health and vigour especi at time of moder bodili exert the pleasur of novelti or the pleasur deriv from the gratif of the appetit of curios by the applic of new object to ani of the sens v by the pleasur of wealth may be meant those pleasur which a man is apt to deriv from the conscious of possess ani articl or articl which stand in the list of instrument of enjoy or secur and more particularli at the time of hi first acquir them at which time the pleasur may be style a pleasur of gain or a pleasur of acquisit at other time a pleasur of possess the pleasur of skill as exercis upon particular object are those which accompani the applic of such particular instrument of enjoy to their use as can not be so appli without a greater or less share of difficulti or exert vi the pleasur of amiti or selfrecommend are the pleasur that may accompani the persuas of a man be in the acquisit or the possess of the goodwil of such or such assign person or person in particular or as the phrase is of be upon good term with him or them and as a fruit of it of hi be in a way to have the benefit of their spontan and gratuit servic vii the pleasur of a good name are the pleasur that accompani the persuas of a man be in the acquisit or the possess of the goodwil of the world about him that is of such member of societi as he is like to have concern with and as a mean of it either their love or their esteem or both and as a fruit of it of hi be in the way to have the benefit of their spontan and gratuit servic these may likewis be call the pleasur of good reput the pleasur of honour or the pleasur of the moral sanction viii the pleasur of power are the pleasur that accompani the persuas of a man be in a condit to dispos peopl by mean of their hope and fear to give him the benefit of their servic that is by the hope of some servic or by the fear of some disservic that he may be in the way to render them ix the pleasur of pieti are the pleasur that accompani the belief of a man be in the acquisit or in possess of the goodwil or favour of the suprem be and as a fruit of it of hi be in a way of enjoy pleasur to be receiv by god special appoint either in thi life or in a life to come these may also be call the pleasur of religion the pleasur of a religi disposit or the pleasur of the religi sanction x the pleasur of benevol are the pleasur result from the view of ani pleasur suppos to be possess by the be who may be the object of benevol to wit the sensit be we are acquaint with under which are commonli includ the suprem be human be other anim these may also be call the pleasur of goodwil the pleasur of sympathi or the pleasur of the benevol or social affect xi the pleasur of malevol are the pleasur result from the view of ani pain suppos to be suffer by the be who may becom the object of malevol to wit human be other anim these may also be style the pleasur of illwil the pleasur of the irasc appetit the pleasur of antipathi or the pleasur of the malevol or dissoci affect xii the pleasur of the memori are the pleasur which after have enjoy such and such pleasur or even in some case after have suffer such and such pain a man will now and then experi at recollect them exactli in the order and in the circumst in which they were actual enjoy or suffer these deriv pleasur may of cours be distinguish into as mani speci as there are of origin percept from whenc they may be copi they may also be style pleasur of simpl recollect xiii the pleasur of the imagin are the pleasur which may be deriv from the contempl of ani such pleasur as may happen to be suggest by the memori but in a differ order and accompani by differ group of circumst these may accordingli be refer to ani one of the three cardin point of time present past or futur it is evid they may admit of as mani distinct as those of the former class xiv the pleasur of expect are the pleasur that result from the contempl of ani sort of pleasur refer to time futur and accompani with the sentiment of belief these also may admit of the same distinct xv the pleasur of associ are the pleasur which certain object or incid may happen to afford not of themselv but mere in virtu of some associ they have contract in the mind with certain object or incid which are in themselv pleasur such is the case for instanc with the pleasur of skill when afford by such a set of incid as compos a game of chess thi deriv it pleasur qualiti from it associ partli with the pleasur of skill as exercis in the product of incid pleasur of themselv partli from it associ with the pleasur of power such is the case also with the pleasur of good luck when afford by such incid as compos the game of hazard or ani other game of chanc when play at for noth thi deriv it pleasur qualiti from it associ with one of the pleasur of wealth to wit with the pleasur of acquir it xvi farther on we shall see pain ground upon pleasur in like manner may we now see pleasur ground upon pain to the catalogu of pleasur may accordingli be ad the pleasur of relief or the pleasur which a man experi when after he ha been endur a pain of ani kind for a certain time it come to ceas or to abat these may of cours be distinguish into as mani speci as there are of pain and may give rise to so mani pleasur of memori of imagin and of expect xvii pain of privat are the pain that may result from the thought of not possess in the time present ani of the sever kind of pleasur pain of privat may accordingli be resolv into as mani kind as there are of pleasur to which they may correspond and from the absenc whereof they may be deriv xviii there are three sort of pain which are onli so mani modif of the sever pain of privat when the enjoy of ani particular pleasur happen to be particularli desir but without ani expect approach to assur the pain of privat which thereupon result take a particular name and is call the pain of desir or of unsatisfi desir xix where the enjoy happen to have been look for with a degre of expect approach to assur and that expect is made suddenli to ceas it is call a pain of disappoint xx a pain of privat take the name of a pain of regret in two case where it is ground on the memori of a pleasur which have been onc enjoy
