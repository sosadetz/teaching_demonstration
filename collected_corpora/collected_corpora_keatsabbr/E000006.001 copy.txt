they who have presum to dogmat on natur as on some well investig subject either from selfconceit or arrog and in the professori style have inflict the greatest injuri on philosophi and learn for they have tend to stifl and interrupt inquiri exactli in proport as they have prevail in bring other to their opinion and their own activ ha not counterbalanc the mischief they have occas by corrupt and destroy that of other they again who have enter upon a contrari cours and assert that noth whatev can be known whether they have fallen into thi opinion from their hatr of the ancient sophist or from the hesit of their mind or from an exuber of learn have certainli adduc reason for it which are by no mean contempt they have not howev deriv their opinion from true sourc and hurri on by their zeal and some affect have certainli exceed due moder but the more ancient greek whose write have perish held a more prudent mean between the arrog of dogmat and the despair of sceptic and though too frequent intermingl complaint and indign at the difficulti of inquiri and the obscur of thing and champ as it were the bit have still persist in press their point and pursu their intercours with natur think as it seem that the better method wa not to disput upon the veri point of the possibl of anyth be known but to put it to the test of experi yet they themselv by onli employ the power of the understand have not adopt a fix rule but have laid their whole stress upon intens medit and a continu exercis and perpetu agit of the mind our method though difficult in it oper is easili explain it consist in determin the degre of certainti while we as it were restor the sens to their former rank but gener reject that oper of the mind which follow close upon the sens and open and establish a new and certain cours for the mind from the first actual percept of the sens themselv thi no doubt wa the view taken by those who have assign so much to logic show clearli therebi that they sought some support for the mind and suspect it natur and spontan mode of action but thi is now employ too late as a remedi when all is clearli lost and after the mind by the daili habit and intercours of life ha come prepossess with corrupt doctrin and fill with the vainest idol the art of logic therefor be as we have mention too late a precaut and in no way remedi the matter ha tend more to confirm error than to disclos truth our onli remain hope and salvat is to begin the whole labor of the mind again not leav it to itself but direct it perpetu from the veri first and attain our end as it were by mechan aid if men for instanc had attempt mechan labor with their hand alon and without the power and aid of instrument as they have not hesit to carri on the labor of their understand with the unaid effort of their mind they would have been abl to move and overcom but littl though they had exert their utmost and unit power and just to paus awhil on thi comparison and look into it as a mirror let us ask if ani obelisk of a remark size were perchanc requir to be move for the purpos of grace a triumph or ani similar pageant and men were to attempt it with their bare hand would not ani sober spectat avow it to be an act of the greatest mad and if they should increas the number of workmen and imagin that they could thu succeed would he not think so still more but if they chose to make a select and to remov the weak and onli employ the strong and vigor think by thi mean at ani rate to achiev their object would he not say that they were more fondli derang nay if not content with thi they were to determin on consult the athlet art and were to give order for all to appear with their hand arm and muscl regularli oil and prepar would he not exclaim that they were take pain to rave by method and design yet men are hurri on with the same senseless energi and useless combin in intellectu matter as long as they expect great result either from the number and agreement or the excel and acut of their wit or even strengthen their mind with logic which may be consid as an athlet prepar but yet do not desist if we rightli consid the matter from appli their own understand mere with all thi zeal and effort while noth is more clear than that in everi great work execut by the hand of man without machin or implement it is imposs for the strength of individu to be increas or for that of the multitud to combin have premis so much we lay down two point on which we would admonish mankind lest they should fail to see or to observ them the first of these is that it is our good fortun as we consid it for the sake of extinguish and remov contradict and irrit of mind to leav the honor and rever due to the ancient untouch and undiminish so that we can perform our intend work and yet enjoy the benefit of our respect moder for if we should profess to offer someth better than the ancient and yet should pursu the same cours as they have done we could never by ani artific contriv to avoid the imput of have engag in a contest or rivalri as to our respect wit excel or talent which though neither inadmiss nor new for whi should we not blame and point out anyth that is imperfectli discov or laid down by them of our own right a right common to all yet howev just and allow would perhap be scarc an equal match on account of the disproport of our strength but sinc our present plan lead up to open an entir differ cours to the understand and one unattempt and unknown to them the case is alter there is an end to parti zeal and we onli take upon ourselv the charact of a guid which requir a moder share of author and good fortun rather than talent and excel the first admonit relat to person the next to thing we make no attempt to disturb the system of philosophi that now prevail or ani other which may or will exist either more correct or more complet for we deni not that the receiv system of philosophi and other of a similar natur encourag discuss embellish harangu are employ and are of servic in the duti of the professor and the affair of civil life nay we openli express and declar that the philosophi we offer will not be veri use in such respect it is not obviou nor to be understood in a cursori view nor doe it flatter the mind in it preconceiv notion nor will it descend to the level of the gener of mankind unless by it advantag and effect let there exist then and may it be of advantag to both two sourc and two distribut of learn and in like manner two tribe and as it were kindr famili of contempl or philosoph without ani hostil or alien between them but rather alli and unit by mutual assist let there be in short one method of cultiv the scienc and anoth of discov them and as for those who prefer and more readili receiv the former on account of their hast or from motiv aris from their ordinari life or becaus they are unabl from weak of mind to comprehend and embrac the other which must necessarili be the case with by far the greater number let us wish that they may prosper as they desir in their undertak and attain what they pursu but if ani individu desir and is anxiou not mere to adher to and make use of present discoveri but to penetr still further and not to overcom hi adversari in disput but natur by labor not in short to give eleg and speciou opinion but to know to a certainti and demonstr let him as a true son of scienc if such be hi wish join with us that when he ha left the antechamb of natur trodden by the multitud an entranc may at last be discov to her inner apart and in order to be better understood and to render our mean more familiar by assign determin name we have accustom ourselv to call the one method the anticip of the mind and the other the interpret of natur we have still one request left we have at least reflect and taken pain in order to render our proposit not onli true but of easi and familiar access to men mind howev wonder prepossess and limit yet it is but just that we should obtain thi favor from mankind especi in so great a restor of learn and the scienc that whosoev may be desir of form ani determin upon an opinion of thi our work either from hi own percept or the crowd of author or the form of demonstr he will not expect to be abl to do so in a cursori manner and while attend to other matter but in order to have a thorough knowledg of the subject will himself by degre attempt the cours which we describ and maintain will be accustom to the subtilti of thing which is manifest by experi and will correct the deprav and deepli root habit of hi mind by a season and as it were just hesit and then final if he will use hi judgment when he ha begun to be master of himself aphorisms—book i on the interpret of natur and the empir of man i man as the minist and interpret of natur doe and understand as much as hi observ on the order of natur either with regard to thing or the mind permit him and neither know nor is capabl of more ii the unassist hand and the understand left to itself possess but littl power effect are produc by the mean of instrument and help which the understand requir no less than the hand and as instrument either promot or regul the motion of the hand so those that are appli to the mind prompt or protect the understand iii knowledg and human power are synonym sinc the ignor of the caus frustrat the effect for natur is onli subdu by submiss and that which in contempl philosophi correspond with the caus in practic scienc becom the rule iv man while oper can onli appli or withdraw natur bodi natur intern perform the rest v those who becom practic vers in natur are the mechan the mathematician the physician the alchemist and the magician but all as matter now stand with faint effort and meagr success vi it would be mad and inconsist to suppos that thing which have never yet been perform can be perform without employ some hitherto untri mean vii the creation of the mind and hand appear veri numer if we judg by book and manufactur but all that varieti consist of an excess refin and of deduct from a few well known matters—not of a number of axiom viii even the effect alreadi discov are due to chanc and experi rather than to the scienc for our present scienc are noth more than peculiar arrang of matter alreadi discov and not method for discoveri or plan for new oper ix the sole caus and root of almost everi defect in the scienc is thi that while we fals admir and extol the power of the human mind we do not search for it real help x the subtilti of natur is far beyond that of sens or of the understand so that the speciou medit specul and theori of mankind are but a kind of insan onli there is no one to stand by and observ it xi as the present scienc are useless for the discoveri of effect so the present system of logic is useless for the discoveri of the scienc xii the present system of logic rather assist in confirm and render inveter the error found on vulgar notion than in search after truth and is therefor more hurt than use xiii the syllog is not appli to the principl of the scienc and is of no avail in intermedi axiom as be veri unequ to the subtilti of natur it forc assent therefor and not thing xiv the syllog consist of proposit proposit of word word are the sign of notion if therefor the notion which form the basi of the whole be confus and carelessli abstract from thing there is no solid in the superstructur our onli hope then is in genuin induct xv we have no sound notion either in logic or physic substanc qualiti action passion and exist are not clear notion much less weight leviti densiti tenuiti moistur dryness gener corrupt attract repuls element matter form and the like they are all fantast and illdefin xvi the notion of less abstract natur as man dog dove and the immedi percept of sens as heat cold white black do not deceiv us materi yet even these are sometim confus by the mutabl of matter and the intermixtur of thing all the rest which men have hitherto employ are error and improperli abstract and deduc from thing xvii there is the same degre of licenti and error in form axiom as in abstract notion and that in the first principl which depend on common induct still more is thi the case in axiom and inferior proposit deriv from syllog ⚓ ✪ xviii the present discoveri in scienc are such as lie immedi beneath the surfac of common notion it is necessari howev to penetr the more secret and remot part of natur in order to abstract both notion and axiom from thing by a more certain and guard method xix there are and can exist but two way of investig and discov truth the one hurri on rapidli from the sens and particular to the most gener axiom and from them as principl and their suppos indisput truth deriv and discov the intermedi axiom thi is the way now in use the other construct it axiom from the sens and particular by ascend continu and gradual till it final arriv at the most gener axiom which is the true but unattempt way xx the understand when left to itself proce by the same way as that which it would have adopt under the guidanc of logic name the first for the mind is fond of start off to gener that it may avoid labor and after dwell a littl on a subject is fatigu by experi but those evil are augment by logic for the sake of the ostent of disput xxi the understand when left to itself in a man of a steadi patient and reflect disposit especi when unimped by receiv doctrin make some attempt in the right way but with littl effect sinc the understand undirect and unassist is unequ to and unfit for the task of vanquish the obscur of thing xxii each of these two way begin from the sens and particular and end in the greatest gener but they are immeasur differ for the one mere touch cursorili the limit of experi and particular while the other run duli and regularli through them—th one from the veri outset lay down some abstract and useless gener the other gradual rise to those principl which are realli the most common in natur xxiii there is no small differ between the idol of the human mind and the idea of the divin mind—that is to say between certain idl dogma and the real stamp and impress of creat object as they are found in natur xxiv axiom determin upon in argument can never assist in the discoveri of new effect for the subtilti of natur is vastli superior to that of argument but axiom properli and regularli abstract from particular easili point out and defin new particular and therefor impart activ to the scienc xxv the axiom now in use are deriv from a scanti hand as it were of experi and a few particular of frequent occurr whenc they are of much the same dimens or extent as their origin and if ani neglect or unknown instanc occur the axiom is save by some frivol distinct when it would be more consist with truth to amend it xxvi we are wont for the sake of distinct to call that human reason which we appli to natur the anticip of natur as be rash and prematur and that which is properli deduc from thing the interpret of natur xxvii anticip are suffici power in produc unanim for if men were all to becom even uniformli mad they might agre toler well with each other xxviii anticip again will be assent to much more readili than interpret becaus be deduc from a few instanc and these princip of familiar occurr they immedi hit the understand and satisfi the imagin while on the contrari interpret be deduc from variou subject and these wide dispers can not suddenli strike the understand so that in common estim they must appear difficult and discord and almost like the mysteri of faith xxix in scienc found on opinion and dogma it is right to make use of anticip and logic if you wish to forc assent rather than thing xxx if all the capac of all age should unit and combin and transmit their labor no great progress will be made in learn by anticip becaus the radic error and those which occur in the first process of the mind are not cure by the excel of subsequ mean and remedi xxxi it is in vain to expect ani great progress in the scienc by the superinduc or ingraft new matter upon old an instaur must be made from the veri foundat if we do not wish to revolv forev in a circl make onli some slight and contempt progress xxxii the ancient author and all other are left in undisput possess of their honor for we enter into no comparison of capac or talent but of method and assum the part of a guid rather than of a critic xxxiii to speak plainli no correct judgment can be form either of our method or it discoveri by those anticip which are now in common use for it is not to be requir of us to submit ourselv to the judgment of the veri method we ourselv arraign xxxiv nor is it an easi matter to deliv and explain our sentiment for those thing which are in themselv new can yet be onli understood from some analog to what is old xxxv alexand borgia said of the expedit of the french into itali that they came with chalk in their hand to mark up their lodg and not with weapon to forc their passag even so do we wish our philosophi to make it way quietli into those mind that are fit for it and of good capac for we have no need of content where we differ in first principl and in our veri notion and even in our form of demonstr xxxvi we have but one simpl method of deliv our sentiment name we must bring men to particular and their regular seri and order and they must for a while renounc their notion and begin to form an acquaint with thing xxxvii our method and that of the sceptic agre in some respect at first set out but differ most wide and are complet oppos to each other in their conclus for they roundli assert that noth can be known we that but a small part of natur can be known by the present method their next step howev is to destroy the author of the sens and understand while we invent and suppli them with assist xxxviii the idol and fals notion which have alreadi preoccupi the human understand and are deepli root in it not onli so beset men mind that they becom difficult of access but even when access is obtain will again meet and troubl us in the instaur of the scienc unless mankind when forewarn guard themselv with all possibl care against them xxxix four speci of idol beset the human mind to which for distinct sake we have assign name call the first idol of the tribe the second idol of the den the third idol of the market the fourth idol of the theatr xl the format of notion and axiom on the foundat of true induct is the onli fit remedi by which we can ward off and expel these idol it is howev of great servic to point them out for the doctrin of idol bear the same relat to the interpret of natur as that of the confut of sophism doe to common logic xli the idol of the tribe are inher in human natur and the veri tribe or race of man for man sens is fals assert to be the standard of thing on the contrari all the percept both of the sens and the mind bear refer to man and not to the univers and the human mind resembl those uneven mirror which impart their own properti to differ object from which ray are emit and distort and disfigur them xlii the idol of the den are those of each individu for everybodi in addit to the error common to the race of man ha hi own individu den or cavern which intercept and corrupt the light of natur either from hi own peculiar and singular disposit or from hi educ and intercours with other or from hi read and the author acquir by those whom he rever and admir or from the differ impress produc on the mind as it happen to be preoccupi and predispos or equabl and tranquil and the like so that the spirit of man accord to it sever disposit is variabl confus and as it were actuat by chanc and heraclitu said well that men search for knowledg in lesser world and not in the greater or common world xliii there are also idol form by the reciproc intercours and societi of man with man which we call idol of the market from the commerc and associ of men with each other for men convers by mean of languag but word are form at the will of the gener and there aris from a bad and unapt format of word a wonder obstruct to the mind nor can the definit and explan with which learn men are wont to guard and protect themselv in some instanc afford a complet remedy—word still manifestli forc the understand throw everyth into confus and lead mankind into vain and innumer controversi and fallaci xliv lastli there are idol which have crept into men mind from the variou dogma of peculiar system of philosophi and also from the pervert rule of demonstr and these we denomin idol of the theatr for we regard all the system of philosophi hitherto receiv or imagin as so mani play brought out and perform creat fictiou and theatric world nor do we speak onli of the present system or of the philosophi and sect of the ancient sinc numer other play of a similar natur can be still compos and made to agre with each other the caus of the most opposit error be gener the same nor again do we allud mere to gener system but also to mani element and axiom of scienc which have becom inveter by tradit implicit credenc and neglect we must howev discuss each speci of idol more fulli and distinctli in order to guard the human understand against them xlv the human understand from it peculiar natur easili suppos a greater degre of order and equal in thing than it realli find and although mani thing in natur be sui generi and most irregular will yet invent parallel and conjug and rel where no such thing is henc the fiction that all celesti bodi move in perfect circl thu reject entir spiral and serpentin line except as explanatori term henc also the element of fire is introduc with it peculiar orbit to keep squar with those other three which are object of our sens the rel rariti of the element as they are call is arbitrarili made to vari in tenfold progress with mani other dream of the like natur nor is thi folli confin to theori but it is to be met with even in simpl notion xlvi the human understand when ani proposit ha been onc laid down either from gener admiss and belief or from the pleasur it afford forc everyth els to add fresh support and confirm and although most cogent and abund instanc may exist to the contrari yet either doe not observ or despis them or get rid of and reject them by some distinct with violent and injuri prejudic rather than sacrific the author of it first conclus it wa well answer by him who wa shown in a templ the votiv tablet suspend by such as had escap the peril of shipwreck and wa press as to whether he would then recogn the power of the god by an inquiri but where are the portrait of those who have perish in spite of their vow all superstit is much the same whether it be that of astrolog dream omen retribut judgment or the like in all of which the delud believ observ event which are fulfil but neglect and pass over their failur though it be much more common but thi evil insinu itself still more craftili in philosophi and the scienc in which a settl maxim vitiat and govern everi other circumst though the latter be much more worthi of confid besid even in the absenc of that eager and want of thought which we have mention it is the peculiar and perpetu error of the human understand to be more move and excit by affirm than neg wherea it ought duli and regularli to be imparti nay in establish ani true axiom the neg instanc is the most power xlvii the human understand is most excit by that which strike and enter the mind at onc and suddenli and by which the imagin is immedi fill and inflat it then begin almost impercept to conceiv and suppos that everyth is similar to the few object which have taken possess of the mind while it is veri slow and unfit for the transit to the remot and heterogen instanc by which axiom are tri as by fire unless the offic be impos upon it by sever regul and a power author xlviii the human understand is activ and can not halt or rest but even though without effect still press forward thu we can not conceiv of ani end or extern boundari of the world and it seem necessarili to occur to us that there must be someth beyond nor can we imagin how etern ha flow on down to the present day sinc the usual receiv distinct of an infin a part ant and a part post can not hold good for it would thenc follow that one infin is greater than anoth and also that infin is wast away and tend to an end there is the same difficulti in consid the infinit divis of line aris from the weak of our mind which weak interfer to still greater disadvantag with the discoveri of caus for although the greatest gener in natur must be posit just as they are found and in fact not causabl yet the human understand incap of rest seek for someth more intellig thu howev while aim at further progress it fall back to what is actual less advanc name final caus for they are clearli more alli to man own natur than the system of the univers and from thi sourc they have wonder corrupt philosophi but he would be an unskil and shallow philosoph who should seek for caus in the greatest gener and not be anxiou to discov them in subordin object xlix the human understand resembl not a dri light but admit a tinctur of the will and passion which gener their own system accordingli for man alway believ more readili that which he prefer he therefor reject difficulti for want of patienc in investig sobrieti becaus it limit hi hope the depth of natur from superstit the light of experi from arrog and pride lest hi mind should appear to be occupi with common and vari object paradox from a fear of the opinion of the vulgar in short hi feel imbu and corrupt hi understand in innumer and sometim impercept way l but by far the greatest impedi and aberr of the human understand proce from the dul incompet and error of the sens sinc whatev strike the sens preponder over everyth howev superior which doe not immedi strike them henc contempl mostli ceas with sight and a veri scanti or perhap no regard is paid to invis object the entir oper therefor of spirit inclos in tangibl bodi is conceal and escap us all that more delic chang of format in the part of coarser substanc vulgarli call alter but in fact a chang of posit in the smallest particl is equal unknown and yet unless the two matter we have mention be explor and brought to light no great effect can be produc in natur again the veri natur of common air and all bodi of less densiti of which there are mani is almost unknown for the sens are weak and er nor can instrument be of great use in extend their sphere or acuteness—al the better interpret of natur are work out by instanc and fit and apt experi where the sens onli judg of the experi the experi of natur and the thing itself li the human understand is by it own natur prone to abstract and suppos that which is fluctuat to be fix but it is better to dissect than abstract natur such wa the method employ by the school of democritu which made greater progress in penetr natur than the rest it is best to consid matter it conform and the chang of that conform it own action and the law of thi action or motion for form are a mere fiction of the human mind unless you will call the law of action by that name lii such are the idol of the tribe which aris either from the uniform of the constitut of man spirit or it prejudic or it limit faculti or restless agit or from the interfer of the passion or the incompet of the sens or the mode of their impress liii the idol of the den deriv their origin from the peculiar natur of each individu mind and bodi and also from educ habit and accid and although they be variou and manifold yet we will treat of some that requir the greatest caution and exert the greatest power in pollut the understand liv some men becom attach to particular scienc and contempl either from suppos themselv the author and inventor of them or from have bestow the greatest pain upon such subject and thu becom most habitu to them if men of thi descript appli themselv to philosophi and contempl of a univers natur they wrest and corrupt them by their preconceiv fanci of which aristotl afford us a singl instanc who made hi natur philosophi complet subservi to hi logic and thu render it littl more than useless and disputati the chemist again have form a fanci philosophi with the most confin view from a few experi of the furnac gilbert too have employ himself most assidu in the consider of the magnet immedi establish a system of philosophi to coincid with hi favorit pursuit lv the greatest and perhap radic distinct between differ men disposit for philosophi and the scienc is thi that some are more vigor and activ in observ the differ of thing other in observ their resembl for a steadi and acut disposit can fix it thought and dwell upon and adher to a point through all the refin of differ but those that are sublim and discurs recogn and compar even the most delic and gener resembl each of them readili fall into excess by catch either at nice distinct or shadow of resembl lvi some disposit evinc an unbound admir of antiqu other eagerli embrac novelti and but few can preserv the just medium so as neither to tear up what the ancient have correctli laid down nor to despis the just innov of the modern but thi is veri prejudici to the scienc and philosophi and instead of a correct judgment we have but the faction of the ancient and modern truth is not to be sought in the good fortun of ani particular conjunctur of time which is uncertain but in the light of natur and experi which is etern such faction therefor are to be abjur and the understand must not allow them to hurri it on to assent lvii the contempl of natur and of bodi in their individu form distract and weaken the understand but the contempl of natur and of bodi in their gener composit and format stupefi and relax it we have a good instanc of thi in the school of leucippu and democritu compar with other for they appli themselv so much to particular as almost to neglect the gener structur of thing while the other were so astound while gaze on the structur that they did not penetr the simplic of natur these two speci of contempl must therefor be interchang and each employ in it turn in order to render the understand at onc penetr and capaci and to avoid the inconveni we have mention and the idol that result from them lviii let such therefor be our precaut in contempl that we may ward off and expel the idol of the den which mostli owe their birth either to some predomin pursuit or secondli to an excess in synthesi and analysi or thirdli to a parti zeal in favor of certain age or fourthli to the extent or narrow of the subject in gener he who contempl natur should suspect whatev particularli take and fix hi understand and should use so much the more caution to preserv it equabl and unprejud lix the idol of the market are the most troublesom of all those name which have entwin themselv round the understand from the associ of word and name for men imagin that their reason govern word while in fact word react upon the understand and thi ha render philosophi and the scienc sophist and inact word are gener form in a popular sens and defin thing by those broad line which are most obviou to the vulgar mind but when a more acut understand or more dilig observ is anxiou to vari those line and to adapt them more accur to natur word oppos it henc the great and solemn disput of learn men often termin in controversi about word and name in regard to which it would be better imit the caution of mathematician to proceed more advisedli in the first instanc and to bring such disput to a regular issu by definit such definit howev can not remedi the evil in natur and materi object becaus they consist themselv of word and these word produc other so that we must necessarili have recours to particular instanc and their regular seri and arrang as we shall mention when we come to the mode and scheme of determin notion and axiom lx the idol impos upon the understand by word are of two kind they are either the name of thing which have no exist for as some object are from inattent left without a name so name are form by fanci imagin which are without an object or they are the name of actual object but confus badli defin and hastili and irregularli abstract from thing fortun the primum mobil the planetari orbit the element of fire and the like fiction which owe their birth to futil and fals theori are instanc of the first kind and thi speci of idol is remov with greater facil becaus it can be extermin by the constant refut or the desuetud of the theori themselv the other which are creat by viciou and unskil abstract are intric and deepli root take some word for instanc as moist and let us examin how far the differ signif of thi word are consist it will be found that the word moist is noth but a confus sign of differ action admit of no settl and defin uniform for it mean that which easili diffus itself over anoth bodi that which is indetermin and can not be brought to a consist that which yield easili in everi direct that which is easili divid and dispers that which is easili unit and collect that which easili flow and is put in motion that which easili adher to and wet anoth bodi that which is easili reduc to a liquid state though previous solid when therefor you come to predic or impos thi name in one sens flame is moist in anoth air is not moist in anoth fine powder is moist in anoth glass is moist so that it is quit clear that thi notion is hastili abstract from water onli and common ordinari liquor without ani due verif of it there are howev differ degre of distort and mistak in word one of the least faulti class is that of the name of substanc particularli of the less abstract and more defin speci those then of chalk and mud are good of earth bad word signifi action are more faulti as to gener to corrupt to chang but the most faulti are those denot qualiti except the immedi object of sens as heavi light rare dens yet in all of these there must be some notion a littl better than other in proport as a greater or less number of thing come befor the sens lxi the idol of the theatr are not innat nor do they introduc themselv secretli into the understand but they are manifestli instil and cherish by the fiction of theori and deprav rule of demonstr to attempt howev or undertak their confut would not be consist with our declar for sinc we neither agre in our principl nor our demonstr all argument is out of the question and it is fortun that the ancient are left in possess of their honor we detract noth from them see our whole doctrin relat onli to the path to be pursu the lame as they say in the path outstrip the swift who wander from it and it is clear that the veri skill and swift of him who run not in the right direct must increas hi aberr our method of discov the scienc is such as to leav littl to the acut and strength of wit and inde rather to level wit and intellect for as in the draw of a straight line or accur circl by the hand much depend on it steadi and practic but if a ruler or compass be employ there is littl occas for either so it is with our method although howev we enter into no individu confut yet a littl must be said first of the sect and gener divis of these speci of theori secondli someth further to show that there are extern sign of their weak and lastli we must consid the caus of so great a misfortun and so long and gener a unanim in error that we may thu render the access to truth less difficult and that the human understand may the more readili be purifi and brought to dismiss it idol lxii the idol of the theatr or of theori are numer and may and perhap will be still more so for unless men mind had been now occupi for mani age in religi and theolog consider and civil govern especi monarchi had been avers to novelti of that natur even in theori so that men must appli to them with some risk and injuri to their own fortun and not onli without reward but subject to contum and envi there is no doubt that mani other sect of philosoph and theorist would have been introduc like those which formerli flourish in such diversifi abund among the greek for as mani imaginari theori of the heaven can be deduc from the phenomena of the sky so it is even more easi to found mani dogma upon the phenomena of philosophy—and the plot of thi our theatr resembl those of the poetic where the plot which are invent for the stage are more consist eleg and pleasur than those taken from real histori in gener men take for the groundwork of their philosophi either too much from a few topic or too littl from mani in either case their philosophi is found on too narrow a basi of experi and natur histori and decid on too scanti ground for the theoret philosoph seiz variou common circumst by experi without reduc them to certainti or examin and frequent consid them and reli for the rest upon medit and the activ of hi wit there are other philosoph who have dilig and accur attend to a few experi and have thenc presum to deduc and invent system of philosophi form everyth to conform with them a third set from their faith and religi vener introduc theolog and tradit the absurd of some among them have proceed so far as to seek and deriv the scienc from spirit and genii there are therefor three sourc of error and three speci of fals philosophi the sophist empir and superstiti lxiii aristotl afford the most emin instanc of the first for he corrupt natur philosophi by logic—thu he form the world of categori assign to the human soul the noblest of substanc a genu determin by word of secondari oper treat of densiti and rariti by which bodi occupi a greater or lesser space by the frigid distinct of action and power assert that there wa a peculiar and proper motion in all bodi and that if they share in ani other motion it wa owe to an extern move caus and impos innumer arbitrari distinct upon the natur of thing be everywher more anxiou as to definit in teach and the accuraci of the word of hi proposit than the intern truth of thing and thi is best shown by a comparison of hi philosophi with the other of greatest reput among the greek for the similar part of anaxagora the atom of leucippu and democritu the heaven and earth of parmenid the discord and concord of empedocl the resolut of bodi into the common natur of fire and their condens accord to heraclitu exhibit some sprinkl of natur philosophi the natur of thing and experi while aristotl physic are mere logic term and he remodel the same subject in hi metaphys under a more impos titl and more as a realist than a nominalist nor is much stress to be laid on hi frequent recours to experi in hi book on anim hi problem and other treatis for he had alreadi decid without have properli consult experi as the basi of hi decis and axiom and after have so decid he drag experi along as a captiv constrain to accommod herself to hi decis so that he is even more to be blame than hi modern follow of the scholast school who have desert her altogeth lxiv the empir school produc dogma of a more deform and monstrou natur than the sophist or theoret school not be found in the light of common notion which howev poor and superstiti is yet in a manner univers and of a gener tendenc but in the confin obscur of a few experi henc thi speci of philosophi appear probabl and almost certain to those who are daili practic in such experi and have thu corrupt their imagin but incred and futil to other we have a strong instanc of thi in the alchemist and their dogma it would be difficult to find anoth in thi age unless perhap in the philosophi of gilbert we could not howev neglect to caution other against thi school becaus we alreadi forese and augur that if men be hereaft induc by our exhort to appli serious to experi bid farewel to the sophist doctrin there will then be immin danger from empir owe to the prematur and forward hast of the understand and it jump or fli to gener and the principl of thing we ought therefor alreadi to meet the evil lxv the corrupt of philosophi by the mix of it up with superstit and theolog is of a much wider extent and is most injuri to it both as a whole and in part for the human understand is no less expos to the impress of fanci than to those of vulgar notion the disputati and sophist school entrap the understand while the fanci bombast and as it were poetic school rather flatter it there is a clear exampl of thi among the greek especi in pythagora where howev the superstit is coars and overcharg but it is more danger and refin in plato and hi school thi evil is found also in some branch of other system of philosophi where it introduc abstract form final and first caus omit frequent the intermedi and the like against it we must use the greatest caution for the apotheosi of error is the greatest evil of all and when folli is worship it is as it were a plagu spot upon the understand yet some of the modern have indulg thi folli with such consumm inconsider that they have endeavor to build a system of natur philosophi on the first chapter of genesi the book of job and other part of scriptur seek thu the dead among the live and thi folli is the more to be prevent and restrain becaus not onli fantast philosophi but heret religion spring from the absurd mixtur of matter divin and human it is therefor most wise soberli to render unto faith the thing that are faith lxvi have spoken of the viciou author of the system found either on vulgar notion or on a few experi or on superstit we must now consid the faulti subject for contempl especi in natur philosophi the human understand is pervert by observ the power of mechan art in which bodi are veri materi chang by composit or separ and is induc to suppos that someth similar take place in the univers natur of thing henc the fiction of element and their cooper in form natur bodi again when man reflect upon the entir liberti of natur he meet with particular speci of thing as anim plant miner and is thenc easili led to imagin that there exist in natur certain primari form which she strive to produc and that all variat from them aris from some impedi or error which she is expos to in complet her work or from the collis or metamorphosi of differ speci the first hypothesi ha produc the doctrin of elementari properti the second that of occult properti and specif power and both lead to trifl cours of reflect in which the mind acquiesc and is thu divert from more import subject but physician exercis a much more use labor in the consider of the secondari qualiti of thing and the oper of attract repuls attenu inspiss dilat astring separ matur and the like and would do still more if they would not corrupt these proper observ by the two system i have allud to of elementari qualiti and specif power by which they either reduc the secondari to first qualiti and their subtil and immeasur composit or at ani rate neglect to advanc by greater and more dilig observ to the third and fourth qualiti thu termin their contempl prematur nor are these power or the like to be investig onli among the medicin for the human bodi but also in all chang of other natur bodi a greater evil aris from the contempl and investig rather of the stationari principl of thing from which than of the activ by which thing themselv are creat for the former onli serv for discuss the latter for practic nor is ani valu to be set on those common differ of motion which are observ in the receiv system of natur philosophi as gener corrupt augment diminut alter and translat for thi is their mean if a bodi unchang in other respect is move from it place thi is translat if the place and speci be given but the quantiti chang it is alter but if from such a chang the mass and quantiti of the bodi do not continu the same thi is the motion of augment and diminut if the chang be continu so as to vari the speci and substanc and transfus them to other thi is gener and corrupt all thi is mere popular and by no mean penetr into natur and these are but the measur and bound of motion and not differ speci of it they mere suggest how far and not how or whenc for they exhibit neither the affect of bodi nor the process of their part but mere establish a divis of that motion which coars exhibit to the sens matter in it vari form even when they wish to point out someth rel to the caus of motion and to establish a divis of them they most absurdli introduc natur and violent motion which is also a popular notion sinc everi violent motion is also in fact natur that is to say the extern effici put natur in action in a differ manner to that which she had previous employ but if neglect these ani one were for instanc to observ that there is in bodi a tendenc of adhes so as not to suffer the uniti of natur to be complet separ or broken and a vacuum to be form or that they have a tendenc to return to their natur dimens or tension so that if compress or extend within or beyond it they immedi strive to recov themselv and resum their former volum and extent or that they have a tendenc to congreg into mass with similar bodies—th dens for instanc toward the circumfer of the earth the thin and rare toward that of the heaven these and the like are true physic genera of motion but the other are clearli logic and scholast as appear plainli from a comparison of the two anoth consider evil is that men in their system and contempl bestow their labor upon the investig and discuss of the principl of thing and the extrem limit of natur although all util and mean of action consist in the intermedi object henc men ceas not to abstract natur till they arriv at potenti and shapeless matter and still persist in their dissect till they arriv at atom and yet were all thi true it would be of littl use to advanc man estat lxvii the understand must also be caution against the intemper of system so far as regard it give or withhold it assent for such intemper appear to fix and perpetu idol so as to leav no mean of remov them these excess are of two kind the first is seen in those who decid hastili and render the scienc posit and dictatori the other in those who have introduc sceptic and vagu unbound inquiri the former subdu the latter enerv the understand the aristotelian philosophi after destroy other system as the ottoman do their brethren by it disputati confut decid upon everyth and aristotl himself then rais up question at will in order to settl them so that everyth should be certain and decid a method now in use among hi successor the school of plato introduc sceptic first as it were in joke and ironi from their dislik to protagora hippia and other who were asham of appear not to doubt upon ani subject but the new academi dogmat in their sceptic and held it as their tenet although thi method be more honest than arbitrari decis for it follow alleg that they by no mean confound all inquiri like pyrrho and hi discipl but hold doctrin which they can follow as probabl though they can not maintain them to be true yet when the human mind ha onc despair of discov truth everyth begin to languish henc men turn asid into pleasant controversi and discuss and into a sort of wander over subject rather than sustain ani rigor investig but as we observ at first we are not to deni the author of the human sens and understand although weak but rather to furnish them with assist lxviii we have now treat of each kind of idol and their qualiti all of which must be abjur and renounc with firm and solemn resolut and the understand must be complet freed and clear of them so that the access to the kingdom of man which is found on the scienc may resembl that to the kingdom of heaven where no admiss is conced except to children lxix viciou demonstr are the muniment and support of idol and those which we possess in logic mere subject and enslav the world to human thought and thought to word but demonstr are in some manner themselv system of philosophi and scienc for such as they are and accordingli as they are regularli or improperli establish such will be the result system of philosophi and contempl but those which we employ in the whole process lead from the sens and thing to axiom and conclus are fallaci and incompet thi process is fourfold and the error are in equal number in the first place the impress of the sens are erron for they fail and deceiv us we must suppli defect by substitut and fallaci by their correct secondli notion are improperli abstract from the sens and indetermin and confus when they ought to be the revers thirdli the induct that is employ is improp for it determin the principl of scienc by simpl enumer without adopt exclus and resolut or just separ of natur lastli the usual method of discoveri and proof by first establish the most gener proposit then appli and prove the intermedi axiom accord to them is the parent of error and the calam of everi scienc but we will treat more fulli of that which we now slightli touch upon when we come to lay down the true way of interpret natur after have gone through the abov expiatori process and purif of the mind lxx but experi is by far the best demonstr provid it adher to the experi actual made for if that experi be transfer to other subject appar similar unless with proper and method caution it becom fallaci the present method of experi is blind and stupid henc men wander and roam without ani determin cours and consult mere chanc are hurri about to variou point and advanc but little—at one time they are happi at anoth their attent is distract and they alway find that they want someth further men gener make their experi carelessli and as it were in sport make some littl variat in a known experi and then if they fail they becom disgust and give up the attempt nay if they set to work more serious steadili and assidu yet they wast all their time on probe some solitari matter as gilbert on the magnet and the alchemist on gold but such conduct show their method to be no less unskil than mean for nobodi can success investig the natur of ani object by consid that object alon the inquiri must be more gener extend even when men build ani scienc and theori upon experi yet they almost alway turn with prematur and hasti zeal to practic not mere on account of the advantag and benefit to be deriv from it but in order to seiz upon some secur in a new undertak of their not employ the remaind of their labor unprofit and by make themselv conspicu to acquir a greater name for their pursuit henc like atalanta they leav the cours to pick up the golden appl interrupt their speed and give up the victori but in the true cours of experi and in extend it to new effect we should imit the divin foresight and order for god on the first day onli creat light and assign a whole day to that work without creat ani materi substanc thereon in like manner we must first by everi kind of experi elicit the discoveri of caus and true axiom and seek for experi which may afford light rather than profit axiom when rightli investig and establish prepar us not for a limit but abund practic and bring in their train whole troop of effect but we will treat hereaft of the way of experi which are not less beset and interrupt than those of judgment have spoken at present of common experi onli as a bad speci of demonstr the order of our subject now requir some mention of those extern sign of the weak in practic of the receiv system of philosophi and contempl which we refer to abov and of the caus of a circumst at first sight so wonder and incred for the knowledg of these extern sign prepar the way for assent and the explan of the caus remov the wonder and these two circumst are of materi use in extirp more easili and gentli the idol from the understand lxxi the scienc we possess have been princip deriv from the greek for the addit of the roman arab or more modern writer are but few and of small import and such as they are are found on the basi of greek invent but the wisdom of the greek wa profession and disputati and thu most advers to the investig of truth the name therefor of sophist which the contemptu spirit of those who deem themselv philosoph reject and transfer to the rhetoricians—gorgia protagora hippia polus—might well suit the whole tribe such as plato aristotl zeno epicuru theophrastu and their successors—chrysippu carnead and the rest there wa onli thi differ between them—th former were mercenari vagabond travel about to differ state make a show of their wisdom and requir pay the latter more dignifi and nobl in possess of fix habit open school and teach philosophi gratuit both howev though differ in other respect were professori and reduc everi subject to controversi establish and defend certain sect and dogma of philosophi so that their doctrin were nearli what dionysiu not unaptli object to plato the talk of idl old men to ignor youth but the more ancient greek as empedocl anaxagora leucippu democritu parmenid heraclitu xenophan philolau and the rest for i omit pythagora as be superstiti did not that we are awar open school but betook themselv to the investig of truth with greater silenc and with more sever and simplic that is with less affect and ostent henc in our opinion they act more advisedli howev their work may have been eclips in cours of time by those lighter product which better correspond with and pleas the apprehens and passion of the vulgar for time like a river bear down to us that which is light and inflat and sink that which is heavi and solid nor were even these more ancient philosoph free from the nation defect but inclin too much to the ambit and vaniti of form a sect and captiv public opinion and we must despair of ani inquiri after truth when it condescend to such trifl nor must we omit the opinion or rather propheci of an egyptian priest with regard to the greek that they would forev remain children without ani antiqu of knowledg or knowledg of antiqu for they certainli have thi in common with children that they are prone to talk and incap of gener their wisdom be loquaci and unproduct of effect henc the extern sign deriv from the origin and birthplac of our present philosophi are not favor lxxii nor are those much better which can be deduc from the charact of the time and age than the former from that of the countri and nation for in that age the knowledg both of time and of the world wa confin and meagr which is one of the worst evil for those who reli entir on experience—they had not a thousand year of histori worthi of that name but mere fabl and ancient tradit they were acquaint with but a small portion of the region and countri of the world for they indiscrimin call all nation situat far toward the north scythian all those to the west celt they knew noth of africa but the nearest part of ethiopia or of asia beyond the gang and had not even heard ani sure and clear tradit of the region of the new world besid a vast number of climat and zone in which innumer nation live and breath were pronounc by them to be uninhabit nay the travel of democritu plato and pythagora which were not extens but rather mere excurs from home were consid as someth vast but in our time mani part of the new world and everi extrem of the old are well known and the mass of experi ha been infinit increas wherefor if extern sign were to be taken from the time of the nativ or procreat as in astrolog noth extraordinari could be predict of these earli system of philosophi lxxiii of all sign there is none more certain or worthi than that of the fruit produc for the fruit and effect are the sureti and voucher as it were for the truth of philosophi now from the system of the greek and their subordin divis in particular branch of the scienc dure so long a period scarc one singl experi can be cull that ha a tendenc to elev or assist mankind and can be fairli set down to the specul and doctrin of their philosophi celsu candidli and wise confess as much when he observ that experi were first discov in medicin and that men afterward built their philosoph system upon them and search for and assign caus instead of the invers method of discov and deriv experi from philosophi and the knowledg of caus it is not therefor wonder that the egyptian who bestow divin and sacr honor on the author of new invent should have consecr more imag of brute than of men for the brute by their natur instinct made mani discoveri while men deriv but few from discuss and the conclus of reason the industri of the alchemist ha produc some effect by chanc howev and casualti or from vari their experi as mechan also do and not from ani regular art or theori the theori they have imagin rather tend to disturb than to assist experi those too who have occupi themselv with natur magic as they term it have made but few discoveri and those of small import and border on impostur for which reason in the same manner as we are caution by religion to show our faith by our work we may veri properli appli the principl to philosophi and judg of it by it work account that to be futil which is unproduct and still more so if instead of grape and oliv it yield but the thistl and thorn of disput and content lxxiv other sign may be select from the increas and progress of particular system of philosophi and the scienc for those which are found on natur grow and increas while those which are found on opinion chang and increas not if therefor the theori we have mention were not like plant torn up by the root but grew in the womb of natur and were nourish by her that which for the last two thousand year ha taken place would never have happen name that the scienc still continu in their beaten track and nearli stationari without have receiv ani import increas nay have on the contrari rather bloom under the hand of their first author and then fade away but we see that the case is revers in the mechan art which are found on natur and the light of experi for they as long as they are popular seem full of life and uninterruptedli thrive and grow be at first rude then conveni lastli polish and perpetu improv lxxv there is yet anoth sign if such it may be term be rather an evid and one of the strongest natur name the actual confess of those veri author whom men now follow for even they who decid on thing so daringli yet at time when they reflect betak themselv to complaint about the subtil of natur the obscur of thing and the weak of man wit if they would mere do thi they might perhap deter those who are of a timid disposit from further inquiri but would excit and stimul those of a more activ and confid turn to further advanc they are not howev satisfi with confess so much of themselv but consid everyth which ha been either unknown or unattempt by themselv or their teacher as beyond the limit of possibl and thu with most consumm pride and envi convert the defect of their own discoveri into a calumni on natur and a sourc of despair to everi one els henc aros the new academi which openli profess sceptic and consign mankind to etern dark henc the notion that form or the true differ of thing which are in fact the law of simpl action are beyond man reach and can not possibl be discov henc those notion in the activ and oper branch that the heat of the sun and of fire are total differ so as to prevent men from suppos that they can elicit or form by mean of fire anyth similar to the oper of natur and again that composit onli is the work of man and mixtur of natur so as to prevent men from expect the gener or transform of natur bodi by art men will therefor easili allow themselv to be persuad by thi sign not to engag their fortun and labor in specul which are not onli desper but actual devot to desper lxxvi nor should we omit the sign afford by the great dissens formerli preval among philosoph and the varieti of school which suffici show that the way wa not well prepar that lead from the sens to the understand sinc the same groundwork of philosophi name the natur of thing wa torn and divid into such wide differ and multifari error and although in these day the dissens and differ of opinion with regard to first principl and entir system are nearli extinct yet there remain innumer question and controversi with regard to particular branch of philosophi so that it is manifest that there is noth sure or sound either in the system themselv or in the method of demonstr lxxvii with regard to the supposit that there is a gener unanim as to the philosophi of aristotl becaus the other system of the ancient ceas and becam obsolet on it promulg and noth better ha been sinc discov whenc it appear that it is so well determin and found as to have unit the suffrag of both age we will observe—st that the notion of other ancient system have ceas after the public of the work of aristotl is fals for the work of the ancient philosoph subsist long after that event even to the time of cicero and the subsequ age but at a later period when human learn had as it were been wreck in the inund of barbarian into the roman empir then the system of aristotl and plato were preserv in the wave of age like plank of a lighter and less solid natur d the notion of unanim on a clear inspect is found to be fallaci for true unanim is that which proce from a free judgment arriv at the same conclus after an investig of the fact now by far the greater number of those who have assent to the philosophi of aristotl have bound themselv down to it from prejudic and the author of other so that it is rather obsequi and concurr than unanim but even if it were real and extens unanim so far from be esteem a true and solid confirm it should even lead to a violent presumpt to the contrari for there is no wors auguri in intellectu matter than that deriv from unanim with the except of divin and polit where suffrag are allow to decid for noth pleas the multitud unless it strike the imagin or bind down the understand as we have observ abov with the shackl of vulgar notion henc we may well transfer phocion remark from moral to the intellect that men should immedi examin what error or fault they have commit when the multitud concur with and applaud them thi then is one of the most unfavor sign all the sign therefor of the truth and sound of the receiv system of philosophi and the scienc are unpropiti whether taken from their origin their fruit their progress the confess of their author or from unanim lxxviii we now come to the caus of error and of such persever in them for age these are suffici numer and power to remov all wonder that what we now offer should have so long been conceal from and have escap the notic of mankind and to render it more worthi of astonish that it should even now have enter ani one mind or becom the subject of hi thought and that it should have done so we consid rather the gift of fortun than of ani extraordinari talent and as the offspr of time rather than wit but in the first place the number of age is reduc to veri narrow limit on a proper consider of the matter for out of twentyf centuri with which the memori and learn of man are convers scarc six can be set apart and select as fertil in scienc and favor to it progress for there are desert and wast in time as in countri and we can onli reckon up three revolut and epoch of philosophi the greek the roman our own that is the philosophi of the western nation of europ and scarc two centuri can with justic be assign to each the intermedi age of the world were unfortun both in the quantiti and rich of the scienc produc nor need we mention the arab or the scholast philosophi which in those age ground down the scienc by their numer treatis more than they increas their weight the first caus then of such insignific progress in the scienc is rightli refer to the small proport of time which ha been favor thereto lxxix a second caus offer itself which is certainli of the greatest import name that in those veri age in which men wit and literatur flourish consider or even moder but a small part of their industri wa bestow on natur philosophi the great mother of the scienc for everi art and scienc torn from thi root may perhap be polish and put into a servic shape but can admit of littl growth it is well known that after the christian religion had been acknowledg and arriv at matur by far the best wit were busi upon theolog where the highest reward offer themselv and everi speci of assist wa abundantli suppli and the studi of which wa the princip occup of the western european nation dure the third epoch the rather becaus literatur flourish about the veri time when controversi concern religion first began to bud forth in the preced age dure the second epoch that of the roman philosoph medit and labor wa chiefli occupi and wast in moral philosophi the theolog of the heathen besid the greatest mind in these time appli themselv to civil affair on account of the magnitud of the roman empir which requir the labor of mani the age dure which natur philosophi appear princip to flourish among the greek wa but a short period sinc in the more ancient time the seven sage with the except of thale appli themselv to moral philosophi and polit and at a later period after socrat had brought down philosophi from heaven to earth moral philosophi becam more preval and divert men attent from natur nay the veri period dure which physic inquiri flourish wa corrupt and render useless by contradict and the ambit of new opinion sinc therefor dure these three epoch natur philosophi ha been materi neglect or imped it is not at all surpris that men should have made but littl progress in it see they were attend to an entir differ matter lxxx add to thi that natur philosophi especi of late ha seldom gain exclus possess of an individu free from all other pursuit even among those who have appli themselv to it unless there may be an exampl or two of some monk studi in hi cell or some nobleman in hi villa she ha rather been made a passag and bridg to other pursuit thu ha thi great mother of the scienc been degrad most unworthili to the situat of a handmaid and made to wait upon medicin or mathemat oper and to wash the immatur mind of youth and imbu them with a first dye that they may afterward be more readi to receiv and retain anoth in the meantim let no one expect ani great progress in the scienc especi their oper part unless natur philosophi be appli to particular scienc and particular scienc again refer back to natur philosophi for want of thi astronomi optic music mani mechan art medicin itself and what perhap is more wonder moral and polit philosophi and the logic scienc have no depth but onli glide over the surfac and varieti of thing becaus these scienc when they have been onc partit out and establish are no longer nourish by natur philosophi which would have impart fresh vigor and growth to them from the sourc and genuin contempl of motion ray sound textur and conform of bodi and the affect and capac of the understand but we can littl wonder that the scienc grow not when separ from their root lxxxi there is anoth power and great caus of the littl advanc of the scienc which is thi it is imposs to advanc properli in the cours when the goal is not properli fix but the real and legitim goal of the scienc is the endow of human life with new invent and rich the great crowd of teacher know noth of thi but consist of dictatori hirel unless it so happen that some artisan of an acut geniu and ambiti of fame give up hi time to a new discoveri which is gener attend with a loss of properti the major so far from propos to themselv the augment of the mass of art and scienc make no other use of an inquiri into the mass alreadi befor them than is afford by the convers of it to some use in their lectur or to gain or to the acquir of a name and the like but if one out of the multitud be found who court scienc from real zeal and on hi own account even he will be seen rather to follow contempl and the varieti of theori than a sever and strict
