that then i will endeavor to make myself as good a neighbor and as social a friend as they can wish me to be on sunday i had a visit from the two hartley they gave me veri satisfactori proof of what they were abl to do as well as will in support of the right of the mansfield to the estat of which they have been despoil and show me a paper which nobodi thought wa in be of the utmost consequ in the caus on monday by appoint i attend sir john lambton two lawyer of the keel were with him they produc their demand i had mine readi but their were so extravag that i would not produc them but take sir john asid i love not said i to affront men of a profess but i am convinc that we never shall come to an understand if we consid ourselv as lawyer and client i am no lawyer but i know the strength of my friend caus and will risqu half my estat upon the justic of it the mansfield will commiss me if the keel will you and we perhap may do someth if not let the law take it cours i am now come to resid in england i will do noth for myself till i have done what can be done to make all my friend easi sir john own that he thought the mansfield had hardship done them mr keel senior he said had heard of the paper in the hartley hand and prais hi honesti told me in confid that he had declar that if such a paper could have been produc in time he would not have prosecut the suit which he had carri but sir john said that the younger keel wa a furiou young man and would oppos a compromis on the term he suppos the mansfield would expect to be compli with but what are your propos sir these sir john the law is expens delay may be medit appeal may be brought if we gain our point what i think it may cost us to establish the right of the injur which can not be a small sum that will i prevail upon the mansfield to give up to the keel i will trust you if you give me your honor with our proof and if you and your friend are satisfi with them and will consent to establish our right by the form onli of a new trial then may we be agre otherwis not and i leav you and them to consid of it i shall hear from you within two or three day sir john promis i should but hope to have some talk first with the hartley with whom as well as with me he declar he would be upon honor wednesday even i had a messag from sir john last night request me to dine with him and the elder mr keel thi day and to bring with me the two mr hartley and the proof i had hint at those gentlemen were so oblig as to go with me and took the import paper with them which had been deposit with their grandfath as a common friend and contain a recognit of the mansfield right to the estat in question upon an amic refer to person long sinc depart an attest copi of which wa onc in the mansfield possess as by a memorandum that came to hand but which never could be found the younger keel wa not intend to be there but he forc himself upon us he behav veri rude i had onc like to have forgot myself thi meet produc noth but as the father is a reason man as we have obtain a rehear of the caus as he is much influenc by sir john lambton who seem convinc and to whose honor i have submit an abstract of our proof i am in hope that we shall be abl to accommod i have bolton propos befor me the first child is dead the second can not live mani month he trembl at the proof he know we have of hi villaini he offer on the death of thi second child to give us possess of the estat and a larg sum of money but thought not to be half of what the superannu calvert left if we will give him gener releas the wretch is not we believ marri to the relict of calvert i am loath methink to let him escap the justic which hi crime call for but such are the delay and chicaneri of the law when practis are found who know how to perplex an honest pursuer and as we must have recours to low and dirti peopl to establish our proof the vile fellow shall take with him the propos spoil they may not be much more than would be the lawyer part of the estat were we to push the litig as to our poor everard noth i fear can be done for him with the men who are revel on hi spoil i have seen one of them the unhappi man ha sign and seal to hi own ruin he regret that a part of the estat which ha been so long in the famili and name should go out of it what an empti pride is that of name the gener tenor of hi life wa not a credit to it though he felt not that till he felt distress the disgrac is actual incur doe not all the world know hi loss and the winner triumph and if the world did not can he conceal from himself those vice the consequ of which have reduc him to what he is but perhap the unhappi man put a valu upon the name in compliment to me mention not to him what i write the poor man is sensibl enough of hi folli to engag piti whether from a right sens or not must be left to hi own heart as to the woman claim what in honor can i do against a promis that he own may be prove upon him he did not condit with her that she wa to be a spotless woman if he thought she wa so when he solicit her to yield to hi desir he is the less to be excus vile as she come out to be he had propos to make her as vile if he had found her not so he promis her marriag meant he onli a promis she is punish in be what she is hi punish can not be condign but by hi be oblig to perform hi promis yet i can not bear to think that my cousin grandison should be made for life the dupe of a success and premedit villaini and the less as in all likelihood the proflig lord b would continu to himself from the merit with her of have vindic her claim an interest in the bad woman favor were she to be the wife of our poor everard but certainli thi claim must be prosecut with a view onli to extort money from my cousin and they know him to be of a famili jealou of it honor i think she must be treat with for releas i could not bear to appear in such a caus as thi in open court in support of my cousin against a promis made by him he is of age and thought to be no novic in the way of the town i am mistaken in mr grandison spirit if it did not lead him to think himself veri sever punish were he to have no other punish for those vice which were to be expens to me but if i should be abl to extric the unhappi man from thi difficulti what can next be done for him the poor remain of hi fortun will not support one who ha alway live more than genteelli will he be abl think you to endur the thought of live in a constant state of depend howev easi and genteel i should endeavor to make it to him there may be mani way in the public offic for exampl of provid for a broken tradesman but for a man who call himself and is a gentleman who will expect as such to rank with hi employ who know noth of figur or busi of ani kind who ha been brought up in idl and hardli know the mean of the word dilig and never could bear confin what can be done for such a one in the public offic or by ani other employ that requir punctual attend but to quit thi subject for a more agreeabl one i have for some time had it in my thought to ask you my dear friend whether your nephew is provid for to your like and hi own if not and he would put it in my power to

with me in their favor and camilla who wa ever full of your prais teaz me continu they name not the man they pretend to leav me free to choos through the world they plead that zealou as they are in the cathol faith they were so earnest for me to enter into the state that they were desir to see me the wife even of a protest rather than i should remain singl and they remind me that it wa owe to my scrupl onli that thi wa not effect but whi whi will they weaken rather than strengthen my scrupl could i have got over three point the sens of my own unworthi after my mind had been disturb the

content of the lerter you have honor me with what a task have you impos upon me you take great and respect your intent i will call it kind care to let me know that i can have no interest in the decis of the case you refer to me i repeat my humbl acquiesc but must again declar that it would have been next to imposs to do so had you not made a point of conscienc of your scrupl but what weight is my advic like to have with a young ladi who repeatedli in the close of her letter desir me not to give it for her parent i madam am far from be unprejud in thi case for can the man who onc himself hope for the honor of your hand advis you against marriag are not your parent gener indulg when they name not ani particular person to you i applaud both their wisdom and their good on thi occas possibl you guess the man whom they would recommend to your choic and i am sure ladi clementina would not refus their recommend mere becaus it wa their nor inde upon ani less reason than an unconquer avers or a prefer to some other cathol a protest it seem it can not be but let me ask my sister my friend what answer can i return to the ladi who had shown in one instanc that she had not an insuper avers to matrimoni yet on conscienti reason refus one man and not particularli favor ani can scrupl to oblig obey is not the word they use a father who with tear in hi eye beseech her a mother who gentli remind her of what she ha suffer for her who declar that it is in her power to make the rest of her day happi and who urg a still stronger plea respect them both and the whole famili to engag the attent of the belov daughter o madam what plea are those let me still make use of your own pathet word from a father whose eye plead more strongli than word and from a mother over whose bright day you had though involuntarili cast a cloud your brother the bishop a man of pieti your confssor a man of equal pieti your two other brother your disinterest friend mr beaumont your faith camilla all wholli disinterest what an enumer against yourself forbidden as i am to give the caus against you what can i say dearest ladi clementina can i on your own represent give it for you you know madam the sacrific i have made to the plea of your conscienc not my own i make no doubt but parent so indulg as your will yield to your reason if you can plead conscienc against the perform of the filial duti the more a duti as it is so gentli urg nay hardli urg but by tear and wish which the eye not the lip express and which if you will perform your parent will think themselv under an oblig to their child ladi clementina is one of the most gener of women but consid madam in thi instanc of prefer your own will to that of the most indulg of parent whether there is not an appar selfish inconsist with your gener charact even were you to be as happi in a convent as you propos would you not in that case live to yourself and renounc your parent and famili as part of that world which you would vow to despis dear ladi i ask you onc befor is there ani thing sin in a sacrament such all good cathol deem matrimoni and shall i ask you whether as selfdeni is held to be meritori in your church there is not a merit in deni yourself in the case befor us when you can by perform the filial duti oblig your whole famili permit me to say that though a protest i am not an enemi to such foundat in gener i could wish under proper regul that we had nunneneri among us i would not inde have the oblig upon nun be perpetu let them have liberti at the end of everi two or three year to renew their vow or otherwis by the consent of friend celibaci in the clergi is an indispens law of your church yet a cardin ha been allow to lay down the purpl and marri you know madam i must mean ferdinand of medici familyreason in that case preponder as well at rome as at florenc of all the women i know ladi clementina della porretta should be the last who should be earnest to take the veil there can be but two person in the world besid herself who will not be griev at her choic we know their reason the will of her grandfath now with god is against her and her live parent and everi other person of her famili those two except would be made unhappi if she sequest herself from the world and them clementina ha chariti she wish she onc said to take a great reveng upon laurana laurana ha someth to repent of let her take the veil the fond she ha for the world a fond which could make her break through all the tie of relat and human requir a check but are ani of those in convent more piou more exemplari piou than clementina is out of them much more could i urg on the same side of the question but what i have urg ha been a task upon me a task which i could not have perform had i not prefer to my own the happi of you and your famili may both earthli and heavenli bless attend your determin whatev it be pray dearest madam your everfaith friend affection brother and humbl servant chapter grandison letter v sir

a possibl though not a probabl that she might chang her mind in my favor i foresaw that you would all join for familyreason to press her to marri and when thought i she find herself veri earnestli urg it is possibl that she will forego her scrupl and propos some condit for herself will honor with her hand the man whom she ha avowedli honor with a place in her heart rather than ani other the maladi she ha been afflict with often leav for some time an unsteadi in the mind my absenc as i propos to settl in my nativ countri never more perhap to return to itali the high notion she ha of oblig and gratitud her declar confid in my honor and affect all cooper she may thought i chang her mind and if she doe i can not doubt the favor of her friend it wa not my jeronymo presumptu to hope it wa justic to clementina to attend the event and to wait for the promis letter but now that i see you are all of one mind and that the dear ladi though vehement urg by all her friend to marri some other man can appeal to me onli as to her fourth brother and a man not interest in the event i give up all my hope i have written accordingli to your dear clementina but it could not be expect that i should give the argument all the weight that might be given it yet be of opinion that she wa in duti oblig to yield to the entreati of all her friend i have been honest but sure no man ever wa involv in so mani difficult situat as your grandison who yet never by enterpris or rash wa led out of the plain path into difficulti so uncommon you wish my dear friend that i would set an exampl to your excel sister i will unbosom my heart to you there is a ladi an english ladi beauti as an angel but whose beauti is her least perfect either in my eye or her own had i never known clementina i could not have love her and onli her of all the women i ever beheld it would not be do her justic if i could not say i do love her but with a flame as pure as the heart of clementina or as her own heart can boast clementina distress mind affect me i imput her suffer to her esteem for me the farewel interview deni her she demonstr i thought so firm an affect for me at the same time that she wa to me what i may truli call a first love that tho the difficulti in my way seem insuper i thought it becam me in honor in gratitud to hold myself in suspens and not offer to make my address to ani other woman till the destini of the dear clementina wa determin it would look like vaniti in me to tell my jeronymo how mani propos from the partial friend of women of rank and merit superior to my own i thought myself oblig in honor to the ladi themselv to declin but my heart never suffer uneasi from the uncertainti i wa in of ever succeed with your belov sister but on thi ladi account i presum not howev to say i could have succeed had i thought myself at liberti to make my address to her yet when i suffer myself to balanc becaus of my uncertainti with your clementina i had hope from the interest my two sister had with her her affect disengag that had i been at liberti to make my address to her i might shall i my dear jeronymo own the truth the two noblestmind women in the world when i went over to itali on the invit of my lord the bishop held almost an equal interest in my heart and i wa therebi enabl justli and with the greater command of myself to declar to the marchio and the gener at my last go over that i held myself bound to you but that your sister and you all were free but when the dear clementina began to show sign of recoveri and seem to confirm the hope i had of her partial to me and my gratitud and attach seem of import to her complet restor then my jeronymo did i content myself with wish anoth husband to the english ladi more worthi of her than my embarass situat could have made me and when i farther experienc the condescend good of your whole famili all unit in my favor i had not a wish but for your clementina what a disappoint my jeronymo wa her reject of me oblig as i wa to admir the nobl ladi the more for her motiv of reject me and now my dear friend what is your wish that i shall set your sister an exampl how can i is marriag in my power there is but one woman in the world now your dear clementina ha refus me that i can think worthi of succeed her in my affect though there are thousand of whom i am not worthi and ought that ladi to accept of a man whose heart had been anoth and that other live and singl and still honor him with so much of her regard as may be thought suffici to attach a grate heart and occas a divid love clementina herself is not more truli delic than thi ladi inde jeronymo i am readi when i contempl my situat on a supposit of make my address to her to give up myself as the unworthiest of her favor of all the men i know and she ha for an admir almost everi man who see her even olivia admir her can i do justic to the merit of both and yet not appear to be divid by a doubl love for i will own to all the world my affect for clementina

not resolv in that case to tri at least to make myself easi and give up to her prior and worthier claim and i should consid her effort though unsuccess as have entitl her to my highest esteem to what we know to be right we ought to submit the more difficult the more meritori and in thi case your harriet would conquer or die if she conquer she would then in that instanc be greater than even

content may be gather from what she here say of them i am veri proud of them both perhap too proud and it may be necessari that i should be pull down though i expect it not from my charlott to be compliment in so nobl and sincer a manner as you will see i am with the power of lay an oblig on him instead of owe it to hi compassion consider for a creatur so long labor in suspens and then despair that her hope could be answer is enough at the same time to flatter her vaniti and gratifi the most delic sensibl you will see how grate he take my grandmamma hint that i knew how by experi to account for a doubl a divid love as she is pleas to call it and the prefer my aunt and herself and i have given to the claim of ladi clementina you my dear know our sincer in thi particular there is some merit in own a truth when it make against us to do justic in anoth case against one self is methink make at least a second merit for one self he ask my leav to attend me at selbyhous i should rejoic to see him but i could wish methink that he had first receiv letter from abroad but how can i hint my wish to him without impli either doubt or reserv reserv in the delay of hi visit impli by such

such as oblig him to balanc but in thought and i could know it i would die befor i would accept of hi hand he ha confirm and establish as i may say my pride i had alway some by the distinct he ha
