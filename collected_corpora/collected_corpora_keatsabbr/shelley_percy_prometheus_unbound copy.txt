the play at the end of the volum prefac the greek tragic writer in select as their subject ani portion of their nation histori or mytholog employ in their treatment of it a certain arbitrari discret they by no mean conceiv themselv bound to adher to the common interpret or to imit in stori as in titl their rival and predecessor such a system would have amount to a resign of those claim to prefer over their competitor which incit the composit the agamemnonian stori wa exhibit on the athenian theatr with as mani variat as drama i have presum to employ a similar licens the prometheu unbound of aeschylu suppos the reconcili of jupit with hi victim as the price of the disclosur of the danger threaten to hi empir by the consumm of hi marriag with theti theti accord to thi view of the subject wa given in marriag to peleu and prometheu by the permiss of jupit deliv from hi captiv by hercul had i frame my stori on thi model i should have done no more than have attempt to restor the lost drama of aeschylu an ambit which if my prefer to thi mode of treat the subject had incit me to cherish the recollect of the high comparison such an attempt would challeng might well abat but in truth i wa avers from a catastroph so feebl as that of reconcil the champion with the oppressor of mankind the moral interest of the fabl which is so power sustain by the suffer and endur of prometheu would be annihil if we could conceiv of him as unsay hi high languag and quail befor hi success and perfidi adversari the onli imaginari be resembl in ani degre prometheu is satan and prometheu is in my judgement a more poetic charact than satan becaus in addit to courag and majesti and firm and patient opposit to omnipot forc he is suscept of be describ as exempt from the taint of ambit envi reveng and a desir for person aggrandis which in the hero of paradis lost interfer with the interest the charact of satan engend in the mind a pernici casuistri which lead us to weigh hi fault with hi wrong and to excus the former becaus the latter exceed all measur in the mind of those who consid that magnific fiction with a religi feel it engend someth wors but prometheu is as it were the type of the highest perfect of moral and intellectu natur impel by the purest and the truest motiv to the best and noblest end thi poem wa chiefli written upon the mountain ruin of the bath of caracalla among the floweri glade and thicket of odorifer blossom tree which are extend in ever wind labyrinth upon it immens platform and dizzi arch suspend in the air the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigor awaken spring in that divinest climat and the new life with which it drench the spirit even to intox were the inspir of thi drama the imageri which i have employ will be found in mani instanc to have been drawn from the oper of the human mind or from those extern action by which they are express thi is unusu in modern poetri although dant and shakespear are full of instanc of the same kind dant inde more than ani other poet and with greater success but the greek poet as writer to whom no resourc of awaken the sympathi of their contemporari wa unknown were in the habitu use of thi power and it is the studi of their work sinc a higher merit would probabl be deni me to which i am will that my reader should imput thi singular one word is due in candour to the degre in which the studi of contemporari write may have ting my composit for such ha been a topic of censur with regard to poem far more popular and inde more deservedli popular than mine it is imposs that ani one who inhabit the same age with such writer as those who stand in the foremost rank of our own can conscienti assur himself that hi languag and tone of thought may not have been modifi by the studi of the product of those extraordinari intellect it is true that not the spirit of their geniu but the form in which it ha manifest itself are due less to the peculiar of their own mind than to the peculiar of the moral and intellectu condit of the mind among which they have been produc thu a number of writer possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleg they imit becaus the former is the endow of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommun lightn of their own mind the peculiar style of intens and comprehens imageri which distinguish the modern literatur of england ha not been as a gener power the product of the imit of ani particular writer the mass of capabl remain at everi period materi the same the circumst which awaken it to action perpetu chang if england were divid into forti republ each equal in popul and extent to athen there is no reason to suppos but that under institut not more perfect than those of athen each would produc philosoph and poet equal to those who if we except shakespear have never been surpass we owe the great writer of the golden age of our literatur to that fervid awaken of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppress form of the christian religion we owe milton to the progress and develop of the same spirit the sacr milton wa let it ever be rememb a republican and a bold inquir into moral and religion the great writer of our own age are we have reason to suppos the companion and forerunn of some unimagin chang in our social condit or the opinion which cement it the cloud of mind is discharg it collect lightn and the equilibrium between institut and opinion is now restor or is about to be restor as to imit poetri is a mimet art it creat but it creat by combin and represent poetic abstract are beauti and new not becaus the portion of which they are compos had no previou exist in the mind of man or in natur but becaus the whole produc by their combin ha some intellig and beauti analog with those sourc of emot and thought and with the contemporari condit of them one great poet is a masterpiec of natur which anoth not onli ought to studi but must studi he might as wise and as easili determin that hi mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is love in the visibl univers as exclud from hi contempl the beauti which exist in the write of a great contemporari the pretenc of do it would be a presumpt in ani but the greatest the effect even in him would be strain unnatur and ineffectu a poet is the combin product of such intern power as modifi the natur of other and of such extern influenc as excit and sustain these power he is not one but both everi man mind is in thi respect modifi by all the object of natur and art by everi word and everi suggest which he ever admit to act upon hi conscious it is the mirror upon which all form are reflect and in which they compos one form poet not otherwis than philosoph painter sculptor and musician are in one sens the creator and in anoth the creation of their age from thi subject the loftiest do not escap there is a similar between homer and hesiod between aeschylu and euripid between virgil and horac between dant and petrarch between shakespear and fletcher between dryden and pope each ha a gener resembl under which their specif distinct are arrang if thi similar be the result of imit i am will to confess that i have imit let thi opportun be conced to me of acknowledg that i have what a scotch philosoph characterist term a passion for reform the world what passion incit him to write and publish hi book he omit to explain for my part i had rather be damn with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthu but it is a mistak to suppos that i dedic my poetic composit sole to the direct enforc of reform or that i consid them in ani degre as contain a reason system on the theori of human life didact poetri is my abhorr noth can be equal well express in prose that is not tediou and supererogatori in vers my purpos ha hitherto been simpli to familiaris the highli refin imagin of the more select class of poetic reader with beauti ideal of moral excel awar that until the mind can love and admir and trust and hope and endur reason principl of moral conduct are seed cast upon the highway of life which the unconsci passeng trampl into dust although they would bear the harvest of hi happi should i live to accomplish what i purpos that is produc a systemat histori of what appear to me to be the genuin element of human societi let not the advoc of injustic and superstit flatter themselv that i should take aeschylu rather than plato as my model the have spoken of myself with unaffect freedom will need littl apolog with the candid and let the uncandid consid that they injur me less than their own heart and mind by misrepresent whatev talent a person may possess to amus and instruct other be they ever so inconsider he is yet bound to exert them if hi attempt be ineffectu let
