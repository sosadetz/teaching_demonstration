to mark the distanc in the long perspect of arch rather than to enlighten the gloomi solitud but no sound not even of a whisper stole along the pavement they cross to a side door commun with the court

a few moment longer in the cave they should have been surpris by those devote some one of whom howev it appear possibl might wander into thi avenu and still interrupt their escap when vivaldi told hi apprehens jeronimo with an arch sneer affirm there wa no danger of that for the passag he ad is known onli to the brother of the convent vivaldi doubt vanish when he further understood that the avenu led onli from the cliff without to the cave and wa use for the purpos of convey secretli to the shrine such articl as were judg necessari to excit the superstiti wonder of the devote while he proceed in thought silenc a distant chime sound hollowli through the chamber of the rock the mattinbel strike said jeronimo in seem alarm i am summon signora quicken your step an unnecessari request for

to prevail with jeronimo to unfasten the gate her effort were howev follow by a long alterc but at length the art or the innoc of the brother appeas vivaldi who now endeavor to forc the gate while jeronimo in vain repres it strength and the certain ruin that must fall upon himself if it should be discov he had concur in destroy it the gate wa immov but as no other chanc of escap appear vivaldi

mysteri and alarm said in a low voic signor as i kept watch under the almond tree who should i see mount up the road from the valley yonder but the two barefoot carmelit that over took us in the pass of chiari i lost them again behind the wood but i dare say they are come thi way for the moment they spi out thi dairyhut they will guess someth good is to be had here and the shepherd would believ their flock would all die if i see them at thi moment emerg from the wood said vivaldi and now they are leav the road and cross thi way where is our host paulo he is without at a littl distanc signor shall i call him ye repli vivaldi or stay i will call him myself yet if they see me aye signor or for that matter if they see me but we can not help ourselv now for if we call the host we shall betray ourselv and if we do not call him he will betray us so they must find us out be it as it may peac peac let me think a moment said vivaldi while vivaldi undertook to think paulo wa peep about for a hide place if occas should requir one call our host immedi said vivaldi i must speak with him he pass the lattic at thi instant said ellena paulo obey and the shepherd enter the cabin my good friend said vivaldi i must entreat that you will not admit those friar whom you see come thi way nor suffer them to know what guest you have they have been veri troublesom to us alreadi on the road i will reward you for ani loss their sudden departur may occas you nay for that matter friend said paulo it is their visit onli that can occas you loss beg the signor pardon their departur never occas loss to ani bodi and to tell you the truth for my master will not speak out we were oblig to look pretti sharpli about us while they bore us compani or we have reason to think our pocket would have been the lighter they are design peopl friend take my word for it banditti perhap in disguis the dress of a carmelit would suit their purpos at thi time of the pilgrimag so be pretti blunt with them if they want to come in here and you will do well when they go to send somebodi to watch which way they take and see them clear off or you may lose a stray lamb perhap the old shepherd lift up hi eye and hand to see how the world goe said he but thank you maestro for your warn they shall not come within my threshold for all their holi seem and it the first time in my life i ever said nay to one of their garb and mine ha been a pretti long one as you may guess perhap by my face how old signor should you take me to be i warrant you will guess short of the matter though for on these high mountain i will guess when you have dismiss the travel said vivaldi after have given them some hasti refresh without they must be almost at the door by thi time dispatch friend if they should fall foul upon me for refus them entranc said the shepherd you will come out to help me signor for my lad are at some distanc vivaldi assur him that they would and he left the cabin paulo ventur to peep at the lattic on what might be go forward without they are gone round to the door signor i fanci said he for i see noth of them thi way if there wa but anoth window what foolish peopl to build a cottag with no window near the door but i must listen he step on tipto to the door and bent hi head in attent they are certainli spi from the monasteri said ellena to vivaldi they follow us so close if they were pilgrim it is improb too that their way should be through thi unfrequ region and still more so that they should not travel in a larger parti when my absenc wa discov these peopl were sent no doubt in pursuit of me and have met the devote whom we pass they were enabl to follow our rout we shall do well to act upon thi supposit repli vivaldi but though i am inclin to believ them emissari from san stefano it is not improb that they are onli carmelit return to some convent on the lake of celano i can not hear a syllabl signor said paulo pray do listen yourself and there is not a singl chink in thi door to afford one consol well if ever i build a cottag there shall be a window near listen said vivaldi not a singl word signor cri paulo after a paus i do not even hear a voic but now i hear step and they are come to the door too they shall find it no easi matter to open it though he ad place himself against it ay ay you may knock friend till your arm ach and kick and lay about you no matter for that silenc let us know who it is said vivaldi and the old shepherd voic wa heard without they are gone signor said he you may open the door which way did they go ask vivaldi when the man enter i can not say as to that signor becaus i did not happen to see them at all and i have been look all about too whi i saw them myself cross thi way from the wood yonder said paulo and there is noth to shelter them from our view between the wood and thi cottag friend ad vivaldi what can they have done with themselv for that matter gone into the wood again perhap said the shepherd paulo gave hi master a signific look and ad it is like enough friend and you may depend upon it they are lurk there for no good purpos you will do well to send somebodi to look after them your flock will suffer for it els depend upon it they design no good we are not use to such sort of folk in these part repli the shepherd but if they mean ani harm they shall find we can help ourselv as her conclud he took down a horn from the roof and blew a shrill blast that made the mountain echo when immedi the younger shepherd were seen run from variou quarter toward the cottag do not be alarm friend said vivaldi these travel mean you no harm i dare say whatev they may design against us but as i think them suspici person and should not like to overtak them on the road i will reward one of your lad if you will let him go a littl way toward celano and examin whether they are lurk on that rout the old man consent and when the shepherd came up one of them receiv direct from vivaldi and be sure you do not return till you have found them ad paulo no master repli the lad and i will bring them safe here you may trust me if you do friend you will get your head broke for your troubl you are onli to discov where they are and to watch where they go said paulo vivaldi at length made the lad comprehend what wa requir of him and he depart while the old shepherd went out to keep guard the time of hi absenc wa pass in variou conjectur by the parti in the cabin concern the carmelit vivaldi still inclin to believ they were honest peopl return from a pilgrimag but paulo wa decidedli against thi opinion they are wait for us on the road you may depend upon it signor said the latter you may be certain they have some great design in hand or they would never have turn their step from thi dairyhous when onc they had spi it and that they did spi it we are sure but if they have in hand the great design you speak of paulo said vivaldi it is probabl that they have spi us also by their take thi obscur road now it must have occur to them when they saw a dairyhut in so solitari a region that we might probabl be found within yet they have not examin it appear therefor they have no design against us what can you answer to thi paulo i trust the apprehens of signora di rosalba are unsound whi do you suppos signor they would attack us when we were safe hous and had these good shepherd to lend us a help hand no signor they would not even have shown themselv if they could have help it and be onc sure we were here they would skulk back to the wood and lurk for us in the road they knew we must go sinc as it happen there is onli one how is it possibl said ellena that they can have discov us here sinc they did not approach the cabin to enquir they came near enough for their purpos signora i dare say and if the truth were known they spi my face look at them through the lattic come come said vivaldi you are an ingeni tormentor inde paulo do you suppos they saw enough of thi face last night by moonlight in that duski glen to enabl them to recollect it again at a distanc of forti yard reviv my ellena i think everi appear is in our favor would i could think so too said she with a sigh o for that matter signora rejoin paulo there is noth to be afraid of they should find tough work of it if they thought proper to attack us ladi it is not an open attack that we have to fear repli ellena but they may surround us with their snare and defi resist howev vivaldi might acced to the truth of thi remark he would not appear to do so but tri to laugh away her apprehens and paulo wa silenc for a while by a signific look from hi master the shepherd boy return much sooner than they had expect and he probabl save hi time that he might spare hi labor for he brought no intellig of the carmelit i look for them among the wood along the road side in the hollow yonder too said the lad and then i mount the hill further on but i could see noth of them far or near nor of a singl soul except our goat and some of them do stray wide enough sometim they lead me a fine danc often they sometim signor have wander as far as mont nuvola yonder and got to the top of it up among the cloud and the crag where i should break my neck if i climb and the rogu seem to know it too for when they have seen me come scrambl up puf and blow they have ceas their caper and stood peep over a crag so sli and so quiet it seem as if they were laugh at me as much as to say catch us if you can vivaldi who dure the latter part of thi speech had been consult with ellena whether they should proceed on their way immedi ask the boy some further question concern the carmelit and becom convinc that they had either not taken the road to celano or have taken it were at a consider distanc he propos set out and proceed leisur for i have now littl apprehens of these peopl he ad and a great deal lest night should over take us befor we reach the place of our destin sinc the road is mountain and wild and further we are not perfectli acquaint with it ellena approv the plan they took leav of the good shepherd who could with difficulti be prevail with to accept ani recompens for hi troubl and who gave them some further direct as to the road and their way wa long cheer by the sound of the tabor and the sweet of the hautboy waft over the wild when they descend into the woodi hollow mention by the boy ellena sent forth mani an anxiou look beneath the deep shade while paulo sometim silent and at other whistl and sing loudli as if to overcom hi fear peep under everi bough that cross the road expect to discov hi friend the carmelit lurk within it gloom have emerg from thi valley the road lay over mountain cover with flock for it wa now the season when they had quit the plain of apulia to feed upon the herbag for which thi region is celebr and it wa near sunset when from a summit to which the travel had long been ascend the whole lake of celano with it vast circl of mountain burst at onc upon their view ah signor exclaim paulo what a prospect is here it remind me of home it is almost as pleasant as the bay of napl i should never love it like that though if it were an hundr time finer the travel stop to admir the scene and to give their hors rest after the labor of the ascent the even sun shoot athwart a clear expans of water between eighteen and twenti leagu in circumfer light up all the town and

of napl they are worth all the rest of the prospect except inde thi fine sheet of water which is almost as good as the bay and that mountain with it sharp head which is almost as good as vesuviu if it would but throw out fire we must despair of find a mountain in thi neighborhood so good as to do that paulo said vivaldi smile at thi stroke of nation though perhap mani that we now see have onc been volcan i honor them for that signor and look at them with doubl satisfact but our mountain is the onli mountain in the world o to see it of a dark night what a blaze it make and what a height it will shoot to and what a light it throw over the sea no other mountain can do so it seem as if the wave were all on fire i have seen the reflect as far off as capri trembl all across the gulf and
