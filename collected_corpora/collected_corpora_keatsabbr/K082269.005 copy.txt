ladi margaret she wa go out for an hour or two and send again for a chair wa carri to portlandstreet she enquir for miss belfield and wa shown into a parlour where she found her drink tea with her mother and mr hobson their landlord henrietta almost scream at her sight from a sudden impuls of joy and surpris and run up to her flung her arm round her neck and embrac her with the most raptur emot but then draw back with a look of timid and shame she bash apolog for her freedom say inde dearest miss beverley it is no want of respect but i am so veri glad to see you it make me quit forget myself cecilia charm at a recept so ingenu affection soon satisfi her doubt diffid by the warmest thank that she had preserv so much regard for her and by doubl the kind with which she return her caress merci on me madam cri mr belfield who dure thi time had been busili employ in sweep the hearth wipe some slop upon the tabl and smooth her handkerchief and apron whi the girl enough to smother you henni how can you be so troublesom i never saw you behav in thi way befor miss beverley madam said henrietta again retreat is so kind as to pardon me and i wa so much surpris at see her that i hardli knew what i wa about the young ladi maam said mr hobson have a mighti way of salut one anoth till such time as they get husband and then i will warrant you they can meet without ani salut at all that is my remark at least and what i have seen of the world ha set me upon make it thi speech led cecilia to check howev artless the tender of her fervent young friend whom she wa much teiz by meet in such compani but who seem not to dare understand the frequent look which she gave her express of a wish to be alon with her come ladi continu the faceti mr hobson what if we were all to sit down and have a good dish of tea and suppos mr belfield you wa to order us a fresh round of toast and butter do you think the young ladi here would have ani object and what if we were to have a littl more water in the teakettl not forget a littl more tea in the teapot what i say is thi let us all be comfort that is my notion of thing and a veri good notion too said mr belfield for you who have noth to vex you ah maam you have heard i suppos about my son gone off nobodi know where left that lord hous where he might have live like a king and gone out into the wide world nobodi know for what inde said cecilia who from see him in london conclud he wa again with hi famili and ha he not acquaint you where he is no maam no cri mr belfield he is never onc told me where he is gone nor let me know the least about the matter for if i did i would not tast a dish of tea again for a twelvemonth till i saw him get back again to that lord and i believ in my heart there is never such anoth in the three kingdom for he ha sent here after him i dare say a score of time and no wonder for i will take upon me to say he will not find hi fellow in a hurri lord as he is as to hi be a lord said mr hobson i am one of them that lay no great stress upon that unless he ha got a good long purs of hi own and then to be sure a lord no bad thing but as to the matter of say lord such a one how do you do and lord such a one what do you want and such sort of compliment whi in my mind it is a mere noth in comparison of a good incom as to your son maam he did not go the right way to work he should have begun with busi and gone into pleasur afterward and if he had but done that i will be bold to say we might have had him at thi veri minut drink tea with us over thi firesid my son sir said mr belfield rather angrili wa anoth sort of a person than a person of busi he alway despis it from a child and come of it what may i am sure he wa born to be a gentleman as to hi despis busi said mr hobson veri contemptu whi so much the wors for busi is no such despis thing and if he had been brought up behind a counter instead of dangl after these same lord whi he might have had a hous of hi own over hi head and been as good a man as myself a hous over hi head said mr belfield whi he might have had what he would and have done what he would if he had but follow my advic and put himself a littl forward i have told him a hundr time to ask some of those great peopl he live amongst for a place at court for i know they have so mani they hardli know what to do with them and it wa alway my design from the begin that he should be someth of a great man but i never could persuad him though for ani thing i know as i have often told him if he had but had a littl courag he might have been an ambassador by thi time and now all of a sudden to be gone nobodi know where i am sorri inde said cecilia who knew not whether most to piti or wonder at her blind folli but i doubt not you will hear of him soon as to be an ambassador maam said mr hobson it is talk quit out of charact those sort of great peopl keep thing of that kind for their own poor relat and cousin what i say is thi a man best way is to take care of himself the more those great peopl see you want them the less they like your compani let everi man be brought up to busi and then when he is made hi fortun he may walk with hi hat on whi now there wa your friend maam turn to cecilia that shot out hi brain without pay ani bodi a sous pray how wa that be more genteel than stand behind a counter and not owe a shill do you think a young ladi cri mr belfield warmli can bear to hear of such a thing as stand behind a counter i am sure if my son had ever done it i should not expect ani ladi would so much as look at him and yet though i say it she might look a good while and not see mani such person let her look where she pleas and then he ha such a win manner into the bargain that i believ in my heart there is never a ladi in the land could say no to him and yet he ha such a prodigi shyness i never could make him own he had so much as ask the question and what ladi can begin first whi no said mr hobson that would be out of charact anoth way now my notion is thi let everi man be agreeabl and then he may ask what ladi he pleas and when he is a mind of a ladi he should look upon a frown or two as noth for the ladi frown in courtship as a thing of cours it is just like a man swear at a coachman whi he is not a bit more in a passion onli he think he shant be mind without it well for my part said mr belfield i am sure if i wa a young ladi and most especi if i wa a young ladi of fortun and all that i should like a modest young gentleman such as my son for exampl better by half than a bold swear young fellow that would make a point to have me whether i would or no ha ha ha cri mr hobson but the young ladi are not of that way of think they are all for a littl life and spirit dont i say right young ladi cecilia who could not but perceiv that these speech wa level at herself felt offend and tire and find she had no chanc of ani privat convers with henrietta aros to take leav but while she stop in the passag to enquir when she could see her alon a footman knock at the door who have ask if mr belfield lodg there and been answer in the affirm beg to know whether miss beverley wa then in the hous cecilia much surpris went forward and told him who she wa i have been madam said he with a messag to you at mr monckton in sohosquar but nobodi knew where you wa and mr monckton came out and spoke to me himself and said that all he could suppos wa that you might be at thi hous so he direct me to come here and from whom sir is your messag from the honor mr delvil madam in st jamesssquar he desir to know if you shall be at home on saturday morn the day after tomorrow and whether you can appoint mr brigg to meet him by twelv oclock exactli as he shant be abl to stay abov three minut cecilia gave an answer as cold as the messag that she would be in sohosquar at the time he mention and acquaint mr brigg of hi intent the footman then went away and henrietta told her that if she could call some morn she might perhap contriv to be alon with her and ad inde i wish much to see you if you could possibl do me so great an honor for i am veri miser and have nobodi to tell so ah miss beverley you that have so mani friend and that deserv as mani again you littl know what a hard thing it is to have none but my brother strang disappear ha half broke our heart cecilia wa begin a consolatori speech in which she meant to give her privat assur of hi health and safeti when she wa interrupt by mr albani who came suddenli into the passag henrietta receiv him with a look of pleasur and enquir whi he had so long been absent but surpris by the sight of cecilia he exclaim without answer her whi did thou fail me whi appoint me to a place thou were quit thyself thou thing of air profess thou inveigl of esteem thou vain delus promis of pleasur you condemn me too hastili said cecilia if i fail in my promis it wa not owe to capric or insincer but to real and bitter misfortun which incapacit me from keep it i shall soon howev nay i am alreadi at your dispos if you have ani command for me i have alway answer he command for the rich for i have alway compass for the poor come to me then at mr monckton in sohosquar cri she and hasten into her chair impati to end a confer which she saw excit the wonder of the servant and which also now drew out from the parlour mr hobson and mr belfield she then kiss her hand to henrietta and order the chairmen to carri her home it had not been without difficulti that she had restrain herself from mention what she knew of belfield when she found hi mother and sister in a state of such pain uncertainti concern him but her utter ignor of hi plan join to her undoubt knowledg of hi wish of conceal made her fear do mischief by offici and think it wiser not to betray what she had seen of him till better inform of hi own view and intent yet will to shorten a suspens so uneasi to them she determin to entreat mr monckton would endeavor to find him out and acquaint him with their anxieti that gentleman when she return to hi hous wa in a state of mind by no mean enviabl miss her at tea he had ask miss bennet where she wa and hear she had not left word he could scarc conceal hi chagrin know howev how few were her acquaint in town he soon conclud she wa with miss belfield but not satisfi with send mr delvil messeng after her he privat employ one in whom he trust for himself to make enquiri at the hous without say whenc he came but though thi man wa return and he knew her safeti he still felt alarm he had flatter himself from the length of time in which she had now done noth without consult him she would scarc even think of ani action without hi previou concurr and he had hope by a littl longer use to make hi counsel becom necessari which he knew to be a veri short step from render it absolut nor wa he well pleas to perceiv by thi voluntari excurs a struggl to cast off her sad and a wish to procur herself entertain it wa not that he desir her miseri but he wa earnest that all relief from it should spring from himself and though far from displeas that delvil should lose hi sovereignti over her thought he wa yet of opinion that till hi own liberti wa restor he had less to apprehend from grief indulg than grief allay one could but lead her to repin retir the other might guid her to a consolatori rival he well knew howev it wa as essenti to hi caus to disguis hi disappoint as hi expect and certain that by pleas alon he had ani chanc of acquir power he clear up when cecilia return who as unconsci of feel as of owe ani

they have not the proper use of their head which make it veri excus but what ha occas ani alarm noth i hope is the matter with miss belfield no maam thank god the young ladi enjoy her health veri well

where to send after him wa of opinion he might be here know your kind to him and that you make the enquiri at the wrong place sir said cecilia much provok by the implic it convey if mr belfield is in

numscul love a good bob jerom whi thi is talk quit wide of the mark said mr hobson to suppos a young ladi of fortun would marri a man with a bobjerom what i say is let everi bodi follow their natur that is the way to be comfort and then if they pay everi one hi own who is a right to call em to account whether they wear a bobjerom or a pigtail down to the calv of their leg ay ay cri brigg sneeringli or whether they stuff their gullet with hot round of toast and butter and what if they do sir return hobson a littl angrili when a man got abov the world where is the harm of live a littl

jail to jail sir exclaim hobson thi is talk quit ungenteel let everi man be civil that is what i say for that is the way to make everi thing agreeabl but as to tell a man he will go to jail and that it is tantamount to affront him a rap at the streetdoor gave now a new relief to cecilia who began to grow veri apprehens lest the delight of spend money thu warmli contest with that of hoard it should give rise to a quarrel which between two such sturdi champion for their own opinion might lead to a conclus rather more rough and violent than she desir to wit but when the parlourdoor open instead of mr delvil whom she now fulli expect mr albani made hi entranc thi wa rather distress as her real busi with her guardian made it proper her confer with them should be undisturb and albani wa

comprehens intimid them both they took howev the relief of commun with one anoth and mr hobson said in a whisper thi you must know is i am told a veri particular old gentleman quit what i call a geniu he come often to my hous to see my lodger miss henni belfield though i never happen to light upon him myself except onc in the passag but what i hear of him is thi he make a practic as one may say of go about into peopl hous to do noth but find fault shall not get into mine return brigg promis him that dont half like him be bound he is an old sharper cecilia mean time enquir what he desir to have half a guinea he answer will that do for those who have noth said he it is much hereaft you may assist them again go but and see their distress and you will wish to give them everi thing mr brigg now when actual between her finger he saw the half guinea could contain no longer he twitch the sleev of her gown and pinch her arm with a look of pain eager said in a whisper dont give it dont let him have it chous him chous him noth but an old bite pardon me sir said cecilia in a low voic hi charact is veri well known to me and then disengag her arm from him she present her littl offer at thi

as to hi be a subject whi a duke is no more nor a judg nor the lord high chancellor and the like of those which make it tantamount to noth be he is answer to nobodi by the right of magna charta except in case of treason feloni and that but as to a beggar it is quit anoth thing he come and ask me for money but what ha he to
