who gave up much of her time to literari pursuit and literari connect and much of her fortun to the assist of the unhappi now learn that domest misfortun had contribut with her natur turn of mind to estrang her entir from those scene where celestina had sometim formerli seen her and that have lost an onli daughter the last of her children of a deep declin she now tri to call off her mind from the subject of her mourn contempl by chang of place and had never sinc that period resid long at ani of her own hous but had pass almost the whole year in travel stop wherev she found a pleasant spot and

so but inde it is more difficult to find such a companion as suit me in everi respect than appear at first view women of my own age who are establish in the world can not of cours leav their famili and connect those who are not are for the most part unhappi from pecuniari or famili distress and the mind depress at that period of life ha lost it is power of resist and sink in that hopeless

express the greatest avers to ladi castlenorth it is true said she i do hot know her much from my own observ for she is a woman whose convers i have alway dislik and avoid but from some anecdot of her that have been relat to me by those who know her well i believ it may with truth be said of her as wa said of a celebr polit charact that she ha a heart to imagin a head to contriv and a hand to execut ani mischief willoughbi is young openheart and artless by no mean like to suspect or like to detect artific so deep as what she is capabl of and i am well convinc that there are no contriv at which she would hesit either to carri a favorit point or aveng it is failur celestina wa extrem comfort by thi opinion given by so good a judg everi other sorrow wa compar light to that which she felt from the idea whenev it forc itself upon her mind that willoughbi had through ambit or capric or avaric voluntarili desert her and everi opinion that strengthen her own hope of hi unalt affect and imput hi leav her to the evil machin of the castlenorth wa sooth and consolatori ladi horatia howard wa now travel toward edinburgh and made the time of mr elphinston her own for the pleasur she deriv from her compani and still more from that of celestina to whom dure thi journey she becam so much attach that she made her promis to come to her whenev the abod she wa now go to should be inconveni or

celestina herself howev whose mind had too long been unpleasingli call off from that object on which she best love to fix it wa far from be displeas by the perfect seclus of the place she could now wander whole day alon amid the wild solitud in which she found herself listen onli to the rush of the cataract which dash through broken stone sparkl amid the dark heath on either side of it or the
