he approach a littl arbour where he wa sometim accustom to sit he heard more plain and distinct and on hi entranc wa soon convinc whenc it proceed just at the foot of a larg tree the extens bough of which greatli contribut to form the arbour wa place a basket close cover on the one side and partli open on the other to let in the air tho the sound which still continu to issu from it left dorilau

you may possibl be hereaft made sensiblein the mean time content yourself with know they are alreadi baptiz by the name of horatio and louisa the astonish he wa in at so unexpect a present be made him may more easili be imagin than express but he had then no time to form ani conjectur by whom or by what mean it wa left there the children want immedi succour and he hesit not a moment whether it would becom him to bestow it he took the basket up himself and run as fast as he could with it into the hous call hi maidserv about him and command them to give these littl stranger what assist wa in their power while a man wa sent among the tenant in search of nurs proper to attend them to what person soever said he i am indebt for thi confid it must not be abusedbesid whatev stand in need of

they should be brought there without the priviti of some one of them but all hi endeavour could get him no satisfact in thi point he read the letter over and over yet still hi curios wa as far to seek as everth hand he wa entir unacquaint with but thought there wa someth in the style that show it wrote by no mean person the hint contain in it that there wa some latent reason for address him in particular on thi account wa veri puzzl to him he could not conceiv whi he ani more than ani other gentleman of the counti should have an interest in the welfar of these children he had no near relat and those distant one who claim an almost forgotten kindr were not in a condit to abandon their progenyth thing appear strang to him but all hi endeavour to give him ani farther light into it be unsuccess he began to imagin the parent of the children had been compel by necess to expos them and had had onli wrote in thi mysteri manner to engag a better recept he also account in hi mind for their be left with him as he be a batchelor and have a larg estat it might natur be suppos there would be fewer impedi to their be taken care of than either where a wife wa in the case or a narrow fortun oblig the owner to preserv a greater oeconomi in expenc be at last convinc within himself that he had now explain thi seem riddl he took no farther troubl about whose or what these children were but resolv to take care of them dure their infanc and afterward to put them into such a way as he should find their geniuss render them most fit for in order to provid for themselv on hi leav the counti he order hi housekeep to furnish everi thing need for them as often as they want it and to take care they were well use by the women with whom he had place them and deliv these command not in a cursori or neglig manner but in such term as terrifi ani failur of obedi in thi point would highli incur hi displeasur noth materi happen dure their infanc i shall pass over those year in silenc onli say that as often as dorilau went down to hi estat which wa gener two or three time a year he alway sent for them and express a veri great satisfact in find in their look the charg he had given concern them so well execut but when they arriv at an age capabl of entertain him with their innoc prattl what befor wa chariti improv into affect and he began to regard them with a tender littl inferior to patern but which still increas with their increas of year have given them the first rudiment of educ in the best school those part afford he place louisa with a gentlewoman who deservedli had the reput of be an excel gover of youth and brought horatio in hi own chariot up to london where he put him to westminst school under the care of doctor busbi and agre for hi board in a famili that live near it and had sever other young gentlemen on the same term what more could have been expect from the best of father what more could children born to the highest fortun have enjoy nor wa their happi like to be fleet dorilau wa a man steadi in hi resolut had alway declar an avers to marriag and by reject everi overtur made him on that score had made hi friend ceas ani farther importun he had besid as ha alreadi been observ no near relat so that it wa the opinion of most peopl that he would make the young horatio heir to the greatest part of hi estat and give louisa a portion answer to her way of bring up what he intend for them howev is uncertain he never have declar hi sentiment so far concern them and the strang revolut happen afterward in both their fortun prevent him from act as it is possibl he might design the educ he allow them inde gave veri good ground for the abovement conjecturelouisa be taught all the accomplish that becam a maid of qualiti to be mistress of and horatio have gone thro all the learn of the school wa taken home to hi own hous from whenc he wa to go to oxford in order to finish hi studi in the charact of a gentlemancommon but when everi

braveri yet had no other reward than their fear and a conscious of have done more than wa their duti in war said he the superior offic carri away all the glori as well as profit of the victori wherea

argument but they were not of the least weight with the impati horatio he wa obstin in hi entreati which he even with tear enforc and dorilau consid so strong a propens as someth supernatur at last consentednev wa joy more sincer and fervent than what thi grant occas and he told hi benefactor that he doubt not but that hereaft he should hear such an account of hi behaviour as would make him not repent hi have compli with hi request the prepar for hi go to oxford were now convert into other of a differ naturesever of our troop were alreadi sent to flander and other about to embark in order to open the campaign so that there wa but a small space between the time of horatio ask leav to go and that of hi departur which dorilau resolv should be in a manner befit a youth whom he had bred up as hi own he provid him a handsom fieldequipag rich cloath hors and a servant to attend him and while these thing were get readi had master to perfect him in ride and those other exercis proper for the vocat he wa now enter into all which he perform with so good a grace that not onli dorilau himself who might be suspect to look on him with partial eye but all who saw him were perfectli charm he wa more than ordinarili tall for hi year admir well proport and had someth of a grave fierc in hi air and deport that tho he wa not yet sixteen he might veri well have pass for twenti he wa also extrem fair had regular featur and eye the most penetr mix with a certain sweet so that it wa difficult to say whether he seem most form for love or war dorilau think it highli proper he should take hi leav of louisa sent for her from the boardingschool that she might pass the short time he had to stay with her brother at hi hous not without some hope that the great tender there wa between them might put horatio out of hi resolut of go to the armi who be grown now extrem dear to him he could not think of part with tho he had yield to it without a great deal of reluct it is certain inde that when she first heard the motiv which had occas her be sent for her gentl breast wa fill with the most terribl alarm for her dear brother danger but the littl regard he seem to have of it and the high idea he had of futur great soon brought her to think as he did and instead of dissuad him from prosecut hi design she rather encourag him in it and in thi gave the first testimoni of a great of soul no less to be admir than the courag and laudabl ambit which actuat that of her brother dorilau beheld with an infin of satisfact the success of hi endeavour in favour of these amiabl twin and said within himself how great a piti would it have been if capac such as their had been deni the mean of improv after the departur of horatio he kept louisa some time with him under pretenc of show her the town which befor she had never seen but in realiti to allevi that melancholi which part from her brother had caus in him he could not have taken a more effectu way for there wa such an engag and sweet cheer in her convers ad to mani person perfect that it wa scarc possibl to think of ani thing els while she wa present she had also an excel voic and play well on the bass viol and harpsicord so that it is hard to say whether he found most satisfact in hear her or discours with her but how danger is it to depend on one own strength against the forc of such unit charm dorilau who in the midst of a thousand temptat had maintain the entir liberti of hi heart and tho never insens of beauti had never been enslav by it wa now by charm he least suspect and at an age when he believ himself proof against all the attack of love subdu without know that he wa soth tender passion stole into hi soul by impercept degre and under the shape of friendship and patern affect met with no opposit from hi reason till it becam too violent to be restrain then show itself in the whole power of restless wish fear hope and impati which he had often heard other complain of but not till now experienc in himself all that he befor had felt of love wa languid at best aim onli at enjoy and in the gratif of that desir wa extinguish but the passion he wa possess of for louisa wa of a differ natur and accompani with a respect which would not suffer him to entertain a thought in prejudic of her innoc mani reason besid hi natur avers to marriag concur to hinder him from make her hi wife and as there were yet more to deter him from be the instrument of her dishonour the situat of hi mind wa veri perplexingh blush within himself at the inclin he had for a girl whom he had alway behav to as a child of hi own and who look upon him as a father not onli the dispar of their year made him consid the passion he wa possess of as ridicul there wa one circumst which if at ani time a thought of marri her enter into hi head immedi extirp it which wa that there wa a possibl of her be born not onli of the meanest but the vilest parent who on hear her establish might appear and claim the right they had in her and lo said he i shall alli myself to perhap a numer famili of vagabond at least whether it be so or not the manner in which these children were expos be publicli known may furnish a pretenc for ani wretch to boast a kindr he wa therefor determin to suppress a passion which as he had too much honour to seek the gratif of by one way hi prudenc and charact in the world would not allow him to think of by the other and as absenc seem to him the best remedi he sent her down into the countri again with a precipit which made her wholli ignor of the real motiv fear she had done someth to offend him at part she entreat him to let her know if he had been dissatisfi with ani thing in her behaviourwherefor do you ask said he with some emot which the poor innoc still mistook for displeasur becaus answer she drop some tear at the same time that you banish me from your presenc whi would you be glad to continu with me alway again demand he ye inde said she and if you love me as well as you do my brother you would never part with me for i saw with what regret you let him go thi tender simplic ad such fewel to the fire with which dorilau wa enflam that it almost consum hi resolut he walk about

to send and have her brought back but wa as often prevent by the apprehens of her discov the motiveh wa now convinc that love doe not alway stand in need of be indulg to enforc it votari to be guilti

found it imposs to recov ani tranquil of mind while he continu in thi dilemma and therefor yield to the strongest side all the argument he had use with himself in the begin of hi passion seem now weak and trifl the differ of age which he had thought so formid an object appear none in the light with which he at present consid it he wa now but in hi fortieth year and the temper he had alway observ had hinder ani decay either in hi look or constitutionwhat censur the world might pass on hi marri one of her age and obscur birth he thought were of littl weight when balanc with hi intern peacethu

of it than he had been in combat it while there wa a possibl of do so to thi end he went down to hi countri seat and as soon as he arriv sent to let louisa know he would have her come and pass some time with him she readili obey the summon and found by hi manner of receiv her that she wa no less dear to him than her brother as she had alway consid him as a father tho she knew all her claim in him wa compass she wa far from suspect the motiv which made him treat her with so much tender but he suffer her not long to remain in thi happi ignor as he wa walk with her one day in the garden he purpos led her on that side where he had found horatio and herself in the manner alreadi relat and as they came toward the arbour it wa here said he that heaven put into my power the opportun of
