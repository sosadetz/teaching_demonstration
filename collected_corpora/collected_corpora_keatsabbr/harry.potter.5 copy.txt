sound of someth break insid a neighbor hous harri felt a dull sink sensat in hi stomach and befor he knew it the feel of hopeless that had plagu him all summer roll over him onc again tomorrow morn he would be woken by the alarm at five oclock so he could pay the owl that deliv the daili prophet but wa there ani point continu to take it harri mere glanc at the front page befor throw it asid these day when the idiot who ran the paper final realiz that voldemort wa back it would be headlin news and that wa the onli kind harri care about if he wa lucki there would also be owl carri letter from hi best friend ron and hermion though ani expect hed had that their letter would bring him news had long sinc been dash we cant say much about youknowwhat obvious weve been told not to say anyth import in case our letter go astray were quit busi but i cant give you detail here there a fair amount go on well tell you everyth when we see you but when were they go to see him nobodi seem too bother with a precis date hermion had scribbl i expect well be see you quit soon insid hi birthday card but how soon wa soon as far as harri could tell from the vagu hint in their letter hermion and ron were in the same place presum at ron parent hous he could hardli bear to think of the pair of them have fun at the burrow when he wa stuck in privet drive in fact he wa so angri with them he had thrown away unopen the two box of honeyduk chocol theyd sent him for hi birthday hed regret it later after the wilt salad aunt petunia had provid for dinner that night and what were ron and hermion busi with whi wasnt he harri busi hadnt he prove himself capabl of handl much more than them had they all forgotten what he had done hadnt it been he who had enter that graveyard and watch cedric be murder and been tie to that tombston and nearli kill dont think about that harri told himself sternli for the hundredth time that summer it wa bad enough that he kept revisit the graveyard in hi nightmar without dwell on it in hi wake moment too he turn a corner into magnolia crescent halfway along he pass the narrow alleyway down the side of a garag where he had first clap eye on hi godfath siriu at least seem to understand how harri wa feel admittedli hi letter were just as empti of proper news as ron and hermion but at least they contain word of caution and consol instead of tantal hint i know thi must be frustrat for you keep your nose clean and everyth will be okay be care and dont do anyth rash well thought harri as he cross magnolia crescent turn into magnolia road and head toward the darken play park he had by and larg done as siriu advis he had at least resist the temptat to tie hi trunk to hi broomstick and set off for the burrow by himself in fact harri thought hi behavior had been veri good consid how frustrat and angri he felt at be stuck in privet drive so long reduc to hide in flowerb in the hope of hear someth that might point to what lord voldemort wa do nevertheless it wa quit gall to be told not to be rash by a man who had serv twelv year in the wizard prison azkaban escap attempt to commit the murder he had been convict for in the first place then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff harri vault over the lock park gate and set off across the parch grass the park wa as empti as the surround street when he reach the swing he sank on to the onli one that dudley and hi friend had not yet manag to break coil one arm around the chain and stare moodili at the ground he would not be abl to hide in the dursley flowerb again tomorrow he would have to think of some fresh way of listen to the news in the meantim he had noth to look forward to but anoth restless disturb night becaus even when he escap the nightmar about cedric he had unsettl dream about long dark corridor all finish in dead end and lock door which he suppos had someth to do with the trap feel he had when he wa awak often the old scar on hi forehead prickl uncomfort but he did not fool himself that ron or hermion or siriu would find that veri interest ani more in the past hi scar hurt had warn that voldemort wa get stronger again but now that voldemort wa back they would probabl remind him that it regular irrit wa onli to be expect noth to worri about old news the injustic of it all well up insid him so that he want to yell with furi if it hadnt been for him nobodi would even have known voldemort wa back and hi reward wa to be stuck in littl whing for four solid week complet cut off from the magic world reduc to squat among die begonia so that he could hear about waterski budgerigar how could dumbledor have forgotten him so easili whi had ron and hermion got togeth without invit him along too how much longer wa he suppos to endur siriu tell him to sit tight and be a good boy or resist the temptat to write to the stupid daili prophet and point out that voldemort had return these furiou thought whirl around in harri head and hi insid writh with anger as a sultri velveti night fell around him the air full of the smell of warm dri grass and the onli sound that of the low grumbl of traffic on the road beyond the park rail he did not know how long he
