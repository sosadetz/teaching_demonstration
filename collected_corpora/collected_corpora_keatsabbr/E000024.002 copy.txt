poetic work of john dryden with life critic dissert and explanatori note by the rev georg gilfillan vol ii m dccc lv critic estim of the geniu and poetic work of john dryden in our life of dryden we promis to say someth about the question how far is a poet particularli in the moral tendenc and tast of hi write to be triedand either condemn or justifiedbi the charact and spirit of hi age to a rapid consider of thi question we now proceed befor examin the constitu element or the vari fruit of the poet geniu and here unquestion there are extrem which everi critic should avoid some imagin that a writer of a former centuri should be tri either by the standard which prevail in the cultur and civilis nineteenth or by the exposit of moral principl and practic which is to be found in the scriptur now it is obvious so far as tast is concern as unjust to judg a book written in the style and manner of one age by the mere arbitrari and convent rule establish in anoth as to judg the dress of our ancestor by the fashion of the present day and in respect of moral it is as unfair to visit with the same measur of condemn offenc against decorum or decenc commit by writer live befor or live after the promulg of the christian code as it would be to class the satyr priapi and bacchant of an antiqu sculptor with their imit by inferior and coarser artist in later time there must be a certain measur of allow made for the error of geniu when it wa work as the galleyslav of it tradit and period and when it had not yet receiv the divin light which shine into the world from abov ha suppli men with higher æsthetic as well as spiritu model of principl and reveal man bodi to be the templ of the holi ghost to look for our modern philanthropi in that greek gazett the iliad of homerto expect that rever for the suprem be which the bibl ha taught us in the metamorphos of ovidor to seek that refin of manner and languag which ha onli of late prevail amongst us in the play of aristophan and plautuswer veri foolish and veri vain in age not so ancient and which have revolv sinc the dawn of christian a certain coars of thought and languag ha been preval and for it still larger allow should be made becaus it ha been appli to simplic rather than to sensualityto rustic barbar not to civilis corruptionand carri along with it a rough raci and a refer to the sturdi aborigin beastjust as acorn in the trough suggest the immemori forest where they grew and the rich greensward on which they fell in two case it thu appear should the severest censor be prepar to modifi hi condemn of the bad tast or the impur to be found in writer of geniusfirst in that of a civil perfect in it kind but destitut of the refin and sublim element which a revel onli can suppli and secondli in that of those age in which the light of knowledg and religion are contend with the gloom of barbarian rude perhap there are still two other case capabl of palliationthat of a mind so constitut as to be noth if not a mirror of it age and faith and irresist reflect even it vice and pollut or that of a mind morbidli in love with the morbid and the vile passag of human natur but suppos the case of a writer sit under the full blaze of gospel truth professedli a believ in the gospel and intim acquaint with it oracl live in a late and dissip not a rude and simpl agepossess of vari and splendid talent which qualifi him to make as well as to mirror and with a tast natur sound and manli who should yet seek to shock the feel of the piou to gratifi the low tendenc and fire to frenzi the evil passion of hi periodh is not to be shield by the apolog that he ha onli conform to the bad age on which he wa so unfortun as to fall prejudic may inde put in such a plea in hi defenc but the inevit eye of common sens distinguish between necess and choic between coars and corrupt between a man passiv yield to and activ invit and encourag the current of fals tast and immor which he must encount will find that plea nugatori and bring in against the author a verdict of guilti now thi we fear is exactli the case of dryden he wa neither a barbarian nor a scythian he wa a consciou artist not a high though helpless reflector of hi age he had not we think like hi rel swift origin ani diseas delight in filth for it own sake wa notshal we saya natur but an artifici yahoo he wield a power over the public mind approach the absolut and which he could have turn to virtuou instead of viciou accountat first it might have been amidst consider resist and obloquy but ultim with triumphant success thi howev he never attempt and must therefor be class in thi respect with such writer as byron whose power gild their pollut less than their pollut degrad and defil their power nay perhap he should be rank even lower than the nobl bard whose obscen are not so gross and who had besid to account for them the doubl palliat of passion and of despair in these remark we refer princip to dryden play for hi poem as we remark in the life are with the except of a few of the prologu which we print under protest in a great measur free from impur we pass gladli to consid him in hi geniu and hi poetic work the most obviou and among the most remark characterist of hi poetic style are it wondrou elast and eas of movement there is never for an instant ani real or appar effort ani strain for effect ani of that doubl doubl toil and troubl by which mani even of the weird cauldron in which geniu form her creation are disturb and bedim that power of do everyth with perfect and consciou eas which dugald stewart ha ascrib to barrow and to horsley in prose distinguish dryden in poetri whether he discuss the deep question of fate and foreknowledg in religio laici or lash shaftesburi in the medal or pour a torrent of contempt on shadwel in macfleckno or describ the fire of london in the annu mirabili or soar into lyric enthusiasm in hi ode on the death of mr killigrew and alexand feast or paint a tournament in palamon and arcit or a fairi danc in the flower and the leafh is alway at home and alway awar that he is hi conscious of hi own power amount to exult he is like the steed who glori in that tremend gallop which affect the spectat with fear inde we never can separ our concept of dryden vigor and vault style from the imag of a nobl hors devour the dust of the field clear obstacl at a bound take up long leagu as a littl thing and the veri strength and speed of whose motion give it at a distanc the appear of smooth pope speak of hi long resound march and energi divin perhap eas divin had been word more characterist of that almost superhuman power of languag by which he make the most obstin materi pliant melt down difficulti as if by the touch of magic and to resum the former figur come into the goal without a hair turn on hi mane or a singl sweatdrop confess effort or extraordinari exert we know no poet sinc homer who can be compar to dryden in thi respect except scott who occasion in marmion and the lay of the last minstrel exhibit the same impetu eas and fieri fluent movement scott doe not howev in gener carri the same weight as the other and the speci of vers he use in comparison to the heroic rhyme of dryden give you often the impress of a hard trot rather than of a longresound and magnific gallop scott exhibit in hi poetri the soul of a warrior but it is of a warrior of the bordersomewhat savag and coars dryden can for the nonc at least assum the appear and display the spirit of a knight of ancient chivalrygal accomplish eleg and gay next to thi poet astonish eas spirit and elast vigour may be rank hi clear sharp intellect he may be call more a logician than a poet he reason often and alway acut and hi rhyme instead of shackl strengthen the movement of hi argument part of hi religio laici and the hind and panther resembl portion of dun scotu or aquina set on fire inde keen strong intellect inflam with passion and inspirit by that ardour and impetuos of mind which wordsworth is compel to allow to him rather than creativ or origin geniu is the differentia of dryden we have compar him to a courser but he wa not one of those courser of achil who fed on no earthli food but on the golden barley of heaven have sprung from the god greek xanthon kai balion to ama pnoiaesi petesthaen tou etek zephuro anemo arpua podarga dryden resembl rather the mortal steed which wa yoke with these immort twain the brood of zephyr and the harpi podarga onli we can hardli say of the poet what homer say of pedasu greek os kai thnaeto eon epeth ippoi athanatoisi he wa not although a mortal abl to keep up with the immort courser hi path wa on the plain or tableland of earthnev or seldom in cloudland gorgeou land or through the aerial altitud which stretch away and abov the cloud to the gate of heaven he can hardli be said to have possess the power of sublim in the high sens of that term as the power of sympathis with the feel of the infinit often he give us the impress of the picturesqu of the beauti of the heroic of the nobli disdainfulbut never when write at least entir from hi own mind of that infinit and nameless grandeur which the imagin soul feel shed on it from the multitudin wave of oceanfrom the cataract leap from hi rock as if to consumm an act of prayer to godfrom the hum of great assembl of menfrom the sight of farextend wast and wildernessesand from the aw silenc and the still more mysteri sparkl of the midnight star thi sens of the presenc of the shadow of immensityimmens itself can not be felt ani more than measuredthi sight like that vouchsaf to mose of the backpart of the divineth divin itself can not be seenha been the inspir of all the highest poetri of the worldof the paradis lost of the divina commedia of the night thought of wordsworth and coleridg of festu and highest far of the hebrew prophet as they cri whither can we go from thi presenc whither can we flee from thi spirit such poet have resembl a blind man who feel although he can not see that a stranger of command air is in the room besid him so they stand awestruck in the wind of the go of a majest and unseen be thi feel differ from mystic inasmuch as it is connect with a realiti while the mystic dream a vagu and unsupport dream and the poetri it produc is simpli the irresist cri spring from the percept of thi wondrou some one who is actual near them the feel is connect in gener with a lofti moral and religi natur and yet not alway sinc while want in dryden we find it intens discov although in an imperfect and pervert shape in byron and rousseau in dryden certainli it exist not we do notand in thi we have jeffrey opinion to back usrememb a singl line in hi poetri that can be call sublim or which is the same thing that give us a thrill shudder as if a god or a ghost were pass by pleasur high excitementraptur even he often produc but such a feel as is creat by that line of milton to bellow through the vast and boundless deep never compar in proof of thi the descript of the tournament in palamon and arciteamazingli spirit as it isto the descript of the warhors in job or if that appear too high a test to the contest of achil with the river in homer to the war of the angel and the interrupt prepar for contest between gabriel and satan in milton to the contest between apollyon and christian in the pilgrim progress to some of the combat in spenser and to that wonder one of the princess and the magician in midair in the arabian night in order to understand the distinct between the most anim liter pictur of battl and those into which the element of imagin is strongli inject by the poet who can to the inevit shiver of human natur at the sight of struggl and carnag add the far more profound and terribl shiver onli creat by a vision of the concomit the consequencesth unseen border of the bloodi scene take these line for instanc they look anew the beauteou form of fight is chang and war appear a grisli sight two troop in fair array one moment show the next a field with fallen bodi strow not half the number in their seat are found but men and steed lie grovel on the ground the point of spear are stuck within the shield the steed without their rider scour the field the knight unhors on foot renew the fight the glitter faulchion cast a gleam light hauberk and helm are hewd with mani a wound outspin the stream blood and dye the ground thi is vigor and vivid but is not imagin or suggest it doe not carri away the mind from the field to bring back thought and imag which shall so to speak brood over and aggrav the gener horror it is in a word plain good paint but it is not poetri there is not a metaphor such as he laugheth at the shake of a spear in it all in connexion with thi defect in imagin is the lack of natur imageri in dryden poetri wordsworth inde greatli overcharg the case when he say in a letter to scott that there is not a singl imag from natur in the whole bodi of hi poetri we have thi minut taken up the hind and the panther and find two imag from natur in one page as where in field the fairi round are seen a rank sour herbag rise on the green so c and a few line down as where the lightn run along the ground no husbandri can heal the blast wound and some page farther on occur a descript of spring not unworthi of wordsworth himself begin new blossom flourish and new flower aris as god had been abroad and walk there had left hi footstep and reformd the year still it is true that take hi write as a whole they are thin in natur imag and even those which occur are often rather the echo of hi read than the result of hi observ and what wordsworth add is we fear true in hi translat of virgil where virgil can be fairli said to have hi eye upon hi object dryden alway spoil the passag the reason of thi apart from hi want of high imagin sympathi may be found in hi long resid in london and hi lack of that intim daili familiar with natur scene which can alon suppli thorough knowledg or enkindl thorough love natur is not like the major of other mistress her charm deepen the longer she is known and he that love her most warmli ha watch her with the narrowest inspect she can bear the keenest glanc of the microscop and to see all her glori would exhaust an antediluvian life the appetit in her case grow with what it feed on but such an appetit wa not dryden anoth of hi great defect is in true tender of feel he ha veri few passag which can be call pathet hi elegi and funer ode such as those on mr killigrew and eleonora are eloqu but they move you to admir not to tear dryden long immers in the pollut of the playhous had combin with hi long cours of domest infel and hi employ as a hack author a parti scribe and a satirist to harden hi heart to brush away whatev fine bloom of feel there had been origin on hi mind and to render him incap of even simul the softer emot of the soul but for the discov fact that he wa in earli life a lover of hi rel honor driden you would have judg him from hi work incap of a pure passion lust hard by hate be hi twin idol how could he repres human far less ether love and how could he touch those spring of holi tear which lie deep in man heart and which are connect with all that is dignifi and all that is divin in man natur what could the author of limberham know of love or the author of macfleckno of piti wordsworth in that admir letter to which we have repeatedli refer say whenev hi languag is poetic impass it is mostli upon unpleas subject such as the folli vice and crime of class of men or individu thi is unquestion he never so nearli reach the sublim as when he is express contempt he never rise so high as in the act of trampl he is a good hater and express hi hatr with a mixtur of animu and eas of fierc and of trenchant rapid which make it veri formid he onli as it were wave off hi adversari disdain but the veri wave of hi hand cut like a sabr hi satir is not savag and furiou like juven not cool collect and infern like that of juniu not rabid and reckless like that of swift and never darken into the unearthli grandeur of byron but it is strong swift dash and decis nor doe it want deep and subtl touch hi pictur of shaftesburi and buckingham are as delic finish as they are power conceiv he fli best at the highest game but even in deal with settl and shadwel he can be as felicit as he is fierc no satir in the world contain line more exquisit invert more ingeni burlesqu more art turn out of their appar proper cours like ray at onc refract and cool than those which thu omin panegyris shadwel hi brow thick fog instead of glori grace and lambent dul playd about hi face as hannib did to the altar come sworn by hi sire a mortal foe to rome so shadwel swore nor should hi vow be vain that he till death true dul would maintain better still the follow pictur in imit of the homer or milton manner the sire then shook the honour of hi head and from hi brow damp of oblivion shed full on the filial dulnesslong he stood repel from hi breast the rage god what inimit ironi in thi epithet the god of dul rage a stagnant pool in a passion a canal insan a mouton enragé as the french say or a snail in a tumultu state of excit were but type of the satir idea impli in these word what a descript of labour nonsenseof the python geniu of absurd pant and heav on hi solemnli ridicul tripod the languag and versif of dryden have been prais and justli hi style is worthi of a still more power and origin vein of geniu than hi own it is a masculin clear elast and vari diction fit to express all feel save the deepest all fanci save the subtlest all passion save the loftiest all mood of mind save the most disinterest and rapt to repres incid howev strang charact howev contradictori to each other shade of mean howev evas and to do all thi as if it were do noth in point of eas and as if it were do everyth in point of felt and rejoic energi no poetic style sinc can in such respect be compar to dryden pope to hi is feebleand byron forc he can say the strongest thing in the swiftest way and the most felicit express seem to fall unconsci from hi lip had hi matter you say but been equal to hi manner hi thought in origin and imagin power but commensur with the boundless quantiti and no less admir qualiti of hi word hi versif deserv a commend scarc inferior it is all ear if we may so appli an express of shakspear no studi rulesno elabor complic of harmoniesit is the mere sink and swell of the wave of hi thought as it move onward to the shore of hi purpos and as in the sea there are no furrow absolut isol from each other but each lean on or melt into each and the subsid of the one is the rise of the otherso with the versif of hi better poetri the begin of the hind and panther we need not quot but it will be rememb as a good specimen of that peculiar style of run the line into one anoth and therebi produc a certain free and nobl effect which the uniform tinkl of pope and hi school is altogeth unabl to reach a style which ha sinc been copi by some of our poetsbi churchil by cowper and by shelley the line of the artifici school on the other hand may be compar to roller each distinct from each othereach be in itself a wholebut altogeth form none pope say hazlitt ha turn pegasu into a rockinghors we are perhap nearli right when we call dryden the most eloqu and rhetor of english poet he bear in thi respect an analog to lucretiu among the roman who inferior in polish to virgil wa incompar more anim and energet in style who exhibit besid trait of lofti imagin rare met with in virgil and never in dryden and who equal the english poet in the power of reason in vers and set the sever abstract of metaphys thought to music with the shakspear chaucer spenser milton byron wordsworth and coleridg the dii majorum gentium of the poetic pantheon of britain dryden rank not although tower far abov the moor goldsmith gay and prior he may be class with a middl but still high order in which we find the name of scott as a poet johnson pope cowper southey crabb and two or three other who while all excel dryden in some qualiti are all excel by him in other and bulk on the whole about as larg as he on the public eye we come to make a few remark in addit to some we have alreadi incident made on dryden separ work and first of hi lyric hi song properli so call are live buoyant and elast yet compar to those of shakspear they are of the earth earthi they are the down of the thistl carri on a light breez upward shakspear resembl aerial

criticsdr johnson call it magnific and warton deni it ani merit we inclin to a mediat view it ha bold passag the first and the last stanza are veri power and the whole is full of that rush torrentmov characterist of the poet but the sink are as deep as the swell and the inequ disturb the gener effect thi is still more true of threnodia augustali the ode on the death of charl ii not onli is it spirit fulsom and it statement of fact grossli partial but mani of it line are feebl and the whole is wirespun yet what can be nobler in thought and languag than the follow descript of the joy at the

onc as from a mould it is pure inspir but of the second orderrath that of the greek pytho than of the hebrew prophet coleridg or wordsworth make the object to it that the bacchu it describ is the mere

but thi although a more imagin represent of the god of wine had not been so suitabl sung at an entertain presid over by an alexand and a thai a drunk conqueror and a courtezan dryden himself we have seen thought thi the best ode that ever wa or would be written in the english languag in a certain sens he wa right for vivac freedom of movement and eloqu it ha never been equal but there are some odessuch as coleridg ode to franc and wordsworth power of soundwhich as certainli excel it in strength of imagin grandeur of concept and uniti of execut and effect of dryden satir we have alreadi
