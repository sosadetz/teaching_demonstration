moment i recollect that in order to teach dutchmen english it wa necessari that they should first teach me dutch how i came to overlook so obviou an object is to me amaz but certain it is i overlook it thi scheme thu blown up i had some thought of fairli ship back to england again but happen into compani with an irish student who wa return from louvain our convers turn upon topic of literatur for by the way it may be observ that i alway forgot the mean of my circumst when i could convers upon such subject from him i learn that there were not two men in hi whole univers who understood greek thi amaz me i instangli resolv to travel to louvain and there live by teach greek and in thi design i wa hearten by my brother student who threw out some hint that a fortun might be got by it i set boldli

and i eat heartili without greek in short continu he i dont know greek and i do not believ there is ani use in it i wa now too far from home to think of return so i resolv to go forward i had some knowledg of music with a toler voic and now turn what wa onc my amus into a present mean of bare subsist i pass among the harmless peasant of flander and among such of the french as were poor enough to be veri merri for i ever found them sprightli in proport to their want whenev i approach a peasant hous toward nightfal i play one of my most merri tune and that procur me not onli a lodg but subsist for the next day i onc or twice attempt to play for peopl of fashion but they still thought my perform odiou and never reward me even with a trifl thi wa to me the more extraordinari as whenev i use formerli to play for compani when play wa my amus my music never fail to throw them into raptur and the ladi especi but as it wa now my onli mean it wa receiv with contempt a proof how readi the world is to under rate those talent which a man live by in thi manner i proceed to pari with no design but just to look about me and then to go forward the peopl of pari are much fonder of stranger that have money than of those that have wit you may imagin then as i could not boast much of either that i wa no great favorit after i had walk about the town four or five day and seen the outsid of the best hous i wa prepar to leav thi retreat of venal hospit when pass through one of the princip street whom should i meet but our cousin to whom you first recommend me thi meet wa veri agreeabl to me and i believ not displeas to him he enquir into the natur of my journey to pari and inform me of hi busi there which wa to collect pictur medal intaglio and antiqu of all kind for a gentleman in london who had just step into tast and a larg fortun i wa still more surpris at see our cousin pitch upon for thi offic as himself had often assur me he knew noth of the matter upon my ask how he had been taught the art of a connoscento so veri suddenli he assur me that noth wa more easi the whole secret consist in a strict adher to two rule the one alway to observ that the pictur might have been better if the painter had taken more pain and the other to prais the work of pietro perugino but say he as i onc taught you how to be an author in london i will now undertak to instruct you in the art of pictur buy at pari with thi propos i veri readili close as it wa a live and now all my ambit wa to live i went therefor to hi lodg improv my dress by hi assist and after some time accompani him to auction of pictur where the english gentri were expect to be purchas i wa not a littl surpris at hi intimaci with peopl of the best fashion who refer themselv to hi judgment upon everi pictur or medal as to an uner standard of tast he made veri good use of my assist upon these occas for when ask hi opinion he would grave take me asid and ask mine shrug look wise return and assur the compani that he could give no opinion upon an affair of so much import yet there wa sometim an occas for a more support assur i rememb to have seen him after give hi opinion that the color of a pictur wa not mellow enough veri deliber take a brush with brown varnish that wa accident lie in the place and rub it over the piec with great composur befor all the compani and then ask if he had not improv the tint when he had finish hi commiss in pari he left me strongli recommend to sever men of distinct as a person veri proper for a travel tutor and i wa after some time employ in that capac by a gentleman who brought hi ward to pari in order to set him forward on hi tour through europ i wa to be the young gentleman governor with thi injunct that he should alway be permit to direct himself my pupil in fact understood the art of guid in money concern much better than me he wa heir to a fortun of about two hundr thousand pound left him by an uncl in the west indi and hi guardian to qualifi him for the manag of it had bound him apprentic to an attorney thu avaric wa hi prevail passion all hi question on the road were how money might be save which wa the least expens cours of travel whether ani thing could be bought that would turn to account when dispos of again in london such curios on the way as could be seen for noth he wa readi enough to look at but if the sight wa to be paid for he usual assert that he had been told it wa not worth see he never paid a bill that he would not observ how amazingli expens travel wa and all thi though he wa not yet come to the age of twentyon when arriv at leghorn as we took a walk to look at the port and ship he enquir the expens of the passag by sea home to england thi he wa inform wa but a trifl compar to hi return by land he wa therefor unabl to withstand the temptat so pay me the small part of my salari that wa then due he took leav and embark with onli one attend for london i now therefor wa left onc more upon the world at larg but then it
