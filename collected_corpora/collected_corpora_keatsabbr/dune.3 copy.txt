throughout the known univers here lay tempor rich secular author and that most power of all mystic talisman the divin authent of muaddib religi bequest in these twin leto and hi sister ghanima an awesom power focus while they live muaddib though dead live in them these were not mere nineyearold children they were a natur forc object of vener and fear they were the children of paul atreid who had becom muaddib the mahdi of all the fremen muaddib had ignit an explos of human fremen had spread from thi planet in a jihad carri their fervor across the human univers in a wave of religi govern whose scope and ubiquit author had left it mark on everi planet yet these children of muaddib are flesh and blood stilgar thought two simpl thrust of my knife would still their heart their water would return to the tribe hi wayward mind fell into turmoil at such a thought to kill muaddib children but the year had made him wise in introspect stilgar knew the origin of such a terribl thought it came from the left hand of the damn not from the right hand of the bless the ayat and burhan of life held few mysteri for him onc hed been proud to think of himself as fremen to think of the desert as a friend to name hi planet dune in hi thought and not arraki as it wa mark on all of the imperi star chart how simpl thing were when our messiah wa onli a dream he thought by find our mahdi we loos upon

of me leto could be heard stir restlessli in hi bed stilgar sigh he had never known the atreid grandfath whose name thi child had taken but mani said the moral strength of muaddib had come from that sourc would that terrifi qualiti of right skip a gener now stilgar found himself unabl to answer thi question he thought sietch tabr is mine i rule here i am a naib of the fremen without me there would have been no muaddib these twin now through chani their mother and my kinswoman my blood flow in their vein i am there with muaddib and chani and all the other what have we done to our univers stilgar could not explain whi such thought came to him in the night and whi they made him feel so guilti he crouch within hi hood robe realiti wa not at all like the dream the friendli desert which onc had spread from pole to pole wa reduc to half it former size the mythic paradis of spread greeneri fill him with dismay it wa not like the dream and as hi planet chang he knew he had chang he had becom a far more subtl person than the onetim sietch chieftain he wa awar now of mani thing of statecraft and profound consequ in the smallest decis yet he felt thi knowledg and subtleti as a thin veneer cover an iron core of simpler more determinist awar and that older core call out to him plead with him for a return to cleaner valu the morn sound of the sietch began intrud upon hi thought peopl were begin to move about in the cavern he felt a breez against hi cheek peopl were go out through the doorseal into the predawn dark the breez spoke of careless as it spoke of the time warren dweller no longer maintain the tight water disciplin of the old day whi should they when rain had been record on thi planet when cloud were seen when eight fremen had been inund and kill by a flash flood in a wadi until that event the word drown had not exist in the languag of dune but thi wa no longer dune thi wa arraki and it wa the morn of an event day he thought jessica mother of muaddib and grandmoth of these royal twin return to our planet today whi doe she end her selfimpos exil at thi time whi doe she leav the soft and secur of caladan for the danger of arraki and there were other worri would she sens stilgar doubt she wa a bene gesserit witch graduat of the sisterhood deepest train and a reverend mother in her own right such femal were acut and they were danger would she order him to fall upon hi own knife as the ummaprotector of lietkyn had been order would i obey her he wonder he could not answer that question but now he thought about lietkyn the planetologist who had first dream of transform the planetwid desert of dune into the humansupport green planet which it wa becom lietkyn had been chani father without him there would have been no dream no chani no royal twin the work of thi fragil chain dismay stilgar how have we met in thi place he ask himself how have we combin for what purpos is it my duti to end it all to shatter that great combin stilgar admit the terribl urg within him now he could make that choic deni love and famili to do what a naib must do on occas make a deadli decis for the good of the tribe by one view such a murder repres ultim betray and atroc to kill mere children yet they were not mere children they had eaten melang had share in the sietch orgi had probe the desert for sandtrout and play the other game of fremen children and they sat in the royal council children of such tender year yet wise enough to sit in the council they might be children in flesh but they were ancient in experi born with a total of genet memori a terrifi awar which set their aunt alia and themselv apart from all other live human mani time in mani night had stilgar found hi mind circl thi differ share by the twin and their aunt mani time had he been awaken from sleep by these torment come here to the twin bedchamb with hi dream unfinish now hi doubt came to focu failur to make a decis wa in itself a decis he knew thi these twin and their aunt had awaken in the womb know there all of the memori pass onto them by their ancestor spice addict had done thi spice addict of the mother the ladi jessica and chani the ladi jessica had born a son muaddib befor her addict alia had come after the addict that wa clear in retrospect the countless gener of select breed direct by the bene gesserit had achiev muaddib but nowher in the sisterhood plan had they allow for melang oh they knew about thi possibl but they fear it and call it abomin that wa the most dismay fact abomin they must possess reason for such a judgment and if they said alia wa an abomin then that must appli equal to the twin becaus chani too had been addict her bodi satur with spice and her gene had somehow complement those of muaddib stilgar thought move in ferment there could be no doubt these twin went beyond their father but in which direct the boy spoke of an abil to be hi father and had prove it even as an infant leto had reveal memori which onli muaddib should have known were there other ancestor wait in that vast spectrum of memori ancestor whose belief and habit creat unspeak danger for live human abomin the holi witch of the bene gesserit said yet the sisterhood covet the genophas of these children the witch want sperm and ovum without the disturb flesh which carri them wa that whi the ladi jessica return at thi time she had broken with the sisterhood to support her ducal mate but rumor said she had return to the bene gesserit way i could end all of these dream stilgar thought how simpl it would be and yet again he wonder at himself that he could contempl such a choic were muaddib twin respons for the realiti which obliter the dream of other no they were mere the len through which light pour to reveal new shape in the univers in torment hi mind revert to primari fremen belief and he thought god command come so seek not to hasten it god it is to show the way and some do swerv from it it wa the religion of muaddib which upset stilgar most whi did they make a god of muaddib whi deifi a man known to be flesh muaddib golden elixir of life had creat a bureaucrat monster which sat astrid human affair govern and religion unit and break a law becam sin a smell of blasphemi aros like smoke around ani question of government edict the guilt of rebellion invok hellfir and selfright judgment yet it wa men who creat these government edict stilgar shook hi head sadli not see the attend who had move into the royal antechamb for their morn duti he finger the crysknif at hi waist think of the past it symbol think that more than onc he had sympath with rebel whose abort upris had been crush by hi own order confus wash through hi mind and he wish he knew how to obliter it return to the simplic repres by the knife but the univers would not turn backward it wa a great engin project upon the grey void of nonexist hi knife if it brought the death of the twin would onli reverber against that void weav new complex to echo
