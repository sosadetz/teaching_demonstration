celibaci chapter ii when the time for miss woodley to depart arriv miss milner entreat earnestli to accompani her home and made the most solemn promis that she would guard not onli her behavior but her veri thought within the limit her friend should prescrib miss woodley at length yield thu much that as soon as lord elmwood wa set out on hi journey to itali where she had heard him say he should shortli be oblig to go she would no longer deni her the pleasur of return and if after the long absenc which must consequ take place between him and her she should then posit affirm the suppress of her passion wa the happi result she would at that time take her word and risk the danger of their onc more resid togeth with thi concess on the side of miss woodley they part and as winter wa now far

sandford to take up hi abod elsewher but the great pleasur hi lordship took in hi societi join to the great mortif he knew such a propos would be to hi friend would not suffer him to make it miss milner all thi time wa not think upon those she hate but on those she love sandford never came into her thought while the imag of lord elmwood never left them one morn as she sat talk to ladi luneham on variou subject but think alon on him sir harri with anoth gentleman a mr fleetmond came in and the convers turn upon the great improb there wa dure the present lord elmwood youth that he should ever inherit the titl and estat that had now fallen to him and said mr fleetmond independ of the fortun it must be matter of infinit joy to dorriforth no answer sir harri independ of the fortun it must be a motiv of concern to him for he must now regret beyond measur hi folli in take priest order thu depriv himself of the hope of an heir by which the titl at hi death will be lost by no mean repli mr fleetmond he may yet have an heir for he will certainli marri marri cri sir harri ye answer the other it wa that i meant by the joy it might probabl give him beyond the possess of hi estat and titl how be marri said ladi luneham ha he not taken a vow never to marri ye answer mr fleetmond but there are no religi vow from which the great pontiff of rome can not grant a dispens those command made by the church the church ha alway the power to dispens withal and when it is for the gener good of religion hi holi think it incumb on him to publish hi bull to remit all pain and penalti for their nonobserv and certainli it is for the honor of the cathol that thi earldom should continu in a cathol famili in short i will lay a wager my lord elmwood is marri within the twelvemonth miss milner who listen with attent fear she wa in a dream or deceiv by the pretend knowledg of mr fleetmond who might know noth but on consider all that he had said wa veri probabl and to confirm it truth he wa himself a roman cathol and must be well inform on the subject upon which he spoke if she had heard the direst news that ever sound in the ear of the most suscept of mortal the agit of her mind and person could not have been stronger she felt while everi word wa speak a chill through all her vein it wa a pleasur too exquisit not to bear along with it the sensat of exquisit pain of which she

of which i had promis myself the most extrem satisfact but the fear your health wa not suffici return to support without danger the burden of hope which i knew would upon thi occas press upon you i defer my pleas commun and have had it anticip yet as you seem in the utmost doubt as to the truth of what you have been told perhap thi confirm of it may fall littl short of the first news especi when it is strengthen by my entreat you to come to us as soon as you can with proprieti leav ladi luneham come my dear miss milner and find in your onc rigid monitor a fait confid i will no longer threaten
