of a number of petti independ state sometim at war and sometim in allianc with one anoth of these differ state therefor we shall now give an account with as much breviti as is consist with perspicu and we shall begin our narr at that period where real and authent histori commenc for as to the more earli that is the fabul time of the grecian republ these belong to mytholog rather than to histori sicyon then is said to have been the first kingdom that wa establish in greec the begin of it is place by historian in the year of the world one thousand nine hundr and fifteen befor christ two thousand eightynin and befor the first olympiad one thousand three hundr and thirteen it first king wa aegialeu it is said to have last a thousand year a m the kingdom of argo in peloponnesu began a thousand and eighti year befor the first olympiad in the time of abraham the first king wa inachu thi wa succeed by the kingdom of mycena to which place the seat of govern wa transfer from argo by perseu the grandson of acrisiu the king of argo whom perseu unfortun flew eurystheu the third in success from him wa expel by the heraclida or descend of hercul who made themselv master of peloponnesu a m the kingdom of athen wa first form into a regular govern by cecrop an egyptian thi princ have quit egypt and spent some time in travel through phoenicia and other part came at last into attica where he marri the daughter of actaeu the king of that countri and upon hi death succeed to the throne he taught the peopl who had hitherto led a wander life the use of fix habit restrain all licenti amor by oblig everi man to be content with one wife and for the better administr of justic he institut the celebr court of areopagu amphictyon the third king of athen establish the famou amphictyon council which make so capit a figur in the histori of greec and codru the last princ of thi line devot himself for the good of hi countri for in a war between the athenian and the heraclida in which the latter had penetr to the veri gate of athen codru hear that the oracl had declar that that peopl should prove conqueror whose king first fell in the contest disguis himself in the habit of a peasant and go over to the enemi camp provok one of their common soldier who instantli flew him the heraclida be inform of thi circumst conclud that heaven had declar against them and they therefor retreat to their own countri without strike anoth blow after the death of codru the titl of king wa abolish at athen and that of archon or chiefgovernor substitut in it stead the durat of thi last offic wa at first for the possessor life it wa afterward limit to ten year and final to one a m cadmu wa the founder of the kingdom of thebe to him are attribut sixteen letter of the greek alphabet

wa the polit situat of greec in the earli period of it histori dure which we see that kingli govern prevail in all the state but thi wa soon chang everi where except in macedonia for a republican mode of govern which howev wa diversifi into as mani variou form as there were differ citi accord to the peculiar charact of each respect peopl these differ state though total independ and sometim at war with one anoth were yet unit by one common languag and one religion by the celebr of public game at which they all assist and particularli by the famou amphictyon council which met twice a year at thermopyla in order to deliber about the gener interest of those state of whose deputi it wa compos the state that sent deputi to thi council were twelv viz the thessalian the theban the dorian the ionian the perhaebean the magnet the locrian the oetan the phthiot the malean the phocian and the dolopian each of these state sent two deputi to the council one of whom wa name hieromnemon and took care of religion the other wa call pylagora and attend to the civil interest of hi commun after offer up sacrific to apollo diana latona and minerva the deputi took an oath import that they would never subvert ani citi of the amphictyon never stop the cours of water either in war or peac and that they would oppos ani attempt to lessen the rever and author of the god to whom they had paid their ador these differ motiv to confederaci unit the greek for a time into a bodi of great power and greater renown by thi associ a countri not half so larg as england wa abl to disput the empir of the world with the greatest monarch of the earth by thi associ they were abl not onli to oppos but even to rout and dispers the most numer armi of persia reduc their power to so low an ebb as to make them submit to the most mortifi condit of peac but of all the state of greec the two that made the most capit figur were athen and lacedaemon and of these therefor it will be necessari to give a more particular account than our limit will allow us to give of the rest chap ii of the govern of sparta and the law of lycurgu lacedaemon as we have alreadi observ wa in the begin govern by king of which thirteen in success held the rein of power of the race of the pelopida under the heraclida who succeed them instead of one king the peopl admit two who govern with equal author thi chang is said to have been owe to the follow circumst aristodemu die left two son euristhen and procl who were twin and so veri much alik that it wa hardli possibl to distinguish the one from the other and the mother equal attach to both and desir of advanc both to the throne pretend that she realli could not tell which of them wa first born or which had the best claim the peopl therefor invest both with the sovereign power and thi form of govern howev strang continu to subsist for sever centuri it wa dure thi latter period that the helot or peasant of sparta were inslav for these peopl have taken up arm in order to vindic their right to the same privileg as the citizen enjoy which the two first king had bestow upon them and of which agi had depriv them they were after a violent struggl subdu and to punish them for their rebellion they and their poster were condemn to perpetu slaveri and to render their condit as disgrac as it wa miser all other slave were call by the gener name of helot to prevent the repetit of these and the like disord to which thi littl state wa subject lycurgu institut hi celebr bodi of law which make so conspicu a figur in the histori of greec and which continu for a long time to render lacedaemon at onc the terror and the umpir of the neighbor kingdom but befor he gave thi proof of hi patriot and hi abil as a legisl he gave if possibl a still more strike proof of hi disinterested and love of justic for have succeed to the throne by the death of hi elder brother polydect without issu and the queendowag hi sisterinlaw afterward prove with child she offer to destroy the birth provid he would marri her and admit her into a share of power lycurgu dissembl hi resent at so unnatur a propos and fear that she might use mean to put her design in execut assur her that as soon as the child wa born he would take care to remov it out of the way accordingli she wa deliv of a boy which lycurgu command to be brought to him and present him to the peopl as their law sovereign by the name of charilau he continu thenceforward to act not as king but as regent the better to qualifi himself for the offic of a legisl which he wa now about to assum he travel into crete and afterward into asia where he is said to have made the first discoveri of the work of homer from thenc he went into egypt and have thu made himself acquaint with the custom and institut of the variou countri through which he pass he at length return home and be assist in hi design by some of the lead men of the state he publish hi celebr code of law by which it wa enact that the king should retain their right of success as befor but their author wa consider diminish by the institut of a senat consist of twentyeight member chosen from among the princip citizen into which none were elig till they were sixti year of age the king howev still enjoy all their outward mark of digniti and respect they had the chief seat in everi public assembl they gave their vote first they receiv ambassador and other stranger of distinct and in time of war they had the command of the armi though upon these occas they were subject to the control of the senat who sometim oblig them to march against the enemi or return home when they had least inclin to do either the senat too were the more respect as they held their place for life and besid be possess of so consider a share of the execut were invest with the whole of the judici power and thi last part of their duti they execut with such integr and discret that though there lay an appeal from them to the peopl yet their decre were hardli ever revers their author howev wa about a centuri after temper by the erect of a superior court call the court of the ephori consist of but five member chosen annual into offic and elect from among the peopl and these had a power to arrest and imprison even the person of their king if they act in a mannner unbecom their station in order to reconcil the peopl to thi mode of govern in which though they had a nomin they had no real share lycurgu fell upon two expedi equal bold and decis these were to divid all the land of the state equal among the citizen and to abolish the use of money the land of laconia he divid into thirti thousand part and those of sparta into nine thousand and these he portion out to the respect inhabit of each district to abolish the use of money he did not think it necessari to depriv those who were possess of gold and silver of their properti he thought it suffici to cri down the valu of those metal and to order that noth but iron money should pass in exchang for ani commod thi coin also he made so heavi and fix at so low a rate that a cart and two oxen were requir to carri home a sum of ten mina or about twenti pound sterl as thi coin had no currenc among the other state of greec it soon fell into contempt even among the spartan themselv who despis it so much that money wa at last brought into difus and few troubl themselv with more than wa necessari to answer their daili expens to enforc the practic of temper and sobrieti lycurgu further ordain that all the men should eat in one common hall in public everi one wa oblig to send thither hi provis monthli consist of one bushel of flour eight measur of wine five pound of chees and two pound and a half of fig and thi regul wa so rigidli observ that a long time after when agi return from a success expedit he wa sever reprimand for have eaten with hi queen in privat black broth wa their favorit dish of what ingredi it wa compos is not known but as they use no flesh in their entertain it probabl resembl those lenten soup which are still in use on the contin dionysiu the tyrant found thi fare veri unpalat but as the cook assert the broth wa noth without the season of fatigu and hunger to accustom the youth to earli habit of disciplin and obedi lycurgu took their educ out of the hand of their parent and commit it to master appoint by the state so desir inde wa he of have a hardi and robust race of citizen that he began the work of educ even from the time of the mother concept make it her duti to use such diet and exercis as might fit her to produc a healthi and vigor offspr nay such children as were born with ani capit defect were not suffer to be brought up but were expos to perish in a cavern near mount taygetu and such as upon a public view were deem to be sound and healthi were adopt as children of the state and deliv to their parent to be nurs with rigor and sever from their tenderest year they were accustom to make no choic in their eat not to be afraid in the dark or when left alon not to be peevish or fret to walk barefoot to lie hard at night to wear the same cloth summer and winter and to fear noth from their equal at the age of seven they were taken from their parent and deliv over to the class for a public educ their disciplin there wa still more rigid and sever they were still oblig to go barefoot their head were shave and they

hippia disappoint in hi hope of aid from the lacedaemonian had recours to one whom he consid as a much more power patron thi wa artaphern governor of sardi for the king of persia to him he repres the facil with which an entir conquest might be made of athen and the persian court influenc by the prospect of gain such an addit of territori and particularli such an extent of seacoast readili adopt the propos when the athenian therefor sent a messeng into persia to vindic their proceed with regard to hippia they receiv for answer that if they wish to be safe they must admit hippia for their king but these gallant republican had too ardent a passion for liberti and too root an avers to slaveri patient to submit to so imperi a mandat they therefor return to it a flat and peremptori refus and from that time forward the athenian and persian began to prepar for commenc hostil against each other the gallantri inde of the athenian upon thi occas is the more to be admir as their number and resourc bore no proport to those of the princ whom they thu set at defianc the persian monarch wa at that time the most power sovereign in the univers wherea the small state of athen did not contain abov twenti thousand citizen ten thousand stranger and about fifti or sixti thousand servant the state of sparta which afterward took such a consider share and made so capit a figur in the war against persia wa still more inconsider with respect to number these did not amount to abov nine thousand citizen and about thirti thousand peasant and yet these two state with veri littl assist from the inferior republ were abl not onli to resist but even to baffl and defeat all the attempt of the persian monarch a memor instanc what act of heroism may be perform by men anim by a love of freedom and inspir with a passion for militari glori the restor of hippia wa not the onli caus of quarrel between the persian and the athenian the greek coloni of lonia aeolia and caria that had been settl for

had not yet lost all memori of the liberti they had formerli enjoy and they therefor seiz everi opportun of deliv themselv from the persian yoke and recov their ancient independ in thi they were now encourag by histiaeu the governor or tyrant as he wa call of miletu for all the persian governor of these provinc were by the greek call tyrant thi man have render hi fidel suspect at the persian court had no other way of provid for hi own safeti than by excit the ionian to a revolt by hi direct therefor aristagora hi deputi first appli to the lacedaemonian for assist and fail of success in that quarter he next had recours to the athenian where he met with a more favor recept the athenian were at thi time inflam with the highest resent against the persian monarch on account of hi naughti

with a few of the insurg he wa conductd to artaphern and that inhuman tyrant immeedi order him to be crucifi and hi head o be sent to dariu the commenc of thi war natur tend to widen the breach between the athenian and persian and the conclus of it wa no less calcul to inflam the pride and presumpt of the latter and to inspir them with the ambiti thought of make an entir conquest of greec to pave the way for thi grand project dariu in the twentyeighth year of hi reign have recal all hi other gener sent hi soninlaw mardoniu to command throughout the maritim part of asia and particularli to

demand earth and water the usual method of requir submiss from inferior state these spirit republican threw the one into a well and the other into a ditch and tauntingli bid them take earth and water from thenc nay they went still farther they resolv to punish he aeginetan for have base submit to the ower of persia and by that mean betray the ommon caus of greec these peopl inde made some resist they even carri on a aval war against the athenian but these last havg at length overcom them increas their own avi to such a degre as to render it almost an equal atch for that of persia in the mean time dariu have complet hi vie sent away hi gener dati and artahern to what be consid as a certain conest they were furnish with a fleet of six undr ship and an armi of an hundr and wenti thousand men

a suffici number of chain for bind the ison to oppos thi formid invas the athenian d onli about ten thousand men but all of them imat with that invinc spirit which the love liberti ever inspir they were at thi time ade by three of the greatest gener and statesmen eir countri ever produc though no countri er produc more these were miltiad theistocl and aristid the first wa look on as the ablest

wa talk to him on the subject d say that he would make an excel magist it he had more imparti god forbid repli he that i should ever sit upon a tribun where my friend should find no more favor than stranger as to aristid he wa so rigidli and inflex just that hi name ha descend to poster as almost anoth term for justic itself the first brunt of the war fell upon the eretrian who be utterli unabl to oppos so mighti a forc in the field shut themselv up in the town but though they defend the place with great gallantri yet after a sieg of seven day it wa taken by storm and reduc to ash the inhabit were put in chain and sent as the first fruit of victori to the persian monarch but he contrari to their expect treat them with great leniti and gave them a villag in the countri of cissa for their resid where apolloniu tyanaeu found their descend six hundr year after elat with thi success the persian advanc into the heart of the countri and be direct in their march by hippia the expel tyrant of athen they soon arriv in the plain of marathon about ten mile distant from that citi there howev it wa that the athenian resolv to oppos them but not think themselv singli equal to such an undertak they first sent to the spartan for assist and would certainli have obtain it had it not been for a foolish superstit which prevail among that peopl and which would not allow them to begin a march befor the full moon they then appli to the other state of greec but these were too much intimid by the power of persia to ventur to move in their defens oblig therefor to depend upon their own courag alon they collect all their forc to the number of ten thousand men and entrust the command of them to ten gener of whom miltiad wa the chief and each of these wa to have the direct of the troop for one day at a time in regular success but thi arrang wa soon found to be so veri inconveni that by the advic of aristid the chief command wa vest in miltiad alon as the ablest and most experienc of all the gener at the same time it wa resolv in a council of war though onli by a major of one vote to meet the enemi in the open field instead of wait for them within the wall of the citi miltiad sensibl of the inferior of hi number when compar to those of the enemi endeavor to make up for thi defect by take possess of an advantag ground he therefor drew up hi armi at the foot of a mountain so that the enemi should not be abl to surround him or charg him in the rear at the same time he fortifi hi flank with a number of larg tree that were cut down for the purpos dati saw the advantag which the athenian must deriv from thi masterli disposit but reli on the superior of hi number and unwil to wait till the spartan succor should arriv he resolv to begin the engag the signal for battl howev wa no sooner given than the athenian instead of wait for the onset of the enemi accord to their usual custom rush in upon them with irresist furi the persian regard thi first step as the result of mad and despair rather than of deliber courag but they were soon convinc of their mistak when they found that the athenian maintain the charg with the same spirit with which they had begun it miltiad had purpos and judici made hi wing much stronger than hi center which wa command by themistocl and aristid the persian avail themselv of thi circumst attack the center with great braveri and were just upon the point of make it give way when the two wing have now becom victori suddenli wheel about and fall upon the enemi in both flank at onc threw them into disord the rout in a moment becam univers and they fled to their ship with great precipit the athenian pursu them as far as the beach and even set sever of their ship on fire it wa on thi occas that cynaegyru the brother of the poet aeschylu seiz one of the enemi ship with hi right hand as they were push it off from the shore when hi right hand wa cut off he laid hold of the vessel with hi left and that likewis be lopt off he at last seiz

hippia who wa the chief caus of the war is thought to have perish in thi battl though some say he escap and afterward die miser at lemno such wa the famou battl of marathon one of the most import that is to be found in histori as it first taught the greek to despis the power of the persian monarch and brave to maintain their own independ and thu to go on cultiv those art and scienc which had so
