therefor though much more confin to breviti follow the same method make it serv as a proper introduct there be mani thing in the volumin origin which i conceiv may with less inconveni be dispens with it wa a constant maxim in all wellregul govern to give a just encourag to merit and thi by proport reward to the servic done for merit must be suppos to consist in the perform of some virtuou or heroic action direct for the public good and as virtu is either militari or civil so the distribut of reward is differ either by bestow degre and titl of honor or by donat of wealth so that in either construct virtu may have it proper and suitabl reward but the proper reward of militari virtu is honor to which distinct head thi work is confin honor which aristotl call the greatest of exterior good and be an object of a nobler ambit than the accumul of wealth is princip the aim of that virtu we understand by valor which spring from more gener spirit and ha been the constant foundat of rais men to the highest emin of glori and superior digniti but that fame might not lose it self in an unbound notion it wa at length thought fit to reduc honor into form and order by invest the person merit with some particular titl or appel of excel the origin of all nobil of which knighthood as it ha been account the most suitabl reward to the greatest virtu so it ha been esteem the chief and primari honor among mani nation the roman held honor and virtu in that esteem that they deifyd and dedic templ to them they made them so contigu in their situat that there wa no other passag to that of honor but through the templ of virtu mystic admonish that honor wa not to be attain by ani other way in sever of the roman coin we see honor and virtu repres togeth in one revers and in one medal the face of honor so shadow that of virtu that but a littl of it appear honor be the more illustri of the two and where we behold ani person outwardli adorn with it we are to judg him inwardli endu with virtu inasmuch as honor is hi due and justli bestow upon him in trace the origin of knighthood we are not so vain to say with the french that s michael wa the premier chevali yet thu much we may assert that ti near as ancient as valor and heroic virtu notwithstand the ceremoni and circumst of have vari accord to sever age and nation and therefor with much probabl we may deriv the origin of militari honor from the trojan and greek among whom as knight of great renown were hector troilu aen antenor agamemnon menelau pelu tydeu etc and thu homer use the word in the same sens as equ wa afterward among the latin among whom thu nestor spoke that honor knight upon a more substanti basi we shall descend to the roman among whom in the veri infanc of their militari glori a societi of knight wa institut immedi after their union with the sabin romulu enrol centuria tre equitum three centuri of knight out of the chiefest famili whom he appoint to be hi lifeguard and call them clere from their activ and dispatch in martial affair tarquiniu priscu made an addit to these centuri the like did serviu tulliu who ordain that those who should succeed in that bodi should be elect ex censu viz from a consider and certain valuat of their estat who had the greatest cen and were of the most nobl famili say dyoni halicarn and soon after the equestrian class began to be form and constitut one of the three order of the commonwealth which were thu rank accord to livi senatu ordo equestri and pleb which in the roman liter note is set down after thi manner con sen e ord p q r and forasmuch as thi degre is place between the patrician or senat and the plebeian it answer exactli the state of our knight between the nobil and commonalti and from thi order to the height of nobil which resid in the senat wa the way prepar juniu brutu be the first who wa rais to a senat from the equestrian order it wa a constitut as old as tibriuss reign that none should be admit unless freeborn or a gentleman for three gener and inde for a long time none were elect knight but the best sort of gentlemen and person of extract as wa the illustri macena aavi regibu ortn equ mart who aspir no higher not out of ani incapac of attain greater honor but that he desir them not say paterculu yet at length through corrupt of time plebeian and freedmen be too frequent receiv into thi degre too near a parallel among the knight of thi age occas their power to grow less and less till it shrunk to noth so that the place and offic of judg which they befor had execut becam conferr upon the publican and when cicero wa consul anno ab urb conditi the equestrian order stood in need of reestablish whereupon they were then incorpor into that commonwealth in the third degre all act pass in the name of the senat the peopl of rome and the equestrian order they often enjoy abroad the govern of sever provinc whereof egypt had thi peculiar to itself that none of the senat were admit but onli those of the equestrian order whose decre augustu command to be had in like regard as if the magistr of rome or king consul or praetor had pronounc them as a mark of emin they had the titl of splendidi and illustr bestow upon them and sometim have been call most sacr knight and besid other privileg they had seat with the senat in the circu maximu and by the roscian law sat next them in the theater they had likewis a colleg call collegium equitum and templ were dedic to the goddess fortun under the titl of equestri fortuna have shown the digniti and honor of the equestrian order among the roman we shall now touch upon the degre of knighthood which have been person and may be comprehend under the modern titl of equit aurati or milit simplic as distinguish from the sever order of chivalri institut in christendom in the circumst of whose creation we confess noth in the roman ordo equestri ha place though that might be the ground and origin of the digniti and one common end in both name the pursuit of militari exploit and servic in the war of the degre of knighthood we shall first of the monozon i e knight begirt with the militari girdl a custom devolv to the german and gaul from ancient time and from them to afterag sir henri spelman note that the late emperor confer the digniti af knighthood with the militari girdl instead of all other arm becaus that part more emin amongst them girdeth supporteth and adorneth the rest whenc seldom call thi gird the most essenti part of the ceremoni nor do we find among the variou ceremoni of knighthood ani that have continu so constant in practic as the endow with girdl and sword ornament proper to the digniti and mark of honor and virtu with which the statu and portraitur of knight on their graveston have been adorn for as at thi day knight are style equit aurati from the golden spur heretofor put on at their creation so were they more ancient singulo miletari donati in respect when ani one wa knight he wa not onli smitten with the sword but invest with sword and belt yet retain at the creat our knight of the bath as the old formulari thu ha it then shall the king of great favor take the sword and gid the quir therewith secondli the baccalaurei or knight batchelor are to be consid who are indiffer style chevali milit equit aurati and knight thi degre is truli account the first of all militari digniti and the foundat of all honor in our nation and is deriv from if not the same with that immedi preced for as the ceremoni of a gentl touch on the shoulder with the flat side of the sword ha been sinc use instead of girt with the sword and belt especi in time of war or in hast as an initi into the militari order so on the contrari it is not unusu nowaday for the princ at least gladi if not cingulo donar for he oftentim bestow the sword upon the person he knigh miraeu give them the epithet aurati from the privileg of wear gold upon their sword and spur omit tiraquel fanci distinct between mile and equ auratu who allow the former to signifi a knight nobl befor and the other to deno one whom we call a knight and no gentleman or applic to the neapoan gentlemen usual call cavaliri who are all style equit though they never have attain the knightli digniti the third sort were knight baneret who so well deserv in the war that they were afterward permit to use vexillum quadratum a squar banner whenc they were call equit vexillarii or chevali a bunier from the dutch banerheer lord or master of the banner camden conceiv thi titl first devis by k edward in recompens of martial prowess a recit of which digniti is mention in a patenr e to john coupland for hi servic in take david king of scot prison but it wa much more ancient with us as well as in franc and they had particular robe and other ornament given them from the crown ad apparatum suum pro militia tanquam pro baneretto a rege suscipienda etc viz ad unum tunicam etc after which is set down the particular robe and other ornament appoint for hi creation to show thi digniti yet more ancient there is the evid of a writ in k edw ds time for furnish thoma bardolf with the robe of a baneret it is an honor esteem the last among the greatest viz nobilitum majorum or the first of the second rank and is place in the middl between the baron and the other knight in which respect the baneret may be call vexillariu minor as if he were the lesser bannerbear to the end he might be so differenc from the greater name the baron to whom the right of bear a squar banner doe belong but there are some remark differ between these knight and knightsbatchelor as in the occas and circumst of their creation the baneret be not creat unless at a time when the king standard is erect and that he bear hi own banner in the field whilst the knightbatchelor follow that which is anoth thi farther differ is observ between them that the knightbaneret had so mani gentlemen hi servant at command as that he could rais a banner and make up a compani of soldier to be maintain at hi tabl and with hi own pay but the knightbatchelor had not suffici for thi and therefor march under the banner of anoth and the wage of the baneret were doubl nxt to these we are to mention knight of the bath which is a degre that ha the investitur and titl of knight with an addit denomin deriv from part of the ceremoni of hi creation it is the gener receiv opinion that our k hen first institut these knight which is justifi by sir john froisard who say he creat of them at hi coron choos them from such as were either hi favorit or had pretens to it from their person merit or servic but if the ceremoni and circumst of their creation be well consid it may be infer that he rather restor the ancient way of make knight than institut them and consequ that the knight of the bath are realli no other than knightsbatchelor that is such as are creat with those ceremoni wherewith knightsbatchelor were formerli creat by ecclesiast but some of them have been laid asid were then brought again into use and made peculiar to thi degre and sinc continu to them upon some solemn and great occas at the first view they look like a distinct order of knighthood but can not be so account becaus they have no statut assign them nor are in case of vacanc suppli the essenti of distinct order nor do they wear their robe beyond the time of that occas upon which they were creat as chiefli the coron of a king or queen the creation of a princ of wale duke of york and the like wherea also their number is uncertain and alway at the pleasur of the king favin call them knight of the crown becaus to distinguish them from esquir they wore upon their left shoulder an escutcheon of black silk embroid with three crown of gold but therein he mistak for they never use onli a silk lace and the jewel they wore wa made of gold contain three crown with thi motto tria juncta in una hang down under the left arm at a carnat ribbon worn cross the bodi thi lead us to the degre of baronet who seem alli to knighthood by have grant them the addit of sir to be set befor their name but thi give them not the digniti of knighthood nor can they properli be flyle knight until they be actual knight it is a degre erect anno jac and the grant made by letter patent under the great seal of england it is hereditari to them and the heir male of their bodi law begotten for ever and by a subsequ decre of the said king preced is grant to them befor all baneret except such as should be made by the king under hi standard display in an armi royal in open war and the king person present and next to and immedi after the younger son of viscount and baron the ground for erect thi degre wa partli martial for though themselv were not enjoin person servic in the war yet each baronet wa to maintain thirti foot soldier for three year in ireland after the rate of eight penc per day for the defens of that kingdom and chiefli to secur the plantat of ulster they were at least to be descend from a grandfath on the father side that bore arm and had a revenu of l per ann or land of old rent of equal valu with l per ann of improv land or at least two part of three of such estat in possess the other third in revers expect upon one life held onli in jointur the year after king jame i ad some new privileg and ornament viz to knight those alreadi made that were no knight and the heir hereaft of everi baronet should at the age of one and twenti year receiv knighthood likewis that all baronet might bear in canton or in an inescutcheon the arm of ulster and farther to have place in the armi of the king in the gross near about the royal standard sinc the institut of baronet in england there have been made divers in ireland after the like form and the knight of nova scotia in the west indi were ordain in imit of baronet in england by the said king jame a d for the plant that countri by scotch coloni and the degre made likewis hereditari these latter wear an orang tawni ribbon as their badg to distinguish them from other knight and it appear there wa an intent to move hi then majesti that all baronet and knight bachelor might wear ribbon of sever color some badg or jewel in such sort as did the knight of the bath to distinguish the one from the other but that matter drop we shall now observ the etymolog of equ mile chevali ritter and sir the grecian had a titl of honor equival to the signif of equ in the latin from equ an hors becaus one part of the ceremoni wherebi thi honor becam confer wa the give of an hors or becaus have an hors at the public charg they receiv the stipend of an horseman to serv in the war hors be symbol of war bello armantur equi it is to be note that the degre of knighthood in the dialect of other nation ha the same deriv for in the french a knight is call chevali in the german ridder or ritter q d rider so the gheslagen ridder is interpret the dub knight in the italian it is cavagliero in the old british morchog concern which hear one of jefferi chaucer scholar equ ab equo is said of veri right and chevali is said of chevalri in which a rider call is a knight arragon done also specifi caballiero through all that parti is dame of worship and so took hi gin of spur of gold and chiefli ride and though the word mile signifi at first ani legal enrol for the war which inrol wa twofold honoraria and vulgari yet upon the decay of the roman empir upon the irrupt of the innumer forc of the alani goth vandal etc which consist in hors their foot wa render useless mile wa no longer said of him that serv on foot in the war but began to be properli spoken of the horseman whenc it came into vogu that among the titl of nobil he who had that of mile bestow on him wa understood to be horseman or equ that is of the equestrian digniti seldom observ mile to be equivoc and that in the old feodal law of the empir it signifi a gentleman as the word gentleman is signifi in nobili and with us it ha been frequent use to denot both gentlemen and knight for milit denot gentlemen or great freehold and not dub knight viz such who hold by knight servic from a lord of a manor and such who are chosen from the sever counti to serv in the high court of parliament mile even in the saxon time denot sometim a digniti but about the year becom a titl of honor it is sinc most gener appropri to person who have receiv knighthood correspond to equ and chevali though inde less proper in regard knighthood is the digniti of horsemanship and the tenur of land by knight fee here in england ancient call regal servitium is in truth hors servic and the tenant such as serv the king on horseback in war are gentlemen at least if not of nobl extract minshew say the equit which heretofor follow and accompani the emperor are in the german tongu call knecht that is servitor or minist but camden say knecht in saxon cniht wa in far more ancient time accept as an honorari titl and among the old german signifi a person arm with spear and lanc the ensign of their knighthood as in aftertim such were among other nation adorn with a girdl and belt sinc call equit aurati and sometim simpli milit the addit sir to the name of all knight baneret knight of the bath and bachelor knight pronounc at the time when they are creat with thi compel aris sir john or sir thoma etc is account parcel of their style which the baneret enjoy by virtu of a claus in their patent it is a contract of the old french sire taken for seigneur or lord from the greek but how it came to be first given we can not find nevertheless our english writer have bestow it upon the major part of the nobil after they had been receiv into the order of knighthood and in the life of st thoma becker written about the time of king edw we meet with the titl prefix to the name of the four knight who slew the said st thoma the ensign of the equestrian order among the roman by which they were made wa a public hors or a gold ring yet still to those who had equestrian cens the hors wa the ancient badg of the two but when through the multitud of these knight no public hors were assign but to such who were readi to enter upon militari servic and to fight in the legion such were call legionari knight to distinguish them from the rest who had onli receiv the honor of a goldr for they were not all employ in war the censor after the institut of that offie ab urb condita and afterward the emperor were the person who bestow thi equu militari or publicu as it wa call from the annual allow to keep him which they gave unto those of known virtu and approv life compel him to serv in the war though against hi will but in the more ancient method of elect constraint wa not use and upon neglig in the care of these hors or ani blemish reproach or infami or loss of patrimoni in the knight the hors were not onli taken away but the knight wholli disfranchisd rosinu lay down the manner and order use in eject such knight add a recit be made of all the knight that were enrol those whose name he omit were therebi understood to be depriv of that digniti when they had serv in the war the time appoint by law it wa the custom to lead their hors by the bridl into the forum befor the duumvir censor and give an account under whom and what gener or captain they had serv they were thereupon dismiss from farther servic in the war an exampl whereof plutarch relat to have been given by pompey himself but wherea among the roman inscript we find equo publico honoratu donatu ornatu and exornatu such is not to be constru to be of equestrian digniti but onli to have receiv the praemia militaria with which the emperor use to recompens some particular exploit by the honor of such a gift accord to salmasiu equu publicu by a wondrou nevertheless an accustom speech among the roman is the knight qui equo publico meret and qui equo publico donatu the other deserv person as to the ring in genesi we read of pharoah take off hi ring and put it upon joseph hand when they came in fashion with the roman the senat at first wore iron one which were account the ensign of militari virtu receiv upon a public account howbeit in process of time when gold ring were drawn into use none but senat and knight had them the differ among the ring of the three order in the state were as licetu observ gold ring set with preciou stone were given to the senat onli plain ring without stone to the knight and iron ring to the plebeian or freebornmen insomuch that equestri dignit donar and annulo honorar is a promiscu phrase in tacitu to give the digniti of knighthood and at the battl of canna by the two measur or bushel of gold ring sent to carthag the number of the roman knight there slain wa comput at length freedmen be creat knight the ju annulorum the right of wear gold ring becam promiscu among the german the shield and lanc were account the grand badg of militari honor or knighthood thi the lombard the frank and our countrymen all descend out of germani use and wa to us in the opinion of sir hen spelman the foundat of the knightli order much like the ancient german wa the custom of make knight among the irish and favin note the shield and lanc were the proper arm appertain to a french knight which esquir armig carri alway after their master shield and scute as they are vulgarli call i e equestrian target inclin to an oval not shield or buckler of foot soldier anoth ensign and ornament of knightli honor is the cingulum militar or balteu which varro say is tuscan signifi a militari girdl which were garnish with great buckl stud and ring of pure gold to show their digniti and power in militari command and with such a belt set with pearl and preciou stone young athelstan wa gird when he receiv knighthood from hi grandfath king alfr our knight were no less ancient known by these belt than by their gilt sword spur etc howbeit the use now onli appear in knight of the bath to thi belt wa also ad a sword not of ordinari use and therefor term the sword of a knight which wa hallow with great ceremoni anoth emin badg is the golden spur wherewith at the time of their creation knight spur were wont to be adorn and to these a littl after the conquest were ad far more and greater oruament they were usual put on after the person had been present to the princ who gave the honor to signifi that the newmad knight should not onli declar hi valor by hi sword but also by the manag of hi hors which he should encourag and excit with hi spur to the carri on hi valiant design these spur have been of that esteem that knight batchelor are latin equit aurati among the german ritter dess gulden sporn and with us heretofor knight of the spur and sever famili by the name of knight bear for their arm the spur on a canton it is farther certifyd among the right of a knight baneret that upon the account of hi knighthood he may wear gilt spur as well as a gilt sword and that the spur are essenti may be collect from the degrad of a knight where hi gilt spur are first cut off with an hatchet the case of sir andra harcla in the last place is the collar an ensign of knightli digniti among the german gaul briton dane and goth among whom it wa customari to wear them as denot such as were remark for their valor but in latr time it wa the peculiar fashion of knight among us to wear golden collar compos of s s or other variou devic so that those monument are known to be erect for knight on whose portraitur such ornament are found the qualif for knighthood are princip three merit the bare mention whereof shall suffic here birth viz that the parti who enter thereinto ought first to make appear they be gentlemen of three patern descent bear coat armor and much the same wa the law of the empir under frederick a d some think it also insuffici unless descend so by the mother side at least she must be a freed woman and estat which also serv to support the digniti thu wealth wa so much regard among the chaldonian that those who were rich bore the name of knight it wa estat that entitl a man to thi honor among the roman for the censor might compel ani citizen equal to the equestrian cens whom he thought fit to take that order and thi consist of sesterc i e l of our money and as in old rome so here in england not long after the conquest they who held a knight fee viz acr of land might claim it say camden but it appear from seldom that no certain number or extent of acr made a knight fee and temp hen and edw and edw the censu militi wa measur by l by the year or more and by the royal prerog some who held then at other time then and sometim l

dignifi yet the gate of honor wa not then shut against those who want rich deserv well of their countri for when princ confer such digniti upon men of narrow fortun they usual bestow with them annual pension or land agreeabl to the judgment of the author of the divis du mond who say that the honor of knighthood is not to be given ani person who ha not a consider estat unless suffici mean to
