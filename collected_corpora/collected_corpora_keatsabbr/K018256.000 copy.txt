map of the world the farther adventur of robinson cruso etc that home proverb use on so mani occas in england viz that what is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh wa never more verifi than in the stori of my life ani one would think that after thirtyf year afflict and a varieti of unhappi circumst which few men if ani ever went through befor and after near seven year of peac and enjoy in the full of all thing grown old and when if ever it might be allow me to have had experi of everi state of middl life and to know which wa most adapt to make a man complet happi i say after all thi ani one would have thought that the nativ propens to rambl which i gave an account of in my first set out into the world to have been so pre domin in my thought should be worn out the volatil part be fulli evacu or at least condens and i might at year of age have been a littl inclin to stay at home and have done ventur life and fortun ani more nay farther the common motiv of foreign adventur wa taken away in me for i had no fortun to make i had noth to seek if i had gain ten thousand pound i had been no richer for i had alreadi suffici for me and for those i had to leav it to and that i had wa visibl increas for have no great famili i could not spend the incom of what i had unless i would set up for an expens way of live such as a great famili servant equipag gayeti and the like which were thing i had no notion of or inclin to so that i had noth inde to do but to sit still and fulli enjoy what i had got and see it increas daili upon my hand yet all these thing had no effect upon me or at least not enough to resist the strong inclin i had to go abroad again which hung about me like a chronic distemp particularli the desir of see my new plantat in the island and the coloni i left there run in my head continu i dream of it all night and my imagin run upon it all day it wa uppermost in all my thought and my fanci work so steadili and strongli upon it that i talk of it out of sleep in short noth could remov it out of my mind it even broke so violent into all my discours that it made my convers tiresom for i could talk of noth els all my discours run into it even to impertin and i saw it my self i have often heard person of good judgment say that all the stir peopl make in the world about ghost and apparit is owe to the strength of imagin and the power oper of fanci in their mind that there is no such thing as a spirit appear or a ghost walk and the like that peopl pore affection upon the past convers of their deceas friend so realiz it to them that they are capabl of fanci upon some extraordinari circumst that they see them talk to them and are answer by them when in truth there is noth but shadow and vapor in the thing and they realli know noth of the matter for my part i know not to thi hour whether there are ani such thing as real apparit specter or walk of peopl after they are dead or whether there is ani thing in the stori they tell us of that kind more than the product of vapor sick mind and wander fanci but thi i know that my imagin work up to such a height and brought me into such ecstasi of vapor or what els i may call it that i actual suppos my self often time upon the spot at my old castl behind the tree saw my old spaniard friday father and the reprob sailor i left upon the island nay i fanci i talk with them and look at them so steadili though i wa broad awak as at person just befor me and thi i did till i often fright my self with the imag my fanci repres to me one time in my sleep i had the villaini of the pyrat sailor so live relat to me by the first spaniard and friday father that it wa surpris they told me how they barbar attempt to murder all the spaniard and that they set fire to the provis they had laid up on purpos to distress and starv them thing that i had never heard of and that inde were never all of them true in fact but it wa so warm in my imagin and so realizd to me that to the hour i saw them i could not be persuad but that it wa or would be true also how i resent it when the spaniard complain to me and how i brought them to justic tri them befor me and order them all three to be hang what there wa realli in thi shall be seen in it place for howev i came to form such thing in my dream and what secret convers of spirit inject it yet there wa veri much of it true i say i own that thi dream had noth in it liter and specif true but the gener part wa so true the base villani behavior of these three harden rogu wa such and had been so much wors than all i can describ that the dream had too much similitud of the fact and as i would afterward have punish them sever so if i had hang them all i had been much in the right and should have been justifi both by the law of god and man but to return to my stori in thi kind of temper i had live some year i had no enjoy of my life no pleasant hour no agreeabl divers but what had some thing or other of thi in it so that my wife who saw my mind so wholli bent upon it told me veri serious one night that she believ there wa some secret power impuls of provid upon me which had determin me to go thither again and that she found noth hinder my go but my be engag to a wife and children she told me that it wa true she could not think of part with me but as she wa assur that if she wa dead it would be the first thing i would do so as it seem to her that the thing wa determin abov she would not be the onli obstruct for if i thought fit and rosolvd to go here she found me veri intent upon her word and that i look veri earnestli at her so that it a littl disord her and she stop i ask her whi she did not go on and say out what she wa go to say but i perceiv her heart wa too full and some tear stood in her eye speak out my dear said i are you will i should go no say she veri affection i am far from will but if you are resolv to go say she and rather than i will be the onli hindranc i will go with you for though i think it a most preposter thing for one of your year and in your condit yet if it must be said she again weep i will not leav you for if it be of heaven you must do it there is no resist it and if heaven make it your duti to go he will also make it mine to go with you or otherwis dispos of me that i may not obstruct it thi affection behavior of my wife brought me a littl out of the vapor and i began to consid what i wa a do i correct my wander fanci and began to argu with my self sedat what busi i had after threescor year and after such a life of tediou suffer and disast and close in so happi and easi a manner i say what busi i had to rush into new hazard and put my self upon adventur fit onli for youth and poverti to run into with those thought i consid my new engag that i had a wife one child born and my wife then great with child of anoth that i had all the world could give me and had no need to seek hazard for gain that i wa declin in year and ought to think rather of leav what i had gain than of seek to increas it that as to what my wife had said of it be an impuls from heaven and that it should be my duti to go i had no notion of that so after mani of these cogit i struggl with the power of my imagin reason my self out of it as i believ peopl may alway do in like case if they will and in a word i conquer it compos my self with such argument as occur to my thought and which my present condit furnish me plenti with and particularli as the most effectu method i resolv to divert my self with other thing and to engag in some busi that might effectu tie me up from ani more excurs of thi kind for i found that thing return upon me chiefli when i wa idl had noth to do or ani thing of moment immedi befor me to thi purpos i bought a littl farm in the countri of bedford and resolv to remov my self thither i had a littl conveni hous upon it and the land about it i found wa capabl of great improv and that it wa mani way suit to my inclin which delight in cultiv manag plant and improv of land and particularli be an inland countri i wa remov from convers among ship sailor and thing relat to the remot part of the world in a word i went down to my farm settl my famili bought me plough harrow a cart wagon hors cow sheep and set serious to work becam in one half year a mere countri gentleman my thought were entir taken up in manag my servant cultiv the ground enclos plant etc and i live as i thought the most agreeabl life that natur wa capabl of direct or that a man alway bred to misfortun wa capabl of be retreat to i farm upon my own land i had no rent to pay wa limit by no articl i could pull up or cut down as i pleas what i plant wa for my self and what i improv wa for my famili and have thu left off the thought of wander i had not the least discomfort in ani part of life as to thi world now i thought inde that i enjoy the middl state of life that my father so earnestli recommend to me and live a kind of heavenli life someth like what is describ by the poet upon the subject of a countri life free from vice free from care age ha no pain and youth no snare but in the middl of all thi felic one blow from unforeseen provid unhing me at onc and not onli made a breach upon me inevit and incur but drove me by it consequ into a deep relaps into the wander disposit which as i may say be born in my veri blood soon recov it hold of me and like the return of a violent distemp came on with an irresist forc upon me so that noth could make ani more impress upon me thi blow wa the loss of my wife it is not my busi here to write an elegi upon my wife give a charact of her particular virtu and make my court to the sex by the flatteri of a funer sermon she wa in a few word the stay of all my affair the center of all my enterpris the engin that by her prudenc reduc me to that happi compass i wa in from the most extravag and ruinou project that flutter in my head as abov and did more to guid my rambl geniu than a mother tear a father instruct a friend counsel or all my own reason power could do i wa happi in listen to her tear and in be move by her entreati and to the last degre desol and disloc in the world by the loss of her when she wa gone the world look aukwardli round me i wa as much a stranger in it in my thought as i wa in the brasil when i went first on shore there and as much alon except as to the assist of servant as i wa in my island i knew neither what to do or what not to do i saw the world busi round me one part labor for bread and the other part squandr in vile excess or empti pleasur equal miser becaus the end they propos still fled from them for the man of pleasur everi day surfeit of hi vice and heap up work for sorrow and repent and the man of labor spent their strength in daili struggl for breadto maintain the vital strength they labor with so live in a daili circul of sorrow live but to work and work but to live as if daili bread where the onli end of wearisom life and a wearisom life the onli occas of daili bread thi put me in mind of the life i live in my kingdom the island where i suffer no more corn to grow becaus i did not want it and bred no more goat becaus i had no more use for them where the money lay in the drawer till it grew moldi and had scarc the favor to be look upon in year all these thing had i improv them as i ought to have done and as reason and religion had dictat to me would have taught me to search farther than human enjoy for a full felic and that there wa someth which certainli wa the reason and end of life superior to all these thing and which wa either to be possess or at least hope for on thi side the grave but my sage counselor wa gone i wa like a ship without a pilot that could onli run befor the wind my thought run all away again into the old affair my head quit wa turn with the whimsi of foreign adventur and all the pleasant innoc amus of my farm and my garden my cattl and my famili which befor entir possess me were noth to me had no relish and were like music to one that ha no ear or food to one that ha no tast in a word i resolv to leav off housekeep let my farm and return to london and in a few month after i did so when i came to london i wa still as uneasi as i wa befor i had no relish to the place no employ in it noth to do but to saunter about like an idl person of whom it may be said he is perfectli useless in god creation and it is not one farth matter to the rest of hi kind whether he be dead or aliv thi also wa the life which of all circumst of life wa the most my avers who had been all my day use to an activ life and i would often say to my self a state of idl is the veri dreg of life and inde i thought i wa much more suitabl employ when i wa day a make me a deal board it wa now the begin of the year when my nephew who as i had observ befor i had brought up to the sea and had made him command of a ship wa come home from a short voyag to bilboa be the first he had made and he came to me and told me that some merchant of hi acquaint had been propos to him to go a voyag for them to the east indi and to china as privat trader and now uncl say he if you will go to sea with me i will engag to land you upon your old habit in the island for we are to touch at the brasil noth can be a greater demonstr of a futur state and of the exist of an invis world than the concur of second caus with the idea of thing which we form in our mind perfectli reserv and not commun to ani in the world my nephew knew noth how far my distemp of wander wa return upon me and i knew noth of what he had in hi thought to say when that veri morn befor he came to me i had in a great deal of confus of thought and revolv everi part of my circumst in my mind come to thi resolut viz that i would go to lisbon and consult with my old seacaptain and so if it wa ration and practic i would go and see the island again and see what wa becom of my peopl there i had pleas my self with the thought of peopl the place and carri inhabit from henc get a patent for the possess and i know not what when in the middl of all thi in come my nephew as i have said with hi project of carri me thither in hi way to the east indi i paus a while at hi word and look steadili at him what devil said i sent you of thi unlucki errand my nephew startl as if he had been fright at first but perceiv i wa not much displeas with the propos he recov himself i hope it may not be an unlucki propos sir say he i dare say you would be pleas to see your new coloni there where you onc reign with more felic than most of your brother monarch in the world in a word the scheme hit so exactli with my temper that is to say the prepossess i wa under and of which i have said so much that i told him in few word if he agre with the merchant i would go with him but i told him i would not promis to go ani farther than my own island whi sir say he you dont want to be left there again i hope whi said i can you not take me up again in your return he told me it could not be possibl that the merchant would allow him to come that way with a laden ship of such valu it be a month sail out of hi way and might be three or four besid sir if i should miscarri said he and not return at all then you would be just reduc to the condit you were in befor thi wa veri ration but we both found out a remedi for it which wa to carri a frame sloop on board the ship which be taken in piec and ship on board the ship might by the help of some carpent who we agre to carri with us be set up again in the island and finish fit to go to sea in a few day i wa not long resolv for inde the importun of my nephew join in so effectu with my inclin that noth could oppos me on the other hand my wife be dead i had no bodi concern themselv so much for me as to persuad me one way or other except my ancient good friend the widow who earnestli struggl with me to consid my year my easi circumst and the needless hazard of a long voyag and abov all my young children but it wa all to no purpos i had an irresist desir to the voyag and i told her i thought there wa someth so uncommon in the impress i had upon my mind for the voyag that it would be a kind of resist provid if i should attempt to stay at home after which she ceas her expostul and join with me not onli in make provis for my voyag but also in settl my famili affair for my absenc and provid for the educ of my children in order to thi i made my will and settl the estat i had in such a manner for my children and place in such hand that i wa perfectli easi and satisfi they would have justic done them whatev might befal me and for their educ i left it wholli to my widow with a suffici mainten to her self for her care all which she richli deserv for no mother could have taken more care in their educ or understand it better and as she live till i came home i also live to thank her for it my nephew wa readi to sail about the begin of januari and i with my man friday went on board in the down the th have besid that sloop which i mention abov a veri consider cargo of all kind of necessari thing for my coloni which if i did not find in good condit i resolv to leav so first i carri with me some servant who i purpos to place there as inhabit or at least to set on work there upon my own account while i stay and either to leav them there or carri them forward as they should appear will particularli i carri two carpent a smith and a veri handi ingeni fellow who wa a cooper by trade but wa also a gener mechan for he wa dextrou at make wheel and handmil to grind corn wa a good turner and a good potmak he also made ani thing that wa proper to make of earth or of wood in a word we call him our jack of all trade with these i carri a tailor who had offer himself to go passeng to the east indi with my nephew but afterward consent to stay on our new plantat and prove a most necessari handi fellow as could be desir in mani other busi besid that of thi trade for as i observ formerli necess arm us for all employ my cargo as near as i can collect for i have not kept an account of the particular consist of a suffici quantiti of linen and some thin english stuff for cloth the spaniard that i expect to find there and enough of them as by my calcul might comfort suppli them for seven year if i rememb right the materi i carri for cloth them with glove hat shoe stock and all such thing as they could want for wear amount to abov pound includ some bed bed and household stuff particularli kitchenutensil with pot kettl peuter brass etc and near a hundr pound more in ironwork nail tool of everi kind stapl hook hing and everi necessari thing i could think of i carri also an hundr spare arm musket and fuze besid some pistol a consider quantiti of shot of all size and two piec of brass cannon and becaus i knew not what time and what extrem i wa provid for i carri an hundr barrel of powder besid sword cutlass and the iron part of some pike and halbert so that in short we had a larg magazin of all sort of store and i made my nephew carri two small quarter deck gun more than he want for hi ship to leav behind if their wa occas that when we came there we might build a fort and man it against all sort of enemi and inde i at first thought there wa need enough for it all and much more if we hope to maintain our possess of the island as shall be seen in the cours of that stori i had not such bad luck in thi voyag as i had been use to meet with and therefor shall have the less occas to interrupt the reader who perhap may be impati to hear how matter went with my coloni yet some odd accid cross wind and bad weather happen on thi first set out which made the voyag longer than i expect it at first and i who had never made but one voyag viz my first voyag to guinea in which i might be said to come back again as the voyag wa at first design began to think the same ill fate still attend me and that i wa born to be never content with be on shore and yet to be alway unfortun at sea contrari wind first put us to the northward and we were oblig to put in at galway in ireland where we lay windbound two and twenti day but we had thi satisfact with the disast that provis where here exceed cheap and in the utmost plenti so that while we lay here never touch the ship store but rather ad to them here also i took in sever live hog and two cow and calv which i resolv if i had a good passag to put on shore in my island but we found occas to dispos otherwis of them we sat out the th of februari from ireland and had a veri fair gale of wind for some day as i rememb it might be about the th of februari in the even late when the mate have the watch came into the roundhous and told us he saw a flash of fire and heard a gunfird and while he wa tell us of it a boy came in and told us the boatswain heard anoth thi made us all run out upon the quarter deck where for a while we heard noth but in a few minut we saw a veri great light and found that there wa some veri terribl fire at a distanc immedi we had recours to our reckon in which we all agre that there could be no land that way in which the fire show it self no not for leagu for it appear at wnw upon thi we conclud it must be some ship on fire at sea and as by our hear the nois of gun just befor we conclud it could not be far off we stood directli toward it and were present satisfi we should discov it becaus the farther we sail the greater the light appear though the weather be haizi we could not perceiv ani thing but the light for a while in about half an hour sail the wind be fair for us though not much of it and the weather clear up a littl we could plainli discern that it wa a great ship on fire in the middl of the sea i wa most sensibl touch with thi disast though not at all acquaint with the person engag in it i present recollect my former circumst and in what condit i wa in when taken up by the portug captain and how much more deplor the circumst of the poor creatur belong to thi ship must be if they had no other ship in compani with them upon thi i immedi order that five gun should be fire one soon after anoth that if possibl we might give notic to them that there wa help for them at hand and that they might endeavor to save themselv in their boat for though we could see the flame of the ship yet they it be night could see noth of us we lay by some time upon thi onli drive as the burn ship drove wait for daylight when on a sudden to our great terror though we had reason to expect it the ship blew up in the air and immedi that is to say in a few minut all the fire wa out that is to say the rest of the ship sunk thi wa a terribl and inde an afflict sight for the sake of the poor men who i conclud must be either all destroy in the ship or be in the utmost distress in their boat in the middl of the ocean which at present by reason it wa dark i could not see howev to direct them as well as i could i caus light to be hung out in all the part of the ship where we could and which we had lanthorn for and kept fire gun all the night long let them know by thi that there wa a ship not far off about clock in the morn we discov the ship boat by the help of our perspect glass found there were two of them both throng with peopl and deep in the water we perceiv they row the wind be against them that they saw our ship and did their utmost to make us see them we immedi spread our ancient to let them know we saw them and hung a waft out as a signal for them to come on board and then made more sail stand directli to them in littl more than half an hour we came up with them and in a word took them all in be no less than sixti four men women and children for there were a great mani passeng upon the whole we found it wa a french merchant ship of tun homeward bound from quebeck in the river of canada the master gave us a long account of the distress of hi ship how the fire began in the steerag by the neglig of the steersman but on hi cri out for help wa as everi bodi thought entir put out when they found that some spark of the first fire had gotten into some part of the ship so difficult to come at that they could not effectu quench it till get in between the timber and within the ceil of the ship it proceed into the hold and master all the skill and all the applic they were abl to exert they had no more to do then but to get into their boat which to their great comfort were pretti larg be their longboat and a great shalloup besid a small skiff which wa of no great servic to them other than to get some fresh water and provis into her after they had secur their live from the fire they had inde small hope of their live by get into these boat at that distanc from ani land onli as they said well that they were escap from the fire and had a possibl that some ship might happen to be at sea and might take them in they had sail oar and a compass and were prepar to make the best of their way back to newfoundland the wind blow pretti fair for it blew an easi gale at se by e they had as much provis and water as with spare it so as to be next door to starv might support them about day in which if they had no bad weather and no contrari wind the captain said he hope he might get the bank of newfoundland and might perhap take some fish to sustain them till they might go on shore but there were so mani chanc against them in all these case such as storm to overset and founder them rain and cold to benumb and perish their limb contrari wind to keep them out and starv them that it must have been next to miracul if they had escap in the midst of their consult everi one be hopeless and readi to despair the captain with tear in hi eye told me they were on a sudden surpis with the joy of hear a gun fire and after that four more these were the five gun which i caus to be fire at first see the light thi reviv their heart and gave them the notic which as abov i desir it should viz that there wa a ship at hand for their help it wa upon the hear these gun that they took down their mast and sail the sound come from the windward they resolv to lie by till morn some time after thi hear no more gun they fire three musket one a consider while after anoth but these the wind be contrari we never heard some time after that again they were still more agreeabl surpis with see our light and hear the gun which as i have said i caus to be fire all the rest of the night thi set them to work with their oar to keep their boat ahead at least that we might the sooner come up with them and at last to their inexpress joy they found we saw them it is imposs for me to express the sever gestur the strang ecstasi the varieti of postur which these poor deliv peopl run into to express the joy of their soul at so unexpect a deliver grief and fear are easili describ sigh tear groan and a veri few motion of the head and hand make up the sum of it varieti but an excess of joy a surpris of joy ha a thousand extravag in it there were some in tear some rage and tear themselv as if they had been in the greatest agoni of sorrow some starkrav and downright lunat some ran about the ship stamp with their feet other wring their hand some were danc some sing some laugh more cri mani quit dumb not abl to speak a word other sick and vomit sever swoon and readi to faint and a few were cross themselv and give god thank i would not wrong them neither there might be mani that were thank afterward but the passion wa too strong for them at first and they were not abl to master it they were thrown into ecstasi and a kind of frenzi and it wa but a veri few that were compos and seriou in their joy perhap the case may have some addit to it from the particular circumst of that nation they belong to i mean the french whose temper is allow to be more volatil more passion and more sprightli and their spirit more fluid than in other nation i am not philosoph enough to determin the caus but noth i had ever seen befor came up to it the ecstasi poor friday my trusti savag wa in when he found hi father in the boat came the nearest to it and the surpris of the master and hi two companion who i deliv from the villain that set them on shore in the island came a littl way toward it but noth wa to compar to thi either that i saw in friday or ani where els in my life it is further observ that these extravag did not show themselv in that differ manner i have mention in differ person onli but all the varieti would appear in a short success of moment in one and the same person a man that we saw thi minut dumb and as it were stupid and confound should the next minut be danc and hallow like an antic and the next moment be tear hi hair or pull hi cloth to piec and stamp them under hi feet like a mad man a few moment after that we should have him all in tear then sick then swoon and had not immedi help been had would in a few moment more have been dead and thu it wa not with one or two or ten or twenti but with the greatest part of them and if i rememb right our surgeon wa oblig to let abov thirti of them blood there were two priest among them one an old man and the other a young man and that which wa strangest wa that the oldest man wa the worst as soon as he set hi foot on board our ship and saw himself safe he drop down stone dead not the least sign of life could be perceiv in him our surgeon immedi appli proper remedi to recov him and wa the onli man in the ship that believ he wa not dead at length he open a vein in hi arm have first chaffd and rub the part so as to warm it as much as possibl upon thi the blood which onli drop at first flow someth freeli in three minut after the man open hi eye and about a quarter of an hour after that he spoke grew better and quit well after the blood wa stop he walk about told us he wa perfectli well took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him and wa what we call come to himself about a quarter of an hour after they came run into the cabin to the surgeon who wa bleed a french woman that had faint and told him the priest wa gone starkmad it seem he had begun to revolv the chang of hi circumst and again thi put him into an ecstasi of joy hi spirit whirl about faster than the vessel could convey them the blood grew hot and feverish and the man wa as fit for bedlam as ani creatur that ever wa in it the surgeon would not bleed him again in that condit but gave him someth to dose and put him to sleep which after some time oper upon him and he wake the next morn perfectli compos and well the younger priest behav with great command of hi passion and wa realli an exampl of a seriou wellgovern mind at hi first come on board the ship he threw himself flat on hi face prostrat himself in thank for hi deliver in which i unhappili and unseason disturb him realli think he had been in a swoon but he spoke calmli thank me told me he wa give god thank for hi deliver and beg me to leav him a few moment and that next to hi maker he would give me thank also i wa heartili sorri that i disturb him and not onli left him but kept other from interrupt him also he continu in that postur about three minut or littl more after i left him then came to me as he had said he would and with a great deal of serious and affect but with tear in hi eye thank me that had under god given him and so mani miser creatur their live i told him i had no room to move him to thank god for it rather than me but i ad that it wa noth but what reason and human dictat to all men and that we had as much reason as he to give thank to god who had bless us so far as to make us the instrument of hi merci to so mani of hi creatur after thi the young priest appli himself to hi countryfolk labor to compos them persuad entreat argu reason with them and did hi utmost to keep them within the exercis of their reason and with some he had success though other were for a time out of all govern of themselv i can not help commit thi to write as perhap it may be use to those into whose hand it may fall for the guid themselv in all the extravag of their passion for if an excess of joy can carri men out to such a length beyond the reach of their reason what will not the extravag of anger rage and a provok mind carri us to and inde here i saw reason for keep an exceed watch over our passion of everi kind as well those of joy and satisfact as those of sorrow and anger we were someth disord by these extravag among our new guest for the first day but when they had been retir lodg provid for them as well as our ship would allow and they had slept heartili as most of them did they were quit anoth sort of peopl the next day noth of good manner or civil acknowledg for the kind shown them wa want the french it is known are natur apt enough to exceed that way the captain and one of the priest came to me the next day and desir to speak with me and my nephew the command began to consult with us what should be done with them and first they told us that as we had save their live so all they had wa littl enough for a return to us for that kind receiv the captain said they had save some money and some thing of valu in their boat caught hastili out of the flame and if we would accept it they were order to make an offer of it all to us they onli desir to be set on shore somewher in our way where if possibl they might get passag to franc my nephew wa for accept their money at first word and to consid what to do with them afterward but i overrul him in that part for i knew what it wa to be set on shore ina strang countri and if the portug captain that took me up at sea had serv me so and took all i had for my deliver i must have starv or have been as much a slave at the brasil as i had been in barbari the mere be sold to a mohammedan except and perhap a portugues is not much a better master than a turk if not in some case a much wors i therefor told the french captain that we had taken them up in their distress it wa true but that it wa our duti to do so as we were fellow creatur and as we would desir to be so deliv if we were in the like or ani other extrem that we had done noth for them but what we believ they would have done for us if we had been in their case and they in our but that we took them up to save them not to plunder them and it would be a most barbar thing to take that littl from them which they save out of the fire and then set them on shore and leav them that thi would be first to save them from death and then kill them our selv save them from drown and abandon them to starv and therefor i would not let the least thing be taken from them as to set them on shore i told them inde that wa an exceed difficulti to us for that the ship wa bound to the east indi and though we were driven out of our cours to the westward a veri great way and perhap wa direct by heaven on purpos for their deliver yet it wa imposs for us wil to chang our voyag on thi particular account nor could my nephew the captain answer it to the freighter with whom he wa under charterparti to pursu hi voyag by the way of brasil and all i knew we could do for them wa to put our selv in the way of meet with other ship homeward bound from the west indi and get them passag if possibl to england or franc the first part of the propos wa so gener and kind they could not but be veri thank for it but they were in a veri great constern especi the passeng at the notion of be carri away to the east indi and they then entreat me that see i wa driven so far to the westward befor i met with them i would at least keep on the same cours to the bank of newfoundland where it wa probabl i might meet with some ship or sloop that they might hire to carri them back to canada from whenc they came i thought thi wa but a reason request on their part and therefor i inclin to agre to it for inde i consid that to carri thi whole compani to the east indi would not onli be an intoler sever upon the poor peopl but would be ruin our whole voyag by devour all our provis so i thought it no breach of charterparti but what an unforeseen accid made absolut necessari to us and in which no one could say we were to blame for the law of god and natur would have forbid that we should refus to take up two boat full of peopl in such a distress condit and the natur of the thing as well respect our selv as the poor peopl oblig us to set them on shore some where or other for their deliver so i consent that we would carri them to newfoundland if wind and weather would permit and if not that i would carri them to martinico in the west indi the wind continu fresh easterli but the weather pretti good and as the wind had continu in the point between ne and se a long time we miss sever opportun of send them to franc for we met sever ship bound to europ whereof two were french from st christoph but they had been so long beat up against the wind that they durst take in no passeng for fear of want provis for the voyag as well for themselv as for those they should take in so we were oblig to go on it wa about a week after thi that we made the bank of newfoundland where to shorten my stori we put all our french peopl on board a bark which they hire at sea there to put them on shore and afterward to carri them to franc if they could get provis to victual themselv with when i say all the french went on shore i should rememb that the young priest i spoke of hear we were bound to the east indi desir to go the voyag with us and to be set on shore on the coast of coromandel which i readili agre to for i wonder like the man and had veri good reason as will appear afterward also four of the seamen enter themselv on our ship and prove veri use fellow from henc we direct our cours for the west indi steer away s and s by e for about twenti day togeth sometim littl or no wind at all when we met with anoth subject for our human to work upon almost as deplor as that befor it wa in the latitud of degre minut north and the th day of march when we spyd a sail our cours se and by s we soon perceiv it wa a larg vessel and that she bore up to us but could not at first know what to make of her till after come a littl nearer we found she had lost her maintopmast foremast and boltsprit and present she fire a gun as a signal of distress the weather wa pretti good wind at nnw a fresh gale and we soon came to speak with her we found her a ship of bristol bound home from barbado but had been blown out of the road at barbado a few day befor she wa readi to sail by a terribl hurrican while the captain and chief mate were both gone on shore so that besid the terror of the storm they were but in an indiffer case for good artist to bring the ship home they had been alreadi nine week at sea and had met with anoth terribl storm after the hurrican wa over which had blown them quit out of their knowledg to the westward and in which they lost their mast as abov they told us they expect to have seen the bahama island but were then driven away again to the south east by a strong gale of wind at nnw the same that blew now and have no sail to work the ship with but a main cours and a kind of squar sail upon a juri foremast which they had set up they could not lie near the wind but were endeavor to stand away for the canari but that which wa worst of all wa that they were almost starv for want of provis besid the fatigu they had undergon their bread and flesh wa quit gone they had not one ounc left in the ship and had had none for eleven day the onli relief they had wa their water wa not all spent and they had about half a barrel of flower left they had sugar enough some succad or sweetmeat they had at first but they were devour and they had seven cask of rum there wa a youth and hi mother and a maidserv on board who were go passeng and think the ship wa readi to sail unhappili came on board the even befor the hurrican began and have no provis of their own left they were in a more deplor condit than the rest for the seamen be reduc to such an extrem necess themselv had no compass we may be sure for the poor passeng and they were inde in a condit that their miseri is veri hard to describ i had perhap not known thi part if my curios had not led me the weather be fair and the wind abat to go on board the ship the second mate who upon thi occas command the ship had been on board our ship and he told me me inde they had three passeng in the great cabin that they were in a deplor condit nay say he i believ they are dead for i have heard noth of them for abov two day and i wa afraid to enquir after them said he for i had noth to reliev them with we immedi appli our selv to give them what relief we could spare and inde i had so far overrul thing with my nephew that i would have victualld them though we had gone away to virginia or ani part of the coast of america to have suppli our selv but there wa no necess for that but now they were in a new danger for they were afraid of eat too much even of that littl we gave them the mate or command brought six men with him in hi boat but these poor wretch look like skeleton and were so weak they could hardli sit to their oar the mate himself wa veri ill and half starv for he declar he had reserv noth from the men and went share and share alik with them in everi bit they eat i caution him to eat sparingli but set meat befor him immedi and he had not eaten three mouth befor he began to be sick and out of order so he stop a while and our surgeon mix him up someth with some broth which he said would be to him both food and physic and after he had taken it he grew better in the mean time i forgot not the men i order victual to be given them and the poor creatur rather devour than eat it they were so exceed hungri that they were in a kind raven and had no command of themselv and two of them eat with so much greedi that they were in danger of their live the next morn the sight of these peopl distress wa veri move to me and brought to mind what i had a terribl prospect of at my first come on shore in the island where i had neither the least mouth of food or ani prospect of procur ani besid the hourli apprehens i had of be made the food of other creatur but all the while the mate wa thu relat to me the miser condit of the ship compani i could not put out of my thought the stori he had told me of the three poor creatur in the great cabin viz the mother her son and the maidserv who he had heard noth of for two or three day and who he seem to confess they had wholli neglect their own extrem be so great by which i understood that they had realli given them no food at all and that therefor they must be perish and be all lie dead perhap on the floor or deck of the cabin as i therefor kept the mate who we then call captain on board with hi men to refresh them so i also forgot not the starv crew that were left on board but order my own boat to go on board the ship and with my mate and twelv men to carri them a sack of bread and four or five piec of beef to boil our surgeon charg the men to caus the meat to be boil while they stay and to keep guard in the cookroom to prevent the men take it to eat raw or take it out of the pot befor it wa well boil and then to give everi man but a veri littl at a time and by thi caution he preserv the men who would otherwis have kill themselv with that veri food that wa given them on purpos to save their live at the same time i order the mate to go into the great cabin and see what condit the poor passeng were in and if they were aliv to comfort them and give them what refresh wa proper and the surgeon gave him a larg pitcher with some of the prepar broth which he had given the mate that wa on board and which he did not question would restor them gradual i wa not satisfi with thi but as i said abov have a great mind to see the scene of miseri which i knew the ship itself would present me with in a more live manner than i could have it by report i took the captain of the ship as we now call him with me and went myself a littl after in their boat i found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the victual out of the boyler befor it wa readi but my mate observ hi order and kept a good guard at the cookroom door and the man he place there after use all possibl persuas to have patienc kept them off by forc howev he caus some biscuit cake to be dip in the pot and soften with the liquor of the meat which they call brew and gave them everi one one to stay their stomach and told them it wa for their own safeti that he wa oblig to give them but a littl at a time but it wa all in vain and had i not come on board and their own command and offic with me and with good word and some threat also of give them no more i believ they would have broke into the cookroom by forc and tore the meat out of the furnac for word are inde of veri small forc to a hungri belli howev we pacifi them and fed them gradual and cautious for the first time and the next time gave them more and at last fill their belli and the men did well enough but the miseri of the poor passeng in the cabin wa of anoth natur and far beyond the rest for as first the ship compani had so littl for themselv it wa but too true that they had at first kept them veri low and at last total neglect them so that for six or seven day it might be said they had realli had no food at all and for sever day befor veri littl the poor mother who as the men report wa a woman of good sens and good breed had spare all she could get so affection for her son that at last she entir sunk under it and when the mate of our ship went in she sat upon the floor or deck with her back up against the side between two chair which were lash fast and her head sunk in between her shoulder like a corps though not quit dead my mate said all he could to reviv and encourag her and with a spoon put some broth into her mouth she open her lip and lift up one hand but could not speak yet she understood what he said and made sign to him intim that it wa too late for her but point to her child as if she would have said they should take care of him howev the mate who wa exceedinglymovd with the sight endeavor to get some of the broth into her mouth and as he said got two or three spoon down though i question whether he could be sure of it or not but it wa too late and she die the same night the youth who wa preserv at the price of hi most affection mother life wa not so far gone yet he lay in a cabin bed as one stre chd out with hardli ani life left in him he had a piec of an old glove in hi mouth have eaten up the rest of it howev be young and have more strength than hi mother the mate got someth down hi throat and he began sensibl to reviv though by give him some time after but two or three spoon extraordinari he wa veri sick and brought it up again but the next care wa the poor maid she lay all along upon the deck hard by her mistress and just like one that had fallen down with an apoplexi and struggl for life her limb where distort one of her hand wa clasp round the frame of a chair and she grip it so hard that we could not easili make her let go her other arm lay over her head and her feet lay both togeth set fast against the frame of the cabin tabl in short she lay just like one in the last agoni of death and yet she wa aliv too the poor creatur wa not onli starv with hunger and terrifi with the thought of death but as the men told us afterward wa brokenheart for her mistress who she saw die for two or three day befor and who she love most tenderli we knew not what to do with thi poor girl for when our surgeon who wa a man of veri great knowledg and experi had with great applic recov her as to life he had her upon hi hand as to her sens for she wa littl less than distract for a consider time after as shall appear present whoever shall read these memorandum must be desir to consid that visit at sea are not like a journey into the countri where sometim peopl stay a week or a fortnight at a place our busi wa to reliev thi distress ship crew but not to lie by for them and though they were will to steer the same cours with us for some day yet we could carri no sail to keep pace with a ship that had no mast howev as their captain beg of us to help him to set up a maintopmast and a kind of a topmast to hi juri foremast we did as it were lie by him for three or four day and then have given him five barrel of beef a barrel of pork two hogshead of biscuit and a proport of peac flour and what other thing we could spare and take three cask of sugar some rum and some piec of eight of them for satisfact we left them take on board with us at their own earnest request the priest the youth and the maid and all their good the young lad wa about seventeen year of age a pretti wellbr modest and sensibl youth greatli deject with the loss of hi mother and as it seem had lost hi father but a few month befor at berbado he beg of the surgeon to speak to me to take him out of the ship for he said the cruel fellow had murder hi mother and inde so they had that is to say passiv for they might have spare a small susten to the poor helpless widow that might have preserv her life though it had been but just to keep her aliv but hunger know no friend no relat no justic no right and therefor is remorseless and capabl of no compass the surgeon told him how far we were go and how it would carri him away from all hi friend and put him perhap in as bad circumst almost as those we found him in that is to say starv in the world he said he matter not whether he went if he wa but deliv from the terribl crew he wa among that the captain by which he meant me for he could know noth of my nephew had save hi life and he wa sure would not hurt him and as for the maid he wa sure if she came to herself she would be veri thank for it let us carri them where we would the surgeon repres the case so affection to me that i yield and we took them both on board with all their good except eleven hogshead of sugar which could not be remov or come at and as the youth had a bill of lade for them i made hi command sign a write oblig himself to go as soon as he came to bristol to one mr roger a merchant there to whom the youth said he wa relat and to deliv a letter which i wrote to him and all the good he had belong to the deceas widow which i suppos wa not done for i could never learn that the ship came to bristol but wa as is most probabl lost at sea be in so disabl a condit and so far from ani land that i am of opinion the first storm she met with afterward she might founder in the sea for she wa leaki and had damag in her hold when we met with her i wa now in the latitud of degre min and had hitherto had a toler voyag as to weather though at first the wind had been contrari i shall troubl no bodi with the littl incid of wind weather current etc on the rest of our voyag but shortn my stori for the sake of what is to follow shall observ that i came to my old habit the island on the th of april it wa with no small difficulti that i found the place for as i came to it and went from it befor on the south and east side of the island as come from the brasil so now come in between the main and the island and have no chart for the coast nor ani landmark i did not know it when i saw it or know whether i saw it or no we beat about a great while and went on shore on sever island on the mouth of the great river oronooqu but none for my purpos onli thi i learn by my coast the shore that i wa under one great mistak befor viz that the contin which i thought i saw from the island i live in wa realli no contin but a long island or rather a ridg of island reach from one to the other side of the extend mouth of that great river and that the savag who came to my island were not properli those which we call caribbe but island and other barbarian of the same kind who inhabit someth nearer to our side than the rest in short i visit sever of these island to no purpos some i found were inhabit and some were not on one of them i found some spaniard and thought they had live there but speak with them found they had a sloop lay in a small creek hard by and they came thither to make salt and to catch some pearl mussl if they could but that they belong to the isl de trinidad which lay farther north in the latitud of and degre but at last coast from one island to anoth sometim with the ship sometim with the french man shalloup which we had found a conveni boat and therefor kept her with their veri good will at length i came fair on the south side of my island and i present knew the veri counten of the place so i brought the ship safe to an anchor broadsid with the littl creek where wa my old habit as soon as i saw the place i call for friday and ask him if he knew where he wa he look about a littl and present clap hi hand cri o ye o there o ye o there point to our old habit and fell a danc and caper like a mad fellow and i had much ado to keep him from jump into the sea to swim ashor to the place well friday say i do you think we shall find ani bodi here or no and what do you think shall we see your father the fellow stood mute as a stock a good while but when i name hi father the poor affection creatur look deject and i could see the tear run down hi face veri plenti what is the matter friday say i are you troubl becaus you may see your father no no say he shake hi head no see him more no ever more see again whi so said i friday how do you know that o no o no say friday he long ago die long ago he much old man well well say i friday you dont know but shall we see ani one els then the fellow it seem had better eye than i and he point just to the hill abov my old hous and though we lay half a leagu off he cri out we see we see ye we see much men there and there and there i look but i could see no bodi no not with a perspect glass which wa i suppos becaus i could not hit the place for the fellow wa right as i found upon enquiri the next day and there wa five or six men altogeth stood to look at the ship not know what to think of us as soon as friday had told me he saw peopl i caus the english ancient to be spread and fire three gun to give them notic we were friend and in about half a quarter of an hour after we perceiv a smoke rise from the side of the creek so i immedi order a boat out take friday with me and hang out a white flag or flag of truce i went directli on shore take with me the young friar i mention to whom i had told the whole stori of my live there and the manner of it and everi particular both of my self and those i left there and who wa on that account extrem desir to go with me we had besid about sixteen men veri well arm if we had found ani new guest there which we did not know of but we had no need of weapon as we went on shore upon the tide of flood near high water we row directli into the creek and the first man i fix my eye upon wa the spaniard whole life i had save and who i knew by hi face perfectli well as to hi habit i shall describ it afterward i order no bodi to go on shore at first but my self but there wa no keep friday in the boat for the affection creatur had spi hi father at a distanc a good way off of the spaniard where inde i saw noth of him and if they had not let him go on shore he would have jump into the sea he wa no sooner on shore but he flew away to hi father like an arrow out of a bow it would have made ani man have shed tear in spite of the firmest resolut to have seen the first transport of thi poor fellow joy when he came to hi father how he embrac him kiss him strokd hi face took him up in hi arm set him down upon a tree and lay down by him then stood and look at him as ani one would look at a strang pictur for a quarter of an hour togeth then lie down on the ground and stroke hi leg and kiss them and then get up again and stare at him one would have thought the fellow bewitch but it would have made a dog laugh to see how the next day hi passion run out anoth way in the morn he walk along the shore to and again with hi father sever hour alway lead him by the hand as if he had been a ladi and everi now and then he would come to fetch someth or other for him to the boat either a lump of sugar or a dram a biscuit cake or someth or other that wa good in the afternoon hi frolick run anoth way for then he would set the old man down upon the ground and danc about him and make a thousand antic postur and gestur and all the while he did thi he would be talk to him and tell him one stori or anoth of hi travel and of what had happen to him abroad to divert him in short if the same filial affect wa to be found in christian to their parent in our part of the world one would be tempt to say there would hardli have been ani need of the fifth command but thi is a digress i return to my land it would be endless to take notic of all the ceremoni and civil that the spaniard receiv me with the first spaniard who as i said i knew veri well wa he whose life i had save he came toward the boat attend by one more carri a flag of truce also and he did not onli not know me at first but he had no thought no notion of it be me that wa come till i spoke to him seignior said i in portugues do you not know me at which he spoke not a word but give hi musket to the man that wa with him threw hi arm abroad and say someth in spanish that i did not perfectli hear come forward and embrac me tell me he wa inexcus not to know that face again that he had onc seen as of an angel from heaven sent to save hi life he said abund of veri handsom thing as a well bred spaniard alway know how and then beckon to the person that attend him bad him go and call out hi comerad he then ask me if i would walk to my old habit where he would give me possess of my own hous again and where i should see there had been but mean improv so i walk along with him but ala i could no more find the place again than if i had never been there for they had plant so mani tree and place them in such a postur so thick and close to one anoth and in ten year time they were grown so big that in short the place wa inaccess except by such wind and blind way as they themselv onli who made them could find i ask them what put them upon all these
