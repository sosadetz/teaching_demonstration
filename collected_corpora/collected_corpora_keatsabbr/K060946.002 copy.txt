amazon and the fierc naobarzan king of the cilician must need conceiv a veri high idea of hi virtu but if i can not bring the exampl of oront to influenc you in the present case i can mention those of other person no less illustri for their birth and courag than him did not the brave memnon when hi rival oxyatr wa sick entreat the beauti barsina to favor him with a visit and the complais husband of the divin parisati wa not content with bare desir her to visit lysimachu who wa die with despair at her marriag but would mani time bring her himself to the bedsid of thi unfortun lover and leav her there give him an opportun of tell her what he suffer for her sake i am afraid madam said mr glanvil i shall never be capabl of imit either the brave memnon nor the complais lysimachu in thi case and the humor of oront seem to me the most commend nevertheless said arabella the humor of oront cost him an infinit number of pain and it may happen you will as near resembl him in hi fortun as you do in

shall i by oppos the impetu humor of a lover to whom i am somewhat oblig make myself the author of hi death fatal necess which oblig me either to be cruel or unjust and with a disposit to neither make me in some degre guilti of both chap iii in which our heroin is in some littl confus while arabella wa utter thi pathet complaint mr glanvil with great difficulti kept himself from smile and by some supplic look to hi sister prevent her laugh out yet she gigl in secret behind her fan but arabella wa so lost in her melancholi reflect that she kept her eye immov fix on the ground for some moment at last cast an upbraid glanc at glanvil is it possibl cruel person that you are said she to him that you can without piti see me suffer so much uneasi and know the sensibl of my temper can expos me to the grief of be accessori to the death of an unfortun man guilti inde of a too violent passion which merit a gentler punish than that you doom him to dont be uneasi dear cousin interrupt miss glanvil

affect what then said miss glanvil do you realli imagin sir georg is in love with ladi bella he is either in love with her person or estat repli mr glanvil or perhap with both for she is handsom enough to gain a lover of hi merit though she had no fortun and she ha fortun enough to do it though she had no beauti my cousin is well enough to be sure said miss glanvil but i never could think her a beauti if repli mr glanvil a most love complexion regular featur a fine statur an eleg shape and an inexpress grace in all her motion can form a beauti ladi bella may pretend to that charact without ani disput though she wa all that you say return miss glanvil i am certain sir georg is not in love with her i wish i wa certain of that repli mr glanvil for it is veri probabl you are mistaken you

with the content oblig him much against hi will to read it aloud it wa as follow arabella to bellmour whatev offens your presumptu declar may have given me yet my resent will be appeas with a less punish than death and that grief and submiss you have testifi in your letter may happili have alreadi procur you pardon for your fault provid you do not forfeit it by disobedi i therefor command you to live and command you by all that power you have given me over you rememb i requir no more of you than parisati did of lysimachu in a more cruel and insupport misfortun imit then the obedi and submiss of that illustri princ and though you should be as unfortun as he let your courag also be equal to hi and like him be content with the esteem that is offer you sinc it is all that can be
