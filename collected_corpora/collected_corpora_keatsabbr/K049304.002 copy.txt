my life proceed in your own way i invest you with full power and author not onli to gag my whole council but even to nail their ear to the pillori should it be found necessari for the benefit of yesso in token of which deleg present your posterior and i will bestow upon you a doubl portion of my favor taycho humbl thank hi imperi majesti for the great honor he intend him but beg leav to declin the ceremoni on account of the haemorrhoid which at that time gave him great disturb the orat have thu annihil all opposit in the council of twentyeight repair to hi own hous in order to plan the oper of the ensu campaign though he had reinforc the armi in tartari with the flower of the japones soldieri and destin a strong squadron of fune as usual to parad on the coast of china he foresaw it would be necessari to amus the peopl with some new stroke on the side of fatsisio which inde wa the origin and the most natur scene of the war he lock himself up in hi closet and in consult the map of fatsisio he found that the princip chines settlement of that island wa a fortifi town call quibquab to which there wa access by two differ avenu one by a broad rapid navig river on the bank of which the town wa situat and the other by an inland rout over mountain lake and danger torrent he measur the map with hi compass and perceiv that both rout were nearli of the same length and therefor he resolv that the forc in fatsisio be divid into two equal bodi should approach the place by the two differ avenu on the supposit that they would both arriv befor the wall of quibquab at the same instant of time the conduct of the inland expedit wa given to yaffray who now command in chief in fatsisio and the rest of the troop were sent up the great river under the auspic of yaloff who had so emin distinguish himself in the cours of the preced year orat taycho had receiv some articl of intellig which embarrass him a littl at first but these difficulti soon vanish befor the vigor of hi resolut he knew that not onli the town of quibquab wa fortifi by art but also that the whole adjac countri wa almost impregn by natur that one chines gener block up the pass with a strong bodi of forc in the rout which wa to be follow by yaffrai and that anoth command a separ corps in the neighborhood of quibquab equal at least in number to the detach of yaloff whom he might therefor either prevent from land or attack after he should be land or final should neither of these attempt succeed he might reinforc the garrison of quibquab so as to make it more numer than the besieg armi which accord to the rule of war ought to be ten time the number of the besieg on the other hand in order to invalid these object he reflect that fortun which ha such a share in all militari event is inconst and variabl that as the chines had been so long success in fatsisio it wa now their turn to be unfortun he reflect that the demon of folli wa caprici and that as it had so long possess the ruler and gener of japan it wa high time it should shift it quarter and occupi the brain of the enemi in which case they would quit their advantag post and commit some blunder that would lay them at the merci of the japones with respect to the reduct of quibquab he had heard inde that the besieg ought to be ten time the number of the garrison besieg but as everi japones wa equival to ten subject of china he thought the match wa pretti equal he reflect that even if thi expedit should not succeed it would be of littl consequ to hi reput as he could plead at home that he neither conceiv the origin plan nor appoint ani of the offic concern in the execut it is true he might have reinforc the armi in fatsisio so as to leav veri littl to fortun but then he must have subtract someth from the strength of the oper in tartari which wa now becom the favorit scene of the war or he must have altogeth suspend the execut of anoth darl scheme which wa liter hi own concept there wa an island in the great indian ocean at a consider distanc from fatsisio and here the chines had a strong settlement taycho wa inflam with the ambit of reduc thi island which wa call thinquo and for thi purpos he resolv to embark a bodi of forc which should cooper with the squadron of fune destin to cruiz in those latitud the onli difficulti that remain wa to choos a gener to direct thi enterpris he perus a list of all the militari offic in japan and as they were all equal in point of reput he began to examin their name in order to pitch upon that which should appear to be the most signific and in thi particular taycho wa a

might be brought to justic and execut as a felon and perturb of the public peac kuntthan who wa the partisan pitch upon for thi servic practic a thousand stratagem to decoy brutantiffi into a careless secur but he wa still baffl by the vigil of yamakheit a famou soldier of fortun who had engag in the servic of the outlaw tartar at length the opportun offer when thi captain wa sent out to lay the countri under contribut then kuntthan march sole in the dead of night caught brutantiffi nap he might have slain him upon the spot but hi order were to take him aliv that he might be made a public

a good offic afford him an opportun to shift the blame of neglect from hi own shoulder to those of a person who could not answer for himself in the same manner your gener a y acquit himself of the charg of misconduct for the attack of t a by accus hi engin who have fallen in the battl could not contradict hi assert in regard to the affair with the mantchoux brutantiffi wa resolv to swear truth out of tartari by mere dint of impud in the veri articl of run away he began to propag the report of the great victori he had obtain he sent the dairo a circumstanti detail of hi own prowess and expati upon the cowardic of the mantchoux who he said had vanish from him like quicksilv at the veri time when they were quietli possess of the field of battl and he himself wa call upon the mountain to cover him it must have been in imit of thi great origin that the inspector of tympanit memori assur the public in one of hi lucubr that a certain tall hibernian wa afraid of look him in the face becaus the said poltroon had kick hi breech the night befor in presenc of five hundr peopl fortun had now abandon the chines in good earnest two squadron of their fune had been success taken destroy or dispers by the japones command ornbo and faskhan and they had lost such a number of singl junk that they were scarc abl to keep the sea on the coast of africa they were driven from the settlement

and divers strong hold in the neighborhood of yesso bronxit who command the mercenari armi of japan on that contin had been oblig to retreat befor the chines from post to pillar till at length he found it absolut necessari to maintain hi posit even at the risqu of be attack by the enemi that outnumb him greatli he chose an advantag post where he thought himself secur and went to sleep at hi usual time of rest the chinesegener resolv to beat up hi quarter in the night select a bodi of hors for that purpos and put them in motion accordingli it wa happi for bronxit that thi detach fell upon a quarter where there happen to be a kennel of japones dog which are as famou as the bulldog of england these anim ever on the watch not onli gave the alarm but at the same time fell upon the chines hors with such impetuos that the enemi were disord and had actual fled befor bronxit could bring up hi troop to action all that he saw of the battl when he came up wa a small number of kill and wound and the cavalri of the enemi scamper off in confus though at a great distanc from the field no matter he found mean to paint thi famou battl of mynthan in such color as dazzl the weak eyesight of the japones monster which bellow hoars applaus through all it throat and in it hymn of triumph equal bronxit even to the unconquer brutantiffi which last about thi time receiv at hi own door anoth beat

wa with great difficulti some of their inferior chief who were wiser than themselv prevent them from go by the ear togeth in a word the confus and anarchi that ensu afford an opportun to one of brutantiffi partisan to steal away the bodi of hi master whom the nois of the contest had just rous from hi swoon llhadahn perceiv he wa gone rode off in disgust with all hi cavalri and the mantchoux instead of follow the blow made a retrograd motion toward their own countri which allow brutantiffi time to breath three success disast of thi kind would have been suffici to lower the militari charact of ani warrior in the opinion of ani public that judg from their own sens and reflect but by thi time the japones had quietli resign all their natur percept and paid the most implicit faith to everi articl broach by their apostl taycho the more it seem to contradict common reason and common evid the more greedili wa it swallow as a mysteri dogma of the polit creed taycho then assur them that the whole armi of the mantchoux wa put to the sword and that bronxit would carri the war within three week into the heart of china he gave them goblet of horseblood from mynthan and tickl their ear and their nose they snort approb lick hi toe and sunk into a profound lethargi from thi howev they were soon arrous by unwelcom tide from fatsisio yaffrai had proceed in hi rout until he wa stop

strongli fortifi by natur that it seem rash even to attempt a land especi in the face of an enemi more numer than hi own detach land howev he did and even attack a fortifi camp of the chines but in spite of all hi effort he wa repuls with consider slaughter he sent an account of thi miscarriag to taycho give him to understand at the same time that he had receiv no intellig of yaffrai motion that hi troop were greatli diminish that the season wa too far advanc to keep the field much longer and that noth wa left them but a choic of difficulti everi one of which seem more insurmount than anoth taycho have deliber on thi subject thought it wa necessari to prepar the monster for the worst that could happen as he now expect to hear by the first opportun that the grand expedit of fatsisio had total miscarri he resolv therefor to throw the blame upon the shoulder of yaloff and yaffrai and stigmat them as the creatur of fikakaka who had neither abil to comprehend the instruct he had given nor resolut to execut the plan he had project for thi purpos he ascend the rostrum and with a rueful length of face open hi harangu upon the defeat of yaloff the hydra no sooner understood that the

crawl silent on it belli to a sandhil just without the wall of meaco and began to scratch the earth with great eager and persever some peopl imagin it wa dig for gold but the truth is the beast wa make a hole to hide itself from the enemi whom it durst not look in the face for it must be observ of thi beast it wa equal timor and cruel equal cowardli and insol so hard it labor at thi cavern that it had actual burrow itself all but the tail when it good angel taycho whistl it out with the news of anoth complet victori gain over the chines at sea by the seyseogun phalkhan who had sure enough discomfit or destroy the great armament of the enemi as for the other small squadron which had steer a northerli cours to xicoco it wa encount defeat taken and brought into the harbor of japan by three light fune under the command of a young chief call helyott who happen to be cruis on that part of the coast the beast hear taycho auspici whistl crept out with it buttock foremost and have done

fakkubasi wa almost forgotten and the bonza were univers despis the prais of the prophet taycho had swallow up all other worship let us enquir how far he merit thi ador how justli the unparallel success of thi year wa ascrib to hi conduct and sagac khorh wa taken by khafel and quibquab by yaloff and thonsyn by land the chines were defeat in fatsisio by yanoni in the extrem of asia by

put to flight in three success engag near the land of kamtschatka by the chief bhakakh and their grand armament defeat by the seyseogun phalkhan but khafel wa a stranger to orat taycho yaloff he had never seen the bulldog had been collect at random from the shambl of meaco he had never heard of yanoni name till he distinguish himself by hi first victori nor did he know there wa ani such person as khuttwhang exist as for ornbo faskhan phalkhan and bhakakh they had been seyseogun in constant employ under the former administr and the youth helyott owe hi promot to the interest of hi own famili but it may be alleg that taycho project in hi closet those plan that were crown with success we have seen how he mutil and fritter the origin scheme of the campaign in fatsisio so as to leav it at the capric of fortun the reduct of khorh wa part of the design form by the banyan thumkhummqua which taycho did all that lay in hi power to render abort the plan of oper in the extrem of tartari he did not pretend to meddl with it wa the concern of the offic appoint by the trade compani there settl and as to the advantag obtain at sea they natur result from the disposit of cruis made and regul by

utmost stretch he milk the dug of the monster till the blood came for the servic of the ensu year he squeez from them near twelv million of oban amount to near twentyfour million sterl about four time as much as had ever been rais by the empir of japan in ani former war but by thi time taycho wa becom not onli a convert to the system of tartari which he had formerli persecut but also an enthusiast

maintain it without contract yearli immens load of debt which must have crush it at the longrun it wa the busi of the chines therefor not to finish the war in tartari by take the farm of yesso becaus in that case the annual expens of it would have been save to japan but to keep it aliv by forc march praedatori excurs and undecis action and thi wa precis the interest of gener bronxit who in the

thee of the ancient digramma the genera etc of music which with their color were construct by a divis of the diatessaron thou art too dull and ignor to comprehend the chromat speci the construct of the tetrachord the phrygian the lydian and other mode of the ancient music and for distinct of ear thou might be justli rank among the bray tribe that graze along the ditch of tottenhamcourt or hockleyithehol i know that noth exhilar thi spirit so much as a sonata on the saltbox or a concert of marrowbon and cleaver the ear of the japones were much of the same textur and their music wa suit to their ear they neither excel in the melopoeia and rythm or cadenc nor did they know ani thing of the true scienc of harmoni composit in part and those combin of sound the invent of which with the improv of the scale is erron ascrib to a benedictin monk the truth is the ancient understood composit perfectli well their scale wa found upon perfect conson they were remark nice in temper sound and had reduc their interv and concord to mathemat demonstr but to return to the council of twentyeight they conven in the same apart where the dairo lay and as the busi wa to determin what kind of music wa most like to make an impress upon hi organ everi member came provid with hi expedi first and foremost mr orat taycho pronounc an orat upon the excel of the land of yesso of energi as the cuboy said suffici to draw the moon from her sphere it drew noth howev from the patient but a singl groan then the fatzman caus a drum to beat without produc ani effect at all upon the dairo though it depriv the

other speci of music and pull out a huge purs of golden oban began to chink them in hi ear thi experi so far succeed that the dairo wa perceiv to smile and even to contract one hand but further effect it had none at last gottomio start up threw a small quantiti of aurum fulminan into the fire which went off with such an explos that in the same instant fikakaha fell flat upon hi face and gothamababa start upright in hi bed thi howev wa no more than a convuls that put an end to hi life for he fell back again and expir in the twinkl of an eye as for the cuboy though he did not die he underw a surpris transform or metamorphosi which i shall record in due season taycho wa no sooner certifi that gothamababa had actual breath hi last than he vanish from the council in the twinkl of an eye and mount the beast whose name is legion rode full speed to the habit of giogio the successor and descend of the deceas dairo giogio wa a young princ who had been industri sequest from the public view and

art of reign of all those who superintend hi educ he who insinu himself the farthest in hi favor wa one yakstrot from the mountain of ximo who valu himself much upon the ancient blood that ran in hi vein and still more upon hi elev idea of patriot yakstrot wa honest at bottom but proud reserv vain and affect he had a turn for nicknack and gimcrack and onc made and mount an iron jack and a wooden clock with hi own hand but it wa hi misfortun to set up for a connoisseur in paint and other liber art and to announc himself an univers patron of geniu he did not fail to infus hi own notion and conceit into the tender mind of giogio who gradual imbib hi turn of think and follow the studi which he recommend with respect to hi lesson on the art of govern he reduc them to a veri few simpl principl hi maxim were these that the emperor of japan ought to cherish the establish religion both by precept and exampl that he ought to abolish corrupt discourag faction and balanc the two parti by admit an equal number from each to place and offic of trust in the administr that he should make peac as soon as possibl even in despit of the public which seem insens of the burden it sustain and wa inde grow deliri by the illus of taycho and the cruel evacu he had prescrib that he should retrench all superflu expens in hi household and govern and detach himself entir from the accurs farm of yesso which some evil geniu had fix upon the breech of japan as a cancer ulcer through which all her blood and substanc would be discharg these maxim were gener just enough in specul but some of them were altogeth impractic for exampl that of form an administr equal compos of the two saction wa as absurd as it would be to yoke two stonehors and two jackass in the same carriag which instead of draw one way would do noth but bite and kick one anoth while the machin of govern would stand stockstil or perhap be torn in piec by their drag in opposit direct the peopl of japan had been long divid between two inveter parti known by the name of shittilkumsheit and sheitkumshitil the first signifi more fool than knave and the other more knave than fool each had predomin in it turn by secur a major in the assembl of the peopl for the major had alway interest to forc themselv into the administr becaus the constitut be partli democrat the dairo wa still oblig to truckl to the prevail faction to obtain thi major each side had employ everi art of corrupt calumni insinu and priestcraft for noth is such an effectu ferment in all popular commot as religi fanatic no sooner one parti accomplish it aim than it reprob the other brand it with the epithet of traitor to their countri or traitor to their princ while the minor retort upon them the charg of corrupt rapaci and abject servil in short both parti were equal abus rancor uncandid and illiber taycho had been of both faction more than onc he made hi first appear as a shitilkumsheit in the minor and display hi talent for scurril against the dairo to such advantag that an old rich hag who love noth so well as money except the gratif of her reveng made him a present of five thousand oban on condit he should continu to revil the dairo till hi dyingday after her death the ministri intimid by the bold of hi trope and the fame he began to acquir as a malcont orat made him such offer as he thought proper to accept and then he turn sheitkumshitil be disgust in the sequel at hi own want of import in the council he open onc more at the head of hi old friend the shitilkumshitit and onc more he desert them to rule the roast as chief of the sheitkumshitilit in which predica he now stood and inde thi wa the most natur postur in which he could stand for thi parti embrac all the scum of the peopl constitut the blatant beast which hi talent were so peculiarli adapt to manag and govern anoth impractic maxim of yakstrot wa the abolit of corrupt the ordur of which is as necessari to anoint the wheel of govern in japan as greas is to
