disgust and a vast bodi of the other gentlemen as well as of the common peopl desir of the restor of the exil royal famili but mani writer explicitli espous the caus of simpl monarchi and absolut

the person whose will give a be to that law that the perfect of monarchi consist in govern by a nobil weighti enough to keep the peopl under yet not tall enough in ani particular person to measur with

they felt the necess of leav the monarch and aristocrat order out of their scheme of govern becaus all the friend of those order were their enemi and of address themselv wholli to the democrat parti becaus they alon were their friend at least there appear no other hypothesi on which to account for the crude concept of milton and nedham the latter in hi prefac discov hi apprehens and feel too clearli to be mistaken in these words—i believ none will be offend with thi follow discours but those that are enemi to public welfar let such be offend still it is not for their sake that i publish thi ensu treatis but for your sake that have been nobl patriot fellow soldier and suffer for the liberti and freedom of your countri as m turgot idea of a commonwealth in which all author is to be collect into one centr and that centr the nation is suppos to be precis the project of marchamont nedham and probabl deriv from hi book and as the excel of a free state is a valuabl morsel of antiqu well known in america where it ha mani partisan it may be worth while to examin it especi as it contain everi semblanc of argument which can possibl be urg in favor of the system as it is not onli the popular idea of a republ both in franc and england but is gener intend by the word republ commonwealth and popular state when use by english writer even those of the most sens tast and learn marchamont nedham lay it down as a fundament principl and an undeni rule that the peopl that is such as shall be success chosen to repres the peopl are the best keeper of their own liberti and that for mani reason first becaus they never think of usurp over other men right but mind which way to preserv their own our first attent should be turn to the proposit itself—th peopl are the best keeper of their own liberti but who are the peopl such as shall be success chosen to repres them here is a confus both of word and idea which though it may pass with the gener of reader in a fugit pamphlet or with a major of auditor in a popular harangu ought for that veri reason to be as care avoid in polit as it is in philosophi or mathemat if by the peopl is meant the whole bodi of a great nation it should never be forgotten that they can never act consult or reason togeth becaus they can not march five hundr mile nor spare the time nor find a space to meet and therefor the proposit that they are the best keeper of their own liberti is not true they are the worst conceiv they are no keeper at all they can neither act judg think or will as a bodi polit or corpor if by the peopl is meant all the inhabit of a singl citi they are not in a gener assembl at all time the best keeper of their own liberti nor perhap at ani time unless you separ from them the execut and judici power and temper their author in legisl with the matur counsel of the one and the few if it is meant by the peopl as our author explain himself a repres assembl such as shall be success chosen to repres the peopl still they are not the best keeper of the peopl liberti or their own if you give them all the power legisl execut and judici they would invad the liberti of the peopl at least the major of them would invad the liberti of the minor sooner and often than an absolut monarchi such as that of franc spain or russia or than a wellcheck aristocraci like venic bern or holland an excel writer ha said somewhat incauti that a peopl will never oppress themselv or invad their own right thi compliment if appli to human natur or to mankind or to ani nation or peopl in be or in memori is more than ha been merit if it should be admit that a peopl will not unanim agre to oppress themselv it is as much as is ever and more than is alway true all kind of experi show that great number of individu do oppress great number of other individu that parti often if not alway oppress other parti and major almost univers minor all that thi observ can mean then consist with ani color of fact is that the peopl will never unanim agre to oppress themselv but if one parti agre to oppress anoth or the major the minor the peopl still oppress themselv for one part of them oppress anoth the peopl never think of usurp over other men right what can thi mean doe it mean that the peopl never unanim think of usurp over other men right thi would be trifl for there would by the supposit be no other men right to usurp but if the peopl never jointli nor sever think of usurp the right of other what occas can there be for ani govern at all are there no robberi burglari murder adulteri theft nor cheat is not everi crime a usurp over other men right is not a great part i will not say the greatest part of men detect everi day in some disposit or other stronger or weaker more or less to usurp over other men right there are some few inde whose whole live and convers show that in everi thought word and action they conscienti respect the right of other there is a larger bodi still who in the gener tenor of their thought and action discov similar principl and feel yet frequent err if we should extend our candor so far as to own that the major of men are gener under the dominion of benevol and good intent yet it must be confess that a vast major frequent transgress and what is more directli to the point not onli a major but almost all confin their benevol to their famili relat person friend parish villag citi counti provinc and that veri few inde extend it imparti to the whole commun now grant but thi truth and the question is decid if a major are capabl of prefer their own privat interest or that of their famili counti and parti to that of the nation collect some provis must be made in the constitut in favor of justic to compel all to respect the common right the public good the univers law in prefer to all privat and partial consider the proposit of our author then should be revers and it should have been said that they mind so much their own that they never think enough of other suppos a nation rich and poor high and low ten million in number all assembl togeth not more than one or two million will have land hous or ani person properti if we take into the account the women and children or even if we leav them out of the question a great major of everi nation is wholli destitut of properti except a small quantiti of cloth and a few trifl of other movabl would mr nedham be respons that if all were to be decid by a vote of the major the eight or nine million who have no properti would not think of usurp over the right of the one or two million who have properti is sure a right of mankind as realli as liberti perhap at first prejudic habit shame or fear principl or religion would restrain the poor from attack the rich and the idl from usurp on the industri but the time would not be long befor courag and enterpris would come and pretext be invent by degre to counten the major in divid all the properti among them or at least in share it equal with it present possessor debt would be abolish first tax laid heavi on the rich and not at all on the other and at last a downright equal divis of everi thing be demand and vote what would be the consequ of thi the idl the viciou the intemper would rush into the utmost extravag of debaucheri sell and spend all their share and then demand a new divis of those who purchas from them the moment the idea is admit into societi that properti is not as sacr as the law of god and that there is not a forc of law and public justic to protect it anarchi and tyranni commenc if thou shalt not covet and thou shalt not steal were not command of heaven they must be made inviol precept in everi societi befor it can be civil or made free if the first part of the proposit name that the peopl never think of usurp over other men right can not be admit is the second name they mind which way to preserv their own better found there is in everi nation and peopl under heaven a larg proport of person who take no ration and prudent precaut to preserv what they have much less to acquir more indol is the natur charact of man to such a degre that noth but the necess of hunger thirst and other want equal press can stimul him to action until educ is introduc in civil societi and the strongest motiv of ambit to excel in art trade and profess are establish in the mind of all men until thi emul is introduc the lazi savag hold properti in too littl estim to give himself troubl for the preserv or acquisit of it in societi the most cultiv and polish vaniti fashion and folli prevail over everi thought of way to preserv their own they seem rather to studi what mean of luxuri dissip and extravag they can invent to get rid of it the case is far otherwis among king and grande say our author as all nation in the world have felt to some purpos that is in other word king and grande think of usurp over other men right but do not mind which way to preserv their own it is veri easi to flatter the democrat portion of societi by make such distinct between them and the monarch and aristocrat but flatteri is as base an artific and as pernici a vice when offer to the peopl as when given to the other there is no reason to believ the one much honest or wiser than the other they are all of the same clay their mind and bodi are alik the two latter have more knowledg and sagac deriv from educ and more advantag for acquir wisdom and virtu as to usurp other right they are all three equal guilti when unlimit in power no wise man will trust either with an opportun and everi judici legisl will set all three to watch and control each other we may appeal to everi page of histori we have hitherto turn over for proof irrefrag that the peopl when they have been uncheck have been as unjust tyrann brutal barbar and cruel as ani king or senat possess of uncontrol power the major ha etern and without one except usurp over the right of the minor they natur move say nedham within the circl of domin as in their proper centr when writer on legisl have recours to poetri their imag may be beauti but they prove noth thi howev ha neither the merit of a brilliant figur nor of a convinc argument the populac the rabbl the canail move as natur in the circl of domin whenev they dare as the nobl or a king nay although it may give pain truth and experi forc us to add that even the middl peopl when uncontrol have move in the same circl and have not onli tyrann over all abov and all below but the major among themselv ha tyrann over the minor and count it no less secur than wisdom and polici to brave it over the peopl declamatori flourish although they may furnish a mob with watchword afford no reason convict to the understand what is meant by brave it in the histori of holland you will see the peopl brave it over the de witt and in that of florenc siena bologna pistoia and the rest over mani other cæsar crassu and anoth made a contract with each other that noth should be done without the concurr of all three societatem inier ne quid ageretur in republica quod displicuisset ulli e tribu nedham could not have select a less fortun exampl for hi purpos sinc there never wa a more arrant creatur of the peopl than cæsar no not even catilin wat tyler massaniello or shay the peopl creat cæsar on the ruin of the senat and on purpos to usurp over the right of other but thi exampl among innumer other is veri apposit to our purpos it happen univers when the peopl in a bodi or by a singl repres assembl attempt to exercis all the power of govern they alway creat three or four idol who make a bargain with each other first to do noth which shall displeas ani one these hold thi agreement until one think himself abl to disembarrass himself of the other two then they quarrel and the strongest becom singl tyrant but whi is the name of pompey omit who wa the third of thi triumvir becaus it would have been too unpopular it would have too easili confut hi argument and have turn it against himself to have said that thi associ wa between pompey cæsar and crassu against cato the senat the constitut and liberti which wa the fact can you find a peopl who will never be divid in opinion who will be alway unanim the peopl of rome were divid as all other peopl ever have been and will be into a varieti of parti and faction pompey crassu and cæsar at the head of differ parti were jealou of each other their divis strengthen the senat and it friend and furnish mean and opportun of defeat mani of their ambiti design cæsar perceiv it and paid hi court both to pompey and crassu in order to hinder them from join the senat against him he separ repres the advantag which their enemi deriv from their misunderstand and the eas with which if unit they might concert among themselv all affair of the republ gratifi everi friend and disappoint everi enemi the other exampl of augustu lepidu and antoni is equal unfortun both are demonstr that the peopl did think of usurp other right and that they did not mind ani way to preserv their own the senat wa now annihil mani of them murder augustu lepidu and antoni were popular demagogu who agre togeth to fleec the flock between them until the most cun of the three destroy the other two fleec the sheep alon and transmit the shear to a line of tyrant how can thi writer say then that while the govern remain untouch in the peopl hand everi particular man live safe the direct contrari is true everi man live safe onli while the senat remain as a check and balanc to the peopl the moment that control wa destroy no man wa safe while the govern remain untouch in the variou order the consul senat and peopl mutual balanc each other it might be said with some truth that no man could be undon unless a true and satisfactori reason wa render to the world for hi destruct but as soon as the senat wa destroy and the govern came untouch into the peopl hand no man live safe but the triumvir and their tool ani man might be and multitud of the best men were undon without render ani reason to the world for their destruct but the will the fear or the reveng of some tyrant these popular leader in our author own languag save and destroy depress and advanc whom they pleas with a wet finger the second argument to prove that the peopl in their success singl assembl are the best keeper of their own liberti is— becaus it is ever the peopl care to see that author be so constitut that it shall be rather a burden than benefit to those that undertak it and be qualifi with such slender advantag of profit or pleasur that men shall reap littl by the enjoy the happi consequ whereof is thi that none but honest gener and public spirit will then desir to be in author and that onli for the common good henc it wa that in the infanc of the roman liberti there wa no canvass of voic but singl and plainheart men were call entreat and in a manner forc with importun to the helm of govern in regard of that great troubl and pain that follow the employ thu cincinnatu wa fetch out of the field from hi plough and place much against hi will in the sublim digniti of dictat so the nobl camillu and fabiu and curiu were with much ado drawn from the recreat of garden to the troubl of govern and the consulyear be over they return with much glad again to their privat employ the first question which would aris in the mind of an intellig and attent reader would be whether thi were burlesqu and a republ travesti but as the principl of thi second reason is veri pleas to a larg bodi of narrow spirit in everi societi and as it ha been adopt by some respect author without suffici consider it may be proper to give it a seriou investig the peopl have in some countri and season made their servic irksom and it is popular with some to make author a burden but what ha been the consequ to the peopl their servic ha been desert and they have been betray those veri person who have flatter the mean of the stingi by offer to serv them grati and by purchas their suffrag have carri the liberti and properti of their constitu to market and sold them for veri handsom privat profit to the monarch and aristocrat portion of societi and so long as the rule of make their servic a burthen is persist in so long will the peopl be serv with the same kind of address and fidel by hypocrit pretenc to disinterest benevol and patriot until their confid is gain their affect secur and their enthusiasm excit and by knavish bargain and sale of their caus and interest afterward but although there is alway among the peopl a parti who are justli chargeabl with mean and avaric envi and ingratitud and thi parti ha sometim been a major who have liter made their servic burdensom yet thi is not the gener charact of the peopl a more univers fault is too much affect confid and gratitud not to such as realli serv them whether with or against their inclin but to those who flatter their inclin and gain their heart honest and gener spirit will disdain to deceiv the peopl and if the public servic is wil render burdensom they will realli be avers to be in it but hypocrit enough will be found who will pretend to be also loth to serv and feign a reluct consent for the public good while they mean to plunder in everi way they can conceal there are conjunctur when it is the duti of a good citizen to hazard and sacrific all for hi countri but in ordinari time it is equal the duti and interest of the commun not to suffer it everi wise and free peopl like the roman will establish the maxim to suffer no gener action for the public to go unreward can our author be suppos to be sincer in recommend it as a principl of polici to ani nation to render her servic in the armi navi or in council a burden an unpleas employ to all her citizen would he depend upon find human spirit enough to fill public offic who would be suffici elev in patriot and gener benevol to sacrific their eas health time parent wive children and everi comfort conveni and eleg of life for the public good is there ani religion or moral that requir thi which permit the mani to live in affluenc and eas while it oblig a few to live in miseri for their sake the peopl are fond of call public men their servant and some are not abl to conceiv them to be servant without make them slave and treat them as planter treat their negro but good master have a care how you use your power you may be tyrant as well as public offic it seem accord to our author himself that honesti and generos of spirit and the passion for the public good were not motiv strong enough to induc hi hero to desir to be in public life they must be call entreat and forc by singl and plainheart men he mean the same no doubt with those describ by the other express honest gener and public spirit cincinnatu camillu fabiu and curiu were men as simpl and as gener as ani and these all by hi own account had a strong avers to the public servic either these great charact must be suppos to have practis the nolo episcopari to have held up a fictiti avers for what they realli desir or we must allow their reluct to have been sincer if counterfeit these exampl do not deserv our imit if sincer they will never be follow by men enough to carri on the busi of the world the glori of these roman charact can not be obscur nor ought the admir of their sublim virtu to be diminish but such exampl are as rare among statesmen as homer and milton are among poet a free peopl of common sens will not depend upon find a suffici number of such charact at ani one time still less a success of them for ani long durat for the support of their liberti to make a law that armi should be led senat counsel negoti conduct by none but such charact would be to decre that the busi of the world should come to a full stand and it must have stood as still in those period of the roman histori as at thi hour for such charact were nearli as scarc then as they are now the parallel of lysand pericl themistocl and cæsar are much easier to find in histori than those of camillu fabiu and curiu if the latter were with much difficulti drawn from their garden to govern and return with pleasur at the end of the consular year to their rural amus the former are as ardent to continu in the public servic and if the public will not legal reward them they plunder the public to reward themselv the father of themistocl had more avers to public life than cincinnatu and to moder the propens of hi son who ardent aspir to the highest offic of the state point to the old galley roll in the dock there say he see the old statesmen worn out in the servic of their countri thu alway neglect when no longer of use yet the son ardor wa not abat though he wa not one of those honest spirit that aim onli at the public good pericl too though hi fortun wa small and the honest emolu of hi offic veri moder discov no such avers to the servic on the contrari he enter into an emul in prodig with cimon who wa rich in order equal to dazzl the eye of the multitud to make himself the soul of the republ and master of the affect of the populac to enabl them to attend the public assembl and theatric represent for hi purpos he lavish hi donat yet he wa so far from be honest and gener and aim sole at the public good that he avail himself of the rich of the state to suppli hi extravag of expens and made it an invari maxim to sacrific everi thing to hi own ambit when the public financ were exhaust to avoid account for the public money he involv hi countri in a war with sparta but we must not reli upon these gener observ alon let us descend to a particular consider of our author exampl in everi one of which he is veri unfortun the retir of cincinnatu to the countri wa not hi choic but hi necess cæso hi son had offend the peopl by an outrag opposit to their honest struggl for liberti and had been fine for a crime the father rather than let hi bondsmen suffer paid the forfeitur of hi recogniz reduc himself to poverti and the necess of retir to hi spade or plough did the peopl entreat and forc him back to rome no it wa the senat in opposit to the peopl who dread hi high aristocrat principl hi power connect and person resent nor did he discov the least reluct to the servic ordain him by the senat but accept it without hesit all thi appear in livi clearli contradictori to everi sentiment of our author at anoth time when disput ran so high between the tribun and the senat that sedit were apprehend the senat exert themselv in the centuri for the elect of cincinnatu to the great alarm and terror of the people† cincinnatu in short although hi moral charact and privat life were irreproach among the plebeian appear to have owe hi appoint to offic not to them but the senat and not for popular qualiti but for aristocrat one and the determin opposit of himself and hi whole famili to the peopl he appear to have been forc into servic by no parti but to have been as will as he wa an abl instrument of the senat in order to see the inaptitud of thi exampl in anoth point of view let the question be ask what would have been the fortun of cincinnatu if nedham right constitut had then been the govern of rome the answer must be that he would have lost hi elect most probabl even into the repres assembl most certainli he would never have been consul dictat or command of armi becaus he wa unpopular thi exampl then is no argument in favor of our author but a strong one against him if we recollect the charact and action of curiu we shall find them equal conclus in favor of balanc govern and against our author plan maniu curiu dentatu in the year of rome obtain as consul a doubl triumph for forc the samnit to sue for peac thi nation have their countri laid wast sent their princip men as ambassador to offer present to curiu for hi credit with the senat in order to their obtain favor term of peac they found him sit on a stool befor the fire in hi littl hous in the countri and eat hi dinner out of a wooden dish they open their deput and offer him the gold and silver he answer them polit but refus the present he then ad somewhat which at thi day doe not appear so veri polish i think it gloriou to command the owner of gold not to possess it myself and which passion do you think is the worst the love of gold or thi pride and ambit hi whole estat wa seven acr of land and he said onc in assembl that a man who wa not content with seven acr of land wa a pernici citizen as we pass it may be proper to remark the differ of time and circumst how few in america could escap the censur of pernici citizen if curiuss rule were establish is there one of our yeomen content with seven acr how mani are discont with seventi time seven exampl then drawn from time of extrem poverti and a state of a veri narrow territori should be appli to our circumst with great discret as long as the aristocraci last a few of those rigid charact appear from time to time in the roman senat cato wa one to the last and went expressli to visit the hous of curiu in the countri of the sabin wa never weari of view it contempl the virtu of it ancient owner and desir warmli to imit them but though declamatori writer might call the conduct of curiu exactissima romanæ frugalitati norma it wa not the gener charact even of the senat at that time avaric rage like a fieri furnac in the mind of creditor most of whom were patrician and equal avaric and injustic in the mind of plebeian who instead of aim at moder the law against debtor would be content with noth short of a total abolit of debt onli two year after thi name in so tenaci were the patrician and senat of all the rigor of their power over debtor that veturiu the son of a consul who had been reduc by poverti to borrow money at an exorbit interest wa deliv up to hi creditor and that infam usur c plotiu exact from him all the servic of a slave and the senat would grant no relief and when he attempt to subject hi slave to a brutal passion which the law did not toler and scourg him with rod becaus he would not submit all the punish which the consul and senat would impos on plotiu wa imprison thi anecdot prove that the indiffer to wealth wa far from be gener either among patrician or plebeian and that it wa confin to a few patrician famili whose tenaci of the maxim and manner of their ancestor proudli transmit it from age to age in curiu wa consul a second time when the plagu and a war with pyrrhu had last so long as to threaten the final ruin of the nation and oblig the centuri to choos a sever charact not becaus he wa belov but becaus hi virtu and abil alon could save the state the auster charact of the consul wa accompani by correspond auster in thi time of calam in the censor who degrad sever knight and senat and among the rest rufinu who had been twice consul and onc dictat for extravag and luxuri pyrrhu wa defeat and curiu again triumph and becaus a continu of the war with pyrrhu wa expect he wa again elect consul in in he wa censor after all he wa so littl belov that an accus wa brought against him for have convert the public spoil to hi own use and he wa not acquit till he had sworn that no part of them had enter hi hous but a wooden bowl which he use in sacrific all these sublim virtu and magnanim action of curiu make noth in favor of nedham he wa a patrician a senat and a consul he had been taught by aristocrat ancestor form in an aristocrat school and wa full of aristocrat pride he doe not appear to have been a popular man either among the senat in gener or the plebeian rufinu hi rival with hi plate and luxuri appear by hi be appoint dictat to have been more belov notwithstand that the censor on the preval of curiuss parti in a time of distress were abl to disgrac him it wa in that the senat receiv an embassi from ptolemi philadelphu king of egypt and sent four of the princip men in rome q fabiu gurg c fabiu pistor numer fabiu pistor and q ogulniu ambassador to egypt to return the compliment q fabiu who wa at the head of the embassi wa princ of the senat and on hi return report their commiss to the senat said that the king had receiv them in the most oblig and honor manner that he had sent them magnific present on their arriv which they had desir him to excus them from accept that at a feast befor they took leav the king had order crown of gold to be given them which they place upon hi statu the next day that on the day of their departur the king had given them present far more magnific than the former reproach them in a most oblig manner for not have accept them these they had accept with most profound respect not to offend the king but that on their arriv in rome they had deposit them in the public treasuri that ptolemi had receiv the allianc of the roman peopl with joy the senat were much pleas and gave thank to the ambassador for have render the manner of the roman vener to foreign by their sincer disinterested but decre that the rich present deposit in the treasuri should be restor to them and the peopl express their satisfact in thi decre these present were undoubtedli immens rich but where wa the peopl care to make the servic a burden thank of the senat are no burden immens present in gold and silver vote out of the treasuri into the hand of the ambassador were no slender advantag of profit or pleasur at a time when the nation wa extrem poor and no individu in it veri rich but moreov three of these ambassador were fabii of one of those few simpl frugal aristocrat famili who neither made advantag of the law in favor of creditor to make great profit out of the peopl by exorbit usuri on one hand nor gave largess to the peopl to bribe their affect on the other so that although they were respect and esteem by all they were not hate nor much belov by ani and such is the fate of men of such simpl manner at thi day in all countri our author great mistak lie in hi quot exampl from a balanc govern as proof in favor of a govern without a balanc the senat and peopl were at thi time check on each other avaric the peopl were the elector into offic but none till veri late could be chosen but patrician none of the senat who enrich themselv by plunder the public of land or good or by extravag usuri from the peopl could expect their vote to be consul or other magistr and there wa no commerc or other mean of enrich themselv all therefor who were ambiti of serv in magistraci were oblig to be poor to thi constant check and balanc between the senat and peopl the product and the continu of these frugal and simpl patrician charact and famili appear to be owe if our author meant anoth affair of it is still less to hi purpos or rather still more conclus against him it wa so far from be true in the year the most simpl and frugal period of roman histori that none but honest gener and public spirit desir to be in author and that onli for the common good and that there wa no canvass for voic that the most illustri roman offer themselv as candid for the consulship and it wa onli the distress and immin danger of the citi from the etrurian and samnit and a univers alarm that induc the citizen to cast their eye on fabiu who did not stand when he saw the suffrag run for him he aros and spoke whi should he be solicit an old man exhaust with labor and satiat with reward to take the command that neither the strength of hi bodi or mind were the same he dread the capric of fortun some divin might think hi success too great too constant too much for ani mortal he had succeed to the glori of hi ancestor and he saw himself with joy succeed by other that great honor were not want at rome to valor nor valor to honor it wa extrem age not the slender advantag of honor that occas fabiuss disinclin as it did that of cincinnatu on anoth occas thi refus howev onli augment the desir of have him fabiu then requir the law to be read which forbad the reëlect of a consul befor ten year the tribun propos that it should be dispens with as all such law in favor of rotat ever are when the peopl wish it fabiu ask whi law were made if they were to be broken or dispens with by those who made them and declar that the law govern no longer but were govern by men† the centuri howev persev and fabiu wa chosen may the god make your choic success say the old hero dispos of me as you will but grant me one favor deciu for my colleagu a person worthi of hi father and of you and one who will live in perfect harmoni with me there is no such stingi of honor on the part of the peopl nor ani such reluct to the servic for want of them as our author pretend it wa old age and respect to the law onli and one would think the sentiment and languag of fabiu suffici aristocrat hi glori and the glori of hi ancestor and poster seem to be uppermost in hi thought and that disinterest wa not so preval in gener appear thi veri year for a great number of citizen were cite by the ædile to take their trial for possess more land than the law permit all thi rigor wa necessari to check the avid of the citizen but do you suppos american would make or submit to a law to limit to a small number or to ani number the acr of land which a man might possess fabiu fought conquer and return to rome to presid in the elect of the new consul and there appear circumst which show that the great zeal for him wa chiefli aristocrat the first centuri all aristocrat continu him appiu claudiu of consular digniti and sure not one of our author honest gener and public spirit nor one of hi singl and plainheart men but a warm interest and ambiti man offer himself a candid and employ all hi credit and that of all the nobil to be chosen consul with fabiu less as he said for hi privat interest than for the honor of the whole bodi of the patrician whom he wa determin to reëstablish in the possess of both consulship fabiu declin as the year befor but all the nobil surround hi seat and entreat him to be sure but to do what whi to rescu the consulship from the dreg and filth of the peopl to restor the digniti of consul and the order of patrician to their ancient aristocrat splendor fabiu appear inde to have been urg into the offic of consul but by whom by the patrician and to keep out a plebeian the senat and peopl were check each other struggl togeth for a point which the patrician could carri in no way but by violat the law and forc old fabiu into power the tribun had onc given way from the danger of the time but thi year they were not so dispos the patrician were still eager to repeat the irregular but fabiu although he declar he should be glad to assist them in obtain two patrician consul yet he would not violat the law so far as to nomin himself and no other patrician had interest enough to keep out l volumniu the plebeian who wa chosen with appiu claudiu thu fact and event which were evid creat by a struggl between two order in a balanc govern are adduc as proof in favor of a govern with onli one order and without a balanc such sever frugal such perfect disinterested in public charact appear onli or at least most frequent in aristocrat govern whenev the constitut becom democrat such auster disappear entir or at least lose their influenc and the suffrag of the peopl and if an unmix and uncheck peopl ever choos such men it is onli in time of distress and danger when they think no other can save them as soon as the danger is over they neglect these and choos other more plausibl and indulg there is so much pleasur in the contempl of these charact that we ought by no mean to forget camillu thi great charact wa never a popular one to the senat and the patrician he owe hi great employ and seem to have been select for the purpos of oppos the peopl the popular leader had no avers for themselv or their famili to public honor and offic with all their burden in p liciniu calvu the first of the plebeian order who had ever been elect militari tribun wa about to be reëlect when he aros and said roman you behold onli the

all the plebeian with the offic of militari tribun i devot him educ in my principl to the commonwealth and shall be much oblig to you if you will grant him the honor in my stead accordingli the son wa elect the militari tribun act with great ardor and braveri but were defeat and rome wa in a panic veri art augment by the patrician to give a pretext for take the command out of plebeian hand camillu wa creat dictat by the senat and carri on the war with such prudenc abil and success that he saw the richest citi of itali that of veii wa upon the point of fall into hi hand with immens spoil he now felt himself embarrass if he divid the spoil with a spare hand among the soldieri he would draw upon himself their indign and that of the plebeian in gener if he distribut them too gener he should offend the senat for with all the boast love of poverti of those time the senat and peopl the patrician and plebeian as bodi were perpetu wrangl about spoil booti and conquer land which further show that the real moder wa confin to a veri few individu or famili camillu to spare himself reproach and envi dictat as he wa wrote to the senat that by the favor of the god hi own exert and the patienc of the soldier veii would soon be in hi hand and therefor he desir their direct what to do with the spoil the senat were of two opinion liciniu wa for give notic to all the citizen that they might go and share in the plunder appiu claudiu would have it all brought into the public treasuri or appropri to the payment of the soldier which would eas the peopl of tax liciniu repli that if that money should be brought to the treasuri it would be the caus of etern complaint murmur and sedit the latter advic prevail and the plunder wa indiscrimin for the citi of veii after a ten year sieg in which mani command had been employ wa at last taken by camillu by stratagem and the opul of it appear so great that the dictat wa terrifi at hi own good fortun and that of hi countri he pray the god if it must be qualifi with ani disgrac that it might fall upon him not the commonwealth thi pieti and patriot howev did not alway govern camillu hi triumph betray an extravag of vaniti more than border on profan he had the arrog and presumpt to har four white hors in hi chariot a color peculiar to jupit and the sun an ambit more than roman more than human here the peopl were veri angri with camillu for have too littl rever for religion the next moment they were still more incens against him for have too much for he remind them of the vow he had made to consecr a tenth part of the spoil to apollo the peopl in short did not love camillu and the senat ador him becaus he oppos the multitud on all occas without ani reserv and appear the most ardent and activ in resist their capric it wa easier to conquer enemi than to pleas citizen thi mighti aristocrat grew so unpopular that one of the tribun accus him befor the peopl of appli part of the spoil of veii to hi own use and find upon consult hi

in all these exampl of cincinnatu curiu fabiu and camillu c our author quot exampl of virtu which grew up onli in a few aristocrat famili were cultiv by the emul between the two order in the state and by their struggl to check and balanc each other to prove the excel of a state where there is but one order no emul and no balanc thi is like the conduct of a poet who should enumer the cheer ray and refulg glori of the sun in a descript of the beauti of midnight whether success is or is not the grand preserv against corrupt the unit state of america have adopt thi author idea in thi reason so far as to make the governor and senat as well as the hous of repres annual elect they have therefor a clear claim to hi congratul they are that happi nation they ought to rejoic in the wisdom and justic

the grand preserv against corrupt or the grand inlet to it the elect of governor and senat are so guard that there is room to hope but if we recollect the experi of past age and other nation there are ground to fear the experi is made and will have fair play if corrupt break in a remedi must be provid and what that remedi must be is well enough known to everi man who think our author exampl are taken from the roman after the abolit of monarchi while the govern wa an aristocraci in the hand of a senat balanc onli by the tribun it is most certainli true that a stand author in the hand of one the few or the mani ha an impetu propens to corrupt and it is to control thi tendenc that three order equal and independ of each other are contend for in the legislatur while power wa in the hand of a senat accord to our author the peopl were ever in danger of lose their liberti it would be nearer the truth to say that the peopl had no liberti or a veri imperfect and uncertain liberti none at all befor the institut of the tribun and but an imperfect share afterward becaus the tribun were an unequ balanc to the senat and so on the other side were the consul sometim in danger from kingli aspir but whose fault wa that the senat had a suffici abhorr of such conspiraci it wa the peopl who encourag the ambit of particular person to aspir and who becam their partisan mæliu would have been made a king by the peopl if they had not been check by the senat and so would manliu to be convinc of thi it is necessari onli to recollect the stori spuriu mæliu a rich citizen of the equestrian order in the year befor christ and of rome the three hundr and fifteenth a time of scarciti and famin aspir to the consulship he bought a larg quantiti of corn in etruria and distribut it among the peopl becom

therefor wa not onli a traitor but a monster hi estat must be confisc hi hous pull down and the spot call æquimelium as a monument of the crime and the punishment† and hi corn distribut to the populac veri cheap in order to appeas them thi whole stori is a demonstr of the oppress of the peopl under the aristocraci of the extrem jealousi of that aristocraci of king of an oligarchi and of popular power of the constant secret wish of the peopl to set up a king to defend them against the nobl and of their readi to fall in with the view of ani rich man who flatter them and set him up as a monarch but it is a most unfortun instanc for nedham it wa not the peopl who defend the republ against the design of mæliu but the senat who defend it against both mæliu and the peopl had rome been then govern by marchamont nedham right constitut of a commonwealth mæliu would infal have been made a king and have transmit hi crown to hi heir the necess of an independ senat as a check upon the peopl is most appar in thi instanc if the peopl had been uncheck or if they had onli had the right of choos a hous of repres uncheck they would in either case have crown mæliu at the critic moment when the gaul had approach the capitol with such silenc as not to awaken the sentinel or even the dog m manliu who had been consul three year befor wa awaken by the cri of the gees which by the sanctiti of their consecr to juno had escap with their live in an extrem scarciti of provis he hasten to the wall and beat down one of the enemi who had alreadi laid hold of the battlement and whose fall from the

fraudan detractum corpori atqu usibu necessarii ad honorem uniu viri conferret say livi and in the year of rome the commonwealth gave to manliu a hous upon the capitol as a monument of hi valor and hi countri gratitud in the year of rome fiftyf year after the execut of mæliu and five year after the defenc of the capitol from the attack of brennu manliu is suspect of ambit those who had hitherto excit or been excit by the peopl to faction had been plebeian manliu wa a patrician of one of the most illustri famili he had been consul and acquir immort glori by hi militari exploit and by save the capitol he wa in short the rival of camillu who had obtain two signal victori over the gaul and from the new birth of the citi had been alway in offic either as dictat or militari tribun and even when he wa onli tribun hi colleagu consid him as their superior and held it an honor to receiv hi order as their chief in short by hi own reput the support of the quinctian famili and the enthusiast attach to him he had inspir into the nation he wa in fact and effect to all intent and purpos king in rome without the name but under the variou titl of consul dictat or militari tribun he treat said manliu even those creat with power equal to hi own not as hi colleagu but offic and substitut to execut hi order the aristocrat livi and all the other aristocrat of rome accus manliu of envi they say he could not bear such glori in a man whom he believ no worthier than himself he despis all the rest of the nobil the virtu servic and honor of camillu alon excit hi haughti and selfsuffici and tortur hi jealousi and pride he wa enrag to see him alway at the head of affair and command armi it is certain that thi practic of continu camillu alway at the head wa inconsist with the spirit of the constitut by which a rotat wa establish and the consul who had the command of armi could remain in offic but one year but thi is the natur of an aristocrat assembl as well as of a democrat one some emin spirit assist by three or four famili connect with him gain an ascend and excit an enthusiasm and then the spirit and letter too of the constitut is made to give way to him in the case befor us when camillu could not be consul he must be militari tribun and when he could not be militari tribun he must be dictat manliu is charg with envi and with vain speech camillu could not have recov rome from the gaul if i had not save the capitol and citadel thi wa liter true but aristocrat historian must brand the charact of manliu in order to depress the peopl and extol and ador that of camillu in order to elev the senat and the nobl but there is no solid reason to believ that manliu envi camillu more than that camillu and the quinctian famili were both enviou and jealou of manliu the hous upon the capitol wa what the quinctian famili could not bear the truth is an aristocrat despot then rule in rome and oppress the peopl to a cruel decre and one is tempt to say that manliu wa a better man than camillu or cincinnatu though not so secret design and profound a politician let the torrent of aristocrat histori and philosophi roll as it will there were two parti one of the nobl and anoth of the peopl manliu from superior human and equiti embrac the weaker camillu and the quinctii from famili pride like that of lycurgu domin over the stronger parti of which they were in full possess manliu threw himself into the scale of the peopl he enter into close intimaci and strict union with the tribun he spoke contemptu of the senat and flatter the multitud jam aurâ non consilio ferri famæqu magnæ mall

an attempt to get rid of it at almost ani rate wa a virtu the citi had been burnt and everi man oblig to rebuild hi hous not onli the poorest citizen but person in middl life had been oblig to

custom and manner of the age the centurion too display hi own merit and servic as well as hi gratitud to hi deliver manliu went further he caus the princip part of hi own patrimoni to be sold in order roman said he that i may not suffer ani of you whilst i have ani thing left to be adjudg to your creditor and made slave thi no doubt made him veri popular but in the warmth of hi democrat zeal he had been transport upon some occas to say in hi own hous that the senat had conceal or appropri to their own use the gold intend for the ransom of the citi from the gaul allud probabl to the fact for that gold had been deposit under the pedest of jupit statu manliu perhap thought that thi gold would be better employ to pay the debt of the peopl the senat recal the dictat who repair to the forum attend by all the senat ascend hi tribun and order hi lictor to cite manliu befor him manliu advanc with the peopl on one side wa the senat with their client and camillu at their head and on the other the peopl head by manliu and each parti readi for battl at the word of command and such a war will sooner or later be kindl in everi state where the two parti of poor and rich patrician and plebeian nobl and common senat and peopl call them by what name you will have not a third power in an independ execut to interven moder and balanc them the art dictat interrog manliu onli on the stori of the gold

descant on the artific of the senat in make a war the pretext for creat a dictat while their real design wa to employ that terribl author against him and the peopl the dictat order him to prison the peopl were deepli affect but the author wa thought to be legal and the roman had prescrib bound to themselv through which they dare not break the author of the dictat and senat held them in such respect that neither the tribun nor the peopl ventur to rais their eye or open their mouth they put on mourn howev and let their hair and beard grow and surround the prison with continu crowd manifest everi sign of grief and afflict they publicli said that the dictat triumph wa over the peopl not the volsci and that all that wa want wa to have manliu drag befor hi chariot everi thing discov symptom

power of the peopl to demolish one form of govern and erect anoth accord to their own judgment or will is clearli assert the necess of abolish the dictat and consul and give to one chief magistr the power to control the senat and protect the peopl is point out the senat is not propos to be abolish nor the assembl of the peopl nor their tribun but the abolit of cruel debtor law and redress of all the peopl grievanc is to be the consequ the aristocraci wa at that time a cruel tyranni the peopl felt it manliu acknowledg it both saw the necess of newmodel the constitut and introduc the three branch of romulu and lycurgu with better and clearer limit and both were desir of attempt it if in read histori the gloss and reflect of historian are taken implicitli a mistaken judgment will often be form rome wa an aristocraci and livi an aristocrat writer the constitut of govern the principl prejudic and manner of the time should never be a moment out of sight if we believ the roman manliu wa actuat onli by envi and ambit but if we consid hi action and the form of govern at the time we should be veri apt to pronounc him both a greater and a better man than camillu to speak candidli there wa a rivalri between the manlian and the quinctian famili and the struggl wa which should be the first famili and who the first man and such a struggl exist not onli in everi empir monarchi republ but in everi citi town and villag in the world but a philosoph might find as good reason to say that manliu wa sacrif to the envi jealousi and ambit of camillu and the quinctii as that hi popular endeavor for the plebeian sprung from envi of camillu and ambit to be the first man both were head of parti and had all the passion incid to such a situat but if a judgment must be pronounc which wa the best man and citizen there are veri strong argument in favor of manliu the name of king wa abhor by the roman but who and what had made it so brutu and hi brother aristocrat at the expuls of tarquin by appoint religi execr to be pronounc in the name of the whole state and for all succeed age against such as should dare to aspir to the throne in thi way ani word or ani thing may be made unpopular at ani time and in ani nation the senat were now abl to set up the popular cri that manliu aspir to the throne thi reviv all the religi horror which their establish execr had made an habitu part of their natur and turn an ignor superstiti populac against the best friend and the onli friend they had in the republ the senat first talk of assassin and anoth ahala but to be veri gentl they order the magistr to take care that the commonwealth sustain no prejudic from the pernici design of manliu thi wa wors than privat assassin it wa an assassin by the senat it wa judgment sentenc and execut without trial the timid stare peopl were intimid and even the tribun caught the panic and offer to take the odium off the senat and cite manliu befor the tribun of the peopl themselv and accus him in form it is imposs not to suspect nay fulli to believ that these tribun were bribe secretli by the senat they not onli abandon him with whom they had coöper but they betray the peopl their constitu in the most infam manner they said that in the present disposit manliu could not be openli attack without interest the peopl in hi defenc that violent measur would excit a civil war that it wa necessari to separ the interest of manliu from those of the peopl they themselv would cite him befor the tribun of the peopl and accus him in form noth said the tribun is less agreeabl to the peopl than a king as soon as the multitud see that your aim is not against them that from protector they are becom judg that their tribun are the accus and that a patrician is accus for have aspir at the tyranni no interest will be so dear to them as that of their liberti their liberti the liberti of plebeian at that time what a prostitut of sacr term yet gross as wa thi artific it laid fast hold of those blind prejudic which patrician and aristocrat had inspir and dupe effectu a stupid populac manliu wa cite by the tribun befor the peopl in a mourn habit he appear without a singl senat relat or friend or even hi own brother to express concern for hi fate and no wonder a senat and a person of consular digniti wa never known to have been so univers abandon but noth can be more fals than the reflect of historian upon thi occas so much did the love of liberti and the fear of be enslav prevail in the heart of the roman over all the tie of blood and natur it wa not love of liberti but absolut fear which seiz the peopl the senat had alreadi condemn him by their vote and given their consul dictatori power against manliu and hi friend the tribun themselv were corrupt with bribe or fear and no
