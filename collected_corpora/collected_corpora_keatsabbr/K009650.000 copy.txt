mhamet the turkish spi a continv of letter written by a turkish spi at pari give an imparti account to the divan at constantinopl of the most remark transact of europ and discov sever intrigu and secret of the christian court especi of that of franc continu from the year to the year written origin in arab translat into italian and from thenc into english london print for w tailor at the sign of the ship in paternost row the prefac it wa not so much the success of the former volum of these letter that ha promot their continu but the excel of the subject the beauti of the manner and the delight varieti they present us with convinc me that it wa imposs but they should pleas if it were possibl to give the reader in the translat the same idea he would conceiv were he to read the origin could i translat or inde could our languag express the stori with the same vivac the fame spirit and the same energi of word as the old exquisit qualifi arabian deliv it how much superior would it be to what it now appear with what pleasur with what raptur and extafi must it be receiv but it is not to be done i may translat the word and i have some hope the reader will suggest that i have done my duti but to render the sublim flight of the incompar mohmut hi bright idea hi surpris turn of wit and flight of fanci i say to render these exactli in our languag is as difficult as it is for a painter to repres the passion or a carver to make hi figur speak it is observ by the curiou that the most difficult thing in the limner art is to repres a person sing suppos it be the pictur of a young ladi the utmost he can do is to show her counten bright the compani listen and appear pleas but ala toward the sound toward the charm of her voic and the beauti of her judgment he can do no more than paint her with her mouth open which is the meanest postur she can with decenc be shown in and unless the other passion discov it she may as well be suppos to be swear scold sick or ani thing els as well at sing we can no more repres the eloqu the spirit the sprightli turn and the happi geniu of our accomplish inimit arabian by the most labor and studi translat into english than a limner can paint the voic and give the music of the song in the gestur of the ladi but when i have acknowledg thi the reader i hope will not find that all the care ha been taken to make old mahmut speak english i say all the care that consist with one veri sollicit to pleas and oblig as well as to divert and instruct abov all i have follow that sure rule in our tongu and which were it observ would i believ be acknowledg to be the best rule in all tongu viz to make the languag plain artless and honest suitabl to the stori and in a style easi and free with as few exot phrase and obsolet word as possibl that the meanest reader may meet with no difficulti in the read and may have no obstruct to hi search the histori of thing by their be obscur repres it wa object i know to the former volum of thi work that the turk wa brought in too much debas the christian religion extol mahomet and speak disrespect of jesu christ call him the nazaren and the son of mari and it is certain the continu must fall into the same method but either mahmut must be a turk or no turk either he must speak hi own languag or other peopl languag and how must we repres word spoken by him in the first person of invinc mahmut the arabian if we must not give hi own languag and how can thi work be a translat if we must not translat the veri style of the origin let those who think they have caus for ani observ of thi natur observ that all care possibl is taken to repres such passag in term that may give no offens and with thi caution to the reader that when he read those part he is desir to take them as the word of the arabian not the word of the translat and if ani thing may be said to be left out of the origin it can onli be such place where mahmut may have taken more liberti than might be proper for the repetit of christian reader on the other hand it will be observ in defens of the translat and of the good intent of the translat that as honest mahmut upon mani occas speak veri honor and even rever of our savior and particularli of the perfect law and rule of faith and doctrin and speak with detest of the apostasi of hi follow and of the unworthi behavior of those who profess to be hi discipl and worshipp so the translat ha not fail to take all occas to do justic to the origin in all those case in particular it is true the translat ha some letter on these subject which he ha not thought fit to make public becaus of the nice palat of a censori age who will take all advantag to insult the public of such a style while yet they concern not themselv to hear the deiti of our bless lord insult everi day in public by those who call themselv believ and even the be of a god deni by a much wors infidel than that of a mohammedan it is an observ not unworthi the remark of our arabian and may be veri use to those that read him viz that the practic atheism so rife in the world in thi age is a sin engross among christian that the mahometan know noth of it and that it is not heard of among the mussulman that ani man should arriv to that degre of hard in crime as to deni the be of a god whose glori the light of natur so evid reveal these letter are not onli a record of histori through the year they refer to and that not onli respect franc but all the part of the christian world but they are fruit of improv observ on mani subject as well religi as moral it is true our arabian grow ancient and we find him cast hi thought upon the pleasur of their mohammedan futur but as christian should when they grow nearer a futur state have their mind ting with the glori they expect so we find hi understand so far from a decay by hi year that he speak of religi thing with so much the more relish and tast as if he reallizd on earth the heaven he expect he must have veri few thought about him who can not see that the older our author grow the more profit and instruct hi write will be and yet we do not find hi fanci so confin but that he rang through all the region of scienc speak of the polit of state and progress of armi with as true deduct and as clear a judgment as ever if our correspond at vienna to whom mahmut commit hi paper and to whom they were faith deliv by hi successor doe not deceiv us we may expect a yet greater varieti toward the conclus of hi resid than ha yet seen the light and perhap some remain of thing omit in the time of former public which as they come to hand shall be commun with the greatest exact whether they may exactli correspond with the chronolog of former public or no and though there may seem a littl confus in such a retrospect yet i doubt not the beauti of the subject shall make full amend for ani disord in the date thi ha been the reason whi even in thi volum some letter especi of specul subject may come a littl out of the order of time which i think is a thing of so trifl a natur compar to the advantag of their public that it need not the least apolog for it a tabl of the letter and matter contain in thi volum vol i

it is without question true that thi jesu who they are denomin from wa a veri holi person endu with heavenli wisdom that he wrought innumer miracl and left them pure doctrin in write taken from hi

for some age follow with great exact and suffer inexpress torment from the roman emperor and govern in the defens of but their successor degener from the puriti and the rectitud of principl which their said ancestor retain have corrupt their religion to that degre that it is now one of the greatest piec of confus and buffoonri on earth it would have fill thee with indign vener and holi mirza had thou been here the other day when these nazareen were pay their public thank to their prophet jesu who thou know they pretend to say is even equal with god i went onc into one of their idolatr templ or mosqu to see the pageantri of their worship which curios led me to observ veri particularli becaus it wa upon an occas of rejoic or thanksgiv as they call it for take of philipsburg a citi of the emperor on the rhine when i wa not onli astonish at the ridicul folli of such a polit nation as thi is but even provok with a holi rage and i curs them by mahomet three time reserv serv it farther to thee to confirm the anathema which they have reason to expect and fall under verili it is scarc to be imagin how they can pretend if they did believ the ineff glori of the creator of heaven and earth and that their sacrific were offer to him that he would be captiv by the nois of fiddl and bagpip the shoot of great ordnanc the beat of kettledrum and the clamor of trumpet but thu it wa for their great rhapsodi of prais which they call te deum is thu manag behold just befor they began their song in the mosqu piec of canon were fire without as if they intend to awaken their prophet with the nois immedi after thi and just befor the door of the great mosqu i wa surpis with the confus of kettledrum five set of trumpet place at proper distanc and drummer of the king guard of foot which for a quarter of an hour compliment their god with tabor and pipe as soon as thi wa over an anthem so they call their idolatr song which they sing on these occas began within the mosqu sung by the voic of eunuch boy and women taught for those wick purpos their voic were inde excel and had they been employ on occas of mirth and delight not for the debauch the mind with corrupt idea in religion the harmoni of them wa admir fine these singer are place in stall for that purpos in sever gradat as their voic rise then follow the te deum which wa sung with the like voic but mix with innumer sort

creator of heaven and earth to whom they should rather appear as penit offend with mortif and sacrific of sorrow heart trembl even in their thanksgiv than with a nois of music and voic of triumph as if they were invit their great prophet to a festiv or masquerad i think often when i reflect on these infidel that they must certainli have veri gross concept of god and may well be said to think of him after the manner of men that is that he act after the manner of men it is not possibl that they can rever hi divin be in that aw and humbl manner as the true believ who wash their bodi from outward defil conceiv of god with perfect idea cover their eye and retreat with heavenli solitud into the inmost soul to contempl the be who is the sum and substanc of inconceiv glori the most which i meet with of defens for the barbar of thi custom is drawn by their cun dervic from the practic of the jew which they say wa given them by their ancient lawgiv mose but thi were it just in it self is most absurd in these nazareen becaus as they themselv pretend to be follow of their prophet jesu who they say is the messiah which mose himself foretold them wa to come and to put an end to all hi institut also they do declar that thi jesu ha fulfil all mosess law and abolish all those thing which belong to that ceremoni worship set up a more sure word of propheci or direct for worship and also that in all thi their said prophet direct which he left behind him there is not the least precept exampl or direct for such monstrou thing as drum trumpet etc in religi worship but that on the contrari he scourg all pageantri which they had set up out of their great mosqu or templ which wa at jerusalem declar that from that time the mosqu where god would be worship should be hous of prayer

of the mighti emperor of the island call here slightli the king of england for know thi haughti court give slight and mean titl to all their neighbor princ for thi king of england is inde a most power princ and hi empir though not larg in extent yet in power and strength is exceed great princip found in the prodigi wealth and the immens rich of hi countri and peopl he also possess besid the great island of britain and ireland i say he possess infinit tract of land island and coloni in the remotest part of the world hali bassa the late happi chaimacam of constantinopl thi friend and mine command me to write to him the histori of the fall of the king of that countri call england which i did at larg with the charact of hi person for we now see him here take sanctuari in the court of the king of franc who is hi great friend and protector but in answer to thi our friend hali sent me hi command to inform him how it came to pass that the king of franc or of the frank in whose countri i resid who thou know is taken with us for the greatest king among the nation of the messiah should at the same time that he profess so sincer friendship for the english king suffer that so mean and so weak a person as the princ of orang and who had no assist but that of the elutch to support him should invad and attack hi friend and alli the king of england when he knew at the same time that the subject of the said english king were malcont and inclin to revolt and my answer to these thing he ha wise command me to send to thee know it seem or believ by inspir that the predestin time of hi translat unto bliss wa approach know then illustri and valiant leader of the faith host that true it is that the present king of franc is the greatest of all the king of the christian nation abound in wealth and immens treasur surround with numer and victori armi and it is no more to be question but that he is and also then wa a sincer friend to the english king and would veri willingli have prevent the mischief which ha sinc befallen him nay had he not been hi friend yet prudenc and polici of state requir that he would by no mean have suffer the said english king to have been so invad see he knew perfectli well that the princ of orang wa not onli a warlik princ in himself but wa also a profess enemi to the great and ambit of franc it is also true that thi king of franc is now and wa at that time in the veri meridian of hi glori cloth with innumer triumph and trophi of victori which are the envi and grief of all the nation about him and that all those nation would rejoic to see the said princ of orang strengthen by the addit of the english power that they might join in confederaci with him to bridl the the exorbit of the french great which begin to be terribl to europ yet most true it is that noth but the infatu and unaccount indol of thi great monarch ha next to the irresist decre of heaven brought thi great affair to pass and thi doubtless wa the reason whi the illustri chaimacam enjoin me with such earnest to acquaint him with these thing sinc to him as i doubt not it will to thee who art as he wa well acquaint with the state of thing in these part of the world it seem veri strang that the king of franc should stand still and look on in a matter which so nearli concern hi friend and alli and in effect himself and not prevent a mischief big with such danger event i must then acquaint thee that one fals step in the king of franc ha been the occas of all thi disast to hi friend the king of england and without which it had been imposs for the princ of orang to have brought ani of hi design to pass viz at the veri junctur of the prepar of the dutch the french king as if he wa confeder with them resolv to push at the emperor of germani send the dauphin with a french armi of men quit out of the way to the upper rhine and caus him to sit down befor phillipsburg wherea had he caus men to have advanc to the mae and but hover over the dutch frontier though without ani attempt the dutch could never have part with their troop to make the attempt in england these measur they are now satisfi here were wrong and the most formid enemi they have is by thi veri step strengthen with the addit of those kingdom which alon are abl to look the french armi in the face but the opinion those peopl have of the invinc power of their king is such that they valu not the whole world which confid may howev be fatal to them in the end inde hi armi are compos of excel troop but then it is to be consid that they are not all compos of hi own subject nay those which are of hi own subject are not esteem hi best troop but hi armi are compos of german swiss irish scot and some english and whenev a strong confederaci shall so attack him as that he shall not be abl to make up the loss of these with men of the same nation they will find the french infantri inferior to ani of the neighbor nation but thi must be grant that the offic of the french troop are good and it is to their conduct that the glori of their monarch is owe there is a say which is made use of when they talk of the french and english nation by way of comparison viz that of the french if the soldier will but follow the offic will alway lead andthat of the english if the offic will but lead the soldier will alway follow so that by the way an armi of english soldier led by french offic would be invinc how gloriou are the troop of thi illustri emperor in whose caus both soldier and offic equal emul of glori and of serv well the most invinc monarch of the univers are equal readi both to lead and to follow and to fix the gloriou crescent the ensign of our great mahomet upon the vanquish frontier of the sultan enemi may thi way be prosper and thi arm victori in the

believ him to be inferior to our most holi prophet mahomet but assuredli if he prophesi that hi follow should in the latter day believ lie and be given up to strong delus there is no question but in that he ha been a true prophet these hugonot are by far an honest and wiser sect of the nazareen than those who are call cathol and therefor have been persecut and even extirp out of the kingdom of
