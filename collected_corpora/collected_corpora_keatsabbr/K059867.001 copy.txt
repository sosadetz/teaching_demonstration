who equal remov from the corrupt of opul and from the depress of bodili labor are bent on use knowledg who even in the delirium of youth feel the dawn of patriot and who in riper year enjoy it meridian warmth to such men thi work is dedic and that they may profit by it is the author ardent wish and probabl will be while ani spirit remain in him to form a wish may not he hope that thi work child of hi gray hair will surviv and bear testimoni for him to good men that even a labori call which left him not mani leisurehour never banish from hi mind that he would littl deserv to be of the human speci were he indiffer about hi fellow creatur homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto most of the subject handl in the follow sheet admit but of probabl reason which is not a littl slipperi as with respect to mani reason of that kind it is difficult to pronounc what degre of convict they ought to produc it is easi to form plausibl argument but to form such as will stand the test of time is not alway easi i could amus the reader with numer exampl of conjectur argument which fair at a distant view vanish like a cloud on a near approach in the first sketch of thi book not to go farther he will find record more than one exampl the dread of be misl by such argument fill the author with anxieti and after hi utmost attent he can but faintli hope that he ha not often wander far from truth abov thirti year ago he began to collect materi for a natur histori of man and in the vigor of youth did not think the undertak too bold even for a singl hand he ha discov of late that hi utmost abil are scarc suffici for execut a few imperfect sketch edinburgh feb to the reader as one great object of the editor is to make thi a popular work he ha chiefli with a view to the femal sex subjoin an english translat of all the quotat from other languag sketch of the histori of man book i progress of men as individu sketch i divers of men and of languag whether there be differ race of men or whether all men be of one race without ani differ but what proce from climat or other accid is a profound question of natur histori which remain still undetermin after all that ha been said upon it as the question is of moment in trace the histori of man i purpos to contribut my mite and in order to admit all the light possibl a view of brute anim as divid into differ race or kind will make a proper introduct as mani anim contribut to our wellb by labor for us or by afford us food and raiment and as mani are noxiou our terrestri habit would be littl comfort had we no mean but experi for distinguish the one sort from the other were each individu anim a speci by itself indulg the express differ from everi other individu a man would finish hi day without acquir so much knowledg of anim as is necessari even for selfpreserv experi would give him no aid with respect to ani individu of which he ha no experi the deiti ha left none of hi work imperfect anim are form of differ kind each kind have a figur and a temper peculiar to itself great uniform is discov among anim of the same kind no less varieti among anim of differ kind and to prevent confus kind are distinguish extern by figur air manner so clearli as not to escap even a child and out of the ground the lord god form everi beast of the field and everi fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and adam gave name to all cattl and to the fowl of the air and to everi beast of the field genesi ii to complet thi curiou system we have an innat sens that each kind is endu with properti peculiar to itself and that these properti belong to everi individu of the kind see element of critic edit vol p our road to the knowledg of anim is thu wonder abridg the experi we have of the disposit and properti of ani anim is appli without hesit to everi one of the kind by that sens a child familiar with one dog is fond of other that resembl it an european upon the first sight of a cow in africa stroke it as gentl and innoc and an african avoid a tiger in hindostan as at home if the forego theori be well found neither experi nor argument is requir to prove that a hors is not an ass or that a monkey is not a man see m buffon natur histori some anim inde are so similar as to render it uncertain whether they be not radic of the same speci but in everi such instanc there is littl need to be solicit for i ventur to affirm that both will be found gentl or fierc wholesom food or unwholesom such question may be curiou but they are of no use the divis of brute anim into differ kind is not more use to man than to the anim themselv a beast of prey would be ill fit for it station if natur did not teach it what creatur to attack and what to avoid a rabbit is the prey of the ferret present a rabbit even dead to a young ferret that never had seen a rabbit it throw itself upon the bodi and bite it with furi a hound ha the same instinct with respect to a hare and most dog have it unless direct by natur innoc anim would not know their enemi till they were in it clutch a hare fli with precipit from the first dog it ever saw and a chicken upon the first sight of a kite cower under it dam social anim without scrupl connect with their own kind and as readili avoid other the populac about smyrna have a cruel amus they lay the egg of a hen in a stork nest upon see the chicken the male in amaz call hi neighbor stork togeth who to reveng the affront put upon them destroy the poor innoc femal while he bewail hi misfortun in heavi lament bird are not afraid of quadrup not even of a cat till they are taught by experi that a cat is their enemi they appear to be as littl afraid of a man natur and upon that account are far from be shi when left unmolest in the uninhabit island of visia grand one of the philippin kempfer say that bird may be taken with the hand hawk in some of the south sea island are equal tame at port egmont in the falkland island gees far from be shi may be knock down with a stick the bird that inhabit certain rock hang over the sea in the island of annabon take food readili out of a man hand in arabia felix fox and ape show no fear of man the inhabit of hot countri have no notion of hunt in the uninhabit island bere adjac to kamskatka the fox are so littl shi that they scarc go out of a man way doe not thi observ suggest a final caus a partridg a plover a pheasant would be lost to man for food were they natur as much afraid of him as of a hawk or a kite the divis of anim into differ kind serv anoth purpos not less import than those mention which is to fit them for differ climat we learn from experi that no anim nor veget is fit for everi climat and from experi we also learn that there is no anim or veget but what is fit for some climat where it grow to perfect even in the torrid zone plant of a cold countri are found upon mountain where plant of a hot countri will not grow and the height of a mountain may be determin with toler precis from the plant it produc wheat is not an indigen plant in britain no farmer is ignor that foreign seed is requisit to preserv the plant in vigor to prevent flax from degener in scotland and ireland great quantiti of foreign seed are annual import a camel is peculiarli fit for the burn sand of arabia and lapland would be uninhabit but for raindeer an anim so entir fit for pierc cold that it can not subsist even in a temper climat arabian and barbari hors degener in britain and to preserv the breed in some degre of perfect frequent suppli from their origin climat are requisit spanish hors degener in mexico but improv in chili have more vigor and swift there than even the andalusian race whose offspr they are our dunghillfowl import origin from a warm countri in asia are not harden even after mani centuri to bear the cold of thi countri like bird origin nativ the hen lay few or no egg in winter unless in a hous warm with fire the desert of zaara and biledulgerid in africa may be properli term the nativ countri of lion there they grow to nine feet long and five feet high lion in the south of africa toward the cape of good hope grow but to five feet and a half long and to three and a half high a breed of lion transplant from the latter to the former would rise to the full size and sink to the smaller size if transplant from the former to the latter to preserv the differ speci of anim entir as far as necessari provid is care to prevent a mix breed few anim of differ speci copul togeth some may be brought to copul but without effect and some produc a mongrel a mule for exampl which seldom procreat if at all in some few instanc where a mixtur of speci is harmless procreat goe on without limit all the differ speci of the dog kind copul togeth and the mongrel produc gener other without end but dog are by their natur companion to men and provid probabl ha permit a mixtur in order that everi man may have a dog to hi like m buffon in hi natur histori borrow from ray wisdom of god in the work of creation a veri artifici rule for ascertain the differ speci of anim ani two anim that can procreat togeth and whose issu can also procreat are of the same speci octavo edit vol p and in mani other part a hors and an ass can procreat togeth but they are not say he of the same speci becaus their issu a mule can not procreat he appli that rule to the human race hold all men to be of one race or speci becaus a man and a woman howev differ in size in shape in complexion can procreat togeth without end and by the same rule he hold all dog to be of one speci with respect to other anim the rule should pass without opposit from me but as it also respect man the subject of the present enquiri i propos to examin it with attent provid it is true ha prevent confus for in most instanc it ha withheld from anim of differ speci a power of procreat togeth but as our author ha not attempt to prove that such restraint is univers without a singl except hi rule is evid a petitio principii whi may not two anim differ in speci produc a mix breed buffon must say that by a law of natur anim of differ speci never produc a mix breed but ha he prove thi to be a law of natur on the contrari he more than onc mention sever except he admit the sheep and the goat to be of a differ speci and yet we have hi author for affirm that a hegoat and a ewe produc a mix breed which gener for ever vol p the camel and the dromedari though nearli relat are howev no less distinct than the hors and the ass the dromedari is less than the camel more slender and remark more swift of foot it ha but one bunch on it back the camel ha two the race is more numer than that of the camel and more wide spread one would not desir distinguish mark more satisfi and yet these two speci propag togeth no less freeli than the differ race of men and of dog buffon inde with respect to the camel and dromedari endeavor to save hi credit by a distinct without a differ they are say he one speci but their race are differ and have been so past all memori vol p doe thi say more than that the camel and the dromedari are differ speci of the same genu which also hold true of the differ speci of men and of dog if our author will permit me to carri back to the creation the camel and the dromedari as two distinct race i desir no other concess he admit no fewer than ten kind of goat visibl distinguish which also propag togeth but say that these are varieti onli though perman and unchang no difficulti is unsurmount if word be allow to pass without mean nor doe he even preserv ani consist in hi opinion though in distinguish a hors from an ass he affirm the mule they gener to be barren yet afterward entir forget hi rule he admit the direct contrari vol p at that rate a hors and an ass are of the same speci did it never onc enter into the mind of thi author that the human race would be strang imperfect if they were unabl to distinguish a man from a monkey or a hare from a hedgehog till it were known whether they can procreat togeth but it seem unnecessari after all to urg ani argument against the forego rule which m buffon himself inadvert abandon as to all anim men and dog except we are indebt to him for a remark that not a singl anim of the torrid zone is common to the old world and to the new but how doe he verifi hi remark doe he ever think of tri whether such anim can procreat togeth they are say he of differ kind have no such resembl as to make us pronounc them to be of the same kind linnaeu and brisson he add have veri improperli given the name of the camel to the lama and the paco of peru so appar is the differ that other writer class these anim with sheep wool howev is the onli circumst in which a paco resembl a sheep nor doe the lama resembl a camel except in length of neck he distinguish in the same manner the true asiat tiger from sever american anim that bear the same name he mention it size it forc it feroc the color of it hair the strip black and white that like ring surround altern it trunk and are continu to the end of it tail charact say he that clearli distinguish the true tiger from all anim of prey in the new world the largest of which scarc equal one of our mastiv and he reason in the same manner upon the other anim of the torrid zone see vol sec of anim common to the two contin here then we have m buffon author against himself that there are differ race of men for he can not deni that certain tribe differ appar from each other not less than the lama and paco from the camel or from the sheep nor less than the true tiger from the american anim of that name which of hi rule are we to follow must we appli differ rule to differ anim and to what anim are we to appli the differ rule for prove that dog were creat of differ kind what better evid can be expect than that the kind continu distinct to thi day our author pretend to deriv the mastiff the bulldog the hound the greyhound the terrier the waterdog etc all of them from the pricktear shepherd cur now admit the progeni of the origin male and femal cur to have suffer everi possibl alter from climat food domest the result would be endless varieti so as that no one individu should resembl anoth whenc then are deriv the differ speci of dog abov mention or the differ race or varieti as m buffon is pleas to name them uniform and perman must be a law in their natur for they never can be the product of chanc there are mongrel it is true among dog from want of choic or from a deprav appetit but as all anim prefer their own kind mongrel are few compar with anim of a true breed there are mongrel also among men the sever kind howev continu distinct and probabl will so continu for ever the celebr linnaeu instead of describ everi anim accord to it kind as adam our first parent did and buffon copi from him ha wander wonder far from natur in class anim he distribut them into six class viz mammalia ave amphibia pisc insecta verm the mammalia are distribut into seven order chiefli from their teeth viz primat bruta fera glire pecora bellua cete and the primat are homo simia lemur vespertilio what may have been hi purpos in class anim so i can not guess if it be not to enabl us from the nippl and teeth of ani particular anim to know where it lie in hi book it resembl the class book in a librari by size or by bind without regard to the content it may serv as a sort of dictionari but to no other purpos so far as i can discov how whimsic is it to class togeth anim that natur ha wide separ a man for exampl and a bat what will a plain man think of a method of class that deni a whale to be a fish besid one would wish to know whi in class anim he confin himself to the nippl and the teeth when there are mani other distinguish mark anim are not less distinguish by their tail long tail short tail no tail nor less distinguish by their hand some have four hand some two some none etc etc at the same time if ani solid instruct is to be acquir from such class i shall listen not onli with attent but with satisfact and now more particularli of man after discuss other anim if the onli rule afford by natur for class anim can be depend on there are differ race of men as well as of dog a mastiff differ not more from a spaniel than a white man from a negro or a lapland from a dane and if we have ani faith in provid it ought to be so plant were creat of differ kind to fit them for differ climat and so were brute anim certain it is that all men are not fit equal for everi climat there is scarc a climat but what is natur to some men where they prosper and flourish and there is not a climat but where some men degener doe not then analog lead us to conclud that as there are differ climat on the face of thi globe so there are differ race of men fit for these differ climat the inhabit of the frozen region of the north men bird beast fish are all of them provid with a quantiti of fat which guard them against cold even the tree are full of rosin the esquimaux inhabit a bitter cold countri and their blood and their breath are remark warm the island st thoma under the line is extrem foggi and the nativ are fit for that sort of weather by the rigid of their fiber the fog is dispel in juli and august by dri wind which give vigor to european whose fiber are relax by the moistur of the atmospher as by a warm bath the nativ on the contrari who are not fit for a dri air have more diseas in juli and august than dure the other ten month on the other hand instanc are without number of men degener in a climat to which they are not fit by natur and i know not of a singl instanc where in such a climat peopl have retain their origin vigor sever european coloni have subsist in the torrid zone of america more than two centuri and yet even that length of time ha not familiaris them to the climat they can not bear heat like the origin inhabit nor like negro transplant from a countri equal hot they are far from equal in vigor of mind or bodi the nation from which they sprung the spanish inhabit of carthagena in south america lose their vigor and color in a few month their motion is languid and their word are pronounc with a low voic and with long and frequent interv european who are born in batavia soon degener scarc one of them ha talent suffici to bear a part in the administr there is not an offic of trust or figur but what is fill with nativ european some portugues who have been for age settl on the seacoast of congo retain scarc the appear of men south carolina especi about charlestown is extrem hot have no seabreez to cool the air european there die so fast that they have not time to degener even in jamaica though more temper by a regular success of land and seabreez recruit from britain are necessari to keep up the number the climat of the northern provinc resembl our own and popul goe on with great rapid thu it appear that there are differ race of men fit by natur for differ climat upon a thorough examin anoth fact will perhap also appear that the natur product of each climat make the most wholesom food for the peopl who are fit to live in it between the tropic the nativ live chiefli on fruit seed and root and it is the opinion of the most know naturalist that such food is of all the most wholesom for the torrid zone comprehend the hot plant which grow there to perfect and tend greatli to fortifi the stomach in a temper climat a mixtur of anim and veget food is held to be the most wholesom and there both anim and veget abound in a cold climat anim are in plenti but scarc ani veget that can serv for food to man what physician pronounc upon that head i know not but if we dare ventur a conjectur from analog anim food will be found the most wholesom for such as are made by natur to live in a cold climat m buffon from the rule that anim which can procreat togeth and whose progeni can also procreat are of one speci conclud that all men are of one race or speci and endeavor to support that favorit opinion by ascrib to the climat to food or to other accident caus all the varieti that are found among men but is he serious of opinion that ani oper of climat or of other accident caus can account for the copper color and smooth chin univers among the american the promin of the pudenda univers among hottentot women or the black nippl no less univers among femal samoid the thick fog of the island st thoma may relax the fiber of the nativ but can not make them more rigid than they are natur whenc then the differ with respect to rigid of fiber between them and european but from origin natur it is in vain to ascrib to the climat the low statur of the esquimaux the small of their feet or the overgrown size of their head it is equal in vain to ascrib to climat the low statur of the lapland by late account it appear that the lapland are onli degener tartar and that they and the hungarian origin sprung from the same breed of men and from the same countri pere hell the jesuit an hungarian made late thi discoveri when sent to lapland for make some astronom observ or their ugli visag lapland is inde piercingli cold but so is finland and the northern part of norway the inhabit of which are tall come and well proport the black color of negro thick lip flat nose crisp woolli hair and rank smell distinguish them from everi other race of men the abyssinian on the contrari are tall and well made their complexion a brown oliv featur well proport eye larg and of a sparkl black thin lip a nose rather high than flat there is no such differ of climat between abyssinia and negroland as to produc these strike differ at ani rate there must be a consider mixtur both of soil and climat in these extens region and yet not the least mixtur is perceiv in the peopl if the climat have ani command influenc it must be chiefli display upon the complexion and in that articl accordingli our author exult man say he white in europ black in africa yellow in asia and red in america is still the same anim ting onli with the color of the climat where the heat is excess as in guinea and seneg the peopl are perfectli black where less excess as in abyssinia the peopl are less black where it is more temper as in barbari and in arabia they are brown and where mild as in europ and lesser asia they are fair book but here he triumph without a victori he is forc to acknowledg that the samoid lapland and greenland are of a sallow complexion for which he ha the follow salvo that the extrem of heat and of cold produc nearli the same effect on the skin but he is total silent upon a fact that singli overturn hi whole system of color viz that all american without except are of a copper color though in that vast contin there is everi varieti of climat neither doe the black color of some african nor the brown color of other correspond to the climat the peopl of the desert of zaara commonli term lower ethiopia though expos to the vertic ray of the sun in a burn sand yield not even to guinea in heat are of a tawni color far from be jet black like negro the nativ of monomotapa are perfectli black with crisp woolli hair though the southern part of that extens kingdom are in a temper climat veri differ from that of guinea and the caffr even those who live near the cape of good hope are the same sort of peopl the heat of abyssinia approach nearer to that of guinea and yet as mention abov the inhabit are not black nor shall our author ingeni observ concern the extrem of heat and cold purchas him impun with respect to the sallow complexion of the samoid lapland and greenland the finland and northern norwegian live in a climat not less cold than that of the peopl mention and yet are fair beyond other european i say more there are mani instanc of race of peopl preserv their origin color in climat veri differ from their own but not a singl instanc of the contrari so far as i can learn there have been four complet gener of negro in pensylvania without ani visibl chang of color they continu jet black as origin shaw in hi travel through barbari mention a peopl inhabit the mountain of auress border upon algier on the south who appear to be of a differ race from the moor their complexion far from swarthi is fair and ruddi and their hair a deep yellow instead of be dark as among the neighbor moor he conjectur them to be a remnant of the vandal perhap the tribe mention by procopiu in hi first book of the vandal war if the european complexion be proof against a hot climat for a thousand year i pronounc that it will never yield to climat in the suburb of cochin a town in malabar there is a coloni of industri jew of the the same complexion they have in europ they pretend that they were establish there dure the captiv of babylon it is unquestion that they have been mani age in that countri those who ascrib all to the sun ought to consid how littl probabl it is that the color it impress on the parent should be commun to their infant children who never saw the sun i should be as soon induc to believ with a german naturalist whose name ha escap me that the negro color is owe to an ancient custom in africa of die the skin black let a european for year expos himself to the sun in a hot climat till he be quit brown hi children will nevertheless have the same complexion with those in europ the hottentot are continu at work and have been for age to darken their complexion but that oper ha no effect on their children from the action of the sun is it possibl to explain whi a negro like a european is born with a ruddi skin which turn jet black the eighth or ninth day differ tribe are distinguish not less by intern disposit than by extern figur nation are for the most part so blend by war by commerc or by other mean that vain would be the attempt to trace out an origin charact in ani cultiv nation but there are savag tribe which so far as can be discov continu to thi day pure without mixtur who act by instinct not art who have not learn to disguis their passion to such i confin the inquiri there is no propens in human natur more gener than avers to stranger as will be made evid in a follow sketch book sketch and yet

island differ so wide from the rest of the world as to have no avers to stranger but on the contrari show great kind to the first they probabl ever saw is a singular phenomenon it is in vain here to talk of climat becaus in all climat we find an avers to stranger from the instanc given abov let us select two island or two cluster of island suppos for exampl bowman island inhabit by white and

male and femal birth in all countri and at all time they can not be account for from educ or exampl which inde may contribut to spread a certain fashion or certain manner but can not be their

presumpt of their be a differ race from the white and i onc thought that the presumpt wa support by inferior in their understand but it appear to me doubt upon second thought whether the inferior of their understand may not be occas by their condit a man never ripen in judgment nor in prudenc but by exercis these power at home the negro have littl occas to exercis either of them they live upon fruit and root which grow without cultur they need littl cloth and they erect hous without troubl or art abroad they are miser slave have no encourag either to think or to act who can say how far they

polic and in manner the negro particularli on the goldcoast are natur gay they are industri apprehend readili what is said to them have a good judgment are equit in their deal and accommod themselv readili to the manner of stranger i shall close the survey with some instanc that seem to differ wide from the common natur of man the giaga a fierc and wander nation in the heart of africa are in effect landpir at war with all the world they indulg in polygami but buri all their children the moment of birth and choos in their stead the most promis children taken in war there is no principl among anim more preval than affect to their offspr suppos the giaga to be born without hand or without feet would they be more distinguish from the rest of mankind i have often than onc doubt whether the author deserv credit from whom thi account is taken and after all i do not press it upon my reader there is onli one consider that can bring it within the verg of probabl viz the littl affect that male savag have for their newborn children which appear from the ancient practic of expos them the affect of the mother commenc with the birth of the child and had she a vote no infant would ever be destroy but as the affect of the father begin much later the practic of destroy newborn infant may be thought not altogeth incred in a wander nation who live by rapin and who can provid themselv with children more easili than by the tediou and precari method of rear them the author of an account of guiana mention a deadli poison compos by the nativ say i do not find that even in their war they ever use poison arrow and yet it may be wonder that a peopl live under no law actuat with no religi principl and unrestrain by the fear of present or futur punish should not sometim employ that fatal poison for gratifi hatr jealousi or reveng but in a state of natur though there are few restraint there are also fewer temptat to vice and the differ tribe are doubtless sensibl that poison arrow in war would upon the whole do more mischief than good thi writer it would seem ha forgot that prospect of futur good or evil never have influenc upon savag is it hi opinion that fear of futur mischief to themselv would make the negro of new guinea abstain from employ poison arrow against their enemi we have noth but origin disposit to account for manner so singular in the savag of guiana the japanes resent injuri in a manner which ha not a parallel in ani other part of the world it is inde so singular as scarc to be consist with human natur other wreak their resent on the person who affront them but an inhabit of japan wreak it on himself he rip up hi own belli kempfer report the follow instanc a gentleman come down the great stair of the emperor palac pass anoth go up and their

suffer wind to escap asham and confound she rais her breast to her mouth tore them with her teeth and expir on the spot the japanes are equal singular in some of their religi opinion they never supplic the god in distress hold that as the god enjoy uninterrupt bliss such supplic would be offens to them their holiday accordingli are dedic to feast wed and all public and privat rejoic it is delight to the god say they to see men happi they are far from be singular in think that a benevol deiti is pleas to see men happi but noth can be more inconsist with the common feel of men than to hold that in distress it is wrong to supplic the author of our natur for relief and that he will be displeas with such supplic in deep afflict there is certainli no balm equal to that of pour out the heart to a benevol deiti and express entir resign to hi will in support of the forego doctrin mani particular still more extraordinari might have been quot from greek and roman writer but truth ha no occas for artific and i would not take advantag of celebr name to vouch fact that appear incred or uncertain the greek and roman made an illustri figur in poetri rhetor and all the fine art but they were littl better than novic in natur histori more than half of the globe wa to them what the terra australi incognita is to us and imagin oper without control when it is not check by knowledg the ignor at the same time are delight with wonder and the more wonder a stori is the more welcom it is made thi may serv as an apolog for ancient writer even when they relat and believ fact to us incred men at that period were ignor in a great measur of natur and of the limit of her oper one concess will be made to me that the writer mention who report thing at secondhand are much more excus than the earliest of our modern travel who pretend to vouch endless wonder from their own knowledg natur histori that of man especi is of late year much ripen no improb tale is suffer to pass without a strict examin and i have been care to adopt no fact but what are vouch by late travel and writer of credit were it true what diodoru siculu report on the author of agatharchid of cnidu concern the lchthyophag on the east coast of afric it would be a more pregnant proof of a distinct race of men than ani i have discov they are describ to be so stupid that even when their wive and children are kill in their sight they stand insens and give no sign either of anger or of compass thi i can not believ upon so slight testimoni and the greek and roman were at that time extrem credul be less acquaint with neighbor nation than we are with the antipod the balear island majorca minorca yvica are at no great distanc from sicili and yet diodoru the sicilian report of the inhabit that at the solemn of marriag all the male friend and even the household servant lay with the bride befor the bridegroom wa admit credat judeu appella it would not be much more difficult to make me believ what is said by plini of the blemmyan that they had no head and that the mouth and eye were in the breast or of the arimaspi who had but one eye place in the middl of the forehead or of the astomi who have no mouth could neither eat nor drink but live upon smell or of a thousand other absurd which plini relat with a grave face in the th book of hi natur histori cap and in the th book cap thu upon an extens survey of the inhabit part of our globe mani nation are found differ so wide from each other not onli in complexion in featur in shape and in other extern circumst but in temper and disposit particularli in two capit articl courag and the treatment of stranger that even the certainti of there be differ race could not make one expect more strike differ doe m buffon think it suffici bare to say that such differ may possibl be the effect of climat or of other accident caus the presumpt is that the differ subsist at present have alway subsist which ought to be held as true till posit evid be brought of the contrari instead of which we are put off with bare supposit and possibl but not to rest entir upon presumpt evid to me it appear clear from the veri frame of the human bodi that there must be differ race of men fit for differ climat few anim are more affect than men gener are not onli with chang of season in the same climat but with chang of weather in the same season can such a be be fit for all climat equal imposs a man must at least be harden by natur against the slighter chang of season or weather he ought to be altogeth insens of such chang yet from sir john pringl observ on the diseas of the armi to go no further it appear that even militari men who ought of all to be the hardiest are greatli affect by them hors and horn cattl sleep on the bare ground wet or dri without harm and yet are not made for everi climat can a man be made for everi climat who is so much more delic that he can not sleep on wet ground without hazard of some mortal diseas but the argument i chiefli reli on is that were all men of one speci there never could have exist without a miracl differ kind such as exist at present give allow for everi suppos variat of climat or of
