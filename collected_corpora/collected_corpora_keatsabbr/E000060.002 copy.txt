reason as they destroy them they corrupt the purest moral thi wa the subject of plato complaint and we everi day see that they polish and refin the most barbar chap ii of the spirit of commerc peac is the natur effect of trade two nation who traffic with each other becom reciproc depend for if one ha an interest in buy the other ha an interest in sell and thu their union is found on their mutual necess but if the spirit of commerc unit nation it doe not in the same manner unit individu we see that in† countri where the peopl move onli by the spirit of commerc they make a traffic of all the human all the moral virtu the most trifl thing those which human would demand are there done or there given onli for money the spirit of trade produc in the mind of man a certain sens of exact justic opposit on the one hand to robberi and on the other to those moral virtu which forbid our alway adher rigidli to the rule of privat interest and suffer us to neglect thi for the advantag of other the

in republ it is commonli found on œconomi their merchant have an eye to all the nation of the earth bring from one what is want by anoth it is thu that the republ of tyre carthag athen marseil florenc venic and holland engag in commerc thi kind of traffic ha a natur relat to a republican govern to monarchi it is onli occasion for as it is found on the practic of gain littl and even less than other nation and of remedi thi by gain incessantli it can hardli be carri on by a peopl swallow up in luxuri who spend much and see noth but object of grandeur cicero wa of thi opinion when he so justli said that he did not like that the same peopl should be at onc both the lord and factor of the whole earth for thi would inde be to suppos that everi individu in the state and the whole state collect had their head constantli fill with grand view and at the same time with small one which is a contradict not but that the most nobl enterpris are compleat also in those state which subsist by œconom commerc they have even an intrepid not to be found in monarchi and the reason is thi one branch of commerc lead to anoth the small to the moder the moder to the great thu he who ha gratifi hi desir of gain a littl rais himself to a situat in which he is not less desir of gain a great deal besid the grand enterpris of merchant are alway necessarili connect with the affair of the public but in monarchi these public affair give as much distrust to the merchant as in free state they appear to give safeti great enterpris therefor in commerc are not for monarch but for republican govern in short an opinion of greater certainti as to the possess of properti in these state make them undertak everi thing they flatter themselv with the hope of receiv great advantag from the smile of fortun and think themselv sure of what they have alreadi acquir they boldli expos it in order to acquir more risk noth but as the mean of obtain i do not pretend to say that ani monarchi is entir exclud from an œconom commerc but of it own natur it ha less tendenc toward it neither do i mean that the republ with which we are acquaint are absolut depriv of the commerc of luxuri but it is less connect with their constitut with regard to a despot state there is no occas to mention it a gener rule a nation in slaveri labour more to preserv than to acquir a free nation more to acquir than to preserv chap v of nation that have enter into an œconom commerc marseil a necessari retreat in the midst of a tempestu sea marseil a harbour which all the wind the shelv of the sea the disposit of the coast point

that they should be just in order to live among barbar nation from whom they were to deriv their prosper that they should be moder to the end that they might alway tast the sweet of a tranquil govern in fine that they should be frugal in their manner to enabl them to subsist by trade a trade the more certain as it wa less advantag we everi where see violenc and oppress give birth to a commerc found on œconomi while men are constrain to take refug in marsh in isl in the shallow of the sea and even on rock themselv thu it wa that tyre venic and the citi of holland were found fugit found there a place of safeti it wa necessari that they should subsist they drew therefor their subsist from all part of the world chap vi some effect of an extens navig it sometim happen that a nation when engag in an œconom commerc have need of the merchand of one countri which serv as a capit or stock for procur the commod of anoth is satisfi with make veri littl profit and frequent none at all in trade with the former in expect of gain greatli by the latter thu when the dutch were almost the onli nation that carri on the trade from the south to the north of europ the french wine which they import to the north were in some measur onli a capit or stock for conduct their commerc in that part of the world it is a known fact that there are some kind of merchand in holland which though import from afar sell for veri littl more than they cost upon the spot they account for it thu a captain who ha occas to ballast hi ship will load it with marbl if he want wood for stowag he will buy it and provid he lose noth by the bargain he will think himself a gainer thu it is that holland ha it quarri and it forest further it may happen so that not onli a commerc which bring in noth shall be use but even a lose trade shall be benefici i have heard it affirm in holland that the whalefisheri in gener doe not answer the expenc but it must be observ that the person employ in build the ship as also those who furnish the rig and provis are jointli concern in the fisheri should they happen to lose in the voyag they have had a profit in fit out the vessel thi commerc in short is a kind of lotteri and everi one is allur with the hope of a prize mankind are gener fond of game and even the most prudent have no avers to it when the disagre circumst attend it such as dissip anxieti passion loss of time and even of life and fortun are conceal from their view chap vii the spirit of england with respect to commerc the tariff or custom of england are veri unsettl with respect to other

respect to trade they bind themselv but littl by treati and depend onli on their own law other nation have made the interest of commerc yield to those of polit the english on the contrari have ever made their polit interest give way to those of commerc they know better than ani other peopl upon earth how to valu at the same time these three great advantag religion commerc and liberti chap viii in what manner the œconom commerc ha been sometim restrain in sever kingdom law have been made extrem proper to humbl the state that have enter into the œconom commerc they have forbid their import ani merchandis except the product of their respect countri and have permit them to traffic onli in vessel built in the kingdom to which they brought their commod it is necessari that the kingdom which impos these law should itself be abl easili to engag in commerc otherwis it will at least be an equal suffer it is much more advantag to trade with a commerci nation whose profit are moder and who are render in some sort depend by the affair of commerc with a nation whose larger view and whose extend trade enabl them to dispos of their superflu merchandis with a wealthi nation who can take off mani of their commod and make them a quicker return in speci with a nation under a kind of necess to be faith pacif from principl and that seek to gain and not to conquer it is much better i say to trade with such a nation than with other their constant rival who will never grant such great advantag chap ix of the prohibit of commerc it is a true maxim that one nation should never exclud anoth from trade with it except for veri great reason the japanes trade onli with two nation the chines and the dutch the chines gain a thousand per cent upon sugar and sometim as much by the good they take in exchang the dutch make nearli the same profit everi nation that act upon japanes principl must necessarili be deceiv for it is competit which set a just valu on merchandis and establish the relat between them much less ought a state to lay itself under an oblig of sell it manufactur onli to a singl nation under a pretenc of their take all at a certain price the pole in thi manner dispos of their corn to the citi of dantzic and sever indian princ have made a like contract for their spice with the dutch† these argreement are proper onli for a poor nation whose inhabit are satisfi to forego the hope of enrich themselv provid they can be secur of a certain subsist or for nation whose slaveri consist either in renounc the use of those thing which natur ha given them or in be oblig to submit to a disadvantag commerc chap x an institut adapt to œconom commerc in state that carri on an œconom commerc they have luckili establish bank which by their credit have form a new speci of wealth but it would be quit wrong to introduc them into govern whose commerc is found onli in luxuri the erect of bank in countri govern by an absolut monarch suppos money on the one side and on the other power that is on the one hand the mean of procur everi thing without ani power and on the other the power without ani mean of procur at all in a govern of thi kind none but the princ ever had or can have a treasur and wherev there is one it no sooner becom great than it becom the treasur of the princ for the same reason all associ of merchant in order to carri on a particular commerc are seldom proper in absolut govern the design of these compani is to give to the wealth of privat person the weight of public rich but in those govern thi weight can be found onli in the princ nay they are not even alway proper in state engag in œconom commerc for if the trade be not so great as to surpass the manag of particular person it is much better to leav it open than by exclus privileg to restrain the liberti of commerc chap xi the same subject continu a free port may be establish in the dominion of state whose commerc is œconom that œconomi in the govern which alway attend the frugal of individu is if i may so express myself the soul of it œconom commerc the loss it sustain with respect to custom it can repair by draw from the wealth and industri of the republ but in a monarchi a step of thi kind must be opposit to reason for it could have no other effect than to eas luxuri of the weight of tax thi would be depriv itself of the onli advantag that luxuri can procur and of the onli curb which in a constitut like thi it is capabl of receiv chap xii of the freedom of commerc the freedom of commerc is not a power grant to the merchant to do what they pleas thi would be more properli it slaveri the constraint of the merchant is not the constraint of commerc it is in the freest countri that the merchant find innumer obstacl and he is never less cross by law than in a countri of slave england prohibit the export of her wool coal must be brought by sea to the capit no hors except geld are allow to be export and the vessel of her coloni trade to europ must take in water in england the english constrain the merchant but it is in favour of commerc chap xiii what it is that destroy thi liberti wherev commerc subsist custom are establish commerc is the export and import of merchandis with a view to the advantag of the state custom are a certain right over thi same export and import found also on the advantag of the state from henc it becom necessari that the state should be neuter between it custom and it commerc that neither of these two interfer with each other and then the inhabit enjoy a free commerc the farm of the custom destroy commerc by it injustic and vexat as well as by the excess of the impost but independ of thi it destroy it even more by the difficulti that aris from it and by the formal it exact in england where the custom are manag by the king offic busi is negoti with a singular dexter one word of write accomplish the greatest affair the merchant need not lose an infinit deal of time he ha no occas for a particular commission either to obviat all the difficulti of the farmer or to submit to them chap xiv the law of commerc concern the confisc of merchandis the magna charta of england forbid the seiz and confisc in case of war the effect of foreign merchant except by way of repris it is an honour to the english nation they have made thi one of the articl of their liberti in the late war between spain and england the former made a law which punish with death those who brought english merchandis into the dominion of spain and the same penalti on those who carri spanish merchandis into england an ordin like thi can not i believ find a preced in ani law but those of japan it equal shock human the spirit of commerc and the harmoni which ought to subsist in the proport of penalti it confound all our idea make that a crime against the state which is onli a violat of civil politi chap xv of seiz the person of merchant solon †made a law that the athenian should no longer seiz the bodi for civil debt thi law he‡ receiv from egypt it had been made by boccori and renew by sesostri thi law is extrem good with respect to the gener of civil §affair but there is suffici reason for it not be observ in those of commerc for as merchant are oblig to entrust larg sum frequent for a veri short time and to pay money as well as to receiv it there is a necess that the debtor should constantli fulfil hi engag at the time prefix and henc it becom necessari to lay a constraint on hi person in affair relat to common civil contract the law ought not to permit the seizur of the person becaus the liberti of one citizen is of greater import to the public than the eas or prosper of anoth but in convent deriv from commerc the law ought to consid the public prosper as of greater import than the liberti of a citizen which howev doe not hinder the restrict and limit that human and good polici demand chap xvi an excel law admir is that law of geneva which exclud from the magistraci and even from the admitt into the great council the children of those who have live or die insolv except they have discharg their father debt it ha thi effect it give a confid in the merchant in the magistr and in the citi itself there the credit of the individu ha still all the weight of public credit chap xvii a law of rhode the inhabit of rhode went further sextu empiricu observ that among those peopl a son could not be excus from pay hi father debt by renounc the success thi law of rhode wa calcul for a republ found on commerc now i am inclin to think that reason drawn from commerc itself should make thi limit that the debt contract by the father sinc the son enter into commerc should not affect the estat or properti acquir by the latter a merchant ought alway to know hi oblig and to squar hi conduct by hi circumst and present fortun chap xviii of the judg of commerc xenophon in hi book of revenu would have reward given to those overs of commerc who dispatch the caus brought befor them

chap xxi of the commerc of the nobil in a monarchi in a monarch govern it is contrari to the spirit of commerc that ani of the nobil should be merchant thi said the emperor honoriu and theodosiu would be pernici to citi and would remov the facil of buy and sell between the merchant and the plebeian it is contrari to the spirit of monarchi to admit the nobil into commerc the custom of suffer the nobil of england to trade is one of those thing which ha there mostli contribut to weaken the monarch govern chap xxii a singular reflect person struck with the practic of some state imagin that in franc they ought to make law to engag the nobil to enter into commerc but these law would be the mean of destroy the nobil without be of ani advantag to trade the practic of thi countri is extrem wise merchant are not nobl though they may becom so they have the hope of obtain a degre of nobil unattend with it actual inconveni there is no surer way of be advanc abov their profess than to manag it well or with success the consequ of which is gener an affluent fortun law which oblig everi one to continu in hi profess and to devolv it to hi children neither are nor can be of use in ani but despot kingdom where no bodi either can or ought to have emul let none say that everi one will succeed better in hi profess when he can not chang it for anoth i say that a person will succeed best when those

when they have not obtain the latter enjoy the consol of have acquir glori all these thing togeth have necessarili contribut to augment the grandeur of thi kingdom and if for two or three centuri it ha been incessantli increas in power thi must be attribut not to fortun who wa never fame for constanc but to the good of it law chap xxiii to what nation commerc is prejudici rich consist either in land or in moveabl effect the soil of everi countri is commonli possess by the nativ the law of most state render foreign unwil to purchas their land and noth but the presenc of the owner improv them thi kind of rich therefor belong to everi state in particular but moveabl effect as money note bill of exchang stock in compani vessel and in fine all merchandis belong to the whole world in gener in thi respect it is compos of but one singl state of which all the societi upon earth are member the peopl who possess more of these moveabl effect than ani other on the globe are the most opul some state have an immens quantiti acquir by their commod by the labour of their mechan by their industri by their discoveri and even by chanc the avaric of nation make them quarrel for the moveabl of the whole univers if we could find a state so unhappi as to be depriv of the effect of other countri and at the same time of almost all it own the proprietor of the land would be onli planter to foreign thi state want all could acquir noth therefor it would be much better for the inhabit not to have the least commerc with ani nation upon earth for commerc in these circumst must necessarili lead them to poverti a countri that constantli export fewer manufactur or commod than it receiv will soon find the balanc sink it will receiv less and less until fall into extrem poverti it will receiv noth at all in trade countri the speci which suddenli vanish quickli return becaus those nation that have receiv it are it debtor but it never return into those state of which we have just been speak becaus those who have receiv it owe them noth poland will serv us for an exampl it ha scarc ani of those thing which we call the moveabl effect of the univers except corn the produc of it land some of the lord possess entir provinc they oppress the husbandmen in order to have greater quantiti of corn which they send to stranger to procur the superflu demand of luxuri if poland had no foreign trade it inhabit would be more happi the grande who would have onli their corn would give it to their peasant for subsist as their too extens estat would becom burthensom they would divid them amongst their peasant everi one would find skin or wool in their herd or flock so that they would no longer be at an immens expenc in provid cloath the great who are ever fond of luxuri not be abl to find it but in their own countri would encourag the labour of the poor thi nation i affirm would then becom more flourish at least if it did not becom barbar and thi the law might easili prevent let us next consid japan the vast quantiti of what they receiv is the caus of the vast quantiti of merchandis they send abroad thing are thu in as nice an equilibrium as if the import and export were but small besid thi kind of exuber in the state is product of a thousand advantag there is a greater consumpt a greater quantiti of those thing on which the art are exercis more men employ and more numer mean of acquir power exig may also happen that requir a speedi assist which so opul a state can better afford than ani other it is difficult for a countri to avoid have superflu but it is the natur of commerc to render the superflu use and the use necessari the state will be therefor abl to afford necessari to a much greater number of subject let us say then that it is not those nation who have need of noth that must lose by trade it is those who have need of everi thing it is not such peopl as have a suffici within themselv but those who are most in want that will find an advantag in put a stop to all commerci intercours book xxi of law rel to commerc consid in the revolut it ha met with in the world chap i some gener consider though commerc be subject to great revolut yet it is possibl that certain physic caus as the qualiti of the soil or the climat may fix it natur for ever we at present carri on the trade of the indi mere by mean of the silver which we send thither the roman carri annual thither about fifti million of sesterc and thi silver as our is at present wa exchang for merchandis which were brought to the west everi nation that ever trade to the indi ha constantli carri

neither demand nor permit hardli ani thing which come from us they go in a great measur nake such cloath as they have the countri itself furnish and their religion which is deepli root give them an avers for those thing that serv for our nourish they want therefor noth but our bullion to serv as the medium of valu and for thi they give us merchandis in return with which the frugal of the peopl and the natur of the countri furnish them in great abund those ancient author who have mention the indi describ them just as we now find them as to their polici custom and manner the indi have ever been the same indi they are at present and in everi period of time those who trade to that countri must carri speci thither and brought none in return chap ii of the peopl of africa the greatest part of the peopl on the coast of africa are savag and barbarian the princip reason i believ of thi is becaus the small countri capabl of be inhabit are separ from each other by larg and almost uninhabit tract of land they are without industri or art they have gold in abund which they receiv immedi from the hand of natur everi civil state is therefor in a condit to traffic with them to advantag by rais their esteem for thing of no valu and receiv a veri high price in return chap iii that the want of the peopl in the south are differ from those of the north in europ there is a kind of balanc between the southern and northern nation the first have everi conveni of life and few of it want the last have mani want and few conveni to one natur ha given much and demand but littl to the other she ha given but littl and demand a great deal the equilibrium is maintain by the lazi of the southern nation and by the industri and activ which she ha given to those in the north the latter are oblig to undergo excess labour without which they would want everi thing and degener into barbarian thi ha natur slaveri to the peopl of the south as they can easili dispens with rich they can more easili dispens with liberti but the peopl of the north have need of liberti for thi can best procur them the mean of satisfi all those want which they have receiv from natur the peopl of the north then are in a forc state if they are not either free or barbarian almost all the peopl of the south are in some measur in a state of violenc if they are not slave chap iv the princip differ between the commerc of the ancient and the modern the world ha found itself from time to time in differ situat by which the face of commerc ha been alter the trade of europ is at present carri on princip from

which the greatest part of the world had of those who were far distant from them favour the nation engag in the œconom commerc they manag trade with as much obscur as they pleas they had all the advantag which the most intellig nation could take over the most ignor the egyptian a peopl who by their religion and their manner were avers to all commun with stranger had scarc at that time ani foreign trade they enjoy a fruit soil and great plenti their countri wa the japan of those time it possess everi thing within itself so littl jealou were those peopl of commerc that they left that of the red sea to all the petti nation that had ani harbour in it here they suffer the idumean the syrian and the jew to have fleet solomon† employ in thi navig the tyrian who knew those sea josephus‡ say that hi nation be entir employ in agricultur knew littl of navig the jew therefor trade onli occasion in the red sea they took from the idumean eloth and eziongeb from whom they receiv thi commerc they lost these two citi and with them lost thi commerc it wa not so with the phœnician their wa not a commerc of luxuri nor wa their trade owe to conquest their frugal their abil their industri their peril and the hardship they suffer render them necessari to all the nation of the world befor alexand the peopl border on the red sea trade onli in thi sea and in that of africa the astonish which fill the globe at the discoveri of the indian sea under that conqueror is of thi a suffici proof i have observ that bullion wa alway carri to the indi and never ani brought from thenc now the jewish fleet which brought gold and silver by the way of the red sea return from africa and not from the indies‡ besid thi navig wa made on the eastern coast of africa for the state of navig at that time is a convinc proof that they did not sail to a veri distant shore i am not ignor that the fleet of solomon and jehosaphat return onli everi three year but i do not see that the time taken up in the voyag is ani proof of the great of the distanc plini and strabo inform us that the junk of india and the red sea were twenti day in perform a voyag which a greek or roman vessel would accomplish† in seven in thi proport a voyag of one year made by the fleet of greec or rome would take veri near three when perform by those of solomon two ship of unequ swift do not perform their voyag in a time proportion to their swift slow is frequent the caus of much greater slow when it becom necessari to follow the coast and to be incessantli in a differ posit when they must wait for a fair wind to get out of a gulph and for anoth to proceed a good sailor take the advantag of everi favour moment while the other still continu in a difficult situat and wait mani day for anoth chang thi slow of the indian vessel which in an equal time could make but one third of the way of those of the greek and roman may be explain by what we everi day see in our modern navig the indian vessel which were built with a kind of searush drew less water than those of greec and rome which were of wood and join with iron we may compar these indian vessel to those at present made use of in port of littl depth of water such are those of venic and even of all itali in gener of the baltic and of the provinc of †holland their ship which ought to be abl to go in and out of port are built round and broad at the bottom while those of other nation who have good harbour are form to sink deep into the water thi mechan render these last mention vessel abl to sail much nearer to the wind while the first can hardli sail except the wind be nearli in the poop a ship that sink deep into the water sail toward the same side with almost everi wind thi proce from the resist which the vessel whilst driven by the wind meet with from the water from which it receiv a strong support and from the length of the vessel which present it side to the wind while from the form of the helm the prow is turn to the point propos so that she can sail veri near to the wind or in other word veri near the point from whenc the wind blow but when the hull is round and broad at the bottom and consequ draw littl water it no longer find thi steadi support the wind drive the vessel which is incap of resist and can run then but with a small variat from the point opposit to the wind from whenc it follow that broadbottom vessel are longer in perform voyag they lose much time in wait for the wind especi if they are oblig frequent to chang their cours they sail much slower becaus not have a proper support from a depth of water they can not carri so much sail if thi be the case at a time when the art are everi where known at a time when art correct the defect of natur and even of art itself if at thi time i say we find thi differ how great must that have been in the navig of the antient i can not yet leav thi subject the indian vessel were small and those of the greek and roman if we except their machin built for ostent much less than our now the smaller the vessel the greater the danger it encount from foul weather a tempest that would swallow up a small vessel would onli make a larg one roll the more one bodi is surpass by anoth in big the more it surfac is rel small from whenc it follow that in a small ship there is a less proport that is a greater differ as to the surfac of the vessel and the weight or lade she can carri than in a larg one we know that it is a pretti gener practic to make the weight of the lade equal to that of half the water the vessel is abl to contain suppos a vessel will contain eight hundr ton her lade then must be four hundr and that of a vessel which would hold but four hundr ton of water would be two hundr ton thu the larg of the first ship will be to the weight she carri as to and that of the second as to let us suppos then that the surfac of the greater is to the surfac of the smaller as to the surfac of thi will be to her weight as to while the surfac of the former will be to her weight onli as to therefor as the wind and wave act onli upon the surfac the larg vessel will by her weight resist their impetuos much more than the small chap vii of the commerc of the greek the first greek were all pirat mino who enjoy the empir of the sea wa onli more success perhap than other in piraci for hi maritim dominion extend no farther than round hi own isl but when the greek becam a great peopl the athenian obtain the real dominion of the sea becaus thi trade and victori nation gave law to the most potent monarch of that time and humbl the maritim power of syria of the isl of cypru and phœnicia but thi athenian lordship of the sea deserv to be more particularli mention athen say xenophon† rule the sea but as the countri of attica is join to the contin it is ravag by enemi while the athenian are engag in distant expedit their leader suffer their land to be destroy and secur their wealth by send it to some island the populac who are not possess of land have no uneasi but if the athenian inhabit an island and besid thi enjoy the empir of the sea they would so long as they were possess of these advantag be abl to annoy other and at the same time to be out of all danger of be annoy one would imagin that xenophon wa speak of england the athenian a peopl whose head were fill with ambiti project the athenian who augment their jealousi instead of increas their influenc who were more attent to extend their maritim empir than to enjoy it whose polit govern wa such that the common peopl distribut the public revenu amongst themselv while the rich were in a state of oppress the athenian i say did not carri on so extens a commerc as might be expect from the produc of their mine from the multitud of their slave from the number of their seamen

them a veri wealthi nation on corinth† he bestow the epithet of rich in like manner when he speak of citi that have plenti of gold he mention orchomenu to which he join thebe in egypt rhode and corinth preserv their power but orchomenu lost her the situat of orchomenu in the neighbourhood of the hellespont the proponti and the euxin sea make us natur imagin that she wa indebt for her opul to a trade along that maritim coast which had given rise to the fabl of the golden fleec and inde the name of minyeio ha been given to orchomenus‡ as well as to the argonaut but these sea becom afterward more frequent the greek plant along the coast a greater number of coloni which trade with the barbar nation and at the same time preserv an intercours with their mother countri in consequ of thi orchomenu began to declin till at length it wa lost in the croud of the other citi of greec befor homer time the greek had scarc ani trade but among themselv and with a few barbar nation in proport

of egypt that likewis of the indi and the discoveri of the sea which lie south of that countri the empir of persia extend to the indu dariu long befor alexand had sent† some vessel which sail down thi river and pass even into the red sea how then were the greek the first who trade to the indi by the south had not the persian done thi befor did they make no advantag of sea which were so near them of the veri sea that wash their coast alexand it is true conquer the indi but wa it necessari for him to conquer a countri in order to trade with it thi is what i shall now examin ariana which extend

uncultiv tradition† relat that the armi of semirami and cyru perish in these desart and alexand who caus hi fleet to follow him could not avoid lose in thi place a great part of hi armi the persian left the whole coast to the ichthyophagi‡ the oritæ and other barbar nation besid the persian were no§ great sailor and their veri religion debar them from entertain ani such notion as that of a maritim commerc the voyag undertaken by dariuss direct upon the indu and the indian sea proceed rather from the caprici of a princ vainli ambiti of shew hi power than from ani settl regular project it wa attend with no consequ either to the advantag of commerc or of navig they emerg from their ignor onli to plung into it again besid it wa a receiv opinion befor the expedit of alexand that the southern part of india were uninhabitable† thi proceed from a tradit that‡ semirami had brought back from thenc onli twenti men and cyru but seven alexand enter by the north hi design wa to march toward the east but have found a part of the south full of great nation citi and river he attempt to conquer it and succeed he then form the design of unit the indi to the western nation by a maritim commerc as he had alreadi unit them by the coloni he had establish by land he order a fleet to be built on the hydasp then fell down that river enter the indu and sail even to it mouth he left hi armi and hi fleet at patala went himself with a few vessel to view the sea and mark the place where he would have port to be open and arsen erect upon hi return from patala he separ the fleet and took the rout by land for the mutual support of fleet and armi the fleet follow the coast from the indu along the bank of the countri of the oritæ of the ichthyophagi of carmania and persia he caus well to be dug built citi and would not suffer the ichthyophagi§ to live on fish be desir of have the border of the sea inhabit by civil nation nearchu and onesecritu wrote a journal of thi voyag which wa perform in ten month they arriv at susa where they found alexand who gave an entertain to hi whole armi thi princ had found alexandria with a view of secur hi conquest of egypt thi wa a key to open it in the veri place where the king hi predecessor had a key to shut it and he had not the least thought of a commerc of which the discoveri of the indian sea could alon give him the idea it even seem that after thi discoveri he had no new design in regard to alexandria he had inde a gener scheme of open a trade between the east indi and the western part of hi empir but as for the project of conduct thi commerc through egypt hi knowledg wa too imperfect to be abl to form ani such design it is true he had seen the indu he had seen the nile but he knew noth of the arabian sea between the two river scarc wa he return from india when he fit out new fleet and navig on the euleus† the tigri the euphrat and the ocean he remov the cataract with which the persian had encumb those river and he discov that the persian gulph wa a branch of the main sea but as he went to view thi sea‡ in the same manner as he had done in regard to that of india as he caus a port to be open for a thousand ship and arsen to be erect at babylon as he sent five hundr talent into phœnicia and syria to draw marin into thi servic whom he intend to distribut in the coloni along the coast in fine as he caus immens work to be erect on the euphrat and the other river of assyria there could be no doubt but he design to carri on the commerc of india by the way of babylon and the persic gulph there are some who pretend that alexand want to subdu arabia and had form a design to make it the seat of hi empir but how could he have pitch upon a place with which he wa entir unacquainted† besid of all countri thi would have been the most inconveni to him for it would have separ him from the rest of hi empir the caliph who made distant conquest soon withdrew from arabia to resid elsewher chap ix of the commerc of the grecian king after the death of alexand at the time when alexand made the conquest of egypt they had but a veri imperfect idea of the red sea and none at all of the ocean which join to thi sea on one side wash the coast of africa and on the other that of arabia nay they thought it imposs to sail round the peninsula of arabia they who attempt it on each side had relinquish their design how is it possibl said they‡ to navig to the southern coast of arabia when cambysess armi which travers it on the north side almost entir perish and the forc which ptolemi the son of lagu sent to the assist of seleucu nicat at babylon underw incred hardship and upon account of the heat could march onli in the night the persian were entirestrang to navig when they had subdu egypt they introduc the same spirit into that countri as prevail in persia henc so great wa the supin of the persian in thi respect that the grecian king found them quit stranger not onli to the commerc of the tyrian idumean and the jew on the ocean but even to the navig of the red sea i am apt to think that the destruct of the first tyre by nebuchadnezzar togeth with the subvers of sever petti nation and town border on the red sea had obliter all their former knowledg of commerc egypt at the time of the persian monarchi did not front the red sea it contain onli that long narrow neck of land which the nile cover with it inund and is enclos on both side by a chain of mountain they were therefor under the necess of make a second discoveri of the ocean and the red sea and thi discoveri engag the curios of the grecian monarch they ascend the nile and hunt after eleph in the countri situat between that river and the sea by thi progress they trace the seacoast and as the discoveri were made by the greek the name are all grecian and the templ are consecr to† greek divin the greek settl in egypt were abl to command a most extens commerc they were master of all the harbour on the red sea tyre the rival of everi trade nation wa no more they were not constrain by the ancient superstit of the countri in short egypt wa becom the centr of the world the king of syria left the commerc of the south to those of egypt and attach themselv onli to the northern trade which wa carri on by mean of the oxu and the caspian sea they then imagin that thi sea wa part of the† northern ocean and alexand some time befor hi death had fit out a fleet‡ in order to discov whether it commun with the ocean by the euxin sea or on some other eastern sea toward india after him seleucu and antiochu appli themselv to make discoveri in it with a particular attent and with thi view they scour it with their fleets§ that part which seleucu survey wa call the seleucidian sea that which antiochu discov receiv the name of the sea of antiochu attent to the project they might have form on that side they neglect the sea on the south whether it wa that the ptolemi by mean of their fleet on the red sea were alreadi becom the master of it or that they discov an invinc avers in the persian against engag in maritim affair the southern coast of persia suppli them with no seamen there had been none in those part except toward the latter end of alexand reign but the egyptian king be master of the isl of cypru of phœnicia and of a great number of town on the coast of asia minor were possess of all sort of conveni for undertak maritim expedit they had no occas to forc they had onli to follow the geniu and bent of their subject i am surpriz i confess at the obstinaci with which the ancient believ that the caspian sea wa a part of the ocean the expedit of alexand of the king of syria of the parthian and the roman could not make them chang their sentiment notwithstand these nation describ the caspian sea with a wonder exact but men are gener tenaci of their error when onli the south of thi sea wa known it wa at first taken for the ocean in proport as they advanc along the bank of the northern coast instead of imagin it a great lake they still believ it to be the ocean that here made a sort of a bay survey the coast their discoveri never went eastward beyond the jaxart nor westward further than the extrem of albania the sea toward the north wa shallow and of cours veri unfit for navig henc it wa that they alway look upon thi as the ocean the land armi of alexand had been on the east onli as far as the hypani which is the last of those river that fall into the indu thu the first trade which the greek carri on to the indi wa confin to a veri small part of the countri seleucu nicat penetr as far as the ganges† and there by discov the sea into which thi river fall that is to say the bay of bengal the modern discov countri by voyag at sea the ancient discov sea by conquest at land strabo‡ notwithstand the testimoni of apollodoru seem to doubt whether the grecian kings§ of bactria proceed farther than seleucu and alexand were it even true that they went no further to the east than seleucu yet they went farther toward the south they discov siger and the port on the coast of malabar which gave rise to the navig i am go to mention pliny† inform us that the navig of the indi wa success carri on by three differ way at first they sail from the cape of siagr to the island of patalena which is at the mouth of the indu thi we find wa the cours that alexand fleet steer to the indi they took afterwards‡ a shorter and more certain cours by sail from the same cape or promontori to siger thi can be no other but the kingdom of siger mention by strabo§ and discov by the grecian king of bactria plini by say that thi way wa shorter than the other can mean onli that the voyag wa made in less time for as siger wa discov by the king of bactria it must have been farther than the indu by thi passag they must therefor have avoid the wind of certain coast and taken advantag of particular wind the merchant at last took a third way they sail to cane or oce port situat at the entranc of the red sea from whenc by a west wind they arriv at muziri the first stapl town of the indi and from thenc to the other port here we see that instead of sail to the mouth of the red sea as far as siagr by coast arabia felix to the northeast they steer directli from west to east from one side to the other by mean of the monsoon whose regular cours they discov by sail in these latitud the ancient never lost sight of the coast but when they took advantag of these and the trade wind which were to them a kind of compass pliny† say that they set sail for the indi in the middl of summer and return toward the end of decemb or in the begin of januari thi is entir conform to our naval journal in that part of the indian sea which is between the peninsula of africa and that on thi side the gang there are two monsoon the first dure which the wind blow from west to east begin in the month of august or septemb and the second dure which the wind is in the east begin in januari thu we set sail from africa for malabar at the season of the year that ptolemi fleet use to put to sea from thenc and we return too at the same time as they alexand fleet wa seven month in sail from patala to susa it set out in the month of juli that is at a season when no ship dare now put to sea to return from the indi between these two monsoon there is an interv of time dure which the wind vari when a north wind meet with the common wind rais especi near the coast the most terribl tempest these continu dure the month of june juli and august alexand fleet therefor set sail from patala in the month of juli must have been expos to mani storm and the voyag must have been long becaus they sail against the monsoon plini say that they set out for the indi at the end of summer thu they spent the time proper for take advantag of the monsoon in their passag from alexandria to the red sea observ here i pray how navig ha by littl and littl arriv at perfect dariuss fleet wa two year and an half in fall down the indu and go to the red sea afterward the fleet of alexander† descend the indu arriv at susa in ten month have sail three month on the indu and seven on the indian sea at last the passag from the coast of malabar to the red sea wa made in forti days‡ strabo§ who account for their ignor of the countri between the hypani and the gang say there were veri few of those who sail from egypt to the indi that ever proceed so far as the gang their fleet in fact never went thither they sail with the western monsoon from the mouth of the red sea to the coast of malabar they cast anchor in port along that coast and never attempt to get round the peninsula on thi side the gang by cape comorin and the coast of coromandel the plan of navig laid down by the king of egypt and the roman wa to set out and return the same year∥ thu it is demonstr that the commerc of the greek and roman to the indi wa much less extens than our we know immens countri which to them were entir unknown we traffic with all the indian nation we even manag their trade and in our bottom carri on their commerc but thi commerc of the ancient wa carri on with far greater facil than our and if the modern were to trade onli to the coast of guzarat and malabar and without seek for the southern isl were satisfi with what these island brought them they would certainli prefer the way of egypt to that of the cape of goodhop strabo inform us that they trade thu with the peopl of taproban chap x of the circuit of africa we find from histori that befor the discoveri of the marin compass four attempt were made to sail round the coast of africa the phœnician sent by necho and eudoxus† fli from the wrath of ptolomi lathyru set out from the red sea and succeed sataspes‡ sent by xerx and hanno by the carthaginian set out from the pillar of hercul and fail in the attempt the capit point in surround africa wa to discov and doubl the cape of goodhop those who set out from the red sea found thi cape nearer by half than it would have been in set out from the mediterranean the shore from the red sea is not so shallow as that from the cape§ to herculess pillar the discoveri of the cape by herculess pillar wa owe to the invent of the compass which permit them to leav the coast of africa and to launch∥ out into the vast ocean in order to sail toward the island of st helena or toward the coast of brasil it wa therefor veri possibl for them to sail from the red sea into the mediterranean but not to set out from the mediterranean to return by the red sea thu without make thi grand circuit after which they could hardli ever hope to return it wa most natur to trade to the east of africa by the red sea and to the western coast by herculess pillar the grecian king of egypt discov at first in the red sea that part of the coast of africa which extend from the bottom of the gulph where stand the town of heroum as far as dira that is to the streight now known by the name of babelmandel from thenc to the promontori of aromatia situat at the entranc of the red sea the coast had never been survey by navig and thi is evid from what artemidoru tell us† that they were acquaint with the place on that coast but knew not their distanc the reason of which is they success gain a knowledg of those port by land without sail from one to the other beyond thi promontori at which the coast along the ocean commenc they knew noth as we learn‡ from eratosthen and artemidoru such wa the knowledg they had of the coast of africa in strabo time that is in the reign of augustu but after that princ deceas the roman found out the two cape raptum and passum of which strabo make no mention becaus they had not been as yet discov it is plain that both those name are of roman origin ptolemi the geograph flourish under adrian and antoninu piu and the author of the periplu of the red sea whoever he wa live a littl after yet the former limit known africa to cape prassum which is in about the th degre of south latitud while the author of the periplus† confin it to cape raptum which is nearli in the th degre of the same latitud in all likelihood the latter took hi limit from a place then frequent and ptolemi hi from a place with which there wa no longer ani commun what confirm me in thi notion is that the peopl about cape prassum were anthropophagi‡ ptolemi take notice§ of a great number of place between the port or emporium aromatum and cape raptum but leav an entir blank between the cape raptum and prassum the great profit of the eastindia trade must have occas a neglect of that of africa in fine the roman never had ani settl navig they had discov these sever port by land expedit and by mean of ship driven on that coast and as at present we are well acquaint with the maritim part of africa but know veri littl of the inland country∥ the ancient on the contrari had a veri good knowledg of the inland part but were almost stranger to the coast i said that the phœnician sent by necho and eudoxu under ptolemi lathryu had made the circuit of africa but at the time of ptolemi the geograph those two voyag must have been look upon as fabul sinc he place after the sinu magnu which i apprehend to be the
