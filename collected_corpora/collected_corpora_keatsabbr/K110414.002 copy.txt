of an amus of thi kind that i sigh at the melancholi reflect how distant we are at present and recollect with redoubl anguish how delight were the sensat of that pleas era of my life to those which

the day with him at dover there is inde a certain mixtur of sweet and vivac blend both in hi counten and manner that render hi convers uncommonli pleas i wa much charm to perceiv that the denouement of the piec which though defect i think in point of delicaci is exceedingli affect brought a tear of feel into hi eye there is inde someth so amiabl in ani unaffect symptom of soft and sensibl in a manli counten and it form a contrast so attract from that rough and auster which is in gener seat upon their face that in my opinion it is the most insinu of all prepossess and as it give you in a manner an insight into the mind render the figur itself infinit more interest i suppos it wa owe to thi observ that mr roatsley never struck me with be so incompar handsom as he did thi even had i even enjoy less pleasur at the represent of a piec which i have so often read with repeat satisfact i should have been suffici amus and delight from observ the effect it produc on my dear fanni who wa

unexpectedli met with an old friend for such in thi part of the world we should deem almost ani person whom we had known in our own countri and as such we cordial welcom our live acquaint mr weldon who arriv in town onli the even befor last fortun she had taken lodg in the next street and perceiv us in mr hindon carriag pass her window in our way to church she made her footman watch our return with a messag inform us of her abod and request that we would take immedi advantag of the inform delight with thi intellig so unexpect too as mr weldon when at the chateau had not onc drop ani hint of an intent to revisit england we request mr hindon to set us down at her hous she gave us the kindest recept possibl and on our part we felt as if we had met one in whom we were warmli interest and who wa nearli connect with us she inform us that busi rel to a legaci late bequeath her had oblig her to come over at a sudden call and that she had left our much respect friend in good health how strang do circumst appar the most trifl alter our opinion and prepossess thi mr weldon whom i thought at best but an agreeabl coquet and whose friendship i had in languedoc no sort of desir to cultiv now scarc appear to me the person she wa except in her power of pleas which are if possibl augment the chang is not howev entir owe to the partial with which i could not but regard an acquaint form under the roof of our worthi friend the alter is in herself and i now perceiv how illiber and injudici are often the sentiment and impress inspir by an imperfect knowledg mr weldon in her own hous and in privat possess not mere the gaieti which amus but that good sens and knowledg of the world which must charm and improv all who are admit to an intimaci with her these good qualiti are blend with a flow of spirit uncommonli elev which diffus a vivac over her manner and appear that on a superfici acquaint may be mistaken for leviti but which on a nearer view i find prove mere the natur result of a sprightli turn of mind ad to an earli introduct into life circumst that in gener ariv defianc to bash at least to that pain degre of it that accompani awkward she wa so kind as to insist on our remain with her the whole day and at her earnest request an apolog wa dispatch to mr hindon inde i have not spent one so entir to my satisfact sinc my arriv mr weldon wa equal amus whether we convers on gay or seriou subject and uninterrupt by compani we chat over affair that mutual interest us i wa extrem sorri howev to find that she did not regard madam de clarenc with that cordial esteem which i imagin everi one must be dispos to feel for a charact so amiabl and she let us into some littl circumst relat to famili dissent which i never should have suspect to have occur between a coupl who alway behav at least in compani with the utmost appar good humor and polit to each other mr weldon even told us that poor madam de clarenc ha an unfortun fail in her temper which render herself and her husband equal miser she possess it seem an unhappi degre of jealousi that lead her to conclud almost everi young woman whose visit are frequent in the famili the object of monsieur de clarenc affect and no sooner is she convinc of her error in one place than her suspicion are turn to anoth quarter howev improb and extraordinari thi is a most unfortun disposit and sincer to be lament for i fear accord to mr weldon account it is quit incur she gave me innumer instanc of her weak in thi particular and ad that as she had been for some time an inmat of her famili she had not fail herself to experi the effect of her temper in thi point i express my surpris that thi unlucki foibl should never have been hint to me till now nor the slightest suspicion of a turn of mind so advers to her tranquil ever occur to my mind dure the whole period of my acquaint with madam de clarenc you wa the last person said she to whom such an inform wa like to be suggest the strict intimaci that subsist between you wa suffici known to deter all malici or offici dispos person from entertain you with a topic so littl agreeabl as the error of your friend and the circl you rang in wa ever so limit that larg as is the proport of the world which come under these descript i believ there were veri few of either class that could be rank among the number of your acquaint but pray ad she had you never occas to remark dure your last visit that madam behav to me with a distanc wholli unaccount and which must i think have provok both your observ and surpris the real truth of the matter wa that as my acquaint with the famili origin through monsieur who live in term of the strictest friendship with poor mr weldon and to whom i wa in some measur given in charg by my husband in hi last moment the ladi never regard me with much kind but consciou she herself possess not address suffici to preserv her husband affect she suspect everi pretti woman she see to be more in favor than herself and charit accus her of the theft that madam de clarenc disapprov of mr weldon behavior i well knew nor wa i ignor that she wa no great favorit with that ladi but as i could not myself avoid join in the censur which her coquetri incur it made no impress on my mind at the time nor could excit either surpris or suspicion our live littl friend mean while happi in the possess of unbound spirit dreamt not of thi sever judgment on her gaieti till after fanni and i left the chateau when the augment reserv and solemn deport of madam de clarenc soon gave place to an open manifest of her repugn and dislik

manner that you should at last becom the object of her suspicion sinc fifti women fifti time your inferior have by turn excit them thi i allow continu mr weldon must have sound somewhat complimentari to an ear the organ of which were disord by jealousi and just at that instant who should we see glide by the tree but madam herself who had been without doubt listen to a sketch of her own charact not much either soften or embellish from the lip of her husband and done perhap rather a littl in caracatura but one must pardon him some degre of exagger from a just exasper at her unceas and teaz

perhap the latter ha hint suspicion of my prudenc and thu overturn the favor sentiment which at dover roatsley seem inclin to feel for hi new acquaint yet hi polit and attent behavior when i met with him at druri lane theater entir contradict thi idea and wa inde total differ from the cold distanc and civil reserv with which hi manner wa impress the last time i saw him at the theater he did not appear the same man at least he certainli wa not actuat by the same feel thi confess may lead you to suspect the weak of my heart and i have sever condemn myself for allow the opinion of a stranger to influenc me so far yet i realli believ pride alon is at the bottom of my uneasi i am hurt to have fallen in the esteem of a man who in spite of your railleri appear superior to most of hi sex i form no wish from hi acquaint but that he might prove an agreeabl acquisit to our societi therefor i could experi i imagin but a slight disappoint yet i allow that i have permit hi behavior to interest me too much and sinc it ha been so remark as to excit your observ even so earli i give you my word i will exert myself to think of it no more jan were it not for the uneasi suspens in which we must remain till lord belmont resolut is known our resid here would not be so uncomfort as i at first conclud it would prove mr hindon is a good natur man and of a veri sociabl disposit he keep an hospit tabl to which he gener bring home two or three guest everi day and these he treat with eas and benevol without ostent they are not to be sure men of veri brilliant manner or whose societi can be deem extrem desir be usual friend from chang about hi own age men who have spent their live in the plod pursuit of gain to the acquisit of which all their talent have been invari exert i had almost said exhaust for their convers seldom display either knowledg of art or tast for seiz that lead not to the great end of becom rich they claim howev the merit of industri and though sometim i am confound with their vulgar in men pass the middl of life one is less shock with that rough which proce from plain deal than with the smart and forward attempt made by some of the beaux of thi line to appear degag men of the world against natur and educ mr hindon though far short of my sanguin expect is a wellmean woman and by no mean defici in sever good qualiti these are inde often obscur by the want of one which bestow luster on everi other i mean delicaci she would not willingli inflict a wound if she wa consciou of it poignanc but she is total destitut of those feel which tell when anoth are hurt without be gener she doe not fail in point of chariti i mean that branch of the duti that consist in give alm she keep excel order in her famili piqu herself upon be an activ oeconomist goe seldom into public and is not given to dissip our hour are earli and regular at least when compar with those which prevail in thi countri and our even are gener spent at home where now and then an easi friend join the famili parti i have discov one strike featur in mr hindon charact to which perhap may be attribut her unbound civil to us yet i own it is unfair to place her kind in a light that depriv it of all it merit she wa herself of veri low extract and probabl for that reason ha attach an idea of import to rank and famili which induc her to attend with the most sedul regard and respect to all who have the slightest claim to distinct sinc our abod here i have suspect a scheme which repeat observ now convinc me is not without foundat captain wilmot mr hindon nephew in a manner live in her hous and except at the season of sleep or dress make constantli one of the famili he is becom of late extrem particular in hi attent to fanni and continu entertain her in a sort of half whisper which give their convers the air of a tete a tete he is goodlook though extrem vacant and insipid but have receiv the polish of a militari educ is enabl to hold forth with eas and fluenci in a complimentari style to which fanni ha no sort of avers i have been a good deal alarm lest as she is young and complet inexperienc le petit soin de monsieur le captain should prove more success than were to be wish i have not fail therefor in talk of him in privat to throw a degre of ridicul upon hi behavior and appear of all weapon the most danger against which a lover can contend and as fanni is not extrem suscept i think my plan will prove the destruct of mr hindon for that she is at the bottom of the captain passion and ha bestow the proper suppli of fuel to blow it into a flame i have no manner of doubt inde her desir of aggrand her famili by an allianc with lord belmont might alon have induc her to promot a match between fanni and her nephew but i make no doubt that besid thi motiv to a young man who is not in affluent circumst fanni ten thousand pound ad to the expect which mr hindon often insinu we may justli form from our grand father liber would be an addit extrem desir after all he may be sincer enamour for fanni possess charm capabl of interest more refin sentiment than i suspect the captain to possess yet i recollect we were some time here befor he seem to know she wa even in the same room with him and hi solicitud took it rise all of a sudden without ani appar caus for the alter after an appear of the most frigid indiffer my suspicion that the scheme wa first suggest to him by hi aunt have been confirm from remark that mr hindon take everi opportun of lavish the most exagger encomium on her nephew he is the veri best young man in the world given to no vice alway kept himself out of the mad frolic of hi militari companion and so good a son that she made no doubt he would make a figur equal respect in everi other depart of life besid dont you think him extrem handsom miss fanni i am sure if you had been within hear of what he said of you last night you must have been flatter though there wa not one word of flatteri in the case he declar you wa in hi opinion you must excus me miss seymour by far the handsomest of the two and so amiabl and so eleg and so like a young ladi of the first qualiti howev i give you my word miss seymour he allow you to be what all the world must acknowledg complet love but miss fanni he say is an angel and i think he is fairli caught at last you see my dear by thi littl trait that mr hindon with all her error is not in the least art inde i believ thi plan no sooner occur to herself than though without intend it she contriv to commun it to me she is inde incap even of a prudent conceal and when she imagin her design for she ha a veri activ turn of mind are cunningli hidden from everi eye a slight degre of penetr onli is requir to pierc through the thin disguis she doe not spare flatteri you may perceiv on thi occas and as she know the influenc which two year senior ad to the warmest attach have given me over fanni mind you see i get my share of it as a person whom it is necessari to bring over to her interest i think mr howard ha likewis made a discoveri of the scheme which evid meet with hi disapprob for he alway appear chagrin and displeas when wilmot join us and regard him with a scrutin eye when he whisper soft nonsens into fanni ear inde to a mind like hi so fraught with rectitud and good sens the utter improprieti of such a step must appear in full forc and i make no doubt that consid himself at present in the light of our guardian he hold himself respons to lord belmont for our conduct while under hi immedi hi sole direct were thi affair to involv fanni in a marriag so imprud it must reflect extrem even on mr howard charact sinc from hi connect with wilmot it would undoubtedli appear to lord belmont as have receiv hi secret concurr and approb of such a conduct i am convinc mr howard is incap even were he to draw from the event the most desir consequens to himself but independ of thi idea i am mistaken if a more forcibl motiv doe not give addit weight to the repugn with which he behold wilmot assidu i believ i onc hint to you that mr howard dure the infanc of our acquaint wa extrem particular in hi attent to me he wa ever solicit for my compani and sought my convers with eager and sedul hi behavior at length alarm me and mine plainli told him how unsuccess ani applic beyond the limit of friendship would prove for though i esteem i admir hi merit and there is none of hi sex for whose charact i have a higher respect though hi manner bespeak hi mind and convey the mild benevol of hi natur into everi look and motion and though hi year would not have been with me a materi object yet yet sophia i could not have love him you will call me romant perhap but never could mr howard have enjoy that tender interest in my heart which my lover must possess ere he becom my husband my sentiment partak of those a daughter feel for her parent they are those of confid depend and gratitud but they are far remov from those soft cordial and insinu tie which make the duti of a wife her first happi and enabl her almost to exist but for the man to whom she ha given her hand when fanni return from the convent for it wa dure her abod there that our acquaint with mr howard commenc he wa struck with her appear but he regard her as a beauti child and wa more delight with her naivet than her convers and though he often enter into chat he never discours with her till our misfortun in lose our dear parent by throw us entir under hi care made him feel fanni depend which at the period of my ill rest sole on him as a peculiar charm that seem to soften and affect him while we travel she leant on him for support in everi difficulti or alarm to him everi enquiri wa made and from him everi explan wa expect and there are few men i believ in whom the idea of protect exert toward a young and pleas object will not creat a tender interest which if it is not love partak extrem of the same sentiment as for me my spirit oppress and my temper independ i trust a littl more to myself nor consult mr howard but when circumst call for counsel and assist to me therefor he ever behav with respect and the most flatter regard but to fanni hi address ha still more soft he appear as if he consid her peculiarli hi charg and to gratifi her in ani littl wish howev whimsic evid confer pleasur on himself yet if my suspicion of hi secret partial are found on truth for i will not pretend to be certain whether my surmiz are not partli the chimera of my own imagin he is act on thi occas like a man of honor and as i should have expect from hi charact hi attent are those which may be felt but except by myself i am certain never have been remark nor ha he onc betray a wish to insinu himself into her good grace no doubt he is consciou that a man of moder fortun can not be consid by lord belmont as a match for hi grand child who if he mean to acknowledg her must possess a varieti of advantag accord to the world opinion suffici to carri a grandfath view infinit higher neither is he insens i dare say to the inequ of their year a girl of sixteen with all the thoughtless incid to her time of life increas perhap by the retir of her educ can not appear to sober reason an ellig choic for a grave sedat man of forti three whose prospect of happi have probabl been center in expect an amiabl companion rather than a belov mistress in the woman whom he make the partner of hi life yet probabl those veri men sophia may not prove less liabl than other to be caught by the charm of youth and when that is the case partial no doubt persuad them they have discov the mistress and companion in one and that they may be abl to mould a young and innoc mind as they pleas i am mistaken if mr howard imagin ha not sometim secretli suggest some such idea though further than conceal wish i am confid hey never will proceed
