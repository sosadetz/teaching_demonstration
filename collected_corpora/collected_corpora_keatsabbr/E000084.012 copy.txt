decid on the case submit to you it ha been heretofor known to congress that frequent incurs have been made on our frontier settlement by certain banditti of indian from the northwest side of the ohio these with some of the tribe dwell on and near the wabash have of late been particularli activ in their depred and be embolden by the impun of their crime and aid by such part of the neighbor tribe as could be seduc to join in their hostil or afford them a retreat for their prison and plunder they have instead of listen to the human invit and overtur made on the part of the unit state renew their violenc with fresh alacr and greater effect the live of a number of valuabl citizen have thu been sacrif and some of them under circumst peculiarli shock whilst other have been carri into a deplor captiv these aggrav provoc render it essenti to the safeti of the western settlement that the aggressor should be made sensibl that the govern of the union is not less capabl of punish their crime than it is dispos to respect their right and reward their attach as thi object could not be effect by defens measur it becam necessari to put in forc the act which empow the presid to call out the

moment most interest to both of these great object our fisheri and the transport of our own produc offer us abund mean for guard ourselv against thi evil your attent seem to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belong to the mediterranean so mani circumst unit in render the present state of it distress to us that you will not think ani deliber misemploy which may lead to it relief and protect the law you have alreadi pass for the establish of a judiciari system have open the door of justic to all descript of person you will consid in your wisdom whether improv in that

these you had no doubt would be soon confirm by law and the necess of the case offer an excus for have exceed your proper power the imperfect state in which the legisl of the northwestern territori is the want which the execut ha often felt of the necessari coadjutor to adopt even the most urgent law and the peculiar situat of a frontier countri are circumst which may not strike everi one who will observ that the execut ha gone beyond it proper power it therefor becom a matter of high import that the utmost circumspect should be observ in the conduct of the execut for there are not want person who would rejoic to find the slightest ground of clamor against public charact and pay no regard to the absolut necess of the case which caus a momentari stretch of power nor the public good which might be produc by it they would seiz the occas of make impress unfavor to govern and possibl product of disagre effect i have therefor thought it best to give you thi intim in a privat and friendli

discuss their request or yield the land ask for i wish you to consid as the basi of the commun to be made to these peopl in the first place it appear to me that cornplant and the other chief now in the citi of philadelphia do not constitut a represent of their nation and to undo or perhap even to enter on the revis of treati which have been deliber and formal conclud but under circumst of equal deliber and form would be to open a door to certain inconveni and probabl difficulti by encourag applic which the indian would not fail to make to the unit state that it is a matter which requir matur consider how far ani assur regard the restor of land which have been cede by treati to the unit state can be made without the particip of the senat and that no assur should be given which may involv a disput with ani individu state respect it claim to the land appli for that they be inform that no agent for indian affair will be author to dispos of their land not comprehend the precis mean of the

unless as is much suspect they are countenanc abet and support in their hostil view by the british though i must confess i can not see much prospect of live in tranquil with them so long as a spirit
