etc i wa born in the year in the citi of york of a good famili though not of that countri my father be a foreign of bremen who settl first at hull he got a good estat by merchandis and leav off hi trade live afterward at york from whenc he had marri my mother whose relat were name robinson a veri good famili in that countri and from whom i wa call robinson kreutznaer but by the usual corrupt of word in england we are now call nay we call our selv and write our name cruso and so my companion alway call me i had two elder brother one of which wa lieuten colonel to an english regiment of foot in flander formerli command by the famou coll lockhart and wa kill at the battl near dunkirk inagast the spaniard what becam of my second brother i never knew ani more than my father or mother did know what wa becom of me be the third son of the famili and not bred to ani trade my head began to be fill veri earli with rambl thought my father who wa veri ancient had given me a compet share of learn as far as houseeduc and a countri free school gener goe and design me for the law but i would be satisfi with noth but go to sea and my inclin to thi led me so strongli against the will nay the command of my father and against all the entreati and persuas of my mother and other friend that there seem to be someth fatal in that propens of natur tend directli to the life of miseri which wa to befal me my father a wise and grave man gave me seriou and excel counsel against what he foresaw wa my design he call me one morn into hi chamber where he wa confin by the gout and expostul veri warmli with me upon thi subject he ask me what reason more than a mere wander inclin i had for leav my father hous and my nativ countri where i might be well introduc and had a prospect of rais my fortun by applic and industri with a life of eas and pleasur he told me it wa for men of desper fortun on one hand or of aspir superior fortun on the other who went abroad upon adventur to rise by enterpris and make themselv famou in undertak of a natur out of the common road that these thing were all either too far abov me or too far below me that mine wa the middl state or what might be call the upper station of low life which he had found by long experi wa the best state in the world the most suit to human happi not expos to the miseri and hardship the labor and suffer of the mechan part of mankind and not embarassd with the pride luxuri ambit and envi of the upper part of mankind he told me i might judg of the happi of thi state by thi one thing viz that thi wa the state of life which all other peopl envi that king have frequent lament the miser consequ of be born to great thing and wish they had been place in the middl of the two exrem between the mean and the great that the wise man gave hi testimoni to thi as the just standard of true felic when he pray to have neither poverti or rich he bid me observ it and i should alway find that the calam of life were share among the upper and lower part of mankind but that the middl station had the fewest disast and wa not expos to so mani vicissitud as the higher or lower part of mankind nay they were not subject to so mani distemp and uneasi either of bodi or mind as those were who by viciou live luxuri and extravag on one hand or by hard labor want of necessari and mean or insuffici diet on the other hand bring distemp upon themselv by the natur consequ of their way of live that the middl station of life wa calcul for all kind of virtu and all kind of enjoy that peac and plenti were the handmaid of a middl fortun that temper moder quiet health societi all agreeabl divers and all desir pleasur were the bless attend the middl station of life that thi way men went silent and smoothli through the world and comfort out of it not embarassd with the labor of the hand or of the head not sold to the life of slaveri for daili bread or harrast with perplex circumst which rob the soul of peac and the bodi of rest not enrag with the passion of envi or secret burn lust of ambit for great thing but in easi circumst slide gentli through the world and sensibl tast the sweet of live without the bitter feel that they are happi and learn by everi day experi to know it more sensibl after thi he press me earnestli and in the most affection manner not to play the young man not to precipit my self into miseri which natur and the station of life i wa born in seem to have provid against that i wa under no necess of seek my bread that he would do well for me and endeavor to enter me fairli into the station of life which he had been just recommend to me and that if i wa not veri easi and happi in the world it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it and that he should have noth to answer for have thu discharg hi duti in warn me against measur which he knew would be to my hurt in a word that as he would do veri kind thing for me if i would stay and settl at home as he direct so he would not have so much hand in my misfortun as to give me ani encourag to go away and to close all he told me i had my elder brother for an exampl to whom he had use the same earnest persuas to keep him from go into the low countri war but could not prevail hi young desir prompt him to run into the armi where he wa kill and though he said he would not ceas to pray for me yet he would ventur to say to me that if i did take thi foolish step god would not bless me and i would have leisur hereaft to reflect upon have neglect hi counsel when there might be none to assist in my recoveri i observ in thi last part of hi discours which wa truli prophet though i suppos my father did not know it to be so himself i say i observ the tear run down hi face veri plenti and especi when he spoke of my brother who wa kill and that when he spoke of my have leisur to repent and none to assist me he wa so move that he broke off the discours and told me hi heart wa so full he could say no more to me i wa sincer affect with thi discours as inde who could be otherwis and i resolv not to think of go abroad ani more but to settl at home accord to my father desir but ala a few day wore it all off and in short to prevent ani of my father farther importun in a few week after i resolv to run quit away from him howev i did not act so hastili neither as my first heat of resolut prompt but i took my mother at a time when i thought her a littl pleasant than ordinari and told her that my thought were so entir bent upon see the world that i should never settl to ani thing with resolut enough to go through with it and my father had better give me hi consent than forc me to go without it that i wa now eighteen year old which wa too late to go apprentic to a trade or clerk to an attorney that i wa sure if i did i should never serv out my time and i should certainli run away from my master befor my time wa out and go to sea and if she would speak to my father to let me go but one voyag abroad if i came home again and did not like it i would go no more and i would promis by a doubl dilig to recov that time i had lost thi put my mother into a great passion she told me she knew it would be to no purpos to speak to my father upon ani such subject that he knew too well what wa my interest to give hi consent to ani thing so much for my hurt and that she wonder how i could think of ani such thing after such a discours as i had had with my father and such kind and tender express as she knew my father had use to me and that in short if i would ruin my self there wa no help for me but i might depend i should never have their consent to it that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruct and i should never have it to say that my mother wa will when my father wa not though my mother refus to move it to my father yet as i have heard afterward she report all the discours to him and that my father after show a great concern at it said to her with a sigh that boy might be happi if he would stay at home but if he goe abroad he will be the miserablest wretch that wa ever born i can give no consent to it it wa not till almost a year after thi that i broke loos though in the mean time i continu obstin deaf to all propos of settl to busi and frequent expostul with my father and mother about their be so posit determin against what they knew my inclin prompt me to but be one day at hull where i went casual and without ani purpos of make an elop that time but i say be there and one of my companion be go by sea to london in hi father ship and prompt me to go with them with the common allur of seafar men viz that it should cost me noth for my passag i consult neither father or mother ani more nor so much as sent them word of it but leav them to hear of it as they might without ask god bless or my father without ani consider of circumst or consequ and in an ill hour god know on the first of septemb i went on board a ship bound for london never ani young adventur misfortun i believ began sooner or continu longer than mine the ship wa no sooner gotten out of the humber but the wind began to blow and the wind to rise in a most fright manner and as i had never been at sea befor i wa most inexpress sick in bodi and terrifi in my mind i began now serious to reflect upon what i had done and how justli i wa overtaken by the judgment of heaven for my wick leav my father hous and abandon my duti all the good counsel of my parent my father tear and my mother entreati came now fresh into my mind and my conscienc which wa not yet come to the pitch of hard which it ha been sinc reproach me with the contempt of advic and the breach of my duti to god and my father all thi while the storm increas and the sea which i had never been upon befor went veri high though noth like what i have seen mani time sinc no nor like what i saw a few day after but it wa enough to affect me then who wa but a young sailor and had never known ani thing of the matter i expect everi wave would have swallow us up and that everi time the ship fell down as i thought in the trough or hollow of the sea we should never rise more and in thi agoni of mind i made mani vow and resolut that if it would pleas god here to spare my life thi one voyag if ever i got onc my foot upon dri land again i would go directli home to my father and never set it into a ship again while i live that i would take hi advic and never run my self into such miseri as these ani more now i saw plainli the good of hi observ about the middl station of life how easi how comfort he had live all hi day and never had been expos to tempest at sea or troubl on shore and i resolv that i would like a true repent prodig go home to my father these wise and sober thought continu all the while the storm continu and inde some time after but the next day the wind wa abat and the sea calmer and i began to be a littl inur to it howev i wa veri grave for all that day be also a littl sea sick still but toward night the weather clear up the wind wa quit over and a charm fine even follow the sun went down perfectli clear and rose so the next morn and have littl or no wind and a smooth sea the sun shine upon it the sight wa as i thought the most delight that ever i saw i had slept well in the night and wa now no more sea sick but veri cheer look with wonder upon the sea that wa so rough and terribl the day befor and could be so calm and so pleasant in so littl time after and now least my good resolut should continu my companion who had inde entic me away come to me well bob say he clap me on the shoulder how do you do after it i warrant you were fright want you last night when it blew but a cap full of wind a cap full do you call it said i twa a terribl storm a storm you fool you repli he do you call that a storm whi it wa noth at all give us but a good ship and sea room and we think noth of such a squal of wind as that but your but a fresh water sailor bob come let us make a bowl of punch and well forget all that do you see what charm weather it is now to make short thi sad part of my stori we went the old way of all sailor the punch wa made and i wa made drunk with it and in that one night wicked i drown all my repent all my reflect upon my past conduct and all my resolut for my futur in a word as the sea wa return to it smooth of surfac and settl calm by the abat of that storm so the hurri of my thought be over my fear and apprehens of be swallow up by the sea be forgotten and the current of my former desir return i entir forgot the vow and promis that i made in my distress i found inde some interv of reflect and the seriou thought did as it were endeavor to return again sometim but i shook them off and rous my self from them as it were from a distemp and appli my self to drink and compani soon master the return of those fit for so i call them and i had in five or six day got as complet a victori over conscienc as ani young fellow that resolv not to be troubl with it could desir but i wa to have anothet trial for it still and provid as in such case gener it doe resolv to leav me entir without excus for if i would not take thi for a deliver the next wa to be such a one as the worst and most wretch among us would confess both the harden danger and the merci the sixth day of our be at sea we came into yarmouth road the wind have been contrari and the weather calm we had made but littl way sinc the storm here we were oblig to come to an anchor and here we lay the wind continu contrari viz at southwest for seven or eight day dure which time a great mani ship from newcastl came into the same road as the common harbor where the ship might wait for a wind for the river we had not howev rid here so long but should have tide it up the river but that the wind blew too fresh and after we had lain four or five day blew veri hard howev the road be reckon as good as a harbor the anchorag good and our groundtackl veri strong our men were unconcern and not in the least apprehens of danger but spent the time in rest and mirth after the manner of the sea but the eighth day in the morn the wind increas and we had all hand at work to strike our topmast and make everi thing snug and close that the ship might ride as easi as possibl by noon the sea went veri high inde and our ship rid forecastl in ship sever sea and we thought onc or twice our anchor had come home upon which our master order out the sheet anchor so that we rode with two anchor ahead and the cabl vere out to the better end by thi time it blew a terribl storm inde and now i began to see terror and amaz in the face even of the seamen themselv the master though vigil to the busi of preserv the ship yet as he went in and out of hi cabin by me i could hear him softli to himself say sever time lord be merci to us we shall be all lost we shall be all undon and the like dure these first hurri i wa stupid lie still in my cabin which wa in the steerag and can not describ my temper i could ill reassum the first penit which i had so appar trampl upon and harden my self against i thought the bitter of death had been past and that thi would be noth too like the first but when the master himself came by me as i said just now and said we should be all lost i wa dread fright i got up out of my cabin and look out but such a dismal sight i never saw the sea went mountain high and broke upon us everi three or four minut when i could look about i could see noth but distress round us two ship that rid near us we found had cut their mast by the board be deep laden and our men cri out that a ship which rid about a mile ahead of us wa founder two more ship be driven from their anchor were run out of the road to sea at all adventur and that with not a mast stand the light ship fare the best as not so much labor in the sea but two or three of them drove and came close by us run away with onli their spritsail out befor the wind toward even the mate and boatswain beg the master of our ship to let them cut away the foremast which he wa veri unwil to but the boatswain protest to him that if he did not the ship would founder he consent and when they had cut away the foremast the mainmast stood so loos and shook the ship so much they were oblig to cut her away also and make a clear deck ani one may judg what a condit i must be in at all thi who wa but a young sailor and who had been in such a fright befor at but a littl but if i can express at thi distanc the thought i had about me at that time i wa in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former convict and the have return from them to the resolut i had wickedli taken at first than i wa at death it self and these ad to the terror of the storm put me into such a condit that i can by no word describ it but the worst wa not come yet the storm continu with such furi that the seamen themselv acknowledg they had never known a wors we had a good ship but she wa deep laden and wallow in the sea that the seamen everi now and then cri out she would founder it wa my advantag in one respect that i did not know what they meant by founder till i inquir howev the storm wa so violent that i saw what is not often seen the master the boatswain and some other more sensibl than the rest at their prayer and expect everi moment when the ship would go to the bottom in the middl of the night and under all the rest of of our distress one of the men that had been down on purpos to see cri out we had sprung a leak anoth said there wa four foot water in the hold then all hand were call to the pump at that veri word my heart as i thought die within me and i fell backward upon the side of my bed where i sat into the cabin howev the men rous me and told me that i that wa abl to do noth befor wa as well abl to pump as anoth at which i stir up and went to the pump and work veri heartili while thi wa do the master see some light collier who not abl to ride out the storm were oblig to flip and run away to sea and would come near us order to fire a gun as a signal of distress i who knew noth what that meant wa so surpris that i thought the ship had broke or some dread thing had happen in a word i wa so surpris that i fell down in a swoon as thi wa a time when everi bodi had hi own life to think of no bodi mind me or what wa becom of me but anoth man step up to the pump and thrust me asid with hi foot let me lie think i had been dead and it wa a great while befor i came to my self we work on but the water increas in the hold it wa appar that the ship would founder and though the storm began to abat a littl yet as it wa not possibl she could swim till we might run into a port so the master continu fire gun for help and a light ship who had rid it out just a head of us ventur a boat out to help us it wa with the utmost hazard the boat came near us but it wa imposs for us to get on board or for the boat to lie near the ship side till at last the men row veri heartili and ventur their live to save our our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it and then vere it out a great length which they after great labor and hazard took hold of and we halld them close under our stern and got all into their boat it wa to no purpos for them or us after we were in the boat to think of reach to their own ship so all agre to let her drive and onli to pull her in toward shore as much as we could and our master promis them that if the boat wa stavd upon shore he would make it good to their master so partli row and partli drive our boat went away to the norward sloap toward the shore almost as far as winterton ness we were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship but we saw her sink and then i understood for the first time what wa meant by a ship founder in the sea i must acknowledg i had hardli eye to look up when the seamen told me she wa sink for from that moment they rather put me into the boat than that i might be said to go in my heart wa as it were dead within me partli with fright partli with horror of mind and the thought of what wa yet befor me while we were in thi condit the men yet labor at the oar to bring the boat near the shore we could see when our boat mount the wave we were abl to see the shore a great mani peopl run along the shore to assist us when we should come near but we made but slow way toward the shore nor were we abl to reach the shore till be past the lighthous at winterton the shore fall off to the westward toward cromer and so the land broke off a littl the violenc of the wind here we got in and though not without much difficulti got all safe on shore and walk afterward on foot to yarmouth where as unfortun men we were use with great human as well by the magistr of the town who assign us good quarter as by particular merchant and owner of ship and had money given us suffici to carri us either to london or back to hull as we thought fit had i now had the sens to have gone back to hull and have gone home i had been happi and my father an emblem of our bless savior parabl had even kill the fat calf for me for hear the ship i went away in wa cast away in yarmouth road it wa a great while befor he had ani assur that i wa not drown but my ill fate push me on now with an obstinaci that noth could resist and though i had sever time loud call from my reason and my more compos judgment to go home yet i had no power to do it i know not what to call thi nor will i urg that it is a secret overrul decre that hurri us on to be the instrument of our own destruct even though it be befor us and that we rush upon it with our eye open certainli noth but some such decre unavoid miseri attend and which it wa imposs for me to escap could have push me forward against the calm reason and persuas of my most retir thought and against two such visibl instruct as i had met with in my first attempt my comrad who had help to harden me befor and who wa the master son wa now less forward than i the first time he spoke to me after we were at yarmouth which wa not till two or three day for we were separ in the town to sever quarter i say the first time he saw me it appear hi tone wa alter and look veri melancholi and shake hi head ask me how i did and tell hi father who i wa and how i had come thi voyag onli for a trial in order to go farther abroad hi father turn to me with a veri grave and concern tone young man say he you ought never to go to sea ani more you ought to take thi for a plain and visibl token that you are not to be a seafar man whi sir said i will you go to sea no more that is anoth case said he it is my call and therefor my duti but as you made thi voyag for a trial you see what a tast heaven ha given you of what you are to expect if ou persist perhap thi is all befallen us on your account like jonah in the ship of tarshish pray continu he what are you and on what account did you go to sea upon that i told him some of my stori at the end of which he burst out with a strang kind of passion what had i done say he that such an unhappi wretch should come into my ship i would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pound thi inde wa as i said an excurs of hi spirit which were yet agit by the sens of hi loss and wa farther than he could have author to go howev he afterward talk veri grave to me exhort me to go back to my father and not tempt provid to my ruin told me i might see a visibl hand of heaven against me and young man said he depend upon it if you do not go back wherev you go you will meet with noth but disast and disappoint till your father word are fulfil upon you we part soon after for i made him littl answer and i saw him no more which way he went i know not as for me have some money in my pocket i travel to london by land and there as well as on the road had mani struggl with my self what cours of life i should take and whether i should go home or go to sea as to go home shame oppos the best motion that offer to my thought and it immedi occur to me how i should be laugh at among the neighbor and should be asham to see not my father and mother onli but even everi bodi els from whenc i have sinc often observ how incongru and irrat the common temper of mankind is especi of youth to that reason which ought to guid them in such case viz that they are not asham to sin and yet are asham to repent not asham of the action for which they ought justli to be esteem fool but are asham of the return which onli can make them be esteem wise men in thi state of life howev i remain some time uncertain what measur to take and what cours of life to lead an irresist reluct continu to go home and as i stay a while the remembr of the distress i had been in wore off and as that abat the littl motion i had in my desir to a return wore off with it till at last i quit laid asid the thought of it and look out for a voyag that evil influenc which carri me first away from my father hous that hurri me into the wild and indigest notion of rais my fortun and that impress those conceit so forcibl upon me as to make me deaf to all good advic and to the entreati and even command of my father i say the same influenc whatev it wa present the most unfortun of all enterpris to my view and i went on board a vessel bound to the coast of africa or as our sailor vulgarli call it a voyag to guinea it wa my great misfortun that in all these adventur i did not ship my self as a sailor wherebi though i might inde have workt a littl harder than ordinari yet at the same time i had learn the duti and offic of a foremast man and in time might have quallifi my self for a mate or lieuten if not for a master but as it wa alway my fate to choos for the wors so i did here for have money in my pocket and good cloth upon my back i would alway go on board in the habit of a gentleman and so i neither had ani busi in the ship or learn to do ani it wa my lot first of all to fall into pretti good compani in london which doe not alway happen to such loos and unguid young fellow as i then wa the devil gener not omit to lay some snare for them veri earli but it wa not so with me i first fell acquaint with the master of a ship who had been on the coast of guinea and who have had veri good success there wa resolv to go again and who take a fanci to my convers which wa not at all disagre at that time hear me say i had a mind to see the word told me if i would go the voyag with him i should be at no expens i should be hi messmat and hi companion and if i could carri ani thing with me i should have all the advantag of it that the trade would admit and perhap i might meet with some encourag i embrac the offer and enter into a strict friendship with thi captain who wa an honest and plaindeal man i went the voyag with him and carri a small adventur with me which by the disinterest honesti of my friend the captain i increas veri consider for i carri about l in such toy and trifl as the captain direct me to buy thi l i had muster togeth by the assist of some of my relat whom i correspond with and who i believ got my father or at least my mother to contribut so much as that to my first adventur thi wa the onli voyag which i may say wa success in all my adventur and which i owe to the integr and honesti of my friend the captain under whom also i got a compet knowledg of the mathemat and the rule of navig learn how to keep an account of the ship cours take an observ and in short to understand some thing that were need to be understood by a sailor for as he took delight to introduc me i took delight to learn and in a word thi voyag made me both a sailor and a merchant for i brought home l ounc of gold dust for my adventur which yield me in london at my return almost l and thi fill me with those aspir thought which have sinc so complet my ruin yet even in thi voyag i had my misfortun too particularli that i wa continu sick be thrown into a violent calentur by the excess heat of the climat our princip trade be upon the coast from the latitud of degre north even to the line it self i wa now set up for a guiney trader and my friend to my great misfortun die soon after hi arriv i resolv to go the same voyag again and i embark in the same vessel with one who wa hi mate in the former voyag and had now got the command of the ship thi wa the unhappiest voyag that ever man made for though i did not carri quit l of my new gain wealth so that i had left and which i lodg with my friend widow who wa veri just to me yet i fell into terribl misfortun in thi voyag and the first wa thi viz our ship make her cours toward the canari island or rather between those island and the african shore wa surpris in the gray of the morn by a turkish rover of salle who gave chase to us with all the sail she could make we crowd also as much canvass as our yard would spread or our mast carri to have got clear but find the pirat gain upon us and would certainli come up with us in a few hour we prepar to fight our ship have gun and the rogu about three in the afternoon he came up with us and bring to by mistak just athwart our quarter instead of athwart our stern as he intend we brought of our gun to bear on that side and pour in a broadsid upon him which made him sheer off again after return our fire and pour in also hi small shot from near men which he had on board howev we had not a man touch all our men keep close he prepar to attack us again and we to defend our selv but lay us on board the next time upon our other quarter he enter men upon our deck who immediatel fell to cut and hack the deck and rig we pli them with smallshot halfpik powderchest and such like and cleard our deck of them twice howev to cut short thi melancholi part of our stori our ship be disabl and three of our men kill and eight wound we were oblig to yield and were carri all prison into salle a port belong to the moor the usag i had there wa not so dread as at first i apprehend nor wa i carri up the countri to the emperor court as the rest of our men were but wa kept by the captain of the rover as hi proper prize and made hi slave be young and nimbl and fit for hi busi at thi surpris chang of my circumst from a merchant to a miser slave i wa perfectli overwhelm and now i look back upon my father prophet discours to me that i should be miser and have none to reliev me which i thought wa now so effectu brought to pass that it could not be wors that now the hand of heaven had overtaken me and i wa undon without redempt but ala thi wa but a tast of the miseri i wa to go through as will appear in the sequel of thi stori as my new patron or master had taken me home to hi hous so i wa in hope that he would take me with him when he went to sea again believ that it would some time or other be hi fate to be taken by a spanish or portug man of war and that then i should be set at liberti but thi hope of mine wa soon taken away for when he went to sea he left me on shore to look after hi littl garden and do the common drudgeri of slave about hi hous and when he came home again from hi cruis he order me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship here i medit noth but my escap and what method i might take to effect it but found no way that had the least probabl in it noth present to make the supposit of it ration for i had no bodi to commun it to that would embark with me no fellowslav no englishman irishman or scotsman there but my self so that for two year though i often pleas my self with the imagin yet i never had the least encourag prospect of put it in practic after about two year an odd circumst present it self which put the old thought of make some attempt for my liberti again in my head my patron lie at home longer than usual without fit out hi ship which as i heard wa for want of money he use constantli onc or twice a week sometim often if the weather wa fair to take the ship pinnac and go out into the road afish and as he alway took me and a young maresco with him to row the boat we made him veri merri and i prove veri dexter in catch fish insomuch that sometim he would send me with a moor one of hi kinsmen and the youth the maresco as they call him to catch a dish of fish for him it happen one time that go a fish in a stark calm morn a fog rose so thick that though we were not half a leagu from the shore we lost sight of it and row we knew not whither or which way we labor all day and all the next night and when the morn came we found we had pull off to sea instead of pull in for the shore and that we were at least two leagu from the shore howev we got well in again though with a great deal of labor and some danger for the wind began to blow pretti fresh in the morn but particularli we were all veri hungri but our patron warn by thi disast resolv to take more care of himself for the futur and have lie by him the longboat of our english ship we had taken he resolv he would not go a fish ani more without a compass and some provis so he order the carpent of hi ship who also wa an english slave to build a littl stateroom or cabin in the middl of the long boat like that of a barg with a place to stand behind it to steer and hale home the mainsheet and room befor for a hand or two to stand and work the sail she sail with that we call a shoulder of mutton sail and the boom gibd over the top of the cabin which lay veri snug and low and had in it room for him to lie with a slave or two and a tabl to eat on with some small locker to put in some bottl of such liquor as he thought fit to drink in particularli hi bread rice and coffe we went frequent out with thi boat a fish and as i wa most dextrou to catch fish for him he never went without me it happen that he had appoint to go out in thi boat either for pleasur or for fish with two or three moor of some distinct in that place and for whom he had provid extraordinarili and had therefor sent on board the boat over night a larger store of provis than ordinari and had order me to get readi three fuze with powder and shot which were on board hi ship for that they design some sport of fowl as well as fish i got all thing readi as he had direct and wait the next morn with the boat wash clean her ancient and pendant out and everi thing to accomod hi guest when by and by my patroon came on board alon and told me hi guest had put off go upon some busi that fell out and order me with the man and boy as usual to go out with the boat and catch them some fish for that hi friend were to sup at hi hous and command that as soon as i had got some fish i should bring it home to hi hous all which i prepar to do thi moment my former notion of deliver dart into my thought for now i found i wa like to have a littl ship at my command and my master be gone i prepar to furnish my self not for a fish busi but for a voyag though i knew not neither did i so much as consid whither i should steer for ani where to get out of that place wa my way my first contriv wa to make a pretens to speak to thi moor to get someth for our subsist on board for i told him we must not presum to eat of our patroon bread he said that wa true so he brought a larg basket of rusk or biscuit of their kind and three jarr with fresh water into the boat i knew where my patroon case of bottl stood which it wa evid by the make were taken out of some english prize and i convey them into the boat while the moor wa on shore as if they had been there befor for our master i convey also a great lump of beeswax into the boat which weigh abov half a hundr weight with a parcel of twine or thread a hatchet a saw and a hammer all which were of great use to us afterward especi the wax to make candl anoth trick i tri upon him which he innoc came into also hi name wa ismael who they call muli or moeli so i call to him moeli said i our patroon gun are on board the boat can you not get a littl powder and shot it may be we may kill some alcami a fowl like our curlieu for our selv for i know he keep the gunner store in the ship ye say he i will bring some and accordingli he brought a great leather pouch which held about a pound and half of powder or rather more and anoth with shot that had five or six pound with some bullet and put all into the boat at the same time i had found some powder of my master in the great cabin with which i fill one of the larg bottl in the case which wa almost empti pour what wa in it into anoth and thu furnish with everi thing need we sail out of the port to fish the castl which is at the entranc of the port knew who we were and took no notic of us and we were not abov a mile out of the port befor we hale in our sail and set us down to fish the wind blew from the n ne which wa contrari to my desir for had it blown southerli i had been sure to have made the coast of spain and at least reach to the bay of cadiz but my resolut were blow which way it would i would be gone from that horrid place where i wa and leav the rest to fate after we had fisht some time and caught noth for when i had fish on my hook i would not pull them up that he might not see them i said to the moor thi will not do our master will not be thu serv we must stand farther off he think no harm agre and be in the head of the boat set the sail and as i had the helm i run the boat out near a leagu farther and then brought her too as if i would fish when give the boy the helm i step forward to where the moor wa and make as if i stoopt for someth hehind him i took him by surpris with my arm under hi twist and toss him clear overboard into the sea he rise immedi for he swam like a cork and call to me beg to be taken in told me he would go all over the world with me he swam so strong after the boat that he would have reach me veri quickli there bieng but littl wind upon which i step into the cabin and fetch one of the fowlingpiec i present it at him and told him i had done him no hurt and if he would be quiet i would do him none but said i you swim well enough to reach to the shore and the sea is calm make the best of your way to shore and i will do you no harm but if you come near the boat i will shoot you through the head for i am resolv to have my liberti so he turn himself about and swam for the shore and i make no doubt but he reach it with eas for he wa an excel swimmer i could have been content to have taken thi moor with me and have drown the boy but there wa no ventur to trust him when he wa gone i turn to the boy who they call xuri and said to him xuri if you will be faith to me i will make you a great man but if you will not stroke your face to be true to me that is swear by mahomet and hi father beard i must throw you into the sea too the boy smile in my face and spoke so innoc that i could not mistrust him and swore to be faith to me and go all over the world with me while i wa in view of the moor that wa swim i stood out directli to sea with the boat rather stretch to windward that they might think me gone toward the straitsmouth as inde ani one that had been in their wit must have been suppos to do for who would have suppos we were saild on to the southward to the truli barbarian coast where whole nation of negro were sure to surround us with their cano and destroy us where we could never onc go on shore but we should be devour by savag beast or more merciless savag of human kind but as soon as it grew dusk in the even i chang my cours and steer directli south and by east bend my cours a littl toward the east that i might keep in with the shore and have a fair fresh gale of wind and a smooth quiet sea i made such sail that i believ by the next day at three a clock in the afternoon when i first made the land i could not be less than mile south of salle quit beyond the emperor of morocco dominion or inde of ani other king thereabout for we saw no peopl yet such wa the fright i had taken at the moor and the dread apprehens i had of fall into their hand that i would not stop or go on shore or come to an anchor the wind continu fair till i had sail in that manner five day and then the wind shift to the southward i conclud also that if ani of our vessel were in chase of me they also would now give over so i ventur to make to the coast and came to an anchor in the mouth of a littl river i knew not what or where neither what latitud what countri what nation or what river i neither saw or desir to see ani peopl the princip thing i want wa fresh water we came into thi creek in the even resolv to swim on shore as soon as it wa dark and discov the countri but as soon as it wa quit dark we heard such dread nois of the bark roar and howl of wild creatur of we knew not what kind that the poor boy wa readi to die with fear and beg of me not to go on shore till day well xuri said i then i will not but it may be we may see men by day who will be as bad to us as those lion then we give them the shoot gun say xuri laugh make them run wey such english xuri spoke by convers among us slave howev i wa glad to see the boy so cheer and i gave him a dram out of our patroon case of bottl to cheer him up after all xuri advic wa good and i took it we drop our littl anchor and lay still all night i say still for we slept none for in two or three hour we saw vast great creatur we knew not what to call them of mani sort come down to the seashoar and run into the water wallow and wash themselv for the pleasur of cool themselv and they made such hideou howl and yell that i never inde heard the like xuri wa dread fright and inde so wa i too but we were both more fright when we heard one of these mighti creatur come swim toward our boat we could not see him but we might hear him by hi blow to be a monstrou huge and furiou beast xuri said it wa a lion and it might be so for ought i know but poor xuri cri to me to weigh the anchor and row away no say i xuri we can slip our cabl with the buoy to it and go off to sea they can not follow us far i had no sooner said so but i perceiv the creatur whatev it wa within two oar length which someth surpris me howev i immedi step to the cabbindoor and take up my gun fire at him upon which he immedi turn about and swam toward the shore again but it is imposs to describ the horribl nois and hideou cri and howl that were rais as well upon the edg of the shore as higher within the countri upon the nois or report of the gun a thing i have some reason to believ those creatur had never heard befor thi convinc me that there wa no go on shore for us in the night upon that coast and how to ventur on shore in the day wa anoth question too for to have fallen into the hand of ani of the savag had been as bad as to have fallen into the hand of lion and tiger at least we were equal apprehens of the danger of it be that as it would we were oblig to go on shore somewher or other for water for we had not a pint left in the boat when or where to get to it wa the point xuri said if i would let him go on shore with one of the jarr he would find if there wa ani water and bring some to me i ask him whi he would go whi i should not go and he stay in the boat the boy answer with so much affect that made me love him ever after say he if wild man come they eat me you go wey well xuri said i we will both go and if the wild man come we will kill them they shall eat neither of us so i gave xuri a piec of ruskbread to eat and a dram out of our patroon case of bottl which i mention befor and we hale the boat in as near the shore as we thought wa proper and so wade on shore carri noth but our arm and two jarr for water i did not care to go out of sight of the boat fear the come of cano with savag down the river but the boy see a low place about a mile up the countri rambl to it and by and by i saw him come run toward me i thought he wa pursu by some savag or fright with some wild beast and i run forward toward him to help him but when i came nearer to him i saw someth hang over hi shoulder which wa a creatur that he had shot like a hare but differ in color and longer leg howev we were veri glad of it and it wa veri good meat but the great joy that poor xuri came with wa to tell me he had found good water and seen no wild man but we found afterward that we need not take such pain for water for a littl higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh when the tide wa out which flow but a littl way up so we fill our jarr and feast on the hare we had kill and prepar to go on our way have seen no footstep of ani human creatur in that part of the countri as i had been one voyag to thi coast befor i knew veri well that the island of the canari and the cape de verd island also lay not far off from the coast but as i had no instrument to take an observ to know what latitud we were in and did not exactli know or at least rememb what latitud they were in i knew not where to look for them or when to stand off to sea toward them otherwis i might now easili have found some of these island but my hope wa that if i stood along thi coast till i came to that part where the english trade i should find some of their vessel upon their usual design of trade that would reliev and take us in by the best of my calcul that place were i now wa must be that countri which lie between the emperor of morocco dominion and the negro lie wast and uninhabit except by wild beast the negro have abandon it and gone farther south for fear of the moor and the moor not think it worth inhabit by reason of it barren and inde both forsak it becaus of the prodigi number of tiger lion leopard and other furiou creatur which harbor there so that the moor use it for their hunt onli where they go like an armi two or three thousand men at a time and inde for near an hundr mile togeth upon thi coast we saw noth but a wast uninhabit countri by day and heard noth but howl and roar of wild beast by night onc or twice in the day time i thought i saw the pico of teneriff be the high top of the mountain teneriff in the canari and had a great mind to ventur out in hope of reach thither but have tri twice i wa forc in again by contrari wind the sea also go too high for my littl vessel so i resolv to pursu my first design and keep along the shore sever time i wa oblig to land for fresh water after we had left thi place and onc in particular be earli in the morn we came to an anchor under a littl point of land which wa pretti high and the tide begin to flow we lay still to go farther in xuri whose eye were more about him than it seem mine were call softli to me and tell me that we had best go farther off the shore for say he look yonder lie a dread monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep i look where he point and saw a dread monster inde for it wa a terribl great lion that lay on the side of the shore under the shade of a piec of the hill that hung as it were a littl over him xuri say i you shall go on shore and kill him xuri look fright and said me kill he eat me at one mouth one mouth he meant howev i said no more to the boy but bad him lie still and i took our biggest gun which wa almost musquetbor and load it with a good charg of powder and with two slug and laid it down then i load anoth gun with two bullet and the third for we had three piec i load with five smaller bullet i took the best aim i could with the first piec to have shot him into the head but he lay so with hi leg rais a littl abov hi nose that the slug hit hi leg about the knee and broke the bone he start up growl at first but find hi leg broke fell down again and then got up upon three leg and gave the most hideou roar that ever i heard i wa a littl supprizd that i had not hit him on the head howev i took up the second piec immedi and though he began to move off fire again and shot him into the head and had the pleasur to see him drop and make but littl nois but lay struggl for life then xuri took heart and would have me let him go on shore well go said i so the boy jump into the water and take a littl gun in one hand swam to shore with the other hand and come close to the creatur put the muzzl of the piec to hi ear and shot him into the head again which dispatch him quit thi wa game inde to us but thi wa no food and i wa veri sorri to lose three charg of powder and shot upon a creatur that wa good for noth to us howev xuri said he would have some of him so he come on board and ask me to give him the hatchet for what xuri said i me cut off hi head said he howev xuri could not cut off hi head but he cut off a foot and brought it with him and it wa a monstrou great one i bethought my self howev that perhap the skin of him might one way or other be of some valu to us and i resolv to take off hi skin if i could so xuri and i went to work with him but xuri wa much the better workman at it for i knew veri ill how to do it inde it took us up both the whole day but at last we got of the hide of him and spread it on the top of our cabin the sun effectu dri it in two day time and it afterward serv me to lie upon after thi stop we made on to the southward continu for ten or twelv day live veri spare on our provis which began to abat veri much and go no often into the shore than we were oblig to for fresh water my design in thi wa to make the river gambia or sennegal that is to say ani where about the cape de verd where i wa in hope to meet with some european ship and if i did not i knew not what cours i had to take but to seek out for the island or perish there among the negro i knew that all the ship from europ which sail either to the coast of guiney or to brasil or to the east indi made thi cape or those island and in a word i put the whole of my fortun upon thi singl point either that i must meet with some ship or must perish when i had pursu thi resolut about ten day longer as i have said i began to see that the land wa inhabit and in two or three place as we sail by we saw peopl stand upon the shore to look at us we could also perceiv they were quit black and starknak i wa onc inclin to have gone on shore to them but xuri wa my better councellor and said to me no go no go howev i hale in nearer the shore that i might talk to them and i found they run along the shore by me a good way i observ they had no weapon in their hand except one who had a long slender stick which xuri said wa a lanc and that they would throw them a great way with good aim so i kept at a distanc but talk with them by sign as well as i could and particularli made sign for some thing to eat they beckon to me to stop my boat and that they would fetch me some meat upon thi i lower the top of my sail and lay by and two of them run up into the countri and in less than half an hour came back and brought with them two piec of dri flesh and some corn such as is the produc of their countri but we neither knew what the one or the other wa howev we were will to accept it but how to come at it wa our next disput for i wa not for ventur on shore to them and they were as much afraid of us but they took a safe way for us all for they brought it to the shore and laid it down and went and stood a great way off till we fetch it on board and then came close to us again we made sign of thank to them for we had noth to make them amend but an opportun offer that veri instant to oblig them wonder for while we were lie by the shore came two mighti creatur one pursu the other as we took it with great furi from the mountain toward the sea whether it wa the male pursu the femal or whether they were in sport or in rage we could not tell ani more than we could tell whether it wa usual or strang but i believ it wa the latter becaus in the first place those raven creatur seldom appear but in the night and in the second place we found the peopl terribl fright especi the women the man that had the lanc or dart did not fli from them but the rest did howev as the two creatur ran directli into the water they did not seem to offer to fall upon ani of the negro but plung themselv into the sea and swam about as if they had come for their divers at last one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first i expect but i lay readi for him for i had load my gun with all possibl expedit and bad xuri load both the other as soon as he came fairli within my reach i fire and shot him directli into the head immedi he sunk down into the water but rose instantli and plung up and down as if he wa struggl for life and so inde he wa he immedi made to the shore but between the wound which wa hi mortal hurt and the strangl of the water he dy just befor he reach the shore it is imposs to express the astonish of these poor creatur at the nois and the fire of my gun some of them were even readi to dye for fear and fell down as dead with the veri terror but when they saw the creatur dead and sunk in the water and that i made sign to them to come to the shore they took heart and came to the shore and began to search for the creatur i found him by hi blood stain the water and by the help of a rope which i slung round him and gave the negro to hawl they drag him on shore and found that it wa a most curiou leopard spot and fine to an admir degre and the negro held up their hand with admir to think what it wa i had kill him with the other creatur fright with the flash of fire and the nois of the gun swam on shore and ran up directli to the mountain from whenc they came nor could i at that distanc know what it wa i found quickli the negro were for eat the flesh of thi creatur so i wa will to have them take it as a favor from me which when i made sign to them that they might take him they were veri thank for immedi they fell to work with him and though they had no knife yet with a sharpen piec of wood they took off hi skin as readili and much more readili than we could have done with a knife they offer me some of the flesh which i declin make as if i would give it them but made sign for the skin which they gave me veri freeli and brought me a great deal more of their provis which though i did not understand yet i accept then i made sign to them for some water and held out one of my jarr to them turn it bottom upward to show that it wa empti and that i want to have it fill they call immedi to some of their friend and there came two women and brought a great vessel made of earth and burnt as i suppos in the sun thi they set down for me as befor and i sent xuri on shore with my jarr and fill them all three the women were as stark nake as the men i wa now furnish with root and corn such as it wa and water and leav my friendli negro i made forward for about eleven day more without offer to go near the shore till i saw the land run out a great length into the sea at about the distanc of four or five leagu befor me and the sea be veri calm i kept a larg of to make thi point at length doubl the point at about two leagu from the land i saw plainli land on the other side to seaward then i conclud as it wa most certain inde that thi wa the cape de verd and those the island call from thenc cape de verd island howev they were at a great distanc and i could not well tell what i had best to do for if i should be taken with a fresh of wind i might neither reach one or other in thi dilemna as i wa veri pensiv i step into the cabin and sat me down xuri have the helm when on a sudden the boy cri out master master a ship with a sail and the foolish boy wa fright out of hi wit think it must need be some of hi master ship sent to pursu us when i knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach i jump out of the cabin and immedi saw not onli the ship but what she wa viz that it wa a portugues ship and as i thought wa bound to the coast of guinea for negro but when i observ the cours she steer i wa soon convinc they were bound some other way and did not design to come ani nearer to the shore upon which i stretch out to sea as much as i could resolv to speak with them if possibl with all the sail i could make i found i should not be abl to come in their way but that they would be gone by befor i could make ani signal to them but after i had crowd to the utmost and began to despair they it seem saw me by the help of their perspectiveglass and that it wa some european boat which as they suppos must belong to some ship that wa lost so they shorten sail to let me come up i wa encourag with thi and as i had my patroon ancient on board i made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress and fire a gun both which they saw for they told me they saw the smoke though they did not hear the gun upon these signal they veri kindli brought too and lay by for me and in about three hour time i came up with them they ask me what i wa in portugues and in spanish and in french but i understood none of them but at last a scot sailor who wa on board call to me and i answer him and told him i wa an englishman that i had made my escap out of slaveri from the moor at salle then they bad me come on board and veri kindli took me in and all my good it wa an inexpress joy to me that ani one will believ that i wa thu deliv as i esteem it from such a miser and almost hopeless condit as i wa in and i immedi offer all i had to the captain of the ship as a return for my deliver but he gener told me he would take noth from me but that all i had should be deliv safe to me when i came to the brasil for say he i have save your life on no other term than i would be glad to be save my self and it may one time or other be my lot to be taken up in the same condit besid said he when i carri you to the brasil so great a way from your own countri if i should take from you what you have you will be starv there and then i onli take away that life i have given no no seignor ingles say he mr englishman i will carri you thither in chariti and those thing will help you to buy your subsist there and your passag home again as he wa charit in hi propos so he wa just in the perform to a tittl for he order the seamen that none should offer to touch ani thing i had then he took everi thing into hi own possess and gave me back an exact inventori of them that i might have them even so much as my three earthen jarr as to my boat it wa a veri good one and that he saw and told me he would buy it of me for the ship use and ask me what i would have for it i told him he had been so gener to me in everi thing that i could not offer to make ani price of the boat but left it entir to him upon which he told me he would give me a note of hi hand to pay me piec of eight for it at brasil and when it came there if ani one offer to give more he would make it up he offer me also piec of eight more for my boy xuri which i wa loath to take not that i wa not will to let the captain have him but i wa veri loath to sell the poor boy liberti who had assist me so faith in procur my own howev when i let him know my reason he own it to be just and offer me thi medium that he would give the boy an oblig to set him free in ten year if he turn christian upon thi and xuri say he wa will to go to him i let the captain have him we had a veri good
