of the die belton and hi repent i just saw him again on saturday night befor i went to bed which i did earli for i wa surfeit with mowbray frothi insens and could not bear him it is such a horrid thing to think of that a man who had live in such strict term of amiti with anoth the proof doe not come out so as to say friendship who had pretend so much love for him could not bear to be out of hi compani would ride a hundr mile an end to enjoy it and would fight for him be the caus right or wrong yet now could be so littl move to see him in such miseri of bodi and mind as to be abl to rebuk

time now that you are in full vigor of mind and bodi but your poor belton ala kept hi vice till they left him and see the miser effect in debil of mind and despond were mowbray here and were he to laugh at me i would own that thi is the caus of my despair that god justic can not let hi merci oper for my comfort for oh i have been veri veri wick and have despis the offer of hi grace till he ha withdrawn it from me for ever i use all the argument i could think of to give him consol and what i said had such an effect upon him as to quiet hi mind for the greatest part of the day and in a lucid

to extend as occas offer the wrong we did to the person whom we had befor injur in their dearest relat but yet i think in my heart that i have less to answer for than either lovelac or mowbray for i by take to myself that accurs deceiv from whom thou have freed me and who for year unknown to me wa retali upon my own head some of the evil i had brought upon other and retir and live with her as a wife wa not parti to half the mischief that i doubt they and tourvil and even you belford commit as to the ungrat thomasm i hope i have met with my punish in her but notwithstand thi do thou not think that such an action and such an action and such an action and then he recapitul sever enorm in which led on by fals braveri and the heat of youth and wine we have all been concern do thou not think that these villaini let me call them now by their proper name join to the wil and gloriedin neglect of everi duti that our better sens and educ gave us to know were requir of us as men and christian are not enough to weigh down my soul into despond inde inde they are and now to hope for merci and to depend upon the efficaci of that graciou attribut when that no less shine one of justic forbid me to hope how can i i who have despis all warn and taken no advantag of the benefit i might have reap from the linger consumpt ill i have labor under but left all to the last stake hope for recoveri against hope and drive off repent till that grace is deni me for oh my dear belford i can now neither repent nor pray as i ought my heart is harden and i can do noth but despair more he would have

made me speak them over again a sad retinu inde said the poor man and then express hi hopeless of life and hi terror at the thought of die and draw from thenc terribl conclus with regard to hi futur state there is said i such a natur avers to death in human natur that you are not to imagin that you my dear belton are singular in the fear of it and in the apprehens that fill the thought mind upon it approach but you ought as much as possibl to separ those natur fear which all men must have on so solemn an occas from those particular one which your justlyapprehend unfit fill you with lord

up in cloud as if to thee our veri knowledg had antipathi then follow what i repeat death could not a more sad retinu find sick and pain befor and dark all behind ala my dear belford infer the unhappi deepthink what poor creatur doe thi convinc me we mortal are at best but what then must be the case of such a proflig as i who by a past wick life have ad forc to these natur terror if death be so repugn a thing to human natur that good men will be startl at it what must it be to one who ha live a life of sens and appetit nor ever reflect upon the end which i now am within view of what could i say to an infer so fairli drawn merci merci unbound merci wa still my plea though hi repeat opposit of justic to it in a manner silenc it and what would i have given to have had rise to my mind one

sensibl of a scratch from a pin point as other from a push of a sword and who can say ani thing for the sensibl of such fellow metcalf would resent for hi sister when hi sister resent not for herself

ani thing to a languish heart i see that and so far wa mowbray apropo in the vers from not lee which thou have transcrib mere to die no man of reason fear is a mistak say thou or say thi author what ye will and thi solemn parad about the natur repugn between life and death is a proof that it is let me tell thee jack that so much am i pleas with thi world in the main though in some point too the world to make a person of it ha been a rascal to me so delight am i with the joy of youth with my worldli prospect as to fortun and now newli with the charm hope given me by dear thrice dear and forev dear miss harlow that were i even sure that noth bad would come hereaft i should be veri loath veri much afraid if thou will have it so to lay down my life and them togeth and yet upon a call of honor no man fear death less than myself but i have not either inclin or leisur to weigh thi leaden argument except in the pig or as thou would say in the lump if i return thi letter let me have them again some time henc that is to say when i am marri or when poor belton is halfforgotten or when time ha enrol the honest fellow among those whom we have so long lost that we may rememb them with more pleasur than pain and then i may give them a seriou perus and enter with thee as deepli as thou will into the subject when i am marri said i what a sound ha that i must wait with patienc for a sight of thi charm creatur till she is at her father and yet as the but blossom beauti as thou tellest me is reduc to a shadow i should have been exceedingli delight to see her now and everi day till the happi one that i might have the pleasur of behold how sweetli hour by hour she will rise to her pristin glori by mean of that state of eas and content which will take place of the stormi past upon her reconcili with her friend and our happi nuptial letter v mr lovelac to john belford esquir well but now my heart is a littl at eas i will condescend to take some brief notic of some other passag in thi letter i find i am to thank thee that the dear creatur ha avoid my visit thing are now in so good a train that i must forgiv thee els should thou have heard more of thi new instanc of disloyalti to thi gener thou art continu give thyself high prais by way of opposit as i may say to other gentli and art blame thyself for qualiti thou would at the same time have to be thought and which gener are thought praiseworthi thu in the air thou assumest about thi servant thou would pass for a mighti human mortal and that at the expens of mowbray and me whom thou representest as king and emperor to our menial yet art thou alway unhappi in thi attempt of thi kind and never can make us who know thee believ that to be a virtu in thee which is but the effect of constitut phlegm and absurd know thou not that some men have a nativ digniti in their manner that make them more regard by a look than either thou can be in thi low style or mowbray in hi high i am fit to be a princ i can tell thee for i reward well and i punish season and properli and i am gener as well serv as ani man the art of govern these underbr varlet lie more in the digniti of look than in word and thou art a sorri fellow to think human consist in act by thi servant as men must act who are not abl to pay them their wage or had made them master of secret which if divulg would lay them at the merci of such wretch now to me who never did ani thing i wa asham to own and who have more ingenu than ever man had who can call a villaini by it right name though practic by myself and by my own readi to reproach myself anticip all reproach from other who am not such a hypocrit as to wish the world to think me other or better than i am it is my part to look a servant into hi duti if i can nor will i keep one who know not how to take me by a nod or a wink and who when i smile shall not be all transport when i frown all terror if inde i am out of the way a littl i alway take care to reward the varlet for bear patient my displeasur but thi i hardli ever am but when a fellow is egregi stupid in ani plain point of duti or will be wiser than hi master and when he shall tell me that he thought act contrari to my order wa the way to serv me best one time or other i will enter the list with thee upon thi conduct and mine to servant and i will convinc thee that what thou would have pass for human if it be indiscrimin practic to all temper will perpetu subject thee to the evil thou complainest of and justli too and that he onli is fit to be a master of servant who can command their attent as much by a nod as if he were to prythe a fellow to do hi duti on one hand or to talk of flay and horsewhip like mowbray on the other for the servant who be use to expect thi creep style will alway be master of hi master and he who deserv to be treat as the other is not fit to be ani man servant nor would i keep such a fellow to rub my hors heel i shall be the readier to enter the list with thee upon thi argument becaus i have presumpt enough to think that we have not in ani of our dramat poet that i can at present call to mind one charact of a servant of either sex that is justli hit off so absurdli wise some and so sottishli foolish other and both sometim in the same person foil drawn from the lee or dreg of the peopl to set off the charact of their master and mistress nay sometim which is still more absurd introduc with more wit than the poet ha to bestow upon their princip mere stint and steel to strike fire with or to vari the metaphor to serv for whetston to wit which otherwis could not be made appar or for engin to be made use of like the machineri of the ancien poet or the still more unnatur soliloquy to help on a sorri plot or to bring about a necessari eclairciss to save the poet the troubl of think deepli for a better way to wind up hi bottom of thi i am persuad whatev my practic be to my own servant that thou will be benefit by my theori when we come to controvert the point for then i shall convinc thee that the dramat as well as natur characterist of a good servant ought to be fidel common sens cheer obedi and silent respect that wit in hi station except to hi companion would be sawci that he should never presum to give hi advic that if he ventur to expostul upon ani unreason command or such a one as appear to him to be so he should do it with humil and respect and take a proper season for it but such lesson do most of the dramat perform i have seen give where servant are introduc as charact essenti to the play or to act veri signific or long part in it which of itself i think a fault such lesson i say do they give to the footmen galleri that i have not wonder we have so few modest or good menserv among those who often attend their master or mistress to play then how miser evid must that poet consciou want of geniu be who can stoop to rais or give forc to a clap by the indiscrimin roar of the partycolor galleri but thi subject i will suspend to a better opportun that is to say to the happi one when my nuptial with my clarissa will oblig me to increas the number of my servant and of consequ to enter more nice into their qualif although i have the highest opinion that man can have of the generos of my dear miss harlow yet i can not for the heart of me account for thi agreeabl chang in her temper but one way faith and troth belford i verili believ lay all circumst togeth that the dear creatur unexpectedli find herself in the way i have so ardent wish her to be in and that thi make her at last inclin to favor me that she may set the better face upon her gestat when at her father if thi be the case all her sail away and her faint ft are charmingli account for nor is it surpris that such a sweet novic in these matter should not know to what to attribut her frequent indisposit if thi should be the case how shall i laugh at thee and when i am sure of her at the dear novic herself that all her grievou distress shall end in a manchild which i shall love better than all the cherubim and seraphim that may come after though there were to be as mani of them as i beheld in my dream in which a vast expans of ceil wa stuck as full of them as it could hold i shall be afraid to open thi next lest it bring me the account of poor belton death yet as there are no hope of hi recoveri but what should i say unless the poor man were better fit but thi heavi sermon shall not affect me too much neither i enclos thi paper and do thou transcrib them for me or return them for there are some thing in them which at a proper season a mortal man should not avoid attend to and thou seem to have enter deepli into the shock subject but here i will end lest i grow too seriou thi servant call here about an hour ago to know if i had ani command i therefor hope that thou will have thi earli in the morn and if thou can let me hear from thee do i will stretch an hour or two in expect of it yet i must be at lord ms tomorrow night if possibl though ever so late thi fellow tell me the poor man is much as he wa when mowbray left him would thou think that thi varlet mowbray is sorri that i am so near be happi with miss harlow and egad jack i know not what to say to it now the fruit seem to be within my reach but let what will come i will stand to it for i find i can not live without her letter vi mr belford to robert lovelac esquir wedn three oclock i will proceed where i left off in my last as soon as i had seen mowbray mount i went to attend upon poor belton whom i found in dread agoni in which he awok as he gener doe the doctor came in present after and i wa concern at the scene that pass between them it open with the die man ask him with melancholi earnest if noth if noth at all could be done for him the doctor shook hi head and told him he doubt not i can not die said the poor man i can not think of die i am veri desir of live a littl longer if i could but be free from these horribl pain in my stomach and head can you give me noth to make me pass one week but one week in toler eas that i may die like a man if i must die but doctor i am yet a young man in the prime of my year youth is a good subject for a physician to work upon can you do noth noth at all for me doctor ala sir repli hi physician you have been long in a bad way i fear i fear noth in physic can help you he wa then out of all patienc what then is your art sir i have been a passiv machin for a whole twelvemonth to be wrought upon at the pleasur of you peopl of the faculti i verili believ had i not taken such dose of nasti stuff i had been now a well man but who the plagu would regard physician whose art is to cheat us with hope while they help to destroy us and who not one of you know ani thing but by guess sir continu he fierc and with more strength of voic and coher than he had shown for sever hour befor if you give me over i give you over the onli honest and certain part of the art of heal is surgeri a good surgeon is worth a thousand of you i have been in surgeon hand often and have alway found reason to depend upon their skill but your art sir what is it but to dawb dawb dawb load load load plaster plaster plaster till ye utterli destroy the appetit first and the constitut afterward which you are calledin to help i had a companion onc my dear belford thou knew honest blomer as pretti a physician he would have made as ani in england had he kept himself from excess in wine and women and he alway use to say there wa noth at all but pickpocket parad in the physician art and that the best guesser wa the best physician and i use to believ him too and yet fond of life and fear of death what do we do when we are taken ill but call ye in and what do ye do when call in but nurs our distemp till from pigmi you make giant of them and then ye come creep with solemn face when ye are asham to prescrib or when the stomach will not bear it natur food by reason of your poison potion ala i am afraid physic can do no more for him nor need it when it ha brought to the brink of the grave the poor wretch who place all hi relianc in your curs slop and the flatter hope you gave him the doctor wa out of counten but said if we could make mortal men immort and would not all thi might be just i blame the poor man yet excus him to the physician to die dear doctor when like my poor friend we are so desir of life is a melancholi thing we are apt to hope too much not consid that the seed of death are sown in us when we begin to live and grow up till like rampant weed they choke the tender flower of life which declin in us as those weed flourish we ought therefor to begin earli to studi what our constitut will bear in order to root out by temper the weed which the soil is most apt to produc or at least to keep them down as they rise and not when the flower or plant is wither at the root and the weed in it full vigor expect that the medic art will restor the one or destroy the other when that other as i hint ha been root itself in the habit from the time of our birth thi speech bob thou will call a pretti or a white bear but the allegori is just and thou have not quit cure me of the metaphor veri true said the doctor you have brought a good metaphor to illustr the thing i am sorri i can do noth for the gentleman and can onli recommend patienc and a better frame of mind well sir said the poor angri man vex at the doctor but more at death you will perhap recommend the next in success to the physician when he can do no more and i suppos will send your brother to pray by me for those virtu which you wish me it seem the physician brother is a clergyman in the neighborhood i wa greatli concern to see the gentleman thu treat and so i told poor belton when he wa gone but he continu impati and would not be deni he said the liberti of talk to a man who had taken so mani guinea of him for do noth or wors than noth and never declin one though he knew all the time he could do him no good it seem the gentleman though rich is note for be greedi after see and poor belton went on rave at the extravag fee of english physician compar with those of the most emin foreign one but poor man he like the turk who judg of a gener by hi success out of patienc to think he must die would have worship the doctor and not grudg three time the sm could he have given him hope of recoveri but nevertheless i must need say that gentlemen of the faculti should be more moder in their fee or take more pain to deserv them for gener they onli come into a room feel the sick man puls ask the nurs a few question inspect the patient tongu and perhap hi water then sit down look plaguey wise and write the golden fee find the readi hand and they hurri away as if the sick man room were infecti so to the next they troll and to the next if men of great practic valu themselv upon the number of visit they make in a morn and the littl time they make them in they go to dinner and unload their pocket and salli out again to refil them and thu in a littl time they rais vast estat for as ratcliff said when first told of a great loss which befel him it wa onli go up and down a hundr pair of stair to fetch it up mr sambr belton sister had sever time propos to him a minist to pray by him but the poor man could not he said bear the thought of one for that he should certainli die in an hour or two after and he wa will to hope still against all probabl that he might recov and wa often ask hi sister if she had not seen peopl as bad as he wa who almost to a miracl when everi bodi gave them over had got up again she shake her head told him she had but onc say that their disord were of an acut kind and such as had a crisi in them he call her smallhop and job comfort and bid her say noth if she could not say more to the purpos and what wa fitter for a sick man to hear and yet poor fellow he ha no hope himself as is plain by hi despond terror one of which he fell into and a veri dread one soon after the doctor went wednesday oclock at night the poor man ha been in convuls terribl convuls for an hour past o lord lovelac death is a shock thing by my faith it is i wish thou were present on thi occas it is not mere the concern a man ha for hi friend but as death is the common lot we see in hi agoni how it will be one day with ourselv i am all over as if cold water were pour down my back or as if i had a strong agu fit upon me i wa oblig to come away and i write hardli know what i wish thou were here though i left him becaus i could stay no longer i can not be easi by myself but must go to him again eleven oclock poor belton draw on apac yet wa he sensibl when i went in too sensibl poor man he ha someth upon hi mind to reveal he tell me that is the worst action of hi life wors than ever you or i knew of him he say it must be then veri bad he order everi bodi out but wa seiz with anoth convulsionfit befor he could reveal it and in it he lie struggl between life and death but i will go in again one oclock in the morn all now must soon be over with him poor poor fellow he ha given me some hint of what he want to say but all incoher interrupt by die hiccough and convuls bad enough it must be heaven know by what i can gather ala lovelac i fear i fear he came too soon into hi uncl estat if a man were to live alway he might have some temptat to do base thing in order to procur to himself as it would then be everlast eas plenti or affluenc but for the sake of ten twenti thirti year of poor life to be a villain can that be worth while with a conscienc sing him all the time too and when he come to wind up all such agon reflect upon hi past guilt all then appear as noth what he most valu most disgust and not one thing to think of as the poor fellow say twenti and twenti time over but what is attend with anguish and reproach to hear the poor man wish he had never been born to hear him pray to be noth after death good god how shock by hi incoher hint i am afraid it is veri bad with him no pardon no merci he repeat can lie for him i hope i shall make a proper use of thi lesson laugh at me if thou will but never never more will i take the liberti i have taken but whenev i am tempt will think of belton die agoni and what my own may be thursday three in the morn he is now at the last gasp rattl in the throat ha a new convuls everi minut almost
