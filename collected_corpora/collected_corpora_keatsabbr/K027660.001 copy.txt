triumph in the world strang quoth i debat the matter with myself that one and twenti mile sail for it is absolut no further from dover to calai should give a man these right i will look into them so give up the argument i went straight to my lodg put up half a dozen shirt and a black pair of silk breech the coat i have on said i look at the sleev will do took a place in the dover stage and the packet sail at nine the next morn by three i had got sat down to my dinner upon a fricasse chicken so incontest in franc that had i die that night of an indigest the whole world could not have suspend the effect of the all the effect of stranger swiss and scotch except die in franc are seiz by virtu of thi law though the heir be upon the spot the profit of these conting be farm there is no redress droit daubain my shirt and black pair of silk breech portmanteau and all must have gone to the king of franc even the littl pictur which i have so long worn and so often have told thee eliza i would carri with me into my grave would have been torn from my neck ungener to seiz upon the wreck of an unwari passeng whom your subject had beckon to their coast by heaven sire it is not well done and much doe it griev me it is the monarch of a peopl so civil and courteou and so renown for sentiment and fine feel that i have to reason with but i have scarc set foot in your dominion calai when i had finish my dinner and drank the king of franc health to satisfi my mind that i bore him no spleen but on the contrari high honor for the human of hi temper i rose up an inch taller for the accommod no said i the bourbon is by no mean a cruel race they may be misl like other peopl but there is a mild in their blood as i acknowledg thi i felt a suffus of a finer kind upon my cheek more warm and friendli to man than what burgundi at least of two livr a bottl which wa such as i had been drink could have produc just god said i kick my portmanteau asid what is there in thi world good which should sharpen our spirit and make so mani kindheart brethren of us fall out so cruelli as we do by the way when man is at peac with man how much lighter than a feather is the heaviest of metal in hi hand he pull out hi purs and hold it airili and uncompressd look round him as if he sought for an object to share it with in do thi i felt everi vessel in my frame dilat the arteri beat all chearili togeth and everi power which sustain life perform it with so littl friction that twould have confound the most physic precieus in franc with all her materi she could scarc have call me a machin i am confid said i to myself i should have overset her creed the access of that idea carri natur at that time as high as she could go i wa at peac with the world befor and thi finish the treati with myself now wa i a king of franc cri i what a moment for an orphan to have beg hi father portmanteau of me the monk calai i had scarc utter the word when a poor monk of the order of st franci came into the room to beg someth for hi convent no man care to have hi virtu the sport of conting or one man may be gener as anoth man is puissant sed non quo ad hanc or be it as it may for there is no regular reason upon the ebb and flow of our humor they may depend upon the same caus for ought i know which influenc the tide themselv twould often be no discredit to us to suppos it wa so i am sure at least for myself that in mani a case i should be more highli satisfi to have it said by the world i had had an affair with the moon in which there wa neither sin nor shame than have it pass altogeth as my own act and deed wherein there wa so much of both but be thi as it may the moment i cast my eye upon him i wa predetermin not to give him a singl sou and accordingli i put my purs into my pocket button it up set myself a littl more upon my center and advanc up grave to him there wa someth i fear forbid in my look i have hi figur thi moment befor my eye and think there wa that in it which deserv better the monk as i judg from the break in hi tonsur a few scatter white hair upon hi templ be all that remain of it might be about seventi but from hi eye and that sort of fire which wa in them which seem more temper by courtesi than year could be no more than sixti truth might lie between he wa certainli sixtyf and the gener air of hi counten notwithstand someth seem to have been plant wrinkl in it befor their time agre to the account it wa one of those head which guido ha often paint mild pale penetr free from all commonplac idea of fat content ignor look downward upon the earth it look forward but look as if it look at someth beyond thi world how one of hi order came by it heaven abov who let it fall upon a monk shoulder best know but it would have suit a bramin and had i met it upon the plain of indostan i had reverenc it the rest of hi outlin may be given in a few stroke one might put it into the hand of ani one to design for twa neither eleg or otherwis but as charact and express made it so it wa a thin spare form someth abov the common size if it lost not the distinct by a bend forward in the figur but it wa the attitud of entreati and as it now stand present to my imagin it gain more than it lost by it when he had enter the room three pace he stood still and lay hi left hand upon hi breast a slender white staff with which he journeyd be in hi right when i had got close up to him he introduc himself with the littl stori of the want of hi convent and the poverti of hi order and did it with so simpl a grace and such an air of deprec wa there in the whole cast of hi look and figur i wa bewitch not to have been struck with it a better reason wa i had predetermin not to give him a singl sou the monk calai it is veri true said i repli to a cast upward with hi eye with which he had conclud hi address it is veri true and heaven be their resourc who have no other but the chariti of the world the stock of which i fear is no way suffici for the mani great claim which are hourli made upon it as i pronounc the word great claim he gave a slight glanc with hi eye downward upon the sleev of hi tunick i felt the full forc of the appeal i acknowledg it said i a coars habit and that but onc in three year with meagr diet are no great matter and the true point of piti is as they can be earn in the world with so littl industri that your order should wish to procur them by press upon a fund which is the properti of the lame the blind the age and the infirm the captiv who lie down count over and over again the day of hi afflict languish also for hi share of it and had you been of the order of merci instead of the order of st franci poor as i am continu i point at my portmanteau full cheer should it have been open to you for the ransom of the unfortun the monk made me a bow but of all other resum i the unfortun of our own countri sure have the first right and i have left thousand in distress upon our own shore the monk gave a cordial wave with hi head as much as to say no doubt there is miseri enough in everi corner of the world as well as within our convent but we distinguish said i lay my hand upon the sleev of hi tunick in return for hi appeal we distinguish my good father betwixt those who wish onli to eat the bread of their own labor and those who eat the bread of other peopl and have no other plan in life but to get through it in sloth and ignor for the love of god the poor franciscan made no repli a hectic of a moment pass across hi cheek but could not tarri natur seem to have had done with her resent in him he show none but let hi staff fall within hi arm he press both hi hand with resign upon hi breast and retir the monk calai my heart smote me the moment he shut the door psha said i with an air of careless three sever time but it would not do everi ungraci syllabl i had utter crowd back into my imagin i reflect i had no right over the poor franciscan but to deni him and that the punish of that wa enough to the disappoint without the addit of unkind languag i consid hi gray hair hi courteou figur seem to reenter and gentli ask me what injuri he had done me and whi i could use him thu i would have given twenti livr for an advoc i have behav veri ill said i within myself but i have onli just set out upon my travel and shall learn better manner as i get along the desoblig calai when a man is discont with himself it ha one advantag howev that it put him into an excel frame of mind for make a bargain now there be no travel through franc and itali without a chais and natur gener prompt us to the thing we are fittest for i walk out into the coach yard to buy or hire someth of that kind to my purpos an old a chais so call in franc from it bold but one person desoblig in the furthest corner of the court hit my fanci at first sight so i instantli got into it and find it in toler harmoni with my feel i order the waiter to call monsieur dessein the master of the hotel but monsieur dessein be gone to vesper and not care to face the franciscan whom i saw on the opposit side of the court in confer with a ladi just arriv at the inn i drew the taffeta curtain betwixt us and be determin to write my journey i took out my pen and ink and wrote the prefac to it in the disoblig prefac in the desoblig it must have been observ by mani a peripatet philosoph that natur ha set up by her own unquestion author certain boundari and fenc to circumscrib the discont of man she ha effect her purpos in the quietest and easiest manner by lay him under almost insuper oblig to work out hi eas and to sustain hi suffer at home it is there onli that she ha provid him with the most suitabl object to partak of hi happi and bear a part of that burden which in all countri and age ha ever been too heavi for one pair of shoulder it is true we are endu with an imperfect power of spread our happi sometim beyond her limit but it is so order that from the want of languag connect and depend and from the differ in educ custom and habit we lie under so mani impedi in commun our sensat out of our own sphere as often amount to a total imposs it will alway follow from henc that the balanc of sentiment commerc is alway against the expatri adventur he must buy what he ha littl occas for at their own price hi convers will seldom be taken in exchang for their without a larg discount and thi by the by etern drive him into the hand of more equit broker for such convers as he can find it requir no great spirit of divin to guess at hi parti thi bring me to my point and natur lead me if the seesaw of thi desoblig will but let me get on into the effici as well as the final caus of travel your idl peopl that leav their nativ countri and go abroad for some reason or reason which may be deriv from one of these gener caus infirm of bodi imbecil of mind or inevit necess the first two includ all those who travel by land or by water labor with pride curios vaniti or spleen subdivid and combin in infinitum the third class includ the whole armi of peregrin martyr more especi those travel who set out upon their travel with the benefit of the clergi either as delinqu travel under the direct of governor recommend by the magistr or young gentlemen transport by the cruelti of parent and guardian and travel under the direct of governor recommend by oxford aberdeen and glasgow there is a fourth class but their number is so small that they would not deserv a distinct wa it not necessari in a work of thi natur to observ the greatest precis and niceti to avoid a confus of charact and these men i speak of are such as cross the sea and sojourn in a land of stranger with a view of save money for variou reason and upon variou pretens but as they might also save themselv and other a great deal of unnecessari troubl by save their money at home and as their reason for travel are the least complex of ani other speci of emigr i shall distinguish these gentlemen by the name of simpl travel thu the whole circl of travel may be reduc to the follow head idl travel inquisit travel lie travel proud travel vain travel splenet travel then follow the travel of necess the delinqu and feloni travel the unfortun and innoc travel the simpl travel and last of all if you pleas the sentiment travel mean therebi myself who have travel and of which i am now sit down to give an account as much out of necess and the besoin de voyag as ani one in the class i am well awar at the same time as both my travel and observ will be altogeth of a differ cast from ani of my forerunn that i might have insist upon a whole nitch entir to myself but i should break in upon the confin of the vain travel in wish to draw attent toward me till i have some better ground for it than the mere novelti of my vehicl it is suffici for my reader if he ha been a travel himself that with studi and reflect hereupon he may be abl to determin hi own place and rank in the catalogu it will be one step toward know himself as it is great odd but he retain some tinctur and resembl of what he imbib or carri out to the present hour the man who first transplant the grape of burgundi to the cape of good hope observ he wa a dutch man never dreamt of drink the same wine at the cape that the same grape produc upon the french mountain he wa too phlegmat for that but undoubtedli he expect to drink some sort of vinou liquor but whether good bad or indiffer he knew enough of thi world to know that it did not depend upon hi choic but that what is gener call chanc wa to decid hi success howev he hope for the best and in these hope by an intemper confid in the fortitud of hi head and the depth of hi discret mynheer might possibl overset both in hi new vineyard and by discov hi naked becom a laughingstock to hi peopl even so it fare with the poor travel sail and post through the polit kingdom of the globe in pursuit of knowledg and improv knowledg and improv are to be got by sail and post for that purpos but whether use knowledg and real improv is all a lotteri and even where the adventur is success the acquir stock must be use with caution and sobrieti to turn to ani profit but as the chanc run prodigi the other way both as to the acquisit and applic i am of opinion that a man would act as wise if he could prevail upon himself to live content without foreign knowledg or foreign improv especi if he live in a countri that ha no absolut want of either and inde much grief of heart ha it often and mani a time cost me when i have observ how mani a foul step the inquisit travel ha measur to see sight and look into discoveri all which as sancho panca said to don quixot they might have seen dryshod at home it is an age so full of light that there is scarc a countri or corner of europ whose beam are not cross and interchang with other knowledg in most of it branch and in most affair is like music in an italian street whereof those may partak who pay noth but there is no nation under heaven and god is my record befor whose tribun i must one day come and give an account of thi work that i do not speak it vauntingli but there is no nation under heaven abound with more varieti of learn where the scienc may be more fitli woo or more sure won than here where art is encourag and will so soon rise high where natur take her all togeth ha so littl to answer for and to close all where there is more wit and varieti of charact to feed the mind with where then my dear countrymen are you go we are onli look at thi chais said they your most obedi servant said i skip out of it and pull off my hat we were wonder said one of them who i found wa an inquisit travel what could occas it motion twa the agit said i coolli of write a prefac i never heard said the other who wa a simpl travel of a prefac wrote in a desoblig it would have been better said i in a vi a vi as an english man doe not travel to see english men i retir to my room calai i perceiv that someth darken the passag more than myself as i step along it to my room it wa effectu mon dessein the master of the hotel who had just return from vesper and with hi hat under hi arm wa most complaisantli follow me to put me in mind of my want i had wrote myself pretti well out of conceit with the desoblig and mon dessein speak of it with a shrug as if it would no way suit me it immedi struck my fanci that it belong to some innoc travel who on hi return home had left it to mon dessein honor to make the most of four month had elaps sinc it had finish it career of europ in the corner of mon dessein coachyard and have salli out from thenc but a vamptup busi at the first though it had been twice taken to piec on mount senni it had not profit much by it adventur but by none so littl as the stand so mani month unpiti in the corner of mon dessein coachyard much inde wa not to be said for it but someth might and when a few word will rescu miseri out of her distress i hate the man who can be a churl of them now wa i the master of thi hotel said i lay the point of my forefing on mon dessein breast i would inevit make a point of get rid of thi unfortun desoblig itstand swing reproach at you everi time you pass by it mon dieu said mon dessein i have no interest except the interest said i which men of a certain turn of mind take mon dessein in their own sensat i am persuad to a man who feel for other as well as for himself everi raini night disguis it as you will must cast a damp upon your spirit you suffer mon dessein as much as the machin i have alway observ when there is as much sour as sweet in a compliment that an englishman is etern at a loss within himself whether to take it or let it alon a frenchman never is mon dessein made me a bow cest bien vrai said he but in thi case i should onli exchang one disquietud for anoth and with loss figur to yourself my dear sir that in give you a chais which would fall to piec befor you had got half way to pari figur to yourself how much i should suffer in give an ill impress of myself to a man of honor and lie at the merci as i must do dun homm desprit the dose wa made up exactli after my own prescript so i could not help take it and return mon dessein hi bow without more casuistri we walk togeth toward hi remis to take a view of hi magazin of chais in the street calai it must need be a hostil kind of a world when the buyer if it be but of a sorri postchais can not go forth with the seller thereof into the street to termin the differ betwixt them but he instantli fall into the same frame of mind and view hi conventionist with the same sort of eye as if he wa go along with him to hydepark corner to fight a duel for my own part be but a poor swordsman and no way a match for monsieur dessein i felt the rotat of all the movement within me to which the situat is incid i look at monsieur dessein through and through eye him as he walk along in profil then en face thought he look like a jew then a turk dislik hi wig curs him by my god wish him at the devil and is all thi to be light up in the heart for a beggarli account of three or four louisdor which is the most i can be overreachd in base passion said i turn myself about as a man natur doe upon a sudden revers of sentiment base ungentl passion thi hand is against everi man and everi man hand against thee heaven forbid said she rais her hand up to her forehead for i had turn full in front upon the ladi whom i had seen in confer with the monk she had follow us unperceiv heaven forbid inde said i offer her my own she had a black pair of silk glove open onli at the thumb and two forefing so accept it without reserv and i led her up to the door of the remis monsieur dessein had diabl the key abov fifti time befor he found out he had come with a wrong one in hi hand we were as impati as himself to have it open and so attent to the obstacl that i continu hold her hand almost without know it so that monsieur dessein left us togeth with her hand in mine and with our face turn toward the door of the remis and said he would be back in five minut now a colloquy of five minut in such a situat is worth one of as mani age with your face turn toward the street in the latter case it is drawn from the object and occurr without when your eye are fix upon a dead blank you draw pure from yourselv a silenc of a singl moment upon monsieur dessein leav us had been fatal to the situat she had infal turn about so i begun the convers instantli but what were the temptat as i write not to apolog for the weak of my heart in thi tour but to give an account of them shall be describ with the same simplic with which i felt them the remis door calai when i told the reader that i did not care to get out of the desoblig becaus i saw the monk in close confer with a ladi just arriv at the inn i told him the truth but i did not tell him the whole truth for i wa full as much restrain by the appear and figur of the ladi he wa talk to suspicion cross my brain and said he wa tell her what had pass someth jar upon it within me i wish him at hi convent when the heart fli out befor the understand it save the judgment a world of pain i wa certain she wa of a better order of be howev i thought no more of her but went on and wrote my prefac the impress return upon my encount with her in the street a guard frank with which she gave me her hand show i thought her good educ and her good sens and as i led her on i felt a pleasur ductil about her which spread a calm over all my spirit good god how a man might lead such a creatur as thi round the world with him i had not yet seen her face twa not materi for the draw wa instantli set about and long befor we had got to the door of the remis fanci had finish the whole head and pleas herself as much with it fit her goddess as if she had dive into the tiber for it but thou art a seduc and a seduc slut and albeit thou cheatest us seven time a day with thi pictur and imag yet with so mani charm do thou do it and thou deckest out thi pictur in the shape of so mani angel of light it is a shame to break with thee when we had got to the door of the remis she withdrew her hand from across her forehead and let me see the origin it wa a face of about six and twenti of a clear transpar brown simpli set off without roug or powder it wa not critic handsom but there wa that in it which in the frame of mind i wa in which attach me much more to it it wa interest i fanci it wore the charact of a widow look and in that state of it declens which had pass the two first paroxysm of sorrow and wa quietli begin to reconcil itself to it loss but a thousand other distress might have trace the same line i wish to know what they had been and wa readi to enquir had the same bon ton of convers permit as in the day of esdra what aileth thee and whi art thou disquiet and whi is thi understand troubl in a word i felt benevol for her and resolv some way or other to throw in my mite of courtesi if not of servic such were my temptat and in thi disposit to give way to them wa i left alon with the ladi with her hand in mine and with our face both turn closer to the door of the remis than what wa absolut necessari the remis door calai thi certainli fair ladi said i rais her hand up a littl lightli as i began must be one of fortun whimsic do to take two utter stranger by their hand of differ sex and perhap from differ corner of the globe and in one moment place them togeth in such a cordial situat as friendship herself could scarc have achiev for them had she project it for a month and your reflect upon it show how much monsieur she ha embarass you by the adventur when the situat is what we would wish noth is so illtim as to hint at the circumst which make it so you thank fortun continu she you had reason the heart knew it and wa satisfi and who but an english philosoph would have sent notic of it to the brain to revers the judgment in say thi she disengag her hand with a look which i thought a suffici commentari upon the text it is a miser pictur which i am go to give of the weak of my heart by own that it suffer a pain which worthier occas could not have inflict i wa mortifi with the loss of her hand and the manner in which i had lost it carri neither oil nor wine to the wound i never felt the pain of a sheepish inferior so miser in my life the triumph of a true feminin heart are short upon these discomfitur in a veri few second she laid her hand upon the cuff of my coat in order to finish her repli so some way or other god know how i regain my situat she had noth to add i forthwith began to model a differ convers for the ladi think from the spirit as well as moral of thi that i had been mistaken in her charact but upon turn her face toward me the spirit which had anim the repli wa fled the muscl relax and i beheld the same unprotect look of distress which first won me to her interest melancholi to see such sprightli the prey of sorrow i piti her from my soul and though it may seem ridicul enough to a torpid heart i could have taken her into my arm and cherish her though it wa in the open street without blush the pulsat of the arteri along my finger press across her told her what wa pass within me she look down a silenc of some moment follow i fear in thi interv i must have made some slight effort toward a closer compress of her hand from a subtl sensat i felt in the palm of my own not as if she wa go to withdraw her but as if she thought about it and i had infal lost it a second time had not instinct more than reason direct me to the last resourc in these danger to hold it loos and in a manner as if i wa everi moment go to releas it of myself so she let it continu till monsieur dessein return with the key and in the mean time i set myself to consid how i should undo the ill impress which the poor monk stori in case he had told it her must have plant in her breast against me the snuff box calai the good old monk wa within six pace of us as the idea of him cross my mind and wa advanc toward us a littl out of the line as if uncertain whether he should break in upon us or no he stop howev as soon as he came up to us with a world of frank and have a horn snuff box in hi hand he present it open to me you shall tast mine said i pull out my box which wa a small tortois one and put it into hi hand it is most excel said the monk then do me the favor i repli to accept of the box and all and when you take a pinch out of it sometim recollect it wa the peac offer of a man who onc use you unkindli but not from hi heart the poor monk blush as red as scarlet mon dieu said he press hi hand togeth you never use me unkindli i should think said the ladi he is not like i blush in my turn but from what movement i leav to the few who feel to analyz excus me madam repli i i treat him most unkindli and from no provoc it is imposs said the ladi my god cri the monk with a warmth of assever which seem not to belong to him the fault wa in me and in the indiscret of my zeal the ladi oppos it and i join with her in maintain it wa imposs that a spirit so regul as hi could give offens to ani i knew not that content could be render so sweet and pleasur a thing to the nerv as i then felt it we remain silent without ani sensat of that foolish pain which take place when in such a circl you look for ten minut in one anoth face without say a word whilst thi last the monk rub hi horn box upon the sleev of hi tunick and as soon as it had acquir a littl air of bright by the friction he made a low bow and said twa too late to say whether it wa the weak or good of our temper which had involv us in thi contest but be it as it would he beg we might exchang box in say thi he present hi to me with one hand as he took mine from me in the other and have kiss it with a stream of good natur in hi eye he put it into hi bosom and took hi leav i guard thi box as i would the instrument part of my religion to help my mind on to someth better in truth i seldom go abroad without it and often and mani a time have i call up by it the courteou spirit of it owner to regul my own in the justl of the world they had found full employ for hi as i learnt from hi stori till about the fortyfifth year of hi age when upon some militari servic ill requit and meet at the same time with a disappoint in the tenderest of passion he abandon the sword and the sex togeth and took sanctuari not so much in hi convent as in himself i feel a damp upon my spirit as i am go to add that in my last return through calai upon inquir after father lorenzo i heard he had been dead near three month and wa buri not in hi convent but accord to hi desir in a littl cimetieri belong to it about two leagu off i had a strong desir to see where they had laid him when upon pull

tear but i am as weak as a woman and i beg the world not to smile but piti me the remis door calai i had never quit the ladi hand all thi time and had held it so long that it would have been indec to have let it go without first press it to my lip the blood and spirit which had suffer a revuls from her crowd back to her as i did it now the two travel who had spoke to me in the coachyard happen at that crisi to be pass by and observ our commun natur took it into their head that we must be man and wife at least so stop as soon as they came up to the door of the remis the one of them who wa the inquisit travel ask us if we set out for pari the next morn i could onli answer for myself i said and the ladi ad she wa for amien we dine there yesterday said the simpl travel you go directli through

the ladi but she had glide off unperceiv as the caus wa plead and had made ten or a dozen pace down the street by the time i had made the determin so i set off after her with a long stride to make her the propos with the best address i wa master of but observ she walk with her cheek half rest upon the palm of her hand with the slow shortmeasurd step of thought and with her eye as she went step by step fix upon the ground it struck me she wa tri the same caus herself god help her said i she ha some motherinlaw or tartufish aunt or nonsens old woman to consult upon the occas as well as myself so not care to interrupt the process and deem it more gallant to take her at discret than by surpris i face about and took a short turn or two befor the door of the remis whilst she walk muse on one side in the street calai have on first sight of the ladi settl the affair in my fanci that she wa of the better order of be and then laid it down as a second axiom as indisput as the first that she wa a widow and wore a charact of distress i went no further i got ground enough for the situat which pleas me and had she remain close besid my elbow till midnight i should have held true to my system and consid her onli under that gener idea she had scarc got twenti pace distant from me ere someth within me call out for a more particular inquiri it brought on the idea of a further separ i might possibl never see her more the heart is for save what it can and i want the trace through which my wish might find their way to her in case i should never rejoin her myself in a word i wish to know her name her famili her condit and as i knew the place to which she wa go i want to know from whenc she came but there wa no come at all thi intellig a hundr littl delicaci stood in the way i form a score differ plan there wa no such thing as a man ask her directli the thing wa imposs a littl french debonair captain who came danc down the street show me it wa the easiest thing in the world for pop in betwixt us just as the ladi wa return back to the door of the remis he introduc himself to my acquaint and befor he had well got announc beg i would do him the honor to present him to the ladi i had not been present myself so turn about to her he did it just as well by ask her if she had come from pari no she wa go that rout she said vou netez pa de londr she wa not she repli then madam must have come through flander apparam vou etez flammand said the french captain the ladi answer she wa peutetr de lisl ad he she said she wa not of lisl nor arra nor cambray nor ghent nor brussel she answer she wa of brussel he had had the honor he said to be at the bombard of it last war that it wa fine situat pour cela and full of nobless when the imperialist were driven out by the french the ladi made a slight curtsi so give her an account of the affair and of the share he had had in it he beg the honor to know her name so made hi bow et madam a son mari said he look back when he had made two step and without stay for an answer danc down the street had i serv seven year apprenticeship to good breed i could not have done as much the remis calai as the littl french captain left us mon dessein came up with the key of the remis in hi hand and forthwith let us into hi magazin of chais the first object which caught my eye as mon dessein open the door of the remis wa anoth old tatter desoblig and notwithstand it wa the exact pictur of that which had hit my fanci so much in the coachyard but an hour befor the veri sight of it stir up a disagre sensat within me now and i thought twa a churlish beast into whose heart the idea could first enter to construct such a machin nor had i much more chariti for the man who could think of use it i observ the ladi wa as littl taken with it as myself so mon dessein led us on to a coupl of chais which stood abreast tell us as he recommend them that they had been purchas by my lord a and b to go the grand tour but had gone no further than pari so were in all respect as good as new they were too good so i pass on to a third which stood behind and forthwith began to chaffer for the price but twill scarc hold two said i open the door and get in have the good madam said mon dessein offer hi arm to step in the ladi hesit half a second and step in and the waiter that moment beckon to speak to mon dessein he shut the door of the chais upon us and left us the remis calai cest bien comiqu it is veri droll said the ladi smile from the reflect that thi wa the second time we had been left togeth by a parcel of nonsens conting cest bien comiqu said she there want noth said i to make it so but the comic use which the gallantri of a frenchman would put it to to make love the first moment and an offer of hi person the second it is their fort repli the ladi it is suppos so at least and how it ha come to pass continu i i know not but they have certainli got the credit of understand more of love and make it better than ani other nation upon earth but for my own part i think them errant bungler and in truth the worst set of marksmen that ever tri cupid patienc to think of make love by sentiment i should as soon think of make a genteel suit of cloth out of remnant and to do it pop at first sight by declar is submit the offer and themselv with it to be sift with all their pour and contr by an unheat mind the ladi attend as if she expect i should go on consid then madam continu i lay my hand upon her that grave peopl hate love for the name sake that selfish peopl hate it for their own hypocrit for heaven and that all of us both old and young be ten time wors frighten than hurt by the veri report what a want of knowledg in thi branch of commerc a man betray whoever let the word come out of hi lip till an hour or two at least after the time that hi silenc upon it becom torment a cours of small quiet attent not so point as to alarm nor so vagu as to be misunderstood with now and then a look of kind and littl or noth said upon it leav natur for your mistress and she fashion it to her mind then i solemnli declar said the ladi blush you have been make love to me all thi while the remis calai monsieur dessein came back to let us out of the chais and acquaint the ladi the count de l her brother wa just arriv at the hotel though i had infinit good will for the ladi i can not say that i rejoic in my heart at the event and could not help tell her so for it is fatal to a propos madam said i that i wa go to make you you need not tell me what the propos wa said she lay her hand upon both mine as she interrupt me a man my good sir ha seldom an offer of kind to maketo a woman but she ha a presenti of it some moment befor natur arm her with it said i for immedi preserv but i think said she look in my face i had no evil to apprehend and to deal frankli with you had determin to accept it if i had she stop a moment i believ your good will would have drawn a stori from me which would have made piti the onli danger thing in the journey in say thi she suffer me to kiss her hand twice and with a look of sensibl mix with a concern she got out of the chais and bid adieu in the street calai i never finish a twelveguinea bargain so expediti in my life my time seem heavi upon the loss of the ladi and know everi moment of it would be as two till i put myself into motion i order post hors directli and walk toward the hotel lord said i hear the town clock strike four and recollect that i had been littl more than a singl hour in calai what a larg volum of adventur may be grasp within thi littl span of

not turn out someth anoth will no matter it is an assay upon human natur i get my labor for my pain it is enough the pleasur of the experi ha kept my sens and the best part of my blood awak and laid the gross to sleep i piti the man who can travel from dan to beersheba and cri it is all barren and so it is and so is all the world to him who will not cultiv the fruit it offer i declar said i clap my hand chearili togeth that wa i in a desert i would find out wherewith in it to call forth my affect if i could not do better i would fasten them upon some sweet myrtl or seek some melancholi cypress to connect myself to i would court their shade and greet them kindli for their protect i would cut my name upon them and swear they were the loveliest tree throughout the desert if their leav wither i would teach myself to mourn and when they rejoic i would rejoic along with them the learn smelfungu travel from boulogn to pari from pari to rome and so on but he set out with the spleen and jaundic and everi object he pafsd by wa discolor or distort he wrote an account of them buttwa noth but the account of hi miser feel i met smelfungu in the grand portico of the pantheon he wa just come out of it it is noth but a huge cockpit vide ss travel said he i wish you had said noth wors of the venu of medici repli i for in pass through florenc i had heard he had fallen foul upon the goddess and use her wors than a common strumpet without the least provoc in natur i poppd upon smelfungu again at turin in hi return home and a sad tale of sorrow adventur had he to tell wherein he spoke of move accid by flood and field and of the cannib which each other eat the anthropophagi he had been flay aliv and bedevild and use wors than st bartholomew at everi stage he had come at i will tell it cri smelfungu to the world you had better tell it said i to your physician mundungu with an immens fortun made the whole tour go on from rome to napl from napl to venic from venic to vienna to dresden to berlin without one gener connect or pleasur anecdot to tell of but he had travel straight on look neither to hi right hand or hi left lest love or piti should seduc him out of hi road peac be to them if it is to be found but heaven itself wa it possibl to get there with such temper would want object to give it everi gentl spirit would come fli upon the wing of love to hail their arriv noth would the soul of smelfungu and mundungu hear of but fresh anthem of joy fresh raptur of love and fresh congratul of their common felic i heartili piti them they have brought up no faculti for thi work and wa the happiest mansion in heaven to be allot to smelfungu and mundungu they would be so far from be happi that the soul of smelfungu and mundungu would do penanc there to all etern montriul i had onc lost my portmanteau from behind my chais and twice got out in the rain and one of the time up to the knee in dirt to help the postilion to tie it on without be abl to find out what wa want nor wa it till i got to montriul upon the landlord ask me if i want not a servant that it occur to me that that wa the veri thing a servant that i do most sadli quoth i becaus monsieur said the landlord there is a clever young fellow who would be veri proud of the honor to serv an englishman but whi an english one more than ani other they are so gener said the landlord i will be shot if thi is not a livr out of my pocket quoth i to myself thi veri night but they have wherewith to be so monsieur ad he set down one livr more for that quoth i it wa but last night said the landlord quun my lord angloi presentoit un ecu a la fill de chamber tant pi pour madll janaton said i now janaton be the landlord daughter and the landlord suppos i wa young in french took the liberti to inform me i should not have said tant pi but tant mieux tant mieux toujour monsieur said he when there is ani thing to be got tant pi when there is noth it come to the same thing said i pardonnez moi said the landlord i can not take a fitter opportun to observ onc for all that tant pi and tant mieux be two of the great hing in french convers a stranger would do well to set himself right in the use of them befor he get to pari a prompt french marqui at our ambassador tabl demand of mr h if he wa h the poet no said h mildli tant pi repli the marqui it is h the historian said anoth tant mieux said the marqui and mr h who is a man of an excel heart return thank for both when the landlord had set me right in thi matter he call in la fleur which wa the name of the young man he had spoke of say onli first that as for hi talent he would presum to say noth monsieur wa the best judg what would suit him but for the fidel of la fleur he would stand respons in all he wa worth the landlord deliv thi in a manner which instantli set my mind to the busi i wa upon and la fleur who stood wait without in that breathless expect which everi son of natur of us have felt in our turn came in montriul i am apt to be taken with all kind of peopl at first sight but never more so than when a poor devil come to offer hi servic to so poor a devil as myself and as i know thi weak i alway suffer my judgment to draw back someth on that veri account and thi more or less accord to the mood i am in and the case and i may add the gender too of the person i am to govern when la fleur enter the room after everi discount i could make for my soul the genuin look and air of the fellow determin the matter at onc in hi favor so i hire him first and then began to inquir what he could do but i shall find out hi talent quoth i as i want them besid a frenchman can do everi thing now poor la fleur could do noth in the world but beat a drum and play a march or two upon the fife i wa determin to make hi talent do and can not say my weak wa ever so insult by my wisdom as in the attempt la fleur had set out earli in life as gallantli as most frenchmen do with serv for a few year at the end of which have satisfi the sentiment and found moreov that the honor of beat a drum wa like to be it own reward as it open no further track of glori to him he retir a se terr and live comm il plaisoit a dieu that is to say upon noth and so quoth wisdom you have hire a drummer to attend you in thi tour of your through franc and itali psha said i and do not one half of our gentri go with a humdrum compagnon du voyag the same round and have the piper and the devil and all to pay besid when man can extric himself with an equivoqu in such an unequ match he is not ill of but you can do someth els la fleur said i o quoui he could make spatterdash and play a littl upon the fiddl bravo said wisdom whi i play a bass myself said i we shall do veri well you can shave and dress a wig a littl la fleur he had all the disposit in the world it is enough for heaven said i interrupt him and ought to be enough for me so supper come in and have a friski english spaniel on one side of my chair and a french valet with as much hilar in hi counten as ever natur paint in one on the other i wa satisfi to my heart content with my empir and if monarch knew what they would be at they might be as satisfi as i wa montriul as la fleur went the whole tour of franc and itali with me and will be often upon the stage i must interest the reader a littl further in hi behalf by say that i had never less reason to repent of the impuls which gener do determin me than in regard to thi fellow he wa a faith affection simpl soul as ever trudg after the heel of a philosoph and notwithstand hi talent of drumbeat and spatterdashmak which though veri good in themselv happen to be of no great servic to me yet wa i hourli recompens by the festiv of hi temper it suppli all defect i had a constant resourc in hi look in all difficulti and distress of my own i wa go to have ad of hi too but la fleur wa out of the reach of everi thing for whether twa hunger or thirst or cold or naked or watch or whatev stripe of ill luck la fleur met with in our journey there wa no index in hi physiognomi to point them out by he wa etern the same so that if i am a piec of a philosoph which satan now and then put it into my head i am it alway mortifi the pride of the conceit by reflect how much i owe to the complexion philosophi of thi poor fellow for shame me into one of a better kind with all thi la fleur had a small cast of the coxcomb but he seem at first sight to be more a coxcomb of natur than of art and befor i had been three day in pari with him he seem to be no coxcomb at all montriul the next morn la fleur enter upon hi employ i deliv to him the key of my portmanteau with an inventori of my half a dozen shirt and silk pair of breech and bid him fasten all upon the chais get the hors put to and desir the landlord to come in with hi bill cest un garcon de bonn fortun said the landlord point through the window to half a dozen wench who had got round about la fleur and were most kindli take their leav of him as the postilion wa lead out the hors la fleur kiss all their hand round and round again and thrice he wipe hi eye and thrice he promis he would bring them all pardon from rome the young fellow said the landlord is belov by all the town and there is scarc a corner in montriul where the want of him will not be felt he ha but one misfortun in the world continu he he is alway in love i am heartili glad of it said i twill save me the troubl everi night of put my breech under my head in say thi i wa make not so much la fleur elog as my own have been in love with one princess or anoth almost all my life and i hope i shall go on so till i die be firmli persuad that if ever i do a mean action it must be in some interv betwixt one passion and anoth whilst thi interregnum last i alway perceiv my heart lock up i can scarc find in it to give miseri a sixpenc and therefor i alway get out of it as fast as i can and the moment i am rekindl i am all generos and good will again and would do ani thing in the world either for or with ani one if they will but satisfi me there is no sin in it but in say thi sure i am commend the passion not myself a fragment the town of abdera notwithstand democritu live there tri all the power of ironi and laughter to reclaim it wa the vilest and most proflig town in all thrace what for poison conspiraci and assassin libel pasquinad and tumult there wa no go there by day twa wors by night now when thing were at the worst it came to pass that the andromeda of euripid be repres at abdera the whole orchestra wa delight with it but of all the passag which delight them noth oper more upon their imagin than the tender stroke of natur which the poet had wrought up in that pathet speech of perseu o cupid princ of god and men etc everi man almost spoke pure iambic the next day and talk of noth but perseu hi pathet address o cupid princ of god and men in everi street of abdera in everi hous o cupid cupid in everi mouth like the natur note of some sweet melodi which drop from it whether it will or no noth but cupid cupid princ of god and men the fire caught and the whole citi like the heart of one man open itself to love no pharmacopolist could sell one grain of helebor not a singl armour had a heart to forg one instrument of death friendship and virtu met togeth and kiss each other in the street the golden age return and hung over the town of abdera everi abderit took hi oaten pipe and everi abderitish woman left her purpl web and chast sat her down and listen to the song twa onli in the power say the fragment of the god whose empir extend from heaven to earth and even to the depth of the sea to have done thi montriul when all is readi and everi articl is disput and paid for in the inn unless you are a littl sourd by the adventur there is alway a matter to compound at the door befor you can get into your chais and that is with the son and daughter of poverti who surround you let no man say let them go to the devil it is a cruel journey to send a few miser and they have had suffer enough without it i alway think it better to take a few sou out in my hand and i would counsel everi gentl travel to do so likewis he need not be so exact in set down hi motiv for give them they will be regist elsewher for my own part there is no man give so littl as i do for few that i know have so littl to give but as thi wa the first public act of my chariti in franc i took the more notic of it a wellaway said i i have but eight sou in the world show them in my hand and there are eight poor men and eight poor women for em a poor tatter soul without a shirt on instantli withdrew hi claim by retir two step out of the circl and make a disqualifi bow on hi part had the whole parterr cri out place aux dame with one voic it would not have convey the sentiment of a defer for the sex with half the effect just heaven for what wise reason have thou order it that beggari and urban which are at such varianc in other countri should find a way to be at uniti in thi i insist upon present him with a singl sou mere for hi politess a poor littl dwarfish brisk fellow who stood over against me in the circl put someth first under hi arm which had onc been a hat took hi snuff box out of hi pocket and gener offer a pinch on both side of him it wa a gift of consequ and modestli declin the poor littl fellow press it upon them with a nod of welcom prenez en prenez said he look anoth way so they each took a pinch piti thi box should ever want one said i to myself so i put a coupl of sou into it take a small pinch out of hi box to enhanc their valu as i did it he felt the weight of the second oblig more than that of the first twa do him an honor the other wa onli do him a chariti and he made me a bow down to the ground for it here said i to an old soldier with one hand who had been campaignd and worn out to death in the servic here is a coupl of sou for thee vive le roi said the old soldier i had then but three sou left so i gave one simpli pour lamour de dieu which wa the foot on which it wa beg the poor woman had a disloc hip so it could not be well upon ani other motiv mon cher et tre charit monsieur there is no oppos thi said i my lord angloi the veri sound wa worth the money so i gave my last sou for it but in the eager of give i had overlook a pauvr honteux who had no one to ask a sou for him and who i believ would have perish ere he could have ask one for himself he stood by the chais a littl without the circl and wipe a tear from a face which i thought had seen better day good god said i and i have not one singl sou left to give him but you have a thousand cri all the power of natur stir within me so i gave him no matter what i am asham to say how much now and wa asham to think how littl then so if the reader can form ani conjectur of my disposit as these two fix point are given him he may judg within a livr or two what wa the precis sum i could afford noth for the rest but dieu vou beniss et le bon dieu vou beniss encor said the old soldier the dwarf etc the pauvr honteux could say noth he pull out a littl handkerchief and wipe hi face as he turn away and i thought he thank me more than them all the bidet have settl all these littl matter i got into my postchais with more eas than ever i got into a postchais in my life and la fleur have got one larg jackboot on the far side of a littl bidet post hors and anoth on thi for i count noth of hi leg he canterd away befor me as happi and as perpendicular as a princ but what is happi what is grandeur in thi paint scene of life a dead ass befor we had got a leagu put a sudden stop to la fleur career hi bidet would not pass by it a content aros betwixt them and the poor fellow wa kick out of hi jackboot the veri first kick la fleur bore hi fall like a french christian say neither more or less upon it than diabl so present got up and came to the charg again astrid hi bidet beat him up to it as he would have beat hi drum the bidet flew from one side of the road to the other then back again then thi way then that way and in short everi way but by the dead ass la fleur insist upon the thing and the bidet threw him what is the matter la fleur said i with thi bidet of thine monsieur said he cest un cheval le plu opiniatr du mond nay if he is a conceit beast he must go hi own way repli i so la fleur got off him and give him a good sound lash the bidet took me at my word and away he scamperd back to montriul pest said la fleur it is not mal a propo to take notic here that though la fleur avail himself but of two differ term of exclam in thi encount name diabl and pest that there are nevertheless three in the french languag like the posit compar and superl one or the other of which serv for everi unexpect throw of the dice in life le diabl which is the first and posit degre is gener use upon ordinari emot of the mind where small thing onli fall out contrari to your expect such as the throw onc doublet la fleur be kick off hi hors and so forth cuckoldom for the same reason is alway le diabl but in case where the cast ha someth provok in it as in that of the bidet run away after and leav la fleur aground in jackboot it is the second degre it is then pest and for the third but here my heart is wrung with piti and fellowfeel when i reflect what miseri must have been their lot and how bitterli so refin a peopl must have smart to have forc them upon the use of it grant me o ye power which touch the tongu with eloqu in distress whatev is my cast grant me but decent word to exclaim in and i will give my natur way but as these were not to be had in franc i resolv to take everi evil just as it befel me without ani exclam at all la fleur who had made no such coven with himself follow the bidet with hi eye till it wa got out of sight and then you may imagin if you pleas with what word he close the whole affair as there wa no hunt down a frighten hors in jackboot there remain no altern but take la fleur either behind the chais or into it i prefer the latter and in half an hour we got to the post hous at nampont nampont the dead ass and thi said he put the remain of a crust into hi wallet and thi should have been thi portion said he had thou been aliv to have share it with me i thought by the accent it had been an apostroph to hi child but twa to hi ass and to the veri ass we had seen dead in the road which had occas la fleur misadventur the man seem to lament it much and it instantli brought into my mind sancho lament for hi but he did it with more true touch of natur the mourner wa sit upon a stone bench at the door with the asss panel and it bridl on one side which he took up from time to time then laid them down look at them and shook hi head he then took hi crust of bread out of hi wallet again as if to eat it held it some time in hi hand then laid it upon the bit of hi asss bridl look wist at
