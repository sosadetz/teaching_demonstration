make the most astonish sacrific to the glori of their countri they becam civil tyrant and prey on the veri societi for whose welfar it wa easier to die than to practis the sober duti of life which

their monster to cope with will labour to establish such ration law throughout the world that men will not rest in the dead letter or becom artifici be as they becom civil we must get entir clear of all the notion drawn from the wild tradit of origin sin the eat of the appl the theft of prometheu the open of pandora box and the other fabl too tediou to enumer on which priest have erect their tremend structur of imposit to persuad us that we are natur inclin to evil we shall then leav room for the expans of the human heart and i trust find that men will insens render each other happier as they grow wiser it is inde the necess of stifl mani of it most spontan desir to obtain the factiti virtu of societi that make man viciou by depriv him of that digniti of charact which rest onli on truth for it is not paradox to assert that the social virtu are nipt in the bud by the veri law of societi one princip of action is sufficient—respect thyself—wheth it be term fear of god—religion love of justice—mor or selflove—th desir of happi yet how can a man respect himself and if not how believ in the exist of virtu when he is practis the daili shift which do not come under the cognis of the law in order to obtain a respect situat in life it seem in fact to be the busi of a civil man to harden hi heart that on it he may sharpen the wit which assum the appel of sagac or cun in differ charact is onli a proof that the head is clear becaus the heart is cold besid one great caus of miseri in the present imperfect state of societi is that the imagin continu tantal becom the inflat wen

to submit to a kind of selfdeni which ignor not moral prescrib but these evil are pass away a new spirit ha gone forth to organis the bodypolit and where is the criterion to be found to estim the mean

civil can onli go as far as it ha hitherto gone and then must necessarili fall back into barbar yet thu much appear certain that a state will infal grow old and feebl if hereditari rich support hereditari rank under ani descript but when court and primogenitur are done away and simpl equal law are establish what is to prevent each gener from retain the vigour of youth—what can weaken the bodi or mind when the great major of societi must exercis both to earn a subsist and acquir respect the french revolut is a strong proof how far thing will govern men when simpl principl begin to act with one power spring against the complic wheel of ignor numer in proport to their weak and constantli want repair becaus expedi of the moment are ever the spawn of cowardli folli or the narrow calcul
