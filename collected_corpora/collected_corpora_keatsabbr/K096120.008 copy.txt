accompani him tell us that though mani of the hous are support on one side by the hill number were fallen down and the greatest part in ruin it is hardli possibl to describ the miseri which thi place suffer about four year befor when nadir shah the persian king came in person against the lesge tartar we saw a specimen of it say he by the carcas of hors and other anim which wa suffer to remain in

the prophet daniel it wa formerli best known by the name of ecbatana and wa then in the greatest splendour the ancient say it wa mile about and had wall cubit high and broad but there is now littl or noth left either of the wall or palac howev tauri is still a consider town be five mile round popul and a place of great trade the inhabit amount to about tauri like most other citi in persia stand in

judgment of the rest i will proceed therefor to mention tefli which is the capit of georgia and suppos to be the acropoli of the ancient which wa taken by pompey but under the dominion of the persian though inhabit chiefli by christian there be christian church and not one mahomedan mosqu except that in the castl which stand on an emin in the center it is a bishop see and ha a handsom cathedr

to let those of their ancestor drop and erect new one for themselv through a superstiti opinion that if the person who inhabit a hous wa in their conceit unlucki the next inhabit of the hous will be unlucki also the best hous are built of stone brought from the island of kishe or larrak but they are gener built of brick sundri they have sometim two stori and a wooden contriv to strike the wind down into the lower room these machin are about feet high and look like tower the hous belong to the english and dutch east india compani are as well built as ani in the town but the english factor

extend to the wall of the citi the bank of the river on each side are veri fertil and pleasant their field produc corn puls rice and sever european fruit and the countri round abound in game have mention the princip citi in exist i will mention one now in ruin but for it antiqu and grandeur better worth a descript than ani we have dwelt on thi is the famou citi of persepoli where are found the noblest ruin of an ancient palac or templ that are now to be seen on the face of the earth even rome itself they say is noth compar with these vener remain of antiqu the place at thi day is call chilmanar or forti pillar it is situat about mile northeast of shirauz it is seat at the foot of a mountain at the northeast end of that spaciou plain where persepoli onc stood and gener held to be part of the palac of dariu who wa conquer by alexand the great it stand on a rise ground and the adjoin mountain encircl it in form of an amphitheatr we ascend to the pillar by a grand flight of step of blue stone in number feet in length and inch broad so that a hors may easili go up or down them mr herbert say it wa built upon a mountain of dark color marbl and the step hew out of the solid rock but those who have view it more accur sinc observ that the step are compos of larg stone fifteen or sixteen feet long and of such a thick that six or seven step are cut out of one stone and the whole be so artifici join that they appear to be but one piec the staircas divid as you ascend one flight wind to the right and the other to the left have a wall on each side and a ballustrad on the other afterward both flight or branch turn again and end at a squar landingplac from whenc you go into a portico of white marbl feet wide on it are carv in basso relievo two beast as larg as eleph but their

are masterli piec of masonri their pedest are curious work and appear littl injur by the hand of time the shaft are flute to the top and the capit are adorn with a profus of friezework from thi hall we proceed eastward till we arriv at the remain of a larg squar build to which we enter through a door of granit most of the door and window of thi apart are still stand they are of black marbl and

these nobl ruin indic their former grandeur truli worthi of be the resid of a great and power monarch and whilst view them the mind becom impress with an aw solemn when we consid the celebr of thi vast empir onc the patron of the art and scienc and the seat of a wise and flourish govern when we reflect on the variou chang and revolut it ha undergon at one period a field for the dare ambit of an alexand at anoth for the enthusiasm of an omar we must feel the strongest convict of the mutabl of all human event there are the remain of other build reach up the side of the mountain equal magnific and beauti in their ruin with human figur cut on the wall carri bow and arrow and spear in their hand all of them with cap in the form of turret which wa the mode of headdress among the ancient mede sir john chardin and mr le brun have given it as their opinion that thi place wa the sepultur of the ancient king of persia the modern nativ call thi place the assembl of king gemshe and say that princ use to visit it with the nobl and great men of hi court in order to enjoy a delight view of the adjac countri of which there can not be a finer prospect than from henc in anoth place close by we ascend by a stone staircais into a magnific court of a quadrangular form sever pedest of pillar and the remain of two grand portal all of granit are still visibl and the cornic of the portal are perfect on mani of the broken piec of the pillar are ancient inscript in sever part of thi palac are stone aqueduct cut under ground eight feet deep and a half broad made with a design to carri off the water run down from the mountain these vener ruin have suffer much from the ravag of time but what still remain of them are as hard and durabl as the soil they stand on they are cover with inscript mr niebur ha given them all in hi second volum most elegantli and accur copi but the most learn and best acquaint with the eastern languag have been baffl in everi attempt to make out their mean it is one of the most consider difficulti to solv when and by whom thi palac wa origin built the grecian historian have given veri imperfect account of it and the persian no less so by the present nativ mr franklin say the place is call tukht gemshe or the throne of king gemsh who they affirm built it between three and four thousand year ago it is relat in grecian histori that alexand the great set fire to and destroy the whole citi of persepoli the noblest and wealthiest citi in the world with thi rich and splendid palac about the year of the world or year befor christ instig to it in a fit of debaucheri by the celebr courtezan thai the athenian in reveng for the town the persian emperor had stroy in greec but thi stori say mr franklin though it ha the sanction of histori if we reflect on what still remain of these ruin ani one on view them would suppos such an event imposs to have taken place he might have burn the citi but of such a natur are the remain of the palac that all the fire that could be appli to them would not make the smallest impress on these huge mass of stone equal in point of durabl and hard to the solid rock it is to be remark that in the figur throughout the whole of the palac the rule of art are not attend to the muscl of the figur are want yet the draperi is fine done and the proport in gener are well kept up though the contour is onli observ which give a same to the whole sir john chardin say whoever wa the architect wa ignor of grecian and of roman architectur and suppos the defect i have mention were occas by finish the work in a hurri but on the other hand it is more natur to conceiv the work altogeth to have been the ne plu ultra of those day as the ornament of the palac of shirauz are in the same style as these at persepoli and as the architectur of the present persian is similar to that of ancient time the materi of which the ruin consist are chiefli hard blue stone but the door and window of the apart are all of black marbl and so beauti and highli polish that we may see our face in them one of the princip thing worthi admir is the immens strength of the foundat the whole of the palac take in a circumfer of squar yard the front is pace from north to south and from east to west the height of the foundat in front is in sever part from to feet and consist of two immens stone laid togeth it is much to be fear that in the cours of a few centuri earthquak may destroy the column and remain apart but whatev may be their fate the foundat must endur until the rock on which it is built shall ceas to exist chap iv of the peopl the modern persian are in mani respect a handsom peopl they are person men of a good statur wellshap cleanlimb and of agreeabl featur and in georgia and the northern provinc of an admir fair complexion toward the south they are a littl upon the oliv they are also robust warlik and hardi and are now all becom soldier their eye and their hair are gener black in most part of the countri the men shave their head veri close but the young men have often a lock on each templ their cheek are shave but the beard on their chin reach up to their templ their priest and religi men wear their beard long onli clip them into form and the common peopl cut their pretti short but none suffer ani hair to grow on their bodi most of the men have clothcap which rise ten or twelv inch and termin at the top in four corner they wear a shorter cap in summer face with gray bucharian lambskin their ear which are veri larg are alway left bae and gener hang down owe to the weight of their cap and mani are proud to show that their ear are not cut off crimson is a color they much affect in their cap as well as in their outward garment and it make a grand appear deep persian blue is the color of their mourn the better sort of peopl wear a sack of kermania wool wrap about their head as turban some of these are so exceed fine as to cost crown l english and the common price for such as are good is eight or ten crown and their sash cost from l to l each their head are thu kept veri warm and the more so as they seldom pull off their cap but wear them even in the presenc of their king next their skin they wear a shirt if it may be so call of color silk or callico gener blue or chequer which they wear out without ever wash it thi shirt ha an open bosom without neck or wristband and is made close to the arm they have a pair of drawer or trowser close befor which reach half down their leg their stock are made of woollen cloth but not at all shape to the leg sit loos like boot but in gener they onli wear woollen trowser which reach over the ancl over the shirt they wear a waistcoat and upon these they wear a coat with close sleev and button and loop befor tie with a sash thi coat is wide at bottom and hang like a bell or hoop a littl below their knee besid they put or frequent anoth coat without sleev the upper coat be the shortest and in the wintertim over all they wear anoth coat line with fur these furcoat are as often worn for state as for warmth for it is common to see a great man sit in hi fablecoat in the midst of summer instead of shoe they have piqu slipper without quarter turn up at the to and made of turkey leather neither tie nor buckl some are made of shagreen be the skin of hors rump prepar hard and tough like seal skin and with such high heel that though they are calcul to carri them out of the dirt are extrem uneafi to those who are not accustom to them when they ride they have boot of yellow leather their bridl saddl and hous are immoder fine the last be a cloth of gold and so larg as almost to hide the hindquart of the hors the outer garment of the common peopl is a slight cotton in gener they wear two or three light vestment and reach onli to their knee it give them a great advantag over the turk who wear long effemin robe silk is worn in summer by men of distinct especi for undergar and these as well as their cotton and woollen undergar are quilt of cours warm and light under the sash round the waist they carri a long point knife mount with gold or silver and sheath and thi whether on foot or on horseback ladi they say do the same writer carri their pen and ink about them the women about shirauz have at all time been celebr over those of other part of persia for their beauti and not without reason they are tall and wellshap but their bright and sparkl eye is a strike beauti thi howev is in a great measur owe to art for they rub their eyebrow and eyelid with the black flower of antimoni which add an incompar brillianc to their natur luster as the women in mahomedan countri are down to the meanest cover with a veil from head to foot a sight is never to be obtain of them in the street but live as mr franklin did in the famili of a persian he had mani opportun of see them unveil the femal say hanway who do not labor in the field are seldom seen abroad except in a morn befor the sun rise and then they are cover with veil which reach to their feet when they travel on horseback everi ladi of distinct is not onli veil but ha gener a servant who run or ride befor her to clear the way and on such occas the men even in the marketplac alway turn their back till the women are past it be deem the highest ill manner to look at them the care which they take to conceal their face to avoid the imput of act indel and contrari to custom ha made so strong an impress on them that if a woman wa accident surpris she would show her whole person rather than her face the dress of the women is simpl differ from the men rather for the distinct of sex than otherwis they wear neither turban on the head nor sash about their waist and their coat or vest reach almost down to their heel they adorn their arm with bracelet and their head with jewel of sever kind one of these is compos of a light gold chainwork set with small pearl with a thin goldplat pendant about the size of a crownpiec on which is engrav an arabian prayer thi is fix to the hair at the upper part of the templ and hang upon the cheek below the ear or is bound round the arm they have larg ear and some border on india wear gold ring set with pearl in their nostril the poorer sort wear the same thing in baser metal their hair hang in tress fall down the back their shirt as well as the men are of a thin manufactur of silk and cotton but these are open at the breast in the manner of men shirt in europ whilst the men are support on the left shoulder by a small button the women also wear drawer and slipper as the men some girl wear a stiffen cap upon their head turn up befor like a hunt cap with a heron feather in it neither men nor women wear glove but their finger are full of ring as their arm are of bracelet they wear necklac of gold or pearl hang down on the bosom with a locket full of perfum as black hair and larg black eye are most common so are they most in esteem and the thickest and broadest eyebrow are thought the finest the women if their eyebrow be not black will as i have observ color them and are accustom to paint their face and rub their hand and feet with hannay a kind of orangecolour pomatum as the cloth both of the men and women are of the richest flower and brocad silk it appear that dress is no inconsider articl in persia particularli as person of small fortun endeavor to vie with their superior and will have fine cloth though they want food those who wear sabl which they will not be without if they can purchas them seldom pay less than an hundr pound for a closebodi coat all thi with the rich trap of their hors when they ride which they do almost everi day if they go but a stone throw must amount to a vast sum and thi keep them poor howev as there are no where more person men finer hors or richer equipag the persian are allow to make as splendid a figur as ani peopl whatev poverti may prey on them at home but they are load with gold and jewel abroad and as they have alway a clear sunshin and bright heaven these cast a more than ordinari luster on their person and their fineri is set off to the greatest advantag in point of dress the persian differ remark from the turk for in turkey ani person who is not a seiud or descend of the prophet wear the least green upon hi garment would most probabl be stone wherea in persia green is the gener and favorit color even to their shoe a turk also think himself defil by the touch of a christian even on hi garment the persian on the contrari will eat out of the same plate drink out of the same cup and smoke out of the same calean the persian in their disposit say mr franklin are much inclin to sudden anger are quick fieri and veri sensibl of affront which they resent on the spot but they are not vindict and yet if their kind to their best friend happen to be turn by the fortun of war into enmiti they often becom insens thi seem to be more owe to a custom of cruelti than a reveng disposit on the other hand there are not mani instanc of the placabl temper which the christian religion so strongli recommend in theori howev they are friend to thi virtu and appar exceed the christian in the duti of resign they are of a sedentari turn and delight in sit still and muse i never found ani of them say hanway walk in their apart as the english often do a turk be on board an english man of war enquir veri serious if the peopl were troubl with an evil spirit becaus say he they are never at rest the persian are certainli a brave and courag peopl but their frequent war have much deprav their ancient urban of manner and introduc a strife peculiar to the lower class of peopl when two person begin fight it alway rais a great crowd who gener enter into the contest and the whole present becom a scene of tumult and confus until the arriv of the daroga or judg of the polic who put an end to the fray hospit is a part of their religion on occas of the least intercours men of ani distinct invit stranger as well as their friend to their tabl and it is remark how they pride themselv in other testimoni of respect they are natur inclin to temper and with regard to diet seem to be more in a state of natur than the european by way of amus they use opiat but not near so much as the turk the follow is their mode of live they alway rise at daybreak in order to perform their devot their first prayer is said befor sunris after which they breakfast thi consist of grape or ani other fruit of the season with a littl bread and chees made of goatsmilk they then drink a cup of veri strong coffe without milk or sugar

each other by relat stori of which they are excess fond and also of repeat passag from the work of their most favorit poet and amus themselv at variou kind of game and it is worthi of remark that when the oldest man in compani speak though poor and at the lowerend of the room he is alway attend to the fifth or last prayer is said about an hour after supper mr hanway sup onc with a man of distinct and describ it as follow supper be brought in a servant present a basin of water and a napkin hung over hi shoulder he went to everi one in the compani and pour water on their hand to wash in the courtyard stood a lamp which wa suppli with tallow and in the middl of the room upon the floor wa one larg wax candl which they snuf with scissar into a teacup of water a larg salver in form of a teaboard wa set for everi person cover with a plate of pilau in which wa a small quantiti of mincemeat mix up with fruit and spice there were also plate of comfit sever china basin of sherbet as sweet sour and other water with cake of rice and other of wheatflour on which were sprinkl the seed of poppi and other of the like natur as they esteem it an abomin to cut either bread or ani kind of meat after it is dress these cake are made thin that they may be easili broken with the hand and their meat which is gener mutton or fowl is so prepar that they divid it with their finger pork is never eaten here nor veal and beef but seldom nor do they eat hare or other anim forbidden by the jew they use no beaten pepper onli whole pepper they never salt their meat nor is salt ever brought to tabl they dress their meat and fowl the day they are kill and put by noth to be cold they sit down on the floor crossleg at their meal and a cloth is spread on the carpet in common famili the person who ha the provis befor him distribut it to the compani they use no spoon except for soup or liquid and take up their rice by hand as do the peopl in india they wash their hand befor and after meal and wipe them in their handkerchief common peopl at ispahan seldom dress their food at home but when they have shut up their shop go to an eatinghous and buy pilau for their famili it is remark of the persian that so far from shut their door at mealtim they invit all to eat that come to their hous at that time rememb to thi day the hospit of abraham and observ that had he not been of a hospit disposit he probabl had miss the honor of entertain three angel everi man may retir from an entertain without ceremoni and what they leav of meat is alway given to the poor when a person make an entertain it is usual a supper notwithstand which the guest gener come at or in the morn and spend the whole day they discours they smoke eat sweatmeat and pass away the time in a thousand amus sometim they hear heroic poem in honor of their princ sometim singingwomen are introduc who sing danc and play and show a number of antic trick to divert the compani and if ani of the guest are dispos to withdraw with ani of these danc girl they are shown into a privat room and when they return no one take ani notic of it wine they have none but their usual drink is sherbet and water cool in summertim with ice the offic of the armi will indulg with wine and other person drink under a pretens of do it for their health but the chief of what is here made is transport to neighbor countri or drank by christian in persia but they rais their spirit with opium mankind seem gener to confess that they can not sustain the care and inquietud of life without some such expedi what is tobacco but an opiat it is not the smell or tast we are enamour with but it lull men into pleas thought within an hour after they have taken a pill of opium it begin to oper and a thousand pleasant scene present themselv to their imagin they laugh they sing and say abund of droll thing like men intox with wine but when the effect of it is gone off they find their spirit exhaust and grow pensiv and melancholi till they repeat the dose and the longer they have been use to it the greater proport they must take to answer the purpos so that some take as much at one time as would destroy half a dozen european a decoct of poppyse is sold also in most citi in persia and in these hous we shall see peopl eat and talk as ridicul as men do when they are drunk if there is ani reason in the prohibit of wine it is to prevent peopl play the fool and injur their health which is as effectu done by opium as by wine in their convers the persian aim much at eleg and are perpetu repeat vers and passag from the work of their most favorit poet hafiz sadi and jami a practic univers from the highest to the lowest for those who have not the advantag of educ make shift thu to bear their part in convers by rememb what they hear they delight also in joke and quaint express and are fond of play upon each other which they sometim do with great eleg and ironi there is one thing much to be admir in their convers which is the strict attent they pay to the person speak whom they never interrupt on ani account they are so accustom in their common discours to use extravag and hyperbol compliment on the most trifl occas that it would at first inspir a stranger with an idea that everi inhabit of the place wa will to lay down hi life shed hi blood or spend hi money in hi servic and thi mode of address which in fact mean noth is practic not onli among the genteel peopl but even among the meanest artific freedom of convers is a thing total unknown here as that wall have ear is proverbi in the mouth of everi one the fear of chain which bind their bodi ha also enslav their mind and their address to men of superior rank to themselv is mark with sign of the most abject and slavish submiss while on the contrari as all men of thi stamp are they are as haughti and overbear to their inferior the persian with respect to outward behavior are certainli the parisian of the east whilst a rude and insol demeanor mark the charact of the turkish nation toward foreign and christian the behavior of the persian would on the contrari do honor to the most civil nation they are kind courteou civil and oblig to all stranger without be guid by those religi prejudic so preval in everi other mahomedan countri they are fond of enquir after the manner and custom of europ and in return veri readili afford ani inform in respect to their own countri hospit is with them so great a virtu that a man think himself highli honor if you will enter hi hous and partak of what it afford wherea go out of a hous without smoke a calean or take some refresh is a high affront they say that everi meal a stranger partak with them bring a bless on the hous the ancient persian are record to have taught their children a most exact rever for truth but the present gener are as notori for falsehood they poison with a sweetmeat in alway say what is pleas whether it be true or not franklin say they are the greatest liar in the world practic the most improb falsiti with the gravest air imagin and so far from be abash by a detect they alway endeavor to turn it off with a laugh and even confess themselv that they think there is no harm in tell a lie provid it turn out of ani benefit to themselv and they will alway in everi busi they are engag in first endeavor to bring it about by lie and knaveri which if unsuccess in those with whom they have to deal be fulli as expert as themselv they will then conclud the bargain with truth and honesti but either way to them is equal indiffer in their disposit they are cheer but rather inclin to serious than loud mirth they are veri eager to gain money and are lavish in expend it when they have furnish themselv with an equipag a hous and garden agreeabl to their wish they will rather than lay by their money lay it out in build caravansera mosqu and on other public occas insomuch that travel observ that there are no peopl in the world that take less thought for the morrow a man to whom a fortun of l shall fall will in a few month lay it out in purchas wive and slave cloth and furnitur without consid where he is to get more and in two or three month after thi will dispos of what he ha bought for present subsist thi chardin assur us he ha seen in a thousand instanc anoth charg against the persian is that they are much addict to women and the reason alleg is that they have sever wive and concubin but whether ani other peopl would not have as mani if their law permit them is a question especi if they were taught as the mahomedan are that the enjoy of women will constitut a great part of their happi in the next world as well as in thi sure those nation may with more reason be charg with lascivi who break through all restraint both civil and religi and fli at the whole sex even the wive and daughter of their most intim friend and acquaint but if it be true that the persian admir boy and that everi great man ha hi ganymed it is a crime they are justli to be detest for thi howev seem to intim that they have less respect for the fair sex than they ought and contradict the former charg the notion which the persian have imbib concern the femal world prevent their be involv in the distress of love such as lose their sens for the sake of a woman though they are betray into mani improprieti of conduct on thi account jealousi which gener prevail in the warmest climat is not unknown to the heart of a persian the nearer approach to the sun may affect mahomedan as well as christian but as in the polit countri of christendom women are gener consid on an equal with men and in persia as much inferior to them there must consequ among christian be a greater regard to conjug love the differ in religion as well as in the custom and manner of countri will hardli admit a comparison but as jealousi sometim occas the infidel of women in europ it is alway a safeguard to them in asia where they are never constitut the guardian of their own honor we find custom ha a great influenc on the manner of mankind in all countri in franc there is a more liber indulg to women than in england and yet contrari to thi rule it is beyond disput that english wive greatli exceed the french in chastiti thi i take to be owe to the natur gaieti of the french which put them more off their guard wherea a more seriou turn of mind creat an awe and keep the enemi at a distanc on the other hand in portug and other countri in the south of europ where jealousi most abound and where the least confid is repos in women there is the most incontin so that it is hard to say whether jealousi ha tend most to thi immor or thi immor establish jealousi as a kind of natur vice in short whether it is from jealousi or what other caus there is no part of the world where the women are so strictli guard as in persia even in the indi and turkey neighbor kingdom they live in freedom in comparison with these for though a husband should have the greatest indiffer for hi wife yet the reflect a wife imprud conduct cast upon her husband is more than he is abl to bear and as a woman is here consid as pollut if she suffer a man to cast but an eye upon her and both her and her husband honor is lost by her appear in public it is no wonder their apart are so strictli guard if thi furiou love and jealousi wa the consequ of the climat it would at all time have been the same but we find in the day of the patriarch abraham who live on the confin of thi countri the women enjoy as great a liberti as with us or sarah beauti would not have brought her husband life in danger we find also ahasueru king of thi veri countri left haman in the room with hi belov queen whilst he retir to hi garden and esther made entertain for the great lord of the court and wa there in person which suffici show that they allow the ladi as great liberti in persia in those day as in ani part of europ at present the persian give thi reason among other for shut up their women that their prophet wa heard to say in hi last moment whilst die take care of your religion and your wive and great care they take of them inde for their haram are not enclos with a singl wall but frequent have two or three and these of an extraordinari height the men are taught also as they valu their salvat and the glori of god never to cast an eye on their neighbor women or even the place where they are kept and if they should meet the camel that carri them in the street or on the road though they are shut up so close that it is imposs to see them yet the men turn asid their face as they pass by or go out of the way and the women are taught that their honor and virtu doe not consist in preserv their chastiti onli but in prevent their be seen or see ani man but their lord and they are accordingli prohibit from convers with their brother or nearest male relat we are speak now of the women kept in the haram of great men so great a particular not be alway preserv with other women as the persian hold that women were made onli for their pleasur and for the continu of the speci and that there is no manner of occas for them in the manag of the affair of the world as in busi of ani kind whatev they suffer them to pass their live in idl and luxuri accordingli we see them almost all the day loll on carpet with their littl slave rub and chafe them which is the common amus in the east sometim they take opium or smoke their countri tobacco which is so mild that it may be taken from morn till night without disturb their head their food is dress by their slave and their cloth also made and wash by them so that they have noth to do but to indulg themselv and pleas their tyrant the women of the haram are attend chiefli by eunuch and there are a vast number of them dispers throughout the whole kingdom of persia especi in the king palac and those of the qualiti where they have almost everi thing of valu entrust to their care and in a manner govern the affair of their master the women never stir abroad without them either on a visit or even to the bath but they are not permit to interrupt their privaci in their chamber the eunuch also teach the children of the famili to read and write and instruct them in the principl of their religion till it is thought fit to put them into the hand of the learn and even then they have the care of the young gentlemen not suffer them to be at ani time out of their sight and as to the king children who never stir out of the haram till they come to the throne they have no other master some few of these eunuch are vers in the liber and mechan art and it is happi where the princ who succe fall into the hand of such a one for otherwis he come to the throne a mere novic eunuch are gener cut between seven and ten year of age if not done till they are fifteen not one in four would surviv the oper an eunuch between eight and sixteen year of age is sold in persia for l english money at least and sometim for l accord to their capac peopl choos to buy them in order to train them up to their wish which done they seldom chang their master whilst they live not have ani friend or relat which they know their sole depend is on their lord and they make it their whole busi to pleas him and gener manag matter so as to obtain the govern of the famili they are brought from the coast of malabar few person have ani white eunuch except the king who ha seldom less of one sort or other than three or four thousand men of the first rank have usual half a dozen in their hous those of inferior qualiti two or three as these unhappi men are not taken up with amor pursuit and can have no view to the rais of famili of their own they are gener veri dilig in their respect employ and faith to their master chap v of their custom etc the usual salut in thi countri is bow the bodi a littl and clap the right hand to the breast but men never stir their cap or their turban those who are more familiar press the palm of your hand between both their and then rais them to their forehead to express the high and cordial respect they have for you befor the king the viceroy of provinc and other great men they bow their face three time to the ground as they approach them as to european if they are not cloth in the persian dress they expect them to take off their hat and to be treat with the same mark of respect as are shown to men of qualiti in their own countri the aw manner in which the persian treat their superior in rank scarc have ani voic or opinion whilst in their presenc is a specimen of the genuin growth of arbitrari power and a despot invas of the common sens as well as the common liberti of mankind upon ani occas of mourn or rejoic the persian never fail to visit each other and peopl of condit alway expect the compliment of their depend on such occas they are introduc into a larg hall where coffe and tobacco is set befor them and with which they refresh themselv till the great man appear as soon as they see him everi man rise up and stand in hi place have bow to them as he pass by everi one bow much lower to him again and after he ha taken hi seat he make a sign to the compani to sit if the master of the hous be alreadi in hi hall the visitor come in softli and step to the next vacant place stand grave with hi feet close togeth and hi hand across till the master of the hous make a sign to him to sit down if a person receiv a visit from a superior he act differ from the english custom in place him on the right hand it be a mark of respect in persia to place a person on the left hand the persian are not much addict to game inde most of the scrupul one consid all game of chanc to be unlaw but there are those who play at card dice tabl chess and other game not in use among us the king and person of rank divert themselv sometim with the fight of wild beast as in india and the common peopl are amus at time with tumbler ropedanc and juggler as with us they have also martial and rural amus the former i will speak of by and by the latter consist in hunt and cours their greyhound are someth like our irish greyhound but the stag and antelop they cours are so swift of foot that the dog can not come up with them without the assist of hawk of which they have variou kind brought from circassia muscovi and the northern part of the empir these hawk are taught not onli to fli at partridg quail rabbit hare etc but even at deer and wild beast and to train them up to thi they stuff the skin of these anim fasten a piec of flesh on the head of it with which they feed the hawk draw the stuf skin along upon wheel to use them to fix themselv on the head whilst it move when they have use the young hawk to thi for some time they carri him to the sport with some old staunch hawk that is use to the game the dog be let loos the hawk are soon after thrown off who pursu the deer fasten on it nose strike their talon into the flesh and keep beat their wing about hi head so that he can not see hi way and thu give the dog an opportun to come up with him the gentlemen usual carri a littl kettledrum at their saddlebow to call off their hawk some of them it is said have formerli been taught to fli at men chardin tell us that the governor of tauri whom he wa particularli acquaint with use to divert himself with thi sport sometim not spare even hi friend that one day he let hi hawk fli at a gentleman and they tore hi face and eye in that manner that he die of it which the king be made acquaint with resent it so far that he turn him out of offic when the king or the great omrah or lord go a hunt the countri peopl for ten or fifteen leagu round are order to drive all the wild beast and game into a certain place surround with strong net or fenc and when thu enclos everi one of the compani shoot at which he pleas and a horribl slaughter is made of them mani hundr are often kill at one of these hunt match but they usual wait till the men of the greatest rank in the field come up and discharg an arrow after which everi one shoot as fast as he can there be a strang medley of deer antelop wild hog wolv fox hare etc all driven in a crowd togeth as for hound and hunt by scent they know noth of it inde their countri seem too dri for thi kind of sport even had they proper dog they frequent howev train up panther and leopard to hunt the game or rather to surpris it for these anim creep from one cover to anoth till they can jump upon their prey as a cat doe on a mous but never run after it in a continu cours about astrabd the peasant support themselv by catch wild duck they go in boat on the caspian dure the night near the marshi bank which are cover with rush and carri great light on the stern then ring a number of small bell the bird are confound and fli to their veri hand music seem to be no part of their geniu both sing and danc are consid in persia as disgrac peopl of condit will not suffer their children to learn either the one or the other but it is left almost entir as it is all over the east to common wench and prostitut it is reckon an indec in peopl of ani reput to sing and would render a man contempt who should attempt it in compani they call their singingwomen cain intim that they deriv their skill from the daughter of cain who they pretend were the first inventor of sing and music in the east they sing and play by rule though they make but poor harmoni at least such as is pleas to an european ear yet they are much delight with our music there is no such thing as sing in part but sing one after anoth and gener to some strung instrument as the lute or the viol their men sing better than the women but there are not mani of them that practic it music be prohibit by their religion their ecclesiast and devote will not so much as be present at such entertain which is one reason that the scienc is not arriv at a greater perfect there they have a great number of instrument both of strung and wind music some in shape like our hautboy and flute other like the viol harp virgin kettledrum and trumpet but the string of their instrument are not made of gut touch ani thing belong to a dead anim especi the entrail be held a pollut the string therefor are made of twist silk or brasswir their trumpet is the most monstrou instrument for size and sound that can be met with it is commonli seven or eight feet long and proportion wide at the great end and as much as a man can hold up these and their drum in a manner drown all other sound and inde their music as it is call serv chiefli instead of clock to let peopl know the time of day or night sound constantli at certain hour bell they have none and when the king or ani great man goe out of hi palac notic is alway given of it by the sound of drum and trumpet place over the palaceg or in some balconi or galleri and their nois is so great that it may be heard at a vast distanc in some place music and danc girl make part of a great man equipag and run befor him when he goe abroad but in gener the perform are a rag stroll rabbl and except some of the king are scarc worth hear howev on ani festiv as the circumcis of a child or other joy occas they come and play befor peopl door and usual have someth given them for their pain hanway say that the king secretari invit him at amul where there is a palac and which citi is said to have been found upward of year to hear hi music of which one instrument resembl a flute anoth a kettledrum and a third a guitar to which an old man and two boy sung and danc the boy move their head leg and arm whilst sing in a veri extravag manner a priest wa next sent for remark for be a good singer and thi man rais hi voic to a degre of amaz hi quaver were mix with a veri harsh guttur sound and the distort of hi visag such as creat rather horror than delight i will take the opportun here of say someth of their mode of travel there are no wheelcarriag in thi countri but all person travel on camel hors mule or ass the women who are to be conceal as much as possibl are put into a squar wooden machin a kind of cover chair call kedgavay about three feet deep and just high enough for a person to sit down in over head are three or four hoop like those which support the tilt of a wagon with a cloth thrown over them these are hung over the back of a camel like a pair of panier their ass are much larger and swifter of foot than our and will trot ten mile at a pretti good rate but are veri obstin and unlucki and frequent throw their rider but if travel have ani great distanc to go they perform their journey with caravan or cafila as they are call in persia a cafila is compos of camel hors and mule the whole of which are under the direct of a cheharwa dar or master it is to him the price of a mule or camel is paid and he stipul with the travel to feed and take care of the beast dure the journey he ha under him sever inferior servant who help to unload the beast of burden water them and attend them whilst on the journey the cafila keep as close as possibl and on it arriv at munzil gah or place of encamp for the day each load is deposit on a particular spot mark out by the master to which the merchant who own the good repair hi luggag form a crescent in the center are place the bed and provis a rope or line made of hair is then drawn round the whole at the distanc of about three yard each way which serv to distinguish the separ encamp dure the night the beast are all brought to their station opposit to the good they are to carri in the morn and are made fast to the hairrop abov mention at the hour of move which is gener between three and four in the morn they load the mule and camel and the passeng are awaken by the jingl of the bell tie round the neck of the beast in order to prevent their straggl dure their march when all thing are readi the master order those nearest the road to advanc and the whole move off in regular success where there are caravansera travel find their lodg grati and can there purchas provis at the best hand though the road in thi countri are steep and mountain yet such care is taken in lay bridg and causeway and to level and open the way that a travel seldom meet with ani difficulti but what are easili surmount here are no gener post but if ani person ha letter to send he dispatch a shater or footman express who will travel a thousand mile in or day and not ask more than d or s a day english they carri with them a bottl of water and a littl bag of provis and thi serv them for thirti or forti hour they gener leav the high road and cross the countri the nearest way there are famili which make thi their onli employ and breed their children up to it practic them to run from their infanc the king and all the great men have sever of these shater or runningfootmen in their retinu but befor a man can be admit one of the king footmen he must give suffici proof that he want neither heel nor breath for he must
