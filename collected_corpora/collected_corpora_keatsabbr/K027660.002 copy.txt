know the reason it is time the reader should know it for in the order of thing in which it happen it wa omit not that it wa out of my head but that had i told it then it might have been forgot now and now is the time i want it i had left london with so much precipit that it never enter my mind that we were at war with franc and had reach dover and look through my glass at the hill beyond boulogn befor the idea present itself and with thi in it train that there wa no get there without a passport go but to the end of a street i have a mortal avers for return back no wiser than i sat out and as thi wa one of the greatest effort i had ever made for knowledg i could less bear the thought of it so hear the count de had hire the packet i beg he would take me in hi suit the count had some littl knowledg of me so made littl or no difficulti onli said hi inclin to serv me could reach no further than calai as he wa to return by way of brussel to pari howev when i had onc pass there i might get to pari without interrupt but that in pari i must make friend and shift for myself let me get to pari monsieur le count said i and i shall do veri well so i embark and never thought more of the matter when le fleur told me the lieuten de polic had been enquir after me the thing instantli recur and by the time le fleur had well told me the master of the hotel came into my room to tell me the same thing with thi addit to it that my passport had been particularli ask after the master of the hotel conclud with say he hope i had one not i faith said i the master of the hotel retir three step from me as from an infect person as i declar thi and poor le fleur advanc three step toward me and with that sort of movement which a good soul make to succor a distress one the fellow won my heart by it and from that singl trait i knew hi charact as perfectli and could reli upon it as firmli as if he had serv me with fidel for seven year mon seignior cri the master of the hotel but recollect himself as he made the exclam he instantli chang the tone of it if monsieur said he ha not a passport appara in all likelihood he ha friend in pari who can procur him one not that i know of quoth i with an air of indiffer then cert repli he you will be sent to the bastil or the chatelet au moin poo said i the king of franc is a good natur soul he will hurt no bodi cela nempech pa said he you will certainli be sent to the bastil tomorrow morn but i have taken your lodg for a month answer i and i will not quit them a day befor the time for all the king of franc in the world la fleur whisper in my ear that no bodi could oppos the king of franc pardi said my host ce messieur angloi sont de gen tre extraordinair and have both said and sworn it he went out the passport the hotel at pari i could not find in my heart to tortur la fleur with a seriou look upon the subject of my embarrass which wa the reason i had treat it so cavalierli and to show him how light it lay upon my mind i drop the subject entir and whilst he wait upon me at supper talk to him with more than usual gaieti about pari and of the opera comiqu la fleur had been there himself and had follow me through the street as far as the booksel shop but see me come out with the young fill de chamber and that we walk down the quai de conti togeth la fleur deem it unnecessari to follow me a step further so make hi own reflect upon it he took a shorter cut and got to the hotel in time to be inform of the affair of the polic against my arriv as soon as the honest creatur had taken away and gone down to sup himself i then began to think a littl serious about my situat and here i know eugeniu thou will smile at the remembr of a short dialogu which pass betwixt us the moment i wa go to set out i must tell it here eugeniu know that i wa as littl subject to be overburthend with money as thought had drawn me asid to interrog me how much i had taken care for upon tell him the exact sum eugeniu shook hi head and said it would not do so pull out hi purs in order to empti it into mine i have enough in conscienc eugeniu said i inde yorick you have not repli eugeniu i know franc and itali better than you but you dont consid eugeniu said i refus hi offer that befor i have been three day in pari i shall take care to say or do someth or other for which i shall get clap up into the bastil and that i shall live there a coupl of month entir at the king of franc expens i beg pardon said eugeniu drili realli i had forgot that resourc now the event i treat gaili came serious to my door is it folli or nonchal or philosophi or pertinac or what is it in me that after all when la fleur had gone down stair and i wa quit alon that i could not bring down my mind to think of it otherwis than i had then spoken of it to eugeniu and as for the bastil the terror is in the word make the most of it you can said i to myself the bastil is but anoth word for a tower and a tower is but anoth word for a hous you can not get out of merci on the gouti for they are in it twice a year but with nine livr a day and pen and ink and paper and patienc albeit a man can not get out he may do veri well within at least for a month or six week at the end of which if he is a harmless fellow hi innoc appear and he come out a better and wiser man than he went in i had some occas i forget what to step into the courtyard as i settl thi account and rememb i walk down stair in no small triumph with the conceit of my reason beshrew the sombr pencil said i vauntingli for i envi not it power which paint the evil of life with so hard and deadli a color the mind sit terrifi at the object she ha magnifi herself and blacken reduc them to their proper size and hue she overlook them it is true said i correct the proposit the bastil is not an evil to be despis but strip it of it tower fill up the foss unbarricad the door call it simpli a confin and suppos it is some tyrant of a distemp and not of a man which hold you in it the evil vanish and you bear the other half without complaint i wa interrupt in the heyday of thi soliloquy with a voic which i took to be of a child which complain it could not get out i look up and down the passag and see neither man woman or child i went out without further attent in my return back through the passag i heard the same word repeat twice over and look up i saw it wa a starl hung in a littl cage i can not get out i can not get out said the starl i stood look at the bird and to everi person who came through the passag it ran flutter to the side toward which they approach it with the same lament of it captiv i can not get out said the starl god help thee said i but i will let thee out cost what it will so i turn about the cage to get to the door it wa twist and doubl twist so fast with wire there wa no get it open without pull the cage to piec i took both hand to it the bird flew to the place where i wa attempt hi deliver and thrust hi head through the trelli press hi breast against it as if impati i fear poor creatur said i i can not set thee at liberti no said the starl i can not get out i can not get out said the starl i vow i never had my affect more tenderli awaken or do i rememb an incid in my life where the dissip spirit to which my reason had been a bubbl were so suddenli call home mechan as the note were yet so true in tune to natur were they chant that in one moment they overthrew all my systemat reason upon the bastil and i heavili walk up stair unsay everi word i had said in go down them disguis thyself as thou will still slaveri said i still thou art a bitter draught and though thousand in all age have been made to drink of thee thou art no less bitter on that account it is thou thrice sweet and graciou goddess address myself to liberti whom all in public or in privat worship whose tast is grate and ever wilt be so till natur herself shall chang no tint of word can spot thi snowi mantl or chymic power turn thi scepter into iron with thee to smile upon him as he eat hi crust the swain is happier than hi monarch from whose court thou art exil graciou heaven cri i kneel down upon the last step but one in my ascent grant me but health thou great bestow of it and give me but thi fair goddess as my companion and shower down thi mitr if it seem good unto thi divin provid upon those head which are ach for them the captiv pari the bird in hi cage pursu me into my room i sat down close to my tabl and lean my head upon my hand i begun to figur to myself the miseri of confin i wa in a right frame for it and so i gave full scope to my imagin i wa go to begin with the million of my fellow creatur born to no inherit but slaveri but find howev affect the pictur wa that i could not bring it near me and that the multitud of of sad group in it did but distract me i took a singl captiv and have first shut him up in hi dungeon i then look through the twilight of hi grate door to take hi pictur i beheld hi bodi half wast away with long expect and confin and felt what kind of sick of the heart it wa which aris from hope defer upon look nearer i saw him pale and feverish in thirti year the western breez had not onc fan hi blood he had seen no sun no moon in all that time nor had the voic of friend or kinsman breath through hi lattic hi children but here my heart began to bleed and i wa forc to go on with anoth part of the portrait he wa sit upon the ground upon a littl straw in the furthest corner of hi dungeon which wa altern hi chair and bed a littl calend of small stick were laid at the head notchd all over with the dismal day and night he had pass there he had one of these littl stick in hi hand and with a rusti nail he wa etch anoth day of miseri to add to the heap as i darken the littl light he had he lift up a hopeless eye toward the door then cast it down shook hi head and went on with hi work of afflict i heard hi chain upon hi leg as he turn hi bodi to lay hi littl stick upon the bundl he gave a deep sigh i saw the iron enter into hi soul i burst into tear i could not sustain the pictur of confin which my fanci had drawn i startl up from my chair and call la fleur i bid him bespeak me a remis and have it readi at the door of the hotel by nine in the morn i will go directli said i myself to monsieur le duke de choiseul la fleur would have put me to bed but not will he should see ani thing upon my cheek which would cost the honest fellow a heart ach i told him i would go to bed by himself and bid him go do the same the starl road to versail i got into my remis the hour i propos la fleur got up behind and i bid the coachman make the best of hi way to versail as there wa noth in thi road or rather noth which i look for in travel i can not fill up the blank better than with a short histori of thi selfsam bird which becam the subject of the last chapter whilst the honor mr wa wait for a wind at dover it had been caught upon the cliff befor it could well fli by an english lad who wa hi groom who not care to destroy it had taken it in hi breast into the packet and by cours of feed it and take it onc under hi protect in a day or two grew fond of it and got it safe along with him to pari at pari the lad had laid out a a livr in a littl cage for the starl and as he had littl to do better the five month hi master stay there he taught it in hi mother tongu the four simpl word and no more to which i own myself so much it is debtor upon hi master go on for itali the lad had given it to the master of the hotel but hi littl song for liberti be in an unknown languag at pari the bird had littl or no store set by him so la fleur bought both him and hi cage for me for a bottl of burgundi in my return from itali i brought him with me to the countri in whose languag he had learn hi note and tell the stori of him to lord a lord a beg the bird of me in a week lord a gave him to lord b lord b made a present of him to lord c and lord cs gentleman sold him to lord ds for a shill lord d gave him to lord e and so on half round the alphabet from that rank he pass into the lower hous and pass the hand of as mani common but as all these want to get in and my bird want to get out he had almost as littl store set by him in london as in pari it is imposs but mani of my reader must have heard of him and if ani by mere chanc have ever seen him i beg leav to inform them that that bird wa my bird or some vile copi set up to repres him i have noth further to add upon him but that from that time to thi i have born thi poor starl as the crest to my arm thu blazon or coat of arm and let the herald offic twist hi neck about if they dare the address versail i should not like to have my enemi take a view of my mind when i am go to ask protect of ani man for which reason i gener endeavor to protect myself but thi go to monsieur le duc de c wa an act of compuls had it been an act of choic i should have done it i suppos like other peopl how mani mean plan of dirti address as i went along did my servil heart form i deserv the bastil for everi one of them then noth would serv me when i got within sight of versail but put word and sentenc togeth and conceiv attitud and tone to wreath myself into monsieur le duc de cs good grace thi will do said i just as well retort i again as a coat carri up to him by an adventur tailor without take hi measur fool continu i see monsieur le duc face first observ what charact is written in it take notic in what postur he stand to hear you mark the turn and express of hi bodi and limb and for the tone the first sound which come from hi lip will give it you and from all these togeth you will compound an address at onc upon the spot which can not disgust the duke the ingredi are hi own and most like to go down well said i i wish it well over coward again as if man to man wa not equal throughout the whole surfac of the globe and if in the field whi not face to face in the cabinet too and trust me yorick whenev it is not so man is fals to himself and betray hi own succor ten time where natur doe it onc go to the duc de c with the bastil in thi look my life for it thou will be sent back to pari in half an hour with an escort i believ so said i then i will go to the duke by heaven with all the gaiti and debonair in the world and there you are wrong again repli i a heart at eas yorick fli into no extrem it is ever on it center well well cri i as the coachman turn in at the gate i find i shall do veri well and by the time he had wheel round the court and brought me up to the door i found myself so much the better for my own lectur that i neither ascend the step like a victim to justic who wa to part with life upon the topmost nor did i mount them with a skip and a coupl of stride as i do when i fli up eliza to thee to meet it as i enter the door of the saloon i wa met by a person who possibl might be the maitr dhotel but had more the air of one of the under secretari who told me the duc de c wa busi i am utterli ignor said i of the form of obtain an audienc be an absolut stranger and what is wors in the present conjunctur of affair be an englishman too he repli that did not increas the difficulti i made him a slight bow and told him i had someth of import to say to monsieur le duc the secretari look toward the stair as if he wa about to leav me to carri up thi account to some one but i must not mislead you said i for what i have to say is of no manner of import to monsieur le duc de c but of great import to myself cest une autr affair repli he not at all said i to a man of gallantri but pray good sir continu i when can a stranger hope to have access in not less than two hour said he look at hi watch the number of equipag in the courtyard seem to justifi the calcul that i could have no nearer a prospect and as walk backward and forward in the saloon without a soul to commun with wa for the time as bad as be in the bastil itself i instantli went back to my remis and bid the coachman drive me to the cordon bleu which wa the nearest hotel i think there is a fatal in it i seldom go to the place i set out for le patiss versail befor i had got halfway down the street i chang my mind as i am at versail thought i i might as well take a view of the town so i pull the cord and order the coachman to drive round some of the princip street i suppos the town is not veri larg said i the coachmen beg pardon for set me right and told me it wa veri superb and that number of the first duke and marquis and count had hotel the count de b of whom the booksel at the quai de conti had spoke so handsom the night befor came instantli into my mind and whi should i not go thought i to the count de b who ha so high an idea of english book and englishmen and tell him my stori so i chang my mind a second time in truth it wa the third for i had intend that day for madam de r in the rue st pierr and had devoutli sent her word by her fill de chamber that i would assuredli wait upon her but i am govern by circumst i can not govern them so see a man stand with a basket on the other side of the street as if he had someth to sell i bid la fleur go up to him and enquir for the count hotel la fleur return a littl pale and told me it wa a chevali de st loui sell pate it is imposs la fleur said i la fleur could no more account for the phenomenon than myself but persist in hi stori he had seen the croix set in gold with it red ribband he said tie to hi buttonhol and had look into the basket and seen the pate which the chevali wa sell so could not be mistaken in that such a revers in man life awaken a better principl than curios i could not help look for some time at him as i sat in the remis the more i look at him hi croix and hi basket the stronger they wove themselv into my brain i got out of the remis and went toward him he wa begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below hi knee and with a sort of a bib went half way up hi breast upon the top of thi but a littl below the hem hung hi croix hi basket of littl pate wa cover over with a white damask napkin anoth of the same kind wa spread at the bottom and there wa a look of propret and neat throughout that one might have bought hi pate of him as much from appetit as sentiment he made an offer of them to neither but stood still with them at the corner of a hotel for those to buy who chose it without solicit he wa about fortyeight of a sedat look someth approach to graviti i did not wonder i went up rather to the basket than him and have lift up the napkin and taken one of hi pate into my hand i beg he would explain the appear which affect me he told me in a few word that the best part of hi life had pass in the servic in which after spend a small patrimoni he had obtain a compani and the croix with it but that at the conclus of the last peac hi regiment be reform and the whole corps with those of some other regiment left without ani provis he found himself in a wide world without friend without a livr and inde said he without ani thing but thi point as he said it to hi croix the poor chevali won my piti and he finish the scene with win my esteem too the king he said wa the most gener of princ but hi generos could neither reliev or reward everi one and it wa onli hi misfortun to be amongst the number he had a littl wife he said whom he love who did the patisseri and ad he felt no dishonor in defend her and himself from want in thi way unless provid had offer him a better it would be wick to withold a pleasur from the good in pass over what happen to thi poor chevali of st loui about nine month after it seem he usual took hi stand near the iron gate which lead up to the palac and as hi croix had caught the eye of number number had made the same enquiri which i had done he had told them the same stori and alway with so much modesti and good sens that it had reach at last the king ear who hear the chevali had been a gallant offic and respect by the whole regiment as a man of honor and integr he broke up hi littl trade by a pension of fifteen hundr livr a year as i have told thi to pleas the reader i beg he will allow me to relat anoth out of it order to pleas myself the two stori reflect light upon each other and it is a piti they should be part the sword renn when state and empir have their period of declens and feel in their turn what distress and poverti is i stop not to tell the caus which gradual brought the hous do you in britani into decay the marqui do you had fought up against hi condit with great firm wish to preserv and still show to the world some littl fragment of what hi ancestor had been their indiscret had put it out of hi power there wa enough left for the littl exig of obscur but he had two boy who look up to him for light he thought they deserv it he had tri hi sword it could not open the way the mount wa too expens and simpl economi wa not a match for it there wa no resourc but commerc in ani other provinc in franc save britani thi wa smite the root for ever of the littl tree hi pride and affect wish to see reblossom but in britani there be a provis for thi he avail himself of it and take an occas when the state were assembl at renn the marqui attend with hi two boy enter the court and have plead the right of an ancient law of the duchi which though seldom claim he said wa no less in forc he took hi sword from hi side here said he take it and be trusti guardian of it till better time put me in condit to reclaim it the presid accept the marquiss sword he stay a few minut to see it deposit in the archiv of hi hous and depart the marqui and hi whole famili embark the next day for martinico and in about nineteen or twenti year of success applic to busi with some unlook for bequest from distant branch of hi hous return home to reclaim hi nobil and to support it it wa an incid of good fortun which will never happen to ani travel but a sentiment one that i should be at renn at the veri time of thi solemn requisit i call it solemn it wa so to me the marqui enter the court with hi whole famili he support hi ladi hi eldest son support hi sister and hi youngest wa at the other extrem of the line next hi mother he put hi handkerchief to hi face twice there wa a dead silenc when the marqui had approach within six pace of the tribun he gave the marchio to hi youngest son and advanc three step befor hi famili he reclaim hi sword hi sword wa given him and the moment he got it into hi hand he drew it almost out of the scabbard twa the shine face of a friend he had onc given up he look attent along it begin at the hilt as if to see whether it wa the same when observ a littl rust which it had contract near the point he brought it near hi eye and bend hi head down over it i think i saw a tear fall upon the place i could not be deceiv by what follow i shall find said he some other way to get it off when the marqui had said thi he return hi sword into it scabbard made a bow to the guardian of it and with hi wife and daughter and hi two son follow him walk out o how i envi him hi feel the passport versail i found no difficulti in get admitt to monsieur le count de b the set of shakespear wa laid upon the tabl and he wa tumbl them over i walk up close to the tabl and give first such a look at the book as to make him conceiv i knew what they were i told him i had come without ani one to present me know i should meet with a friend in hi apart who i trust would do it for me it is my countryman the great shakespear said i point to hi work et ayez la bont mon cher ami apostroph hi spirit ad i de me fair cet honneur la the count smile at the singular of the introduct and see i look a littl pale and sickli insist upon my take an armchair so i sat down and to save him conjectur upon a visit so out of all rule i told him simpli of the incid in the booksel shop and how that had impel me rather to go to him with the stori of a littl embarrass i wa under than to ani other man in franc and what is your embarrass let me hear it said the count so i told him the stori just as i have told it the reader and the master of my hotel said i as i conclud it will need have it monsieur le count that i shall be sent to the bastil but i have no apprehens continu i for in fall into the hand of the most polish peopl in the world and be consciou i wa a true man and not come to spi the naked of the land i scarc thought i laid at their merci it doe not suit the gallantri of the french monsieur le count said i to show it against invalid an anim blush came into the count de bs cheek as i spoke thi ne craignez rien dont fear said he inde i dont repli i again besid continu i a littl sportingli i have come laugh all the way from london to pari and i do not think monsieur le duc de choiseul is such an enemi to mirth as to send me back cri for my pain my applic to you monsieur le compt de b make him a low bow is to desir he will not the count heard me with great good natur or i had not said half as much and onc or twice said cest bien dit so i rest my caus there and determin to say no more about it the count led the discours we talk of indiffer thing of book and polit and men and then of women god bless them all said i after much discours about them there is not a man upon earth who love them so much as i do after all the foibl i have seen and all the satir i have read against them still i love them be firmli persuad that a man who ha not a sort of an affect for the whole sex is incap of ever love a singl one as he ought heh bien monsieur langloi said the count gaili you are not come to spi the naked of the land i believ you ni encor i dare say that of our women but permit me to conjectur if par hazard they fell in your way that the prospect would not affect you i have someth within me which can not bear the shock of the least indec insinu in the sportabl of chitchat i have often endeavor to conquer it and with infinit pain have hazard a thousand thing to a dozen of the sex togeth the least of which i could not ventur to a singl one to gain heaven excus me monsieur le count said i as for the naked of your land if i saw it i should cast my eye over it with tear in them and for that of your women blush at the idea he had excit in me i am so evangel in thi and have such a fellowfeel for what ever is weak about them that i would cover it with a garment if i knew how to throw it on but i could wish continu i to spi the naked of their heart and through the differ disguis of custom climat and religion find out what is good in them to fashion my own by and therefor am i come it is for thi reason monsieur le compt continu i that i have not seen the palai royal nor the luxembourg nor the facad of the louvr nor have attempt to swell the catalogu we have of pictur statu and church i conceiv everi fair be as a templ and would rather enter in and see the origin draw and loos sketch hung up in it than the transfigur of raphael itself the thirst of thi continu i as impati as that which inflam the breast of the connoisseur ha led me from my own home into franc and from franc will lead me through itali it is a quiet journey of the heart in

read shakespear so take up much ado about noth i transport myself instantli from the chair i sat in to messina in sicili and got so busi with don pedro and benedick and beatric that i thought not of versail the count or the passport sweet pliabil of man spirit that can at onc surrend itself to illus which cheat expect and sorrow of their weari moment long long sinc had ye number out my day had i not trod so great a part of them upon thi enchant ground when my way is too rough for my feet or too steep for my strength i get off it to some smooth velvet path which fanci ha scatter over with

i have a clearer idea of the elysian field than i have of heaven i forc myself like enea into them i see him meet the pensiv shade of hi forsaken dido and wish to recogn it i see the injur spirit wave her head and turn off silent from the author of her miseri and dishonour i lose the feel for myself in her and in those affect which were wont to make me mourn for her when i wa at school sure thi is not walk in a vain shadow nor doe man disquiet himself in vain by it he often doe so in trust the issu of hi commot to reason onli i can safe say for myself i wa never abl to conquer ani one singl bad sensat in my heart so decis as by beat up as fast as i could for some kindli and gentl sensat to fight it upon it own ground when i had got to the end of the third act the count de b enter with my

for it twa entir at my own expens we have no jester at court mon le compt said i the last we had wa in the licenti reign of charl the iid sinc which time our manner have been so gradual refin that our court at present is so full of patriot who wish for noth but the honor and wealth of their countri and our ladi are all so chast so spotless so good so devout there is noth for a jester to make a jest of voila un persiflag cri the count the passport versail as the passport wa direct to all lieuten governor governor and command of citi gener of armi justiciari and all offic of justic to let mr yorick the king jester and hi baggag travel quietli along i own the triumph of obtain the passport wa not a littl tarnishd by the figur i cut in it but there is noth unmixt in thi world and some of the gravest of our divin have carri it so far as to affirm that enjoy itself wa attend even with a sigh and that the greatest they knew of termin in a gener way in littl better than a convuls i rememb the grave and learn bevoriskiu in hi commentari upon the gener from adam veri natur break off in the middl of a note to give an account to the world of a coupl of sparrow upon the outedg of hi window which had incommod him all the time he wrote and at last had entir taken him off from hi genealog it is strang write bevoriskiu but the fact are certain for i have had the curios to mark them down one by one with my pen but the cocksparrow dure the littl time that i could have finish the other half thi note ha actual interrupt me with the reiter of hi caress three and twenti time and a half how merci add bevoriskiu is heaven to hi creatur ill fate yorick that the gravest of thi brethren should be abl to write that to the world which stain thi face with crimson to copi in even thi studi but thi is noth to my travel so i twice twice beg pardon for it charact versail and how do you find the french said the count de b after he had given me the passport the reader may suppos that after so oblig a proof of courtesi i could not be at a loss to say someth handsom to the enquiri mai pass pour cela speak frankli said he do you find all the urban in the french which the world give us the honor of i had found everi thing i said which confirm it vraiment said the count le francoi sont poli s to an excess repli i the count took notic of the word excess and would have it i meant more than i said i defend myself a long time as well as i could against it he insist i had a reserv and that i would speak my opinion frankli i believ mon le compt said i that man ha a certain compass as well as an instrument and that the social and other call have occas by turn for everi key in him sothat if you begin a note too high or too low there must be a want either in the upper or under part to fill up the system of harmoni the count de b did not understand music so desir me to explain it some other way a polish nation my dear count said i make everi one it debtor and besid urban itself like the fair sex ha so mani charm it goe against the the heart to say it can do ill and yet i believ there is but a certain line of perfect that man take him altogeth is empow to arriv at if he get beyond he rather exchang qualiti than get them i must not presum to say how far thi ha affect the french in the subject we are speak of but should it ever be the case of the english in the progress of their resent to arriv at the same polish which distinguish the french if we did not lose the politess de coeur which inclin men more to human action than courteou one we should at least lose that distinct varieti and origin of charact which distinguish them not onli from each other but from all the world besid i had a few king william shill as smooth as glass in my pocket and forese they would be of use in the illustr of my hypothesi i had got them into my hand when i had proceed so far see mon le compt said i rise up and lay them befor him upon the tabl by jingl and rib one against anoth for seventi year togeth in one bodi pocket or anoth they are becom so much alik you can scarc distinguish one shill from anoth the english like ancient medai kept more apart and pass but few peopl hand preserv the first sharp which the fine hand of natur ha given them they are not so pleasant to feel but in return the legend is so visibl that at the first look you see whose imag and superscript they bear but the french mon le compt ad i wish to soften what i had said have so mani excel they can the better spare thi they are a loyal a gallant a gener an ingeni and good temper peopl as is under heaven if they have a fault they are too seriou mon dieu cri the count rise out of hi chair mai vou plaisantez said he correct hi exclam i laid my hand upon my breast and with earnest graviti assur him it wa my most settl opinion the count said he wa mortifi he could not stay to hear my reason be engag to go that moment to dine with the duc de c but if it is not too far to come to versail to eat your soup with me i beg befor you leav franc i may have the pleasur of know you retract your opinion or in what manner you support it but if you do support it mon angloi said he you must do it with all your power becaus you have the whole world against you i promis the count i would do myself the honor of dine with him befor i set out for itali so took my leav the temptat pari whey i alight at the hotel the porter told me a young woman with a bandbox had been that moment enquir for me i do not know said the porter whether she is gone away or no i took the key of my chamber of him and went up stair and when i had got within ten step of the top of the land befor my door i met her come easili down it wa the fair fill de chamber i had walk along the quai de conti with madam de r had sent her upon some commiss to a merchand de mode within a step or two of the hotel de moden and as i had fail in wait upon her had bid her enquir if i had left pari and if so whether i had not left a letter address to her as the fair fill de chamber wa so near my door she turn back and went into the room with me for a moment or two whilst i wrote a card it wa a fine still even in the latter end of the month of may the crimson window curtain which were of the same color of those of the bed were drawn close the sun wa set and reflect through them so warm a tint into the fair fill de chambr face i thought she blush the idea of it made me blush myself we were quit alon and that superinduc a second blush befor the first could get off there is a sort of a pleas half guilti blush where the blood is more in fault than the man it is sent impetu from the heart and virtu fli after it not to call it back but to make the sensat of it more delici to the nerv it is associ but i will not describ it i felt someth at first within me which wa not in strict unison with the lesson of virtu i had given her the night befor i sought five minut for a card i knew i had not one i took up a pen i laid it down again my hand trembl the devil wa in me i know as well as ani one he is an adversari whom if we resist he will fli from us but i seldom resist him at all from a terror that though i may conquer i may still get a hurt in the combat so i give up the triumph for secur and instead of think to make him fli i gener fli myself the fair fill de chamber came close up to the bureau where i wa look for a card took up first the pen i cast down then offer to hold me the ink she offer it so sweetli i wa go to accept it but i durst not i have noth my dear said i to write upon write it said she simpli upon ani thing i wa just go to cri out then i will write it fair girl upon thi lip if i do said i i shall perish so i took her by the hand and led her to the door and beg she would not forget the lesson i had given her she said inde she would not and as she utter it with some earnest she turn about and gave me both her hand close togeth into mine it wa imposs not to compress them in that situat i wish to let them go and all the time i held them i kept argu within myself against it and still i held them on in two minut i found i had all the battl to fight over again and i felt my leg and everi limb about me trembl at the idea the foot of the bed wa within a yard and a half of the place where we were standingg i had still hold of her hand and how it happen i can give no account but i neither ask her nor drew her nor did i think of the bed but so it did happen we both sat down i will just show you said the fair fill de chamber the littl purs i have been make today to hold your crown so she put her hand into her right pocket which wa next me and felt for it for sometim then into into the left she had lost it i never bore expect more quietli it wa in her right pocket at last she pull it out it wa of green taffeta line with a littl bit of white quilt satin and just big enough to hold the crown she put it into my hand it wa pretti and i held it ten minut with the back of my hand rest upon her lap look sometim at the purs sometim on one side of it a stitch or two had broke out in the gather of my stock the fair fill de chamber without say a word took out her littl hussiv thread a small needl and sew it up i foresaw it would hazard the glori of the day and as she pass her hand in silenc across and across my neck in the maneuv i felt the laurel shake which fanci had wreath about my head a strap had given way in her walk and the buckl of her shoe wa just fall off see said the fill de chamber hold up her foot i could not for my soul but fasten the buckl in return and put in the strap and lift up the other foot with it when i had done to see both were right in do it too suddenli it unavoid threw the fair fill de chamber off her center and then the conquest ye and then ye whose claycold head and lukewarm heart can argu down or mask your passion tell me what trespass is it that man should have them or how hi spirit stand answer to the father of spirit but for hi conduct under them if natur ha so wove her web of kind that some thread of love and desir are entangl with the piec must the whole web be rent in draw them out whip me such stoic great governor of natur said i to myself wherev thi provid shall place me for the trial of my virtu whatev is my danger whatev is my situat let me feel the movement which rise out of it and which belong to me as a man and if i govern them as a good one i will trust the issu to thi justic for thou have made us and not we ourselv as i finish my address i rais the fair fill de chamber up by the hand and led her out of the room she stood by me till i lock the door and put the key in my pocket and then the victori be quit decis and not till then i press my lip to her cheek and take her by the hand again led her safe to the gate of the hotel the mysteri pari if a man know the heart he will know it wa imposs to go back instantli to my chamber it wa touch a cold key with a flat third to it upon the close of a piec of music which had call forth my affect therefor when i let go the hand of the fill de chamber i remain at the gate of the hotel for some time look at everi one who pass by and form conjectur upon them till my attent got fix upon a singl object which confound all kind of reason upon him it wa a tall figur of a philosoph seriou adust look which pass and repass sedat along the street make a turn of about sixti pace on each side of the gate of the hotel the man wa about fiftytwo had a small cane under hi arm wa dress in a dark drabcolourd coat waistcoat and breech which seem to have seen some year servic they were still clean and there wa a littl air of frugal propret throughout him by hi pull off hi hat and hi attitud of accost a good mani in hi way i saw he wa ask chariti so i got a sou or two out of my pocket readi to give him as he took me in hi turn he pass by me without ask ani thing and yet did not go five step further befor he ask chariti of a littl woman i wa much more like to have given of the two he had scarc done with the woman when he pull off hi hat to anoth who wa come the same way an ancient gentleman came slowli and after him a young smart one he let them both pass and ask noth i stood observ him half an hour in which time he had made a dozen turn backward and forward and found that he invari pursu the same plan there were two thing veri singular in thi which set my brain to work and to no purpos the first wa whi the man should onli tell hi stori to the sex and secondli what kind of stori it wa and what speci of eloqu it could be which soften the heart of the women which he knew twa to no purpos to practic upon the men there were two other circumst which entangl thi mysteri the one wa he told everi woman what he had to say in her ear and in a way which had much more the air of a secret than a petit the other wa it wa alway success he never stop a woman but she pull out her purs and immedi gave him someth i could form no system to explain the phenomenon i had got a riddl to amus me for the rest of the even so i walk up stair to my chamber the case of conscienc pari i wa immedi follow up by the master of the hotel who came into my room to tell me i must provid lodg els where how so friend said i he answer i had had a young woman lock up with me two hour that even in my bedchamb and twa against the rule of hi hous veri well said i well all part friend then for the girl is no wors and i am no wors and you will be just as i found you it wa enough he said to overthrow the credit of hi hotel voyez vou monsieur said he point to the foot of the bed we had been sit upon i own it had someth of the appear of an evid but my pride not suffer me to enter into ani detail of the case i exhort him to let hi soul sleep in peac as i resolv to let mine do that night and that i would discharg what i owe him at breakfast i should not have mind monsieur said he if you had had twenti girl it is a score more repli i interrupt him than i ever reckon upon provid ad he it hadbeen but in a morn and doe the differ of the time of the day at pari make a differ in the sin it made a differ he said in the scandal i like a good distinct in my heart and can not say i wa intoler out of temper with the man i own it is necessari reassum the master of the hotel that a stranger at pari should have the opportun present to him of buy lace and silk stock and ruffl et tout cela and it is noth if a woman come with a band box of my conscienc said i she had one but i never look into it then monsieur said he ha bought noth not one earthli thing repli i becaus said he i could recommend one to you who would use you en conscienc but i must see her thi night said i he made me a low bow and walk down now shall i triumph over thi maitr dhotel cri i and what then then i shall let him see i know he is a dirti fellow and what then what then i wa too near myself to say it wa for the sake of other i had no good answer left there wa more of spleen than principl in my project and i wa sick of it befor the execut in a few minut the grisset came in with her box of lace i will buy noth howev said i within myself the grisset would show me everi thing i wa hard to pleas she would not seem to see it she open her littl magazin laid all her lace one after anoth befor me unfold and fold them up again one by one with the most patient sweet i might buy or not she would let me have everi thing at my own price the poor creatur seem anxiou to get a penni and laid herself out to win me and not so much in a manner which seem art as in one i felt simpl and caress if there is not a fund of honest cullibl in man so much the wors my heart relent and i gave up my second resolut as quietli as the first whi should i chastis one for the trespass of anoth if thou art tributari to thi tyrant of an host thought i look up in her face so much harder is thi bread if i had not had more than four loui dor in my purs there wa no such thing as rise up and show her the door till i had first laid three of them out in a pair of ruffl the master of the hotel will share the profit with her no matter then i have onli paid as mani a poor soul ha paid befor me for an act he could not do or think of the riddl pari when la fleur came up to wait upon me at supper he told me how sorri the master of the hotel wa for hi affront to me in bid me chang my lodg a man who valu a good night rest will not lay down with enmiti in hi heart if he can help it so i bid la fleur tell the master of the hotel that i wa sorri on my side for the occas i had given him and you may tell him if you will la fleur ad i that if the young woman should call again i shall not see her thi wa a sacrific not to him but myself have resolv after so narrow an escap to run no more risk but to leav pari if it wa possibl with all the virtu i enter in cest derog a nobless monsieur said la fleur make me a bow down to the ground as he said it et encor monsieur said he may chang hi sentiment and if par hazard he should like to amus himself i find no amus in it said i interrupt him mon dieu said la fleur and took away in an hour time he came to put me to bed and wa more than commonli offici someth hung upon hi lip to say to me or ask me which he could not get off i could not conceiv what it wa and inde gave myself littl troubl to find it out as i had anoth riddl so much more interest upon my mind which wa that of the man ask chariti befor the door of the hotel i would have given ani thing to have got to the bottom of it and that not out of curios it is so low a principl of enquiri in gener i would not purchas the gratif of it with a twosou piec but a secret i thought which so soon and so certainli soften the heart of everi woman you came near wa a secret at least equal to the philosoph stone had i had both the indi i would have given up one to have been master of it i toss and turn it almost all night long in my brain to no manner of purpos and when i awok in the morn i found my spirit as much troubl with my dream as ever the king of babylon had been with hi and i will not hesit to affirm it would have puzzl all the wise men of pari as much as those of chaldea to have given it interpret le dimanch pari it wa sunday and when la fleur came in in the morn with my coffe and role and butter he had got himself so gallantli array i scarc knew him i had conven at montreal to give him a new hat with a silver button and loop and four loui dor pour sadonis when we got to pari and the poor fellow to do him justic had done wonder with it he had bought a bright clean good scarlet coat and a pair of breech of the same they were not a crown wors he said for the wear i wish him hang for tell me they look so fresh that though i knew the thing could not be done yet i would rather have impos upon my fanci with think i had bought them new for the fellow than that they had come out of the rue de friperi thi is a niceti which make not the heart sore at pari he had purchas moreov a handsom blue satin waistcoat fanci enough embroid thi wa inde someth the wors for the servic it had done but twa clean scour the gold had been touch up and upon the whole wa rather showi than otherwis and as the blue wa not violent it suit with the coat and breech veri well he had squeez out of the money moreov a new bag and a solitair and had insist with the fripier upon a gold pair of garter to hi breech knee he had purchas muslin ruffl bien brode with four livr of hi own money and a pair of white silk stock for five more and to top all natur had given him a handsom figur without cost him a sou he enter the room thu set off with hi hair dress in the first style and with a handsom bouquet in hi breast in a word there wa that look of festiv in everi thing about him which at onc put me in mind it wa sunday and by combin both togeth it instantli struck me that the favor he wish to ask of me the night befor wa to spend the day as everi bodi in pari spent it besid i had scarc made the conjectur when la fleur with infinit humil but with a look of trust as if i should not refus him beg i would grant him the day pour fair le galant vi a vi de sa maitress now it wa the veri thing i intend to do myself vi a vi madam de r i had retain the remis on purpos for it and it would not have mortifi my vaniti to have had a servant so well dress as la fleur wa to have got up behind it i never could have wors spare him but we must feel not argu in these embarrass the son and daughter of servic part with liberti but not with natur in their contract they are flesh and blood and have their littl vaniti and wish in the midst of the hous of bondag as well as their taskmast no doubt they have set their selfdeni at a price and their expect are so unreason that i would often disappoint them but that their condit put it so much in my power to do it behold behold i am thi servant disarm me at onc of the power of a master thou shall go la fleur said i and what mistress la fleur said i can thou have pick up in so littl a time at pari la fleur laid hi hand upon hi breast and said twa a petit demoisel at monsieur le compt de bs la fleur had a heart made for societi and to speak the truth of him let as few occas slip him as hi master so that some how or other but how heaven know he had connect himself with the demoisel upon the land of the staircas dure the time i wa taken up with my passport and as there wa time enough for me to win the count to my inteterest la fleur had contriv to make it do to win the maid to hi the famili it seem wa to be at pari that day and he had made a parti with her and two or three more of the count household upon the boulevard happi peopl that onc a week at least are sure to lay down all your care togeth and danc and sing and sport away the weight of grievanc which bow down the spirit of other nation to the earth the fragment pari la fleur had left me someth to amus myself with for the day more than i had bargain for or could have enter either into hi head or mine he had brought the littl print of butter upon a current leaf and as the morn wa warm and he had a good step to bring it he had beg a sheet of wast paper to put betwixt the current leaf and hi hand as that wa plate suffici i bad him lay it upon the tabl as it wa and as i resolv to stay within all day i order him to call upon the traileur to bespeak my dinner and leav me to breakfast by myself when i had finish the butter i threw the current leaf out of the window and wa go to do the same by the wast paper but stop to read a line first and that draw me on
