entertain to which he is invit by the author but with period public thi object can rare be propos for as the prefac is gener the last part of the work in point of composit the strong probabl is that the gener of reader like the author himself have trace the work through it respect stage befor the prefac come under consider thi is particularli the case with the present perform for though twelv hundr and fifti copi have been print i have the satisfact to find that i am upon the eve of be call upon for a second edit befor the last number of the first is complet few of the person therefor to whom thi prologu is present can be suppos unacquaint with the plot and incid of the drama it is to preced yet as i am about conclud the first volum of a work in everi thing but it form of a veri singular natur i can not but feel myself call upon to say someth by way of apolog for it appear the variou public with which the world ha been sometim benefit and sometim infest have been suggest by a varieti of circumst and author have been stimul in their vi labour by a varieti of causes—th greater number of book undoubtedli have origin either in the love of fame or the desir of profit and neither of these object i believ when properli regul are in the least dishonour either to the understand or the heart but there are some which owe their origin to higher motives—and among these the author flatter himself that the tribun ha some pretens to be rank those who are acquaint with the expenc of public and who compar the quantiti of matter with the price of these pamphlet will immedi perceiv that the sale of a thousand copi at threepenc per number and two hundr and fifti at sixpenc after all deduct for the profit of booksel and other incident circumst can never make ani pecuniari compens to the publish and as for same he must be infatu inde who look for an increas of literari reput from the hasti transcript of a cours of lectur two of which he is to prepar and deliv everi week excel is onli to be attain by flow and elabor process and the world consid the degre of merit produc not the circumst which may have influenc the product if therefor i had regard onli my interest or my reput the probabl is that thi period paper had never appeared—especi as it might have been expect that such a work would rather blunt than excit the curios of the public who are gener less dispos to go and hear that which they suppos they shall have the opportun though perhap they may never have the inclin to read but the fact is that though the late prosecut have influenc me in some degre to vari my mode they have not abat my desir of dissemin inform such as it is in my power to commun vii among the oppress and industri order of societi and at the same time that it wa imposs either from the limit of my premis from the veri larg expenc of my situat or from the necessari precaut of preserv what the aristocrat prejudic of the world would term the respect of my lectur to render the term of admiss more easi than they are i flatter myself that the class of peopl to whom i have allud might be in some degre benefit and enlighten by the doctrin which these lectur are intend to enforc feel myself call upon to guard against a repetit of such gross forgeri as had been advanc against me upon my late trial by the employ of a shorthand writer i therefor began to calcul whether i could not turn thi circumst to the advantag of the caus in which my life ha alreadi been endang and in which my soul still continu to be embark the result wa a determin to send into the world at the cheapest possibl rate the follow public print at the same time a small edit upon fine paper for the use of those whose circumst better enabl them to reward the labour of men who have noth but their talent and exert to bestow upon the public caus as it is imposs that in an undertak like mine there should not be consider inequ my first intent wa to have set apart those lectur which i conceiv most success in point for public in separ volum and to have publish extract onli from the other but upon further reflect i have chang my plan and my present intent to which i have partli adher in the latter part of

more refer to gener principl in conform to thi resolut there are some of the lectur deliv toward the latter end of the cours which though yet unprint call aloud for publication—particularli those on barrack and fortif and on the dear and scarciti of provis it can not howev be expect that i should chain myself down to the metropoli to the total neglect of health relax and comfort dure the whole summer in order to superintend thi public and as i am not at present provid with ani person to whom i can entrust the correct of the press i must declin the regular continu of thi public till the

will it be surpris if we should find that a dead palsi ha seiz one side of the countri when as may possibl be the case ere long we find ourselv call upon by the progress of event for all our energi

have those person who have fled to the hospit shore of america secur by that flight abund to those whom they have left behind alass how melancholi a revers present itself to our observ calcul the present proport between the increas in the price of labour and in the price of the necessari articl of life and estim if you can without a blush the meagr pittanc with which the industri is repaid that secur the comfort and multipli the luxuri of the opul and privileg order behold the condit of our labour those even who can obtain employ for their industri at ani rate—se them in defianc of all their toil and assidu reduc to the miser prospect of not be abl to suppli a necessari quantiti of wholesom food for themselv and their distress famili to what caus shall we trace these distemp for we must know the natur of the diseas befor we attempt to appli a remedi to what caus i say shall we attribut these phenomena in the state of the nation health the first that present itself to us is that immens foreign export which is the consequ of thi just necessari and prosper war the loaf that should feed the use labour is sent to suppli the destroy soldier—english hessian austrian hanoverian sardinian or prussian the peasant languish and the manufactur starv that the fruit of their industri may satisfi the crave of those who are fight not i believ for the liberti of englishmen but for the preserv of the place and emolu of those by whom the liberti of england are invad but even thi intent doe not succeed the store intend for these motley legion are lost in the dyke of holland in the marsh of flander in the ravag territori of the petti princ of germani whom the power of britain is no longer compet to defend it is sent to some british or some friendli armi at some given post and when it arriv there it find no such armi in exist the tricolour flag is wave where the british standard wa expect to be hail the reliqu of our brave battalion have fled to some distant post and the store either fall into the hand of the enemi or are wickedli destroy in hope that the foe we can not conquer may experi the same famin with the friend we can not preserv thu to the calam which proceed from the polit insan of our ruler are to be ad those which result from the absolut imposs of suppli a fli armi without send three time the quantiti of provis which a victori armi would requir independ of thi it seem as though the element themselv had conspir to aggrav our misfortun i shall not allud to the frost in holland the dutch best know whether they were calam or blessings—i shall not attempt to plead their caus as far as we can see holland believ it ha had too much of our friendli interfer alreadi but i do believ that whatev dutchmen may think englishmen must feel that a consider aggrav of their calam ha been produc by the inclement season i do not stand here to uphold the doctrin of superstit i do not pretend to peer abov the cloud and discov the secret of a suppos rule provid that is no part of my profess i speak of fact i wish you to know how great your calam is and what are the moral mean of redress i speak onli to moral agent and therefor have noth to do with supernatur caus but the greater the calam are the greater is the cri necess of appli relief and it is the duti of the statesman not onli to cure those disast which result from the polit wicked or absurd of the ruler but to provid remedi also for those which result from accident circumstances—from physic caus from derang of the element and intern disast for thi it wa that govern wa chiefli institut ye citizen as it is the duti of the physician to appli not onli remedi to the diseas which result from intemper but to those also which proceed from accid which may betid the human bodi and over the caus of which we can have no dominion so with the polit physician it is hi duti to appli the remedi not onli to the evil which result from hi own folli and absurd but to the consequ also of those natur calam which he could not forese and which therefor no human virtu could prevent and i do affirm that thi wa the purpos for which govern were princip institut for these are the onli calam like to befal ani nation independ of those which result from the govern itself all the calam of war all the inconveni to which ani nation is expos in consequ of foreign and extern circumst are the effect of the govern itself and never could exist but from the particular conduct of the governor it is therefor for the purpos of regul those intern circumst which result necessarili from the state of societi or are the consequ of those accid or derang to which the physic univers is perpetu liabl that govern is in realiti institut for these are misfortun to which societi and in mani instanc even unassoci man must be perpetu subject from the yet unfathom law of the system we inhabit it is necessari therefor for the better secur and accommod of man or at least it ha hitherto appear so that institut should exist compos of individu whose superior knowledg and leisur for reflect may enabl them to discov the proper remedi for these inevit and unforeseen calam and to direct the popular attent to the mean of counteract their effect these institut constitut what is call govern and woe to that nation whose governor forget the real object of their institut in the selfish pursuit of factiou aggrandis and the mad and destruct project of war and conquest i say then if it ha happen from the cooper of polit and physic caus that calam have been brought upon the nation it behov those entrust with the administr of the govern first of all prior to all extern concern prior to all consider of foreign allianc or hostil to consid and appli the remedi which the intern situat of the countri happen to demand if then to you as to me the strong probabl should appear that dure thi inclement season hundr nay thousand of our fellow be must have perish from those diseas which result from scanti and unwholesom food from the want of proper protect from the inclem of the season and from the want of fuel to warm their frozen joints—if the probabl should appear that the dearth of provis exist and like to be encreas from the encreas export of the necessari of life to our armi on the contin cooper with the physic calam of flood frost and inund are like still further to aggrav the distress of the countri to a degre littl short of famin itself—it result as a deduct of reason—it result as an imperi duti that the nation at larg but princip the governor of the nation are call upon to seek with dilig and to appli with alacr such remedi as may snatch us from thi sever accumul of disast citizen it will be said that a sort of relief ha been appli we shall be told of the benevol in parish we shall be told of the subscript of person enjoy or l a year who have liber subscrib one guinea in one place becaus it wa not their own parish and two in anoth becaus it wa their own we shall be told perhap that abund relief ha been given to the distress portion of societi citizen thi is a speciou but a danger mode of proceed toward the relief of our fellow be if thi is the condit under which so mani of our fellow citizen groan some remedi not a remedi of chariti of benevol as it is call but a remedi of polit amelior ought to be appli that will imparti reach them all parish associ may amus the wretch with delus hope and present a vain gloriou pictur of public munific but can never afford an adequ remedi to the evil i shall not dwell upon the pecul of parish offic and contractor it is suffici to observ that by parish associ noth but a partial remedi will ever be appli and that not for the purpos of remov the distress but of increas the depend of the lower order of the peopl he who is attach to the faction in power who can can cring and creep to the petti offic and depend of of that faction may perchanc obtain relief but i myself have wit the manner in which the applic of those may be repuls howev great their miseri who are suspect of be defici in these loyal virtu or who have the misfortun to be recommend by individu whose principl are not entir agreeabl to gentlemen high in offic i have known poor wretch refus relief from the fund rais at the gener expenc of the district or chid with surli insol and dismiss with a scanti disproportion pittanc becaus the person who recommend them—th individu who knew their distress were jacobin as they are call person attach not to individu men but to broad and gener principl person who believ that principl as it is the soul of polit exist is more to be rever than the leader of littl paltri associ of men of rank—mor vener than even those corpor institut which arrog to themselv a kind of omnipot while at the same time they are in realiti but the tool of individu who some how or other have got to the lead but who by the grovel passion they so frequent exhibit one would suppos to have been intend to be place at the foot of societi citizen whatev may have been the calam of the peopl whatev the partial relief of those calam i am afraid they have not yet arriv at their height when i read—and who ha not read the melancholi account of flood and inund when i consid how mani pastur have been laid wast how mani field of promis grain destroy i can not but look forward with gloomi apprehens toward that prospect of famin or littl short of famin which present itself to our view and if i can hereaft show and i trust i can show that there are polit remedi which might remov thi grievanc what are the desert of those individu who have power to appli these remedi but whose pride whose avaric of offic prevent them from listen to the voic of calam and render them blind to that happi which might be produc by pursu measur consist with the wish and interest of the peopl but which they conceiv would be detriment to their own selfish interest and the perman of their place and emolu the impot and absurd of superstiti observ from the same what are the proper object to which the statesman ought to turn hi attent what the proper pursuit in which the nation ought at thi time to be engag ought we to appeal to the moral energi of the human mind to the power of reason to the faculti of intellect or to yield to the cowardli dictat of superstit are we in short to appli to moral and polit resourc for redress or like the stupid neopolitan carri about in long process the head of saint januariu to avert the earthquak rumbl under our feet and suspend the explos of the volcano which is flame over our head and threatn us with immedi destruct ye citizen you can see the absurd of thi you can feel what a ridicul figur st januariu make in the midst of thi tremend scene but o blind of selflov o folli of nation partial you can not perceiv that there is scarc a shade of differ between the practic of napl and of britain for how are englishmen at thi time employ are not priest in their pulpit and devote upon their knee pour forth their soul in sublim rhapsodi to an invis be to induc him to do for them what if it is right they ought to do for themselv and if it is wrong such a be certainli would not do for them are they not offer up their petit as they say to a benevol and merci creator to enabl them to cut the throat to desol the field to burn the town and villag to make widow of the wive and orphan of the children of their fellow creatures—accord to their own calcul of their brethren thu intreat thi merci be to lend hi assist to practic so cruel and so proflig that even the beast of prey are stranger to them they devour inde the brute of other speci but leav to man alon the enlighten provinc of destroy hi fellow man instead of appeal to the virtuou resourc of the human charact instead of endeavour to find what kind of stuff briton are made of instead of restor them to their right that they may recov their energi are not person hire to preach the doctrin most agreeabl to their employ rush into the utmost extrem of superstiti absurd and endeavour to preserv those employ from the ruin and destruct in which they have involv themselves—bi what by reform and aton no but by the vain attempt to make divin perfect for so they call the object of their worship the particip of their guilt and pray for thunder and lightn to consum the individu who have presum to differ from them in polit and religi opinion and whom their folli and presumpt have convert from gener friend to the nation into implac enemi to the govern citizen if reason is not to be the arbit if superstit is to be appeal to let me ask what differ is there between a pair of protest lawn sleev and the relic of a roman saint if we are to seek redress not by our exert but by the prayer and mediat of some intermedi be some demigod

disdain to appeal to a superstit which their action show they do not believ and which they do not pretend to comprehend liberti benevol and truth are the triniti in uniti of their perpetu ador these are the object to which the attent of the human mind should be direct if all that is preach and believ is true the be to whom they address their prayer sit immov in the heaven lost in a blaze of light

from thi etern cours but truth we can discov benevol we can feel and liberti the gloriou principl of liberti we can promot let us consid then whether those great deiti of ration ador are not more like to furnish us with the mean of extric ourselv from that weight of calam which polit priestcraft and superstiti polici have so heavili accumul upon the shoulder of mankind than all the juggl between priest and machiavelian politician which have so long been carri on let us labour to enlighten our fellow citizens—let us for polit maladi seek for polit relief endeavour by everi mean in our power to appli the assist of moral amelior to moral calam and explor the mean by which one physic caus may counteract the mischief of anoth thu and thu onli can we remedi what superstit never yet could cure but those who have an interest in impos upon mankind have found out anoth mode of remedi fast and prayer are institut for the purpos of sanguinari ambit you are told to humbl yourselv for the crime which your ruler have commit you are taught to pray that they may continu to slaughter and you are taught to fast and you have been taught it long enough—y are taught to fast that they may riot in luxuri profus on the mean of redress the calam of the nation from the same what then are the mean of redress for which the calam of the nation call for redress of polit calam let us appli ourselv to correct the vice the error the delus ambit which have led to those calam and if the present situat of the countri with respect to polici result from the quixot imagin that a hand of briton could subdu the enthusiast myriad of france—if we have attempt to trampl their infant liberti in the duft without consid with what gigant energi that infanc wa endued—if we have madli suppos that the pigmi effort of a pitt a dunda a loughborough a jenkinson and a colonel mack could subdu thi gigant energi and reduc a mighti nation onc more to the tramel of despotism—and if thi ha been the polit sourc of our calam let us acknowledg that we see our error that we see the folli of our attempt and ere it be too late consid how we can save our own countri from that veri famin and destruct with which we threaten to depopul the street of pari thi also would lead to the remedi of those intern calam that have fallen upon us by call forth the resourc of natur and the energi of a well direct industri and as for those heavier calam which may threaten to assail us at our own door—if briton as perhap may be the case are speedili to be call upon to defend their own habit and their own famili from those hostil aggress with which they so unjustli and so absurdli threaten the enemi they have thu provok let our governor appeal in time to those popular concess those concili act of justic which have been so long and so intemper refus but without which i fear that unanim and energi can never be expect which circumst so alarm may requir to restor us to our vigour let them restor us to our right let them convinc us that it is for ourselv and ourselv alon that we are strugl nor suffer us to suspect for a moment that we are contend for our own chain for the secur of our oppressor and the perpetu of our oppress remov the possibl of thi suspicion and then shall it be found that the british charact ha not lost it energi but that we are still as capabl of vindic our own caus as ever we were in the most brilliant period of our histori then shall it appear in the eye of europ that briton still retain that resolut and unanim affect for the real interest of their countri which can alon secur it protect or improv it happi for the allevi of calam of anoth descript let us also labour to abolish luxuri and everi man may do much toward thi reform let us in our own hous at our own tabl by our exhort to our friend by our admonit to our enemi persuad mankind to discard those tinsel ornament and ridicul superflu which enfeebl our mind and entail voluptu diseas on the affluent while diseas of a still more calamit descript overwhelm the oppress order of societi from the scarciti result from thi extravag thu let us administ to the relief of those who have the same power of enjoy with ourselv have a right to at least an equal particip of all the necessari of life which are the product of their labour let us seek also to restor the freedom of commerc let us consid that while the port of nation are open scarciti can never exist to ani alarm degre everi countri if not prevent by polit impedi will send it surplu product to the best market the best market is alway the countri which is most in want and therefor those who have most of ani particular commod will carri it to that port where it scarciti is most notori so that the effect of that scarciti will hardli be percept to the commun at larg let us consid what the real util of commerc is not that it may swell as at present the opul of a few individu give the luxuri of the globe to the great man tabl and thu inflat hi pride with the imagin that he is a be of superior speci to those by whose toil hi appetit are pamper no the real advantag of commerc is that the surplu resourc of one nation exchang for the surplu resourc of anoth may prevent excess want and scarciti from be felt by ani individu portion of the univers let us consid then for one moment what are the real caus of the polit and natur calam of the countri and we can not be long befor we find redress the greater part of our calam result from a ridicul an unjust and therefor an unnecessari war and that state of corrupt into which the democrat branch of our constitut ha so unfortun fallen it is from those that the polit distress of the great bodi of the peopl aris and let it be rememb that even the physic calam those which origin in the sever of the season may also be remov by the same speci of redress which may remov the other calam in the first place then let us consid how we can put a period to the present disaster war let us see how we can concili the affect of the irrit republ of franc and how we can convert again into our dearest friend those peopl whom our unjust interfer with their intern concern ha compel to be our bitterest foe or to speak more correctli the bitterest foe of our ministeri director let us rememb that howev a few desper individu may have stain with crime the revolut of that countri and howev we may deplor the excess into which the aspir disposit of some individu may have plung a mighti nation yet on the other hand we see in the virtu they have exhibit a charact so great and gloriou that noth but the delus cant of polit corrupt could have induc us for a moment to brand them with those epithet so liber and so impoliticli bestow let us appli ourselv assidu to compos the differ and restor the peac and cordial intercours of europ and let us recollect that if thi intercours thi peac and affect can be restor whatev calam the element may chanc to inflict upon an individu countri will be present remov even by that interest but yet in it effect philanthrop spirit which indu mankind so univers to barter those commod they can spare with other nation that stand in need of them citizen let us also seek for a more immedi redress consid what our natur resourc are let us consid that thi is a countri water by innumer stream not onli impart fresh verdur to the field they flow through but teem also with that food which but from the unjust monopli with which it is incumb might suppli the necess of all our industri poor for proof of thi we need onli appeal to fact one of those fish which is certainli among the most luxuri of the finni tribe the salmon wa so abund in thi countri befor the stream were made the properti of individu that it wa necessari in mani part of the countri to insert a claus in the indentur of poor boy from the parish to prevent their be fed upon thi delici dainti more than three time in a week i refer you to the indentur of the citi of winchest particularli where the claus is still retain though it is difficult now in that town to get a morsel of that fish without pay two and sixpenc or three shill per pound for it circumst also of equal impolici and injustic have produc an artifici scarciti of salt water fish and a red her which some year ago might be bought for a halfpenni is not now to be had for less than threehalfp or twopenc what then is the caus of thi will ani man make me believ that the fish are infect also with the rage of emigration—wil you tell me that they also have drank the poison doctrin of jacobin and becom discont with that gloriou constitut under which for so mani centuri they have so happili been eaten and that therefor the her have fled from the coast of scotland and the salmon desert our river and togeth with the other factiou inhabit of our stream and shore have fled with atheist abhorr of all regular govern to the coast and river of french anarchi or the distant and happi shore of america that they might enjoy the pleasur of be eaten without alloy from the consider that they were put in the mouth of what they rebelli consid as bondmen and slave no citizen it is the infern spirit of monopoli that cruel and wast demon that ha render poverti want and distress the portion of the mass of the peopl of thi countri that ha produc in the midst of abund thi cruel artifici scarciti citizen is it not enough that men should have a properti in that which ha been procur by the labour of their ancestor is it not enough that the soil which from time immemori ha been work by a herd of men who were to receiv a scanti portion onli of it produc should be the properti of a few wealthi and privileg individu is it not enough that the bird of the air should be monopol by these men must the wild inhabit of the veri wave must all the common bounti of natur be also consid as articl of monopol accumul shall one or two men grasp to themselv the whole product of our river and then make an agreement with a fishmong to wast and destroy whatev can not be sold at an extravag price rather than suffer the swinish multitud to feast upon luxuri with which the tabl of the great ought to be exclus furnish and thu produc an artifici scarciti into the countri so ruinou to the popul so detest in it principl so alarm in it effect citizen the harvest of our wave if i may use the metaphor if onc reliev from thi intoler exercis might alway be reap in abund and when plenti smile not in our valley it might still sparkl in our stream and in the neighbourhood of our shore whose finni produc might compens in some degre for the accident scarciti of the field the surplu product also of those stream and shore might produc by the exchang of a liber commerc abund of the necessari suppli of which the countri might stand in need look to the coast of scotland look to the littl island the hebrid and the orkney behold how popul the surround wave see the whole ocean one anim mass as it were one throng associ of littl be who offer themselv as the food of man consid that in the neighbourhood of one island even upon a veri moder calcul more than one hundr thousand million of the finest her are devour annual by one speci of fowl onli the solan goos that frequent the rockey shore consid also that the bay of that countri are frequent by such huge quantiti of them that the whale which might be caught there also instead of send to greenland for them may be seen eat their way through the innumer shoal that throng everi part of the shore whi is it then that they do not come to our market in such quantiti as to render superflu not want the lot of man whi is it that the superflu produc of thi fisheri is not import by the inhabit of these coast and island in such quantiti as to produc in return an abund suppli of those necessari and comfort of which those barren fragment of our isl stand so much in need whi is thi fisheri neglect and resign to the more polit and industri dutch who almost engross the exclus advantag of that trade and thu sell to us at an increas price the produc of our own coast and bay whi stamp thi shame indign on the british charact for it is in realiti a much more shame indign than ani of the offens decre of the french convent against which aristocrat and alarmist have so queril declaim i will tell you citizens—th flagrant impolici of govern is the sole caus of thi scarciti and thi insult it is thi that ha brought the countri into a situat like that of tantalu where the wave rise to our lip and yet we can not drink and the food hang down to our veri mouth and yet we can not eat to thi situat are we reduc by those who constantli engag in the intrigu of parti in the coalit of faction in the manag as it is call of major in the hous of commons—in adjust the interest of proprietor of rotten borough in dispos i had like to have said like cattl of those peopl whom they ought to preserv are too busi to attend to the insignific consider of provid for the comfort susten of million but it is not onli by their neglect that we suffer we are equal injur by their impolit regul citizen i shall read from buchanan gener view of the british fisheri what he say upon thi subject what ad greatli to the hurt of the fish trade in scotland in these latter time appear to have arisen from the regul and heavi restrict respect foreign and home made salt these are particularli hurt to the isl without storehous to suppli them with salt in their neighbourhood and the poor inhabit or fisher are incap of procur it from it extravag price when sold by merchant and it immens distanc to purchas that articl at first hand where it may be had at a moder price thi circumst deserv seriou consider all her cure for home sale are subject to a duti of one shill per barrel if use in scotland and onli threepenc or fourpenc if use in england which heavi duti must greatli retard the fisheri and is too glare an imposit to pass long without amend the customhous fee in scotland are becom a nuisanc to the adventur so heavi as to absorb the greatest part of the bounti especi on small vessel thi also call aloud for redress a man of respect name macbrid and now in london declar that he saw eighteen barrel of fresh her given for one barrel of salt to the master of a smack and three barrel for one shill sterling—th owner judg thi trifl better than to allow them to rot without salt as ha been the case befor an intellig minist on skye told the author that he had seen heap upon heap rot on the shore and until carri off to dung the ground no man durst pass by on the leeward of them for the rotten offens effluvia emit from the fish is it not better then to turn our attent to the redress of these evil than to be engag in ridicul crusad to restor a fallen despot and reinstat a superstiti priesthood in a countri where they have been torn from their pedest and trampl down by the enlighten energi of the peopl citizen it will be ask what should be the first step toward the gener reform that seem so requisite—th first step perhap i shall be expect to say is the restor of peac but ala that can not be restor till other step have been taken so long as those men now at the helm shall remain in power no more i fear must the olivebranch of peac wave over thi devot countri never more i fear must that tranquil and happi be restor to europ for which we have so long and so ardent long the first step i believ toward the redress of our nation calam must be taken by the peopl by manli and spirit but peaceabl remonstr by the unanim voic of the friend of liberti throughout the countri and i believ in that descript i includ at thi time by far the greatest part of the nation the unanim voic of the friend of liberti must be uplift against the abus and corrupt which have crept into the administr of the countri with these boldli but peaceabl we must endeavour to hurl from the seat of ill gotten power those men who jehu like are drive us to destruct we must seek for the redress of our grievanc by remov from the power of futur injuri those men to whom our present injuri are to be attribut ye citizen i believ it is necessari to shew our indign our detest our abhorr of the mad the frantic and destruct measur which the present administr are pursu but let me be understood—when i say we ought to shew our indign i mean not violence—i mean that we ought to shew that benevol feel which disdain to see the miseri of our fellow creatur without attempt to obtain redress i do not mean that by frantic impetuos you should plung the devot countri into desol i hope i have a heart that realli shudder at the idea of civil discord as much as the aristocrat hypocrit and cowardli alarmist of the day pretend and which would never consent to uplift the arm of violenc but in absolut selfdef when it is palpabl necessari to the preserv of that life or that person liberti which everi individu undoubtedli ha a right and which it is hi duti to vindic becaus without vindic that he can never have the power of discharg ani other duti to himself or hi fellow creatur by manli exert then—and by manli i mean benevol and peaceabl for furi and devast though sometim those fiend have inhabit the form of men furi and devast are not the passion of human beings—human is lost when we appeal to desol violenc by manli and spirit remonstr then i would have you seek redress and your courag and your fortitud i would have you display—bi shew what you are readi to suffer in the caus of reason and of man not what you are readi to inflict on the delud and therefor selfish antagonist of thi caus thi is the sort of energi i wish the human charact to display—thi is the sort of argument i wish to enforce—th energi of mind not the energi of the dagger—th logic of assassin but think not citizen if you should accomplish the fall of a particular faction that your work is done you may if you pleas like the fox in the fabl drive away the insati swarm of gnat that are now molest you—but when they are driven away anoth swarm still more hungri may come upon you and the devour system still go on you must show that it is principl not men you contend for—that you are indiffer to the name of a pitt or a fox that you scorn alik all parti distinct and all parti prejudices—that you vener noth but the virtuou principl of liberti and are attach to no man ani farther than as he may be the organ of thi principl the instrument by which it energi may oper for the public good if therefor a chang of men should take place think not that all is done resign not yourselv to supin rememb you must show that your spirit are teem with the love of liberti that you are seek the reform of those abus in the common hous of parliament which if you had obtain befor you never could have labour under your present calam and therefor treat with equal indign everi administr that doe not by activ exert shew it zealou attach to these principl of liberti never lose sight of thi grand polit truth that there is no redress for a nation situat as we are but in a fair full and free represent of the peopl in the common hous of parliament the follow extract from buchanan gener view of the fisheri of great britain will shew that the forego
