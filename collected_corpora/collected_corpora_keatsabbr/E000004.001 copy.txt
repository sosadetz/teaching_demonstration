mention a work or author onc while draw on him more often throughout the entri or they could summar their gener relianc upon a sourc by mention it at the begin or end of an entri there is some reason

refer to by the contributor in text or note have been translat into english where cognat did not make the translat obviou the french text that we use contain a number of term and concept that pose special translat problem some of the more problemat and recur case are as follow commerc if the context is econom trade or commerc although sometim the term seem to includ all product nonagricultur activ see intend for thi mean in french there is frequent a social mean as well as in the commerc between the sex or the commerc among men see manner for thi latter connot droit usual translat as law depend on the context it can also mean a right as in natur right a tax a tariff a duti a fee as a moral or polit adject the word can mean what is right or just we often translat it as law as in divin law civil law natur law canon law or the law of nation see loi below for a differ set of connot économi mean frugal household economi manag of resourc the term wa not use in our modern sens as a

freedom although see franchis abov loi unlik droit loi translat as law ha more consist the connot of a command or prohibit either divin or human as in our phrase lay down the law although it too broaden out metaphor to includ scientif regular such as the law of motion xlvi mœur manner moral or custom depend on the context sometim we use more when all of these mean seem to be includ moral sometim moral as a practic code sometim moral as a subject of studi pay and patri pay is a gener term for ani distinct territori whether citi or region or provinc or nation patri can also refer to these geograph divers entiti but sinc it alway mean natal land it emphas their human rather than their mere physic dimens and often carri a more emot reson homeland or fatherland which are often use to translat patri strike us as strain and awkward option for a mainli american readership accordingli in thi antholog countri will usual be use for either pay or patri but to preserv the distinct between them we capit countri to indic patri and leav it uncapit for pay polic if it refer to an entir state administr or even govern regul if it refer to a specif institut within a state cultur it can mark off the broader differ between civil and precivil societi so a gener term such as civil or law and order sometim seem best polic occur frequent in our select appear in no fewer than nineteen

the word use to denot the branch of government—th execut legisl and judici power pouvoir on the other hand is exercis by subordin diderot say it evok fear rather than the grandeur evok by puissanc and that it aris from the person attach and connect between the subject and the holder of power it is not alway clear how consciou the author repres in thi volum are of such niceti in ani case the context

where he had made himself heard for the first time cicero say in the second volum of hi studi on divin that thi god spoke when he wa not known by anyon but kept quiet the moment he had a templ and altar the god of speech becam mute as soon as he wa worship it is difficult to reconcil the singular vener that the pagan had for their god with the patienc that they also had for the discours of certain philosoph did the christian whom they persecut so much say anyth stronger than we can read in cicero the book on divin are mere irreligi treatis but what an impress must have been made on the peopl by certain piec of oratori in which the god were constantli invok and call forth to wit event in which olympian threat were recal to mind—in short where the veri exist of the pagan deiti wa presuppos by orat who had written a host of philosoph essay treat the god and religion as mere fabl can we not find the solut to all these difficulti in the scarciti of manuscript in ancient time in those day the peopl hardli read they heard the discours of their orat and these discours were alway fill with pieti toward the god but they were ignor of what the orat thought and wrote about them in the privaci of hi own hous these work were avail onli to hi friend sinc it will alway be imposs to prevent men from think and write would it not be desir to allow them to live among us as they did among the ancient the work of incredul are not to be fear for they onli affect the mass and the faith of simpl peopl those who realli think know what to believ and a pamphlet will certainli not lead them off a path which they have care chosen and follow by prefer it is not by trivial and absurd reason that a philosoph can be persuad to abandon hi god impieti is therefor not to be fear except for those who let themselv be guid but a way to reconcil the respect we owe to the faith of the mass and to public worship with freedom of thought which is extrem desir for the discoveri of truth and with public harmoni and peac without which there can not exist ani happi for either the philosoph or the peopl would be to forbid all the work against the govern and religion that are in the vernacular to allow those peopl to publish who write in a scholarli languag and to prosecut onli the translat thereof it seem to me that if we deal with the situat in thi way the nonsens that is written by certain author will not harm anyon moreov thi arrang will permit the greatest amount of freedom that can be grant in an orderli societi wherev thi privileg is not enjoy in a similar manner the countri will still be properli govern but corrupt will certainli exist in a societi where thi freedom becom more extens thi is the case i believ of the english and the dutch it seem that the peopl in these countri think that they are not free unless they can be unrestrain and write with impun the follow sentenc is an erratum that diderot place in volum of the encyclopedia if what we say in thi articl doe not
