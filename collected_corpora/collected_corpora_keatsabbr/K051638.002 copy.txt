here i wa interrupt on the honest man account he ha been here these two hour court my mamma for her daughter i suppos yet she want no court neither it is well one of us doe els the man would have noth but halcyon and be remiss and sauci of cours he wa go hi hors at the door my mamma sent for me down pretend to want to say someth to me someth she said when i came that signifi noth evid for no reason call me but to give me an opportun to see what a fine bow he could make and that he might wish me a goodnight she know i am not overreadi to oblig him with my presenc if i happen to be otherwis engag i could not help an air a littl upon the fret when i found she had noth of moment to say to me and when i saw her end she smile off the visibl fret that the man might go away in good humor with himself he bow to the ground and would have taken my hand hi whip in the other i did not like to be so companiond i withdrew my hand but touch hi elbow with a motion as if from hi low bow i had suppos him fall and would have help him up a sad slip it might have been said i a mad girl smile it off my mamma he wa put quit out took hi horsebridl stumpd back back back bow till he run against hi servant i laugh he mount hi hors rid away i mount up stair after a littl lectur and my head is so fill with him that i must resum my intent in hope to divert you for a few moment take it then hi best and hi worst as i said befor hickman is a sort of fiddl busi yet to borrow a word from you unbusi man ha a great deal to do and seem to me to dispatch noth irresolut and changeabl in everi thing but in teaz me with hi nonsens which yet it is evid he must continu upon my mamma interest more than hi own hope for none have i given him then i have a quarrel against hi face though in hi person for a wellthriven man toler genteel not to hi featur so much neither for what as you have often observ are featur in a man but hickman with strong line and big cheek and chin bone ha not the manli in hi aspect which lovelac ha with the most regular and agreeabl featur then what a set and formal mortal is he in some thing i have not been abl yet to laugh him out of hi long bib and bead inde that is becaus my mamma think it becom him and i would not be so free with him as to own i should choos to have him leav it off if he did so particular is the man he would certainli if left to himself fall into a kingwilliamcravat or some such antiqu chincushion as by the pictur of that princ one see wa then the fashion as to hi dress in gener he can not inde be call a sloven but sometim he is too gaudi at other time too plain to be uniformli eleg and for hi manner he make such a bustl with them and about them as would induc one to suspect that they are more stranger to him than familiar you i know lay thi to hi fear of disoblig or offend inde your overdo gener give the offens they endeavor to avoid the man howev is honest is of famili ha a clear and good estat and may one day be a baronet and pleas you he is human and benevol toler gener as peopl say and as i might say too if i would accept of hi bribe which he offer in hope of have them all back again and the bribe into the bargain a method taken by all corruptor from old satan to the lowest of hi servant yet to speak in the languag of a person i am bound to honor he is deem a prudent man that is a good manag then i can not say that now i like anybodi better whatev i did onc he is no foxhunt keep a pack inde but prefer not hi hound to hi fellow creatur no bad sign for a wife i own love hi hors but dislik race in a game way as well as all sort of game then he is sober modest they say virtuou in short ha qualiti that mother would be fond of in a husband for their daughter and for which perhap their daughter would be the happier could they judg as well for themselv as experi possibl may teach them to judg for their futur daughter nevertheless to own the truth i can not say i love the man nor ever shall i believ strang that these sober fellow can not have a decent sprightli a modest assur with them someth debonnair which need not be separ from that awe and rever when they address a woman which should show the ardor of their passion rather than the sheepish of their natur for who know not that love delight in tame the lyonheart that those of the sex who are most consciou of their own defect in point of courag natur requir and therefor as natur prefer the man who ha most of it as the most abl to give them the requisit protect that the greater their own cowardic as it would be call in a man the greater is their delight in subject of heroism as may be observ in their read which turn upon difficulti encount battl fought and enemi overcom or by the prowess of one singl hero the more improb the better in short that their man should be a hero to everi one live but themselv and to them know no bound to hi humil a woman ha some glori in subdu a heart no man live can appal and henc too often the bravo assum the hero and make himself pass for one succe as onli a hero should but as for honest hickman the good man is so gener meek as i imagin that i know not whether i have ani prefer paid me in hi obsequi and then when i rate him he seem to be so natur fit for rebuk and so much expect it that i know not how to disappoint him whether he just then deserv it or not i am sure he ha puzzl me mani a time when i have seen him look penit for fault he ha not commit whether to piti or laugh at him you and i have often retrospect the face and mind of grown peopl that is to say have form imag from their present appear outsid and in as far as the manner of the person would justifi us in the latter what sort of figur they made when boy and girl and i will tell you the light in which hickman solm and lovelac our three hero have appear to me suppos them boy at school solm i have imagin to be a littl sordid pilfer rogu who would purloin from everybodi and beg everi boy bread and butter from him while as i have heard a reptil brag he would in a wintermorn spit upon hi thumb and spread hi own with it that he might keep it all to himself hickman a great overgrown lankhaird chubbi boy who would be hunchd and punchd by everybodi and go home with hi finger in hi eye and tell hi mother while lovelac i have suppos a curlpat villain full of fire fanci and mischief an orchardrobb a wallclimb a horserid without saddl or bridl neck or noth a sturdi rogu in short who would kick and cuff and do no right and take no wrong of anybodi would get hi head broke then a plaster for it or let it heal of itself while he went on to do more mischief and if not to get to deserv broken bone and the same disposit have grown up with them and distinguish the men with no veri materi alter onli that all men

the world and would one day make a great figur in hi countri for there wa noth he wa not capabl of i am afraid that thi is too true and thi my dear is all that mr hickman could pick up about him and is it not enough to determin such a mind as your if not alreadi determin yet it must be said too that if there be a woman in the world that can reclaim him it is you and by your account of hi behavior

the reput of a famili so splendid would no doubt in a case of such import to the honor of both make them prefer a gener consent i told him as you yourself i knew had done that you were extrem avers to mr solm and that might you be left to your own choic it would be the singl life as to himself i plainli said that you had great and just object to him on the score of hi careless moral that it wa surpris that young gentlemen who gave themselv the liberti he wa said to take should presum to think that whenev they took it into their head to marri the most virtuou and worthi of the sex were to fall to their lot that as to the resumpt it had been veri strongli urg by myself and would be more though you had been avers to it hitherto that your chief relianc and hope were upon your cousin morden and that to suspend or gain time till he arriv wa as i believ your princip aim i told him that with regard to the mischief he threaten neither the act nor the menac could serv ani end but their who persecut you as it would give them a pretens for carri into effect their compulsatori project and that with the approb of all the world sinc he must not think the public would give it voic in favor of a violent young man of no extraordinari charact as to moral who should seek to rob a famili of emin of a child so valuabl and who threaten if he could not obtain her in prefer to a man chosen by themselv that he would aveng himself upon them all by act of violenc i ad that he wa veri much mistaken if he thought to intimid you by such menac for that though your disposit wa all sweet yet i knew not a steadier temper in the world than your nor one more inflex as your friend had found and would still farther find if they continu to give occas for it exert whenev you thought yourself in

to be actual forc into the arm of a man you hate that were thi to be the case he must own that he should pay veri littl regard to the world or it censur especi as the menac of some of your famili now and their triumph over him afterward would both provok and warrant all the vengeanc he could take he ad that all the countri in the world were alik to him but on your account so that whatev he should think fit to do were you lost to him he should have noth to apprehend from the law of thi i did not like the determin air he spoke thi with he is certainli my dear capabl of great rash he palliat a littl thi fierc which by the way i warmli censur by say that while you remain singl he will bear all the indign that shall be cast upon him by your famili but would you throw yourself if you werer still farther driven into ani other protect if not hi uncl or that of the ladi of hi famili into my mamma suppos or would you go to london to privat lodg where he would never visit you unless he had your leav and from whenc you might make your own term with your relat he would be entir satisfi and would as he had said befor wait the effect of your cousin arriv and your free determin as to hi own fate ad that he knew the famili so well and how much fix they were upon their measur as well as the absolut depend they made upon your temper and principl that he could not but apprehend the worst while you remain in the power of their persuas and menac we had a great deal of other discours but as the recit of the rest would be but a repetit of mani of the thing that pass between you and him in the interview between you in the woodhous i refer myself to your memori on that occas see vol i letter xxxvi and now my dear upon the whole i think it behoov you to make yourself independ all then

she had said a good thing without know the bold of it i let it pass but to say the truth thi creatur ha surpris me on mani occas with her smart for sinc she ha been employ in thi controul offic i have discov a great deal of wit in her assur which i never suspect befor thi show that insol is her talent and that fortun in place her as a servant to my sister ha not done so kindli by her as natur for that she would make a better figur as her companion and inde i can not help think sometim that i myself wa better fit by natur to be the servant of both than the mistress of the one or the sister of the other and within these few month past fortun ha act by me as if she were of the same mind friday ten oclock go down to my poultryyard just now i heard my brother and sister and that solm laugh and

my futur peac but i have no doubt that they hate me heartili inde you wa up with her there brother said my sister you need not have bid her not write to you i will engag with all her wit she will never pretend to answer it whi inde said my brother with an air of collegesuffici with which he abound for he think nobodi write like himself i believ i have given her a choakpear what say you mr solm

thi method to reced her cousin morden will soon be here so all must be over befor that time or she will be made independ of us all there miss how is the reason given for their jehudriv mr solm declar that he wa determin to persever while my brother gave him ani hope and while my father stood firm my sister told my brother that he hit me charmingli on the reason whi i ought to convers with mr solm

storm at your sister for tell it you sinc you seem in your letter to make it your boast how you turn my mamma and my aunt hervey against me than i have to be angri with my brother for treat me as no brother ought to treat a sister these are my new propos then that as abov i may not be hinder from go to resid under such condit as shall be prescrib to me which i will most religi observ at my grandfath late hous i will not again in thi place call it mine i have reason to think it a great misfortun that ever it wa so inde i have if thi be not permit i desir leav to go for a month or for

visit there and then i will as cheer go as ever i did so here sir are my new propos and if none of them answer your end as each of them tend to the exclus of that ungener persist visit be pleas to know that there is no misfortun i will not submit to rather than yield to give my hand to the man to whom i can allow no share in my heart if i write in a style differ from my usual and differ from what i wish to have occas to write an imparti person who knew what i have accident within thi hour past heard from your mouth and my sister and a third person particularli the reason you give for drive on at thi violent rate to wit my cousin morden soonexpect arriv would think i have but too much reason for it then be pleas to rememb sir that when my whine voc have subject me to so much scorn and ridicul it is time were it but to imit exampl so excel as you and my sister set me that i should endeavor to assert my charact in order to be thought less an alien and nearer of
