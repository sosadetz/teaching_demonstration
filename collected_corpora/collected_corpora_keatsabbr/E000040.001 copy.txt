that either of them had ani thing in their inclin that wa not perfectli consist with innoc yet it is certain they both languish for a nearer convers which the fertil brain of miss forward at last brought about she pretend one sunday in the afternoon to have so violent a pain in her head that she could not go to church miss betsi beg leav to stay and keep her compani and told the gover she

artific she made use of in order to secur the continu of hi address so that thu earli initi into the mysteri of courtship it is not to be wonder at that when she came to the practic she wa so littl at a loss thi intercours howev last but a small time their meet were too frequent and too littl circumspect use in them not to be liabl to discoveri the gover wa inform that in spite of all her care the young folk had been too cun for her on which she went to the father of sparkish acquaint him with what she knew of the affair and intreat he would lay hi command on hi son to refrain all convers with

short time he have finish hi schoollearn and wa soon to go to the univers to prevent also ani futur strategem be laid between miss betsi and miss forward she took care to keep them from ever be alon togeth which wa a veri great mortif to them but a sudden turn soon after happen in the affair of miss betsi which put all i have been relat entir out of her head chapter ii shew miss betsi in a new scene of life and the frequent opportun she had of put in practic those lesson she wa begin to receiv from her young instructress at the boardingschool though it is certainli necessari to inculc into young girl all imagin precaut in regard to their behaviour toward those of anoth sex yet i know not if it is not an error to dwell too much upon that topick miss betsi might possibl have sooner forgot the littl artific she had seen practis by miss forward if her gover by too strenuous endeavour to convinc her how unbecom they were had not remind her of them besid the good old gentlewoman wa far stricken in year time had set hi iron finger on her cheek had left hi cruel mark on everi featur of her face and she had littl remain of have ever been capabl of excit those inclin she so much condemn so that what she said seem to miss betsi as spoke out of envi or to shew her author rather than the real dictat of truth i have often remark that reproof from the old and ugli have much less efficaci than when given by person less advanc in year and who may be suppos not altogeth past sensibl themselv of the gaieti they advis other to avoid though all the old gentlewoman said could not persuad miss betsi there wa ani harm in miss forward behaviour toward young sparkish yet she had the complais to listen to her with all the attent the other could expect or desir from her she wa inde as yet too young to consid of the justic of the other reason and her futur conduct shew also she wa not of a humour to give herself much pain in examin or weigh in the balanc of judgment the merit of the argument she heard urg whether for or against ani point whatsoev she had a great deal of wit but wa too vol for reflect and as a ship without suffici ballast is toss about at the pleasur of everi wind

gentlemen of unquestion integr and with whom he had preserv a long and uninterrupt friendship on the arriv of thi melancholi news miss betsi felt as much grief as it wa possibl for a heart so young and gay as her to be capabl of but a littl time for the most part serv to obliter the memori of misfortun of thi natur even in person of a riper age and had miss betsi been more afflict than she wa someth happen soon after which would have veri much contribut to her consol mr goodman have live without marri till he had reach an age which one should have imagin would have prevent him from think

reason against her thi ladi wa no sooner inform of the trust impos in him than she told him she thought it would be highli proper for miss betsi to be sent for from the school and board with them not onli as her daughter would be a fine companion for that young orphan they be much of the same age and she herself wa more capabl of improv her mind than ani gover of a school could be suppos to be but that also have her under her own eye he would be more abl to discharg hi duti toward her as a guardian than if she were at the distanc of near an hundr mile there wa someth in thi propos which had inde the face of a great deal of goodnatur and consider for miss betsi at least it seem highli so to mr goodman but as sir ralph trusti wa join with him in the guardianship of that young beauti and wa at that time in london he thought it proper to consult him on the occas which have done and find no object on the part of the other ladi mellasin to shew her great complais to the daughter of her husband deceas friend sent her own woman to bring her from the boardingschool and attend her up to london miss betsi had never seen thi great metropoli but had heard so much of the gay manner in which the genteel part of the world pass their time in it that she wa quit transport at be told she wa to be remov thither mr prink for so ladi mellasin woman wa call did not fail to heighten her idea of the pleasur of the place to which she wa go nor to magnifi the good of her ladi in take her under her care with the most extravag encomium it is not therefor to be wonder at that neither the tear of the good gover who truli love her nor those of her dear miss forward nor of ani of those she left behind could give her ani more than a momentari regret to a heart so possess with the expect of go to receiv everi thing with which youth is liabl to be enchant she promis howev to keep up a correspond by letter which she did till thing that seem to her of much more import put her le acquaint entir out of her head she wa met at the inn where the stage put up by mr goodman in hi own coach accompani by miss flora the good old gentleman embrac her with the utmost tender and assur her that noth in hi power or in that of hi famili would be want to compens as much as possibl the loss she had sustain by the death of her parent the young ladi also said mani oblig thing to her and they seem highli taken with each other at thi first interview which gave the honest heart of goodman an infinit satisfact the recept given her by ladi mellasin when brought home and present to her by her husband wa conform to what mr prink had made her expect that ladi omit noth to make her certain of be alway treat by her with the same affect as her own daughter sir ralph trusti on be inform hi young charg wa come to town came the next day to mr goodman to visit her hi ladi accompani him there had been a great intimaci and friendship between her and the mother of miss betsi and she could not hold in her arm the child of a person so dear to her without let fall some tear which were look upon by the compani as the tribut due to the memori of the dead the conjectur in part might be true but the flow proceed from the mixtur of anoth motiv not suspectedthat of compass for the live thi ladi wa a woman of great prudenc pieti and virtu she had heard mani thing relat to the conduct of ladi mellasin which made her think her a veri unfit person to have the care of youth especi those of her own sex she had been extrem troubl when sir ralph told her that miss betsi wa sent for from the countri to live under such tuition and would have fain oppos it could she have done so without danger of creat a misunderstand between him and mr goodman well know the bigot respect the latter had for hi wife and how unwil he would be to do ani thing that had the least tendenc to thwart her inclin she commun her sentiment howev on thi occas to no person in the world not even to her own husband but resolv within herself to take all the opportun that fell in her way of give miss betsi such instruct as she thought necessari for her behaviour in gener and especi toward the famili in which it wa her lot to be place miss betsi wa now just enter into her fourteenth year a nice and delic time in person of her sex sinc it is then they are most apt to take the bent of impress which accord as it is well or ill direct make or mar the futur prospect of their live she wa tall wellshap and perfectli amiabl without be what is call a compleat beauti and as she want noth to render her liabl to the greatest temptat so she stood in need of the surest arm for her defenc against them but while thi worthi ladi wa full of care for the well do of a young creatur who appear so deserv of regard miss betsi thought she had the highest reason to be satisfi with her situat and how inde could it be otherwis ladi mellasin kept a great deal of compani she receiv visit everi morn from ten to one oclock from the most gay and polit of both sex all the news of the town wa talk on at her leve and it seldom happen that some parti of pleasur wa not form for the ensu even in all which miss betsi and miss flora had their share never did the mistress of a privat famili indulg herself and those about her with such a continu round of publick divers the court the play the ball and opera with give and receiv visit engross all the time that could be spare from the toilett it can not therefor seem strang that miss betsi to whom all these thing were entir new should have her head turn with the promiscu enjoy and the veri power of reflect lost amidst the giddi whirl nor that it should be so long befor she could recov it enough to see the littl true felic of such a cours of life among the mani topick with which thi brilliant societi entertain each other it may easili be suppos that love and gallantri were not exclud ladi mellasin though turn of forti had her fine thing said to her but both heaven and earth were ransack for comparison in favour of the beauti of miss flora and miss betsi but as there wa noth particular in these kind of address intend onli to shew the wit of those who made them these young ladi answer them onli with railleri in which art miss betsi soon learn to excel she had the glori howev of be the first who excit a real passion in the heart of ani of those who visit ladi mellasin though be accustom to hear declar which had the appear of love yet were realli no more than word of cours and made indiscrimin to everi fine woman she would not present persuad herself that thi wa more seriou the first victim of her charm wa the onli son of a veri rich alderman and have a fortun left him by a relat independ of hi father who wa the greatest miser in the world he wa furnish with the mean of mingl with the beau mond and of make one at everi divers that wa propos he had fanci miss flora a mighti fine creatur befor he saw miss betsi but the imaginari flame he had for her wa soon convert into a sincer one for the other he truli love her and wa almost distract at the littl credit she gave to hi profess hi persever hi trembl whenev he approach her hi transport on see her hi anxieti at take leav so differ from what she had observ in ani other of those who had pretend to lift themselv under the banner of her charm at length convinc her of the conquest she had made awaken in her breast that vaniti so natur to a youth mind she exult she plume herself she use him ill and well by turn take an equal pleasur in rais or depress hi hope and in spite of her goodnatur felt no satisfact superior to that of the conscious of a power of give pain to the man who love her but with how great a mortif thi shortliv triumph wa succeed the reader shall present be made sensibl chapter iii afford matter of condol or railleri accord to the humour the reader happen to be in for either we often see that the less encourag is given to the lover suit with the more warmth and eager he prosecut it and mani peopl are apt to ascrib thi hopeless persever to an odd pervers in the veri natur of love but for my part i rather take it to proceed from an ambit of surmount difficulti it is not howev my provinc to enter into ani discuss of so nice a point i deal onli in matter of fact and shall not meddl with definit it wa not till after miss betsi had reason to believ she had engag the heart of her lover too far for him to recal it that she began to take a pride in torment while she look on hi address as of a piec with those who call themselv her admir she had treat him in that manner which she thought would most conduc to make him realli so but no sooner did she perceiv by the token befor mention that hi passion wa of the most seriou natur than she behav to him in a fashion quit the revers especi befor compani for as she had not the least affect or even a like toward him hi submiss deport under the most cold sometim contemptu carriag could afford her no other satisfact than as she fanci it shew the power of her beauti and piqu those ladi of her acquaint who could not boast of such an implicit resign and patient suffer from their lover in particular miss flora who she could not forbear imagin look veri grave on the occas what foundat there wa for a conjectur of thi natur wa nevertheless undiscover till a long time after as thi courtship wa no secret to ani of the famili mr goodman thought himself oblig both as the guardian of miss betsi and the friend of alderman save for so the father of thi young enamorato wa call to enquir upon what foot it stood he thought that if the old man knew and approv of hi son inclin he would have mention the affair to him as they frequent saw each other and it seem to him neither for the interest nor reput of hi fair charg to receiv the clandestin address of ani man whatsoev she had a handsom fortun of her own and he thought that and her person accomplish suffici entitl her to as good a match as mr save but then he knew the sordid natur of the alderman and that all the merit of miss betsi would add noth in the balanc if her money wa found too light to pois against the sum hi son would be possess of thi be the case he doubt not but that he wa kept in ignor of the young man intent and fear the matter might be carri too far resolv either to put a stop to it at onc or permit it to go on on such term as should free him from all censur from the one or the other parti on talk serious to the lover he soon found the suggest he had entertain had not deceiv him young save frankli confess that hi father had other view for him but ad that if he could prevail on the young ladi to marri him he did not despair but that when the thing wa onc done and past recal the alderman would by degre receiv them into favour you know sir said he that he ha no child but me nor ani kindr for whom he ha the least regard and it can not be suppos he would utterli discard me for follow my inclin in thi point especi as they are in favour of the most amiabl and deserv of her sex he said much more on thi head but it had no weight with the merchant he answer that if the alderman wa of hi way of think all the flatter hope hi passion suggest to him on that score might be realiz but that accord to the disposit he knew him to be of he saw but littl room to think he would forgiv a step of thi kind therefor continu he i can not allow thi loveaffair to be prosecut ani farther and must desir you will desist visit at my hous till you have either conquer thi inclin or miss betsi is otherwis dispos of thi wa a cruel sentenc for the truli affection save but he found it in vain to solicit a repeal of it and all he could obtain from him wa a promis to say noth of what had pass to the alderman mr goodman would have thought he had but half compleat hi duti had he neglect to sound the inclin of miss betsi on thi account and in order to come more easili at the truth he began with talk to her in a manner which might make her look on him rather as a favour of mr save pretens than the contrari and wa extrem glad to find by her repli how indiffer that young lover wa to her he then acquaint her with the resolut he had taken and the discours he had just had with him and to keep her from ever after encourag the address of ani man without be author by the consent of friend on both side repres in the most pathetick term he wa abl the danger to which a privat correspond render a young woman liabl she seem convinc of the truth of what he said and promis to follow in the strictest manner hi advic whether she thought herself in realiti so much oblig to the conduct of her guardian in thi i will not take upon me to say for though she wa not charm with the person of mr save it is certain she took an infinit pleasur in the assidu of hi passion it is therefor highli probabl that she might imagin he meddl in thi affair more than he had ani occas to have done she had howev but littl time for reflect on her guardian behaviour an accid happen which shew her own to her in a light veri differ from what she had ever seen it ladi mellasin had a ball at her hous there wa a great deal of compani among whom wa a gentleman name gayland he wa a man of familyhad a larg estatesung danc spoke french dress wellfrequ success among the women had render him extrem vain and as he had too great an admir for hi own person to be possess of ani great share of it for that of ani other he enjoy the pleasur of love without be sensibl of the pain thi darl of the fair it wa that miss betsi pick out to treat with the most peculiar mark of esteem whenev she had a mind to give umbrag to poor save much had that faith lover suffer on the account of thi fop but the fair inflictor of hi torment wa punish for her insens and ingratitud by a way her inexperi of the world and the temper of mankind in gener had made her far from apprehend while the compani were employ some in danc and other in particular convers the beau found an opportun to slip into miss betsi hand a littl billet say to her at the same time you have got my heart and thi littl bit of paper will convey to you the sentiment it is inspir with in your favour she imagin it wa either a sonnet or epistl in prais of her beauti receiv it with a smile and put it in her pocket after everi bodi had taken leav and she wa

j gayland imposs it is to express the mingl emot of shame surpriz and indign which fill the breast of miss betsi on read thi bold invit she threw the letter on the ground she stamp upon it she spurn it and would have treat the author in the same manner had he been present but the first transport of so just a resent be over a conscious of have by a too free behaviour toward him embolden him to take thi liberti involv her in the utmost confus and she wa littl less enrag with herself than she had reason to be with him she could have tore out her veri eye for have affect to look kindli upon a wretch who durst presum so far on her suppos affect and though she spare those pretti twinkler that violenc she half drown their lustr in a delug of tear never wa a night pass in more cruel anxieti than what she sustain both from the affront she had receiv and the reflect that it wa chiefli the folli of her own conduct which had brought it on her and what greatli ad to her vexat wa the uncertainti how it would best becom her to act on an occas which appear so extraordinari to her she had no friend whom she thought it proper to consult she wa asham to relat the stori to ani of the discreet and seriou part of her acquaint she fear their reproof for have counterfeit a tender for a man which she wa now sensibl she ought if it had been real rather to have conceal with the utmost care both from him and all the world and as for ladi mellasin and miss flora though their conduct inspir her not with ani manner of awe yet she thought she saw someth in those ladi which did not promis much sincer and shew as if they would rather turn her complaint into ridicul than afford her that cordial and friendli advic she stood in need of these were the reason which determin her to keep the whole thing a secret from everi one at first she wa tempt to write to gayland and testifi her disdain of hi presumpt in term which should convinc him how grossli hi vaniti had impos upon him but she afterward consid that a letter from her wa do him too much honour and though ever so reproach might draw anoth from him either to excus and beg pardon for the temer of the former or possibl to affront her a second time by defend it and repeat hi request she despis and hate him too much to engag in a correspond with him of ani kind and therefor resolv as it wa certainli most prudent not to let him have ani thing under her hand but when next she saw him to shew her resent by such way as occas should permit he came not to mr goodman howev for three day possibl wait that time for a letter from miss betsi but on the fourth he appear at ladi mellasin teatabl there were besid the famili sever other present so that he had not an opportun of speak in privat to miss betsi but the look she gave him so differ from all he had ever seen her assum toward him might have shewn ani man not blind with hi vaniti how much she wa offend but he imagin her illhumour proceed onli from the want of mean to send to him came again the next day and happen to find her alon in the parlour what my dear said he take her in a free manner by the hand have you been so close watch by your guardian and guardia here that no kind moment offer for you to answer the devoir of your humbl servantth surest guardian of my fame and peac repli she snatch her hand away is the littl share of understand i am mistress of which i hope will alway be suffici to defend my honour in more danger attack than the rude impertin of an idl coxcomb these word and the air with which they were spoke one would think should have struck with confus the person to whom they were direct but gayland wa not so easili put out of counten and look her full in the faceah child cri he sure you are not in your right sens today understandingimpertinencesidl coxcomb veri pleasant ifaith but upon my soul if you think these air becom you you are the most mistaken woman in the worldit may be so cri she readi to burst with inward spite at hi insol but i should be yet more mistaken if i were capabl of think a wretch like you worthi of ani thing but contempt with these word she flung out of the room and he pursu her with a horselaugh till she wa out of hear and then went into the dine room where he found ladi mellasin and sever who had come to visit her miss betsi who had gone directli to her own chamber sent to excus come down to tea pretend a violent headach nor would be prevail upon to join the compani till she heard gayland had taken hi leav which he did much sooner than usual be probabl a good deal disconcert at the shock hi vaniti had receiv chapter iv verifi the old proverb that one afflict tread upon the heel of anoth as miss betsi wa prevent from discov to ani one the impud attempt gayland had made on her virtu by the shame of have embolden him to it by too unreserv a behaviour so also the shame of the disappoint and rebuff he had receiv from her kept him from say ani thing of what had pass between them and thi resolut on both side render it veri difficult for either of them to behav to the other so as not to give some suspicion betsi could not alway avoid see him when he came to ladi mellasin

head toward the window and ran to the door look up and down the street as if she expect somebodi who wa not yet come miss betsi could not forbear be shock at a disappoint which wa the last thing in the world she could have apprehend she had notwithstand the patienc to wait from a littl past eleven till near two oclock expect dure everi moment of that time that he would either come or send some excus for not do so but find he did neither and that it wa near the hour in which mr goodman usual dine she took her leav of the woman and went home full of agit the maid who wa in the secret happen

better and not doubt but the next morn she should receiv a letter with a full eclairciss of thi affair she enjoy the same sweet repos as if noth had happen to ruffl her temper the morn came but brought no billet from that onc obsequi lover the next and three or four succeed one were barren of the fruit she so much expect what judgment could she form of an event so odd she could not bring

alderman save could enabl her to throw off the vexat in which hi late behaviour had involv her had the motiv been the most mortifi of ani that could be imagin to her vaniti pride and resent would then have come to her assist she would have despis the author of the insult and in time have forgot the insult itself but the uncertainti in what manner she ought to think of the man and thi last action of hi made both dwell much longer on her mind than otherwis they would have done as the poet truli say when puzzl doubt the anxiou bosom seiz to know the worst is some degre of eas thi is a maxim which will hold good even when the strongest and most violent passion oper but miss betsi wa possess of no more than a bare curios which as she had as yet no other sensat that demand gratif wa suffici pain to her it wa about ten or twelv day that she continu to labour under thi dilemma but at the expir of that time wa partli reliev from it by the follow mean mr goodman happen to meet alderman save with whom he had great busi upon chang desir he would accompani him to an adjac tavern to which the other compli but with an air much more grave and reserv than he wa accustom to put on with a person whom he had known for a great number of year and wa concern with in some affair of traffick they went togeth to the ship tavern after have end what they had to say to each other upon businessmr goodman said the alderman we have long been friend i alway thought you an honest fairdeal man and am therefor veri much surpriz you should go about to put upon me in the manner you have late doneput upon you

with a sneer to endeavour to draw my onli son into a clandestin marriag with the girl you have at your hous mr goodman wa astonish as well he might at thi accus and perceiv by some other word that the alderman let fall that he wa well acquaint with the love young save had profess for miss betsi frankli relat to him all that he knew of the courtship and the method he had taken to put a stop to it that wa not enough sir cri the alderman hastili you should have told me of it do you think young folk like them would have regard your forbid no no ill warrant you they would have found some way or other to come togeth befor now and the boy might have been ruin if i had not been inform by other hand how thing were carri on and put it out of the power of ani of you to impos upon me the girl may spread her net to catch some other woodcock if she can thank to heaven and my own prudenc my son is far enough out of her reach mr goodman though one of the bestnatur men in the world could not keep himself from be a littl ruffl at the alderman discours and told him that though he had been far from encourag mr save inclin and should alway think it the duti of a son to consult hi father in everi thing he did especi in so materi a point as that of marriag yet he saw no reason for treat miss betsi with contempt as she wa of a good famili had a veri pretti fortun of her own and suitabl accomplish you take a great deal of pain to set her off said the alderman and sinc you marri a courtladi not worth a groat have got all the romantick idl notion of the other end of the town as fine as if you had been bred there a good familyveri pleasant ifaith will a good famili go to market will it buy a joint of mutton at the butcher or a pretti gown at the mercersthen a pretti fortun you sayenough it may be to squander away at card or masquerad for a month or two she ha suitabl accomplish tooy inde they are suitabl one i believei suppos she can sing danc and jabber a littl french but ill be hang if she know how to make a pye or a pud or to teach her maid to do it the reflect on ladi mellasin in the begin of thi speech so much incens mr goodman that he could scarc attend to the latter part of it he forbor interrupt him howev but as soon as he had done speak repli in term which shew hi resent in fine such hot word pass between them as had they been younger men might have produc wors consequ but the spirit of both be equal evapor in mutual reproach they grew more calm and at last talk themselv into as good harmoni as ever mr goodman said he wa sorri that he had been prevail upon by the young man intreati to keep hi courtship to miss betsi a secret and the alderman beg pardon in hi turn for have said ani thing disrespect of ladi mellasin on thi they shook hand anoth halfpint of sherri wa call for and befor they part the alderman acquaint mr goodman that to prevent entir all futur correspond between hi son and miss betsi he had sent him to holland some day ago without let him know ani thing of hi intent till everi thing wa readi for hi embark i sent said he the night befor he wa to go hi portmanteau and what other luggag i thought he would have occas for to the inn where the harwich stage put up and make him be call up veri earli in the morn told him he must go a littl way out of town with me upon extraordinari busi he seem veri unwil said he had appoint that morn to meet a gentleman and beg i would delay the journey to the next day or even till the afternoon what caus thi backward i can not imagin for i think it wa imposs he could know my design on thi score but whatev wa in hi head i took care to disappoint it i listen to none of hi excus nor trust him out of my sight but forc him to go with me to the coach in which i had secur a coupl of place he wa horribl shock when he found where he wa go and would fain have persuad me to repeal hi banish as he call it i laugh in my sleev but took no notic of the real motiv i had for send him away and told him there wa an absolut necess for hi departur that i had a busi of the greatest import at rotterdam in which i could trust nobodi but himself to negoci and that he would find in hi trunk letter and other paper which would instruct him how to act in fine continu the alderman i went with him aboard staid with him till they were readi to weigh anchor then return and stood on the beach till the ship sail quit out of sight so that if my gentleman had a thought of write to hi mistress he had not the least opportun for it he ad that he did not altogeth deceiv hi son have inde some affair to transact at rotterdam though they were not of the mighti consequ he had pretend but which he had by a privat letter to hi agent there order should be made appear as intric and perplex as possibl that the young gentleman return might be delay as long as there wa ani plausibl excus for detain him without hi see through the reason of it mr goodman prais the alderman discret in the whole conduct of thi busi and to aton for have been prevail upon to keep young save secret from him offer to make interest with a friend he had at the postoffic to stop ani letter that should be direct to miss betsi thoughtless by the way of holland by which mean said he all commun between the young peopl will soon be put an end to he will grow weari of write letter when he receiv no answer and she of think of him as a lover when she find he ceas to tell her he is so the alderman wa readi to hug hi old friend for thi propos which it is certain he made in the sincer of hi heart for they no sooner part then he went to the offic and fulfil hi promis when he came home in order to hinder miss betsi from expect to hear ani thing more of mr save he told her he had been treat by the alderman pretti roughli on account of the encourag that had been given in hi hous to the amor address which had been made to her by hi son and ad he the old man is so incens against him for have a thought of that kind in your favour that he ha sent him beyond seai know not to what part but it seem he is never to come back till he ha given full assur the like he ha for you is utterli worn off he might have spare himself the pain said miss betsi blush with disdain hi son could have inform him how littl i wa inclin to listen to ani thing he said on the score of love and i myself if he had ask me the question would have given him the strongest assur that word could form that if ever i chang my condit which heaven know i am far from think on as yet i should never be prevail upon to do it by ani merit hi son wa possess of mr goodman congratul her on the indiffer she express and told her he hope she would alway continu in the same humour till an offer which promis more satisfact in marriag should happen to be made noth more wa said on thi head but miss betsi upon rumin on what mr goodman had relat easili imagin that the day in which he had been sent away wa the same on which he had appoint to meet her and therefor excus hi not come as a thing unavoid yet as she knew not the precaut hi father had taken wa not so readi to forgiv him for not send a line to prevent her wait so long for him at the habitshop she could not howev when she reflect on the whole tenor of hi deport to her think it possibl he should all at onc becom guilti of wil omit what even common good manner and decenc requir she soon grew weari howev of troubl herself about the matter and a veri few day serv to make her lose even the memori of it chapter vi may be of some servic to the ladi especi the younger sort if well attend to miss betsi had now no person that profess a seriou passion for her but as she had yet never seen the man capabl of inspir her with the least emot of tender she wa quit easi as to that point and wish noth beyond what she enjoy the pleasur of be told she wa veri handsom and gallant about by a great number of those who go by the name of veri pretti fellow pleas with

her so much prefer to themselv yet chose to be as much with her as possibl in the cruel hope of find some fresh manner wherewith to blast her reput certain it is that though she wa as far remov as innoc itself from all intent or wish of commit a real ill yet she paid too littl regard to the appear of it and said and did mani thing which the actual crimin would be more cautiou to avoid hurri by an excess of vaniti and that love of pleasur so natur to youth she indulg herself in liberti of which she foresaw not the consequ ladi trusti who sincer love her both for her own sake and that of her deceas mother came more often to mr goodman than otherwis she would have done on purpos to observ the behaviour of miss betsi she had heard some account which gave her great dissatisfact but as she wa a woman of penetr she easili perceiv that plain reproof wa not the way to prevail on her to reclaim the error of her conduct that she must be insens wean from what at present she took so much delight in and brought into a differ manner of live by way which should rather seem to flatter than check her vaniti she therefor earnestli wish to get her down with her into le where she wa soon go herself but knew not how to ask her without make the same invit to miss flora whose compani she no way desir and whose exampl she wa sensibl had veri much contribut to give miss betsi that air of leviti which render her good sens almost useless to her thi worthi ladi happen to find her alon one day a thing not veri usual she ask by way of sound her inclin if she would not be glad to see le again to which she repli that there were mani peopl for whom she had a veri great respect but the journey wa too long to be taken mere on the score of make a short visit for she own she did not like the countri well enough to continu in it for ani length of time ladi trusti would fain have persuad her into a better opinion of the place she wa born in and which most of her famili had pass the greatest part of their live in but miss betsi wa not to be argu into ani toler idea of it and plainli told her ladyship that what she call a happi tranquil manner of spend one day seem to her littl better than be buri aliv from declar her avers to a countri life she ran into such extravag encomium on those variou amus which london everi day present that ladi trusti perceiv it would not be without great difficulti she would be brought to a more just way of think she conceal howev as much as possibl the concern it gave her to hear her express herself in thi manner content herself with say calmli that london wa inde a veri agreeabl place to live in especi for young peopl and the pleasur it afford were veri eleg but then said she the too frequent repetit of them may so much engross the mind as to take it off from other object which ought to have their share in it besid continu she there are but too frequent proof that an innat principl of virtu is not alway a suffici guard against the mani snare laid for

victori turn alway to our glori the world is censori and seldom readi to put the best construct on thing so that reput may suffer though virtu triumph miss betsi listen to all thi with a good deal of attent the impud attempt gayland had made on her came fresh into her mind and made thi ladi remonstr sink the deeper into it the power of reflect be a littl awaken in her some freedom also not altogeth consist with strict modesti which other had offer to her convinc her of the error of maintain too littl reserv she thank her kind advis and promis to observ the precept she had given ladi trusti find thi good effect of what she had said ventur to proceed so far as to give some hint that the conduct of miss flora had been far from blameless and therefor pursu she i should be glad methink to see you separ from that young ladi though it were but for a small time and then gave her to understand how great a pleasur it would be to her to get her down with her to le if it could be ani way contriv that she should go without miss flora as i have been so long from home said she i know i shall have all the gentri round the countri to welcom me at my return and if you should find the compani less polit than those you leav behind it will at least diversifi the scene and render the entertain of london new to you a second time when you come back miss betsi found in herself a strong inclin to compli with thi propos and told ladi trusti she should think herself happi in pass the whole summer with her and as to miss flora the same offer might be made to her without ani danger of her accept it i am not of your opinion said the other the girl ha no fortun but what mr goodman shall be pleas to give her which can not be veri consider as he ha a nephew in the east indi whom he is extrem fond of and will make hi heir ladi mellasin would therefor catch at the opportun of send her daughter to a place where there are so mani gentlemen of estat among whom she might have a better chanc for get a husband than she can have in london where her charact would scarc entitl her to such a hope i will howev pursu she run the risqu and chuse rather to have a guest whose compani
