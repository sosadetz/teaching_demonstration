prosper from the same spring not my lord that i think opul a real benefit to a peopl for man life consist not in the abund of hi possess but i look upon industri the natur parent of opul to be as well a bless as a duti to man from the time that he wa appoint to earn hi bread in the sweat of hi brow mani mental virtu also as well as tempor benefit follow in the train of industri it make men health brave honest social and pacif he who labor hard to acquir a properti will struggl hard to preserv it and exercis will make him activ robust and abl for the purpos as the man of industri ha in himself a live fund of compet for hi own occas he will be the less tempt to plunder or prey upon other and the poignant sens and apprehens of be depriv of a properti so justli acquir will give him the nicer and stronger sens of such an injuri to other industri further incit to commerc and good neighborhood in order to dispos of mutual redund for the suppli of mutual want and lastli it delight in peac that it time and it labor may not be interrupt nor the fruit thereof endang by rapin and invas and all thi may be said of nation as well as of men your observ said the earl are perfectli just the work of industri are unquestion the work of peac and tend to open the avenu wherein the virtu may walk but how to incit men or nation to industri that is the question the finer art we see may be encourag and promot by nation bounti as now in franc but there is no incit the bulk of the peopl to industri in like manner that would be as though the public should grant a bounti to itself nation certainli differ from nation as man differ from man some are by natur industri and ingeni such as china and holland it is their propens their talent while other like ireland are natur lazi and listless and therefor remain in well merit indig you have greatli mistaken thi point inde my lord china and holland are industri and ingeni becaus whether it were through good hap or good polici they hit upon the onli method wherebi industri and ingenu could be duli promot wherea great britain and ireland are total ignor of the said method to thi day though both of them highli capabl of have it put in execut you surpris me mr meekli said the earl a method to make men ingeni a method to make them industri how can that be experi ha prove it to be even so my lord for where a method may be found for encourag and promot ingenu and industri that method will infal make peopl becom both ingeni and industri no man will work my lord without some hire or wage or return for hi labor neither will ani who are in want refus to work when assur of a due reward for so do when the good household walk out to the marketplac and found labor loiter there when it wa now toward even he ask them whi stand ye here all the day idl and when they answer becaus no man ha hire or given us employ he took thi for a suffici apolog he had compass upon them and he suppli them with the divinest of all kind of chariti the mean of earn their own bread now throughout china and holland no person is in want becaus all are hire all employ the young and the old the lame and the blind and all find a readi sale without anxieti or loss of time without travel or delay for the product of their industri throughout great britain on the contrari nineteen in twenti are in real want and in ireland as i am told forti nine in fifti are nearli in a state of beggari mere for want of be employ for want of encourag to labor permit me then to explain to your lordship how some men and some nation come to be encourag to industri and other to be discourag or in a manner prohibit from it differ men are endow with differ talent and power insuffici in mani respect though superflu in other to their own occas differ countri are also endow with differ product superflu in mani respect to the nativ though necessari or desir for the wellb of foreign now these altern qualiti of defici and abund at onc invit and impel all men and all countri to claim and to impart that reciproc assist which is denomin commerc each give what he can spare each receiv what he want the exchang is to the mutual advantag of all parti and could a method be found out for encourag manufactur to persever in their industri and improv in their art by a readi convey and sale of all their redund neither want nor superflu could find place upon earth all thi is quit clear and selfevid mr meekli but how to procur thi readi sale is the question your lordship must allow that the way to procur it would be to bring barter and commut buyer and seller all who mutual want and mutual abound togeth for thi is the end and purpos of everi market upon earth now in great britain and ireland and in all contin or inland countri the sever desert mountain marsh and other obstacl with the difficulti danger and toil of travel and the great expens of land carriag have utterli preclud all commerc and commun to ani consider extent insomuch that it would be easier and cheaper to convey a commod of ani burden to either of the indi than from mani part of great britain or ireland to other by land while god appear to separ the sever nation of the earth from each other by the intervent of sea lake and river he ha actual and intim unit them therebi water serv to the art and navig of man as air serv to the wing of the feather speci it is the easi and speedi medium the

for barter and commut buyer and seller manufactur and merchant like pyramu and thisb want noth but the remov of enviou obstacl to meet and to multipli a similari progeni from what ha been premis my lord it is most evid that industri is the parent of the wealth of thi world that no man industri is suffici to hi own occas that the mutual assist denomin commerc is therefor necessari to the wellb of all peopl that the reciproc advantag of thi commerc consist in suppli mutual want with mutual redund that thi commerc howev can not be carri on without a medium for the convey of such suppli that such a medium by land even where it is practic is tediou toilsom expens extrem discourag and can not be push to ani consider extent or effect that god howev ha open for the purpos an easi speedi and univers medium of sea lake and river part of which he ha left unnavig that man might finish by art what natur had prepar and contribut in some degre to hi own advantag that accordingli china and holland and franc of late have pursu the path so divin appoint and that power wealth and prosper have flow in upon them in proport as they have open the medium of watercarriag for their recept and that caus which have produc their concomit effect without variat from the earliest age to the present period must be presum to produc the like effect through all countri and age to the end of time i protest mr meekli exclaim the earl you have push thi matter into mathemat demonstr what a happi what a gloriou prospect now open to my view how easili how speedili how profit might thi method be put in execut throughout the earth there is no defici of river or collater stream for the purpos the sink into the earth would give vent to new spring and extract plenti of water in all place for an inland navig and half the number of hand that perish through war and want might be peac and plenti employ in accomplish thi weal of mankind famin and depred would then ceas nation would no longer rise up against nation nor man against man the earth by cultur would soon becom capabl of sustain tenfold the number of it present inhabit we should no more be tempt to push each other from exist we should find ourselv mutual interest in preserv and multipli the live of all from whose labor we were to deriv such advantag all would be plenti all peac and benevol throughout the globe the number of inhabit instead of be a burden would then becom the rich of everi climat all hand would be set to work when thu assur of a purchas for everi effect of labor the buzz of wheel reel and loom the sound of hammer file and forg with the shout of vintag and the song of harvest would be hear in all land i am quit astonish that a work so full of benefit and bless to the univers of man is not alreadi commenc advanc and complet how come thi to pass mr meekli have you yet mention thi matter to ani of our great one i have my lord to sever they confess themselv convinc of the util of the scheme and could each of them be assur of engross to himself the most consider part of the profit that would therebi accru to the public the work would instantli be begun and would shortli be perfect for such is the natur of unregener man that he grudg to other ani portion of those good which he so eagerli crave and grappl after for himself he would hedg in the air and make a properti of the light in proport as he see hi neighbor in compar want he exult in the accumul of imaginari wealth but should he deem them in a measur more prosper than himself he sigh at hi inmost soul and grow wretch and repin i protest cri the earl were i young i would to morrow morn at my own cost set about thi great work of nation or rather of univers benefic but my harri here ha youth enough with an abund of benevol also for the purpos and i recommend it to him as the greatest of chariti a chariti to great britain a chariti to mankind what would you think my lord said harri of my expend your whole drawer of gold upon thi busi great as it is it would be but a small matter toward the valu of purchas peac upon earth and the son of peac upon earth will be likeliest to be the son of love in heaven so that we can not lay out our money to better advantag in ani purchas for the benefit of the brother of our own frailti ala my love rejoin mr meekli though you were master of half the wealth of the peopl of england and were will to employ the whole for their emolu in thi way the peopl themselv would oppos you in everi step you should take some would be too proud to accept a benefit from you other would tell you that no man should dare to violat their properti with either spade or pickax and other would indict you even for tread on their ground noth less than the act of the whole legislatur to whom the peopl have commit their confluent power can avail for an undertak of such nation import then my dear mr meekli be pleas to let me have in write what you have alreadi set forth on thi head and if i live to come to the lower hous of parliament i will bend all my power to thi capit chariti and if no other oratori will avail for the purpos i will bribe the member with a hundr thousand pound and corrupt them if possibl
