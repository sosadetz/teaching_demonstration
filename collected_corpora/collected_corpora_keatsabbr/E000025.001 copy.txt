statuesand on the variou defect and absurd of mr luttridg and her wig on all these topic mr hervey display much wit gallantri and satir with so happi an effect that belinda when he took leav wa precis of her aunt opinion that he wa a most uncommonli pleasant young man clarenc hervey might have been more than a pleasant young man if he had not been smitten with the desir of be thought superior in everi thing and of be the most admir person in all compani he had been earli flatter with the idea that he wa a man of geniu and he imagin that as such he wa entitl to be imprud wild and eccentr he affect singular in order to establish hi claim to geniu he had consider literari talent by which he wa distinguish at oxford but he wa so dread afraid of pass for a pedant that when he came into the compani of the idl and the ignor he pretend to disdain everi speci of knowledg hi chameleon charact seem to vari in differ light and accord to the differ situat in which he happen to be place he could be all thing to all menand to all women he wa suppos to be a favourit with the fair sex and of all hi variou excel and defect there wa none on which he valu himself so much as on hi gallantri he wa not proflig he had a strong sens of honour and quick feel of human but he wa so easili led or rather so easili excit by hi companion and hi companion were now of such a sort that it wa probabl he would soon becom viciou as to hi connexion with ladi delacour he would have start with horror at the idea of disturb the peac of a famili but in her famili he said there wa no peac to disturb he wa vain of have it seen by the world that he wa distinguish by a ladi of her wit and fashion and he did not think it incumb on him to be more scrupul or more attent to appear than her ladyship by lord delacour jealousi he wa sometim provok sometim amus and sometim flatter he wa constantli of all her ladyship parti in public and privat consequ he saw belinda almost everi day and everi day he saw her with increas admir of her beauti and with increas dread of be taken in to marri a niec of the catchmatchmak the name by which mr stanhop wa known amongst the men of hi acquaint young ladi who have the misfortun to be conduct by these art dame are alway suppos to be partner in all the specul though their name may not appear in the firm if he had not been prejud by the charact of her aunt mr hervey would have thought belinda an undesign unaffect girl but now he suspect her of artific in everi word look and motion and even when he felt himself most charm by her power of pleas he wa most inclin to despis her for what he thought such prematur profici in scientif coquetri he had not suffici resolut to keep beyond the sphere of her attract but frequent when he found himself within it he curs hi folli and drew back with sudden terror hi manner toward her wa so variabl and inconsist that she knew not how to interpret it languag sometim she fanci that with all the eloqu of eye he said i ador you belinda at other time she imagin that hi guard silenc meant to warn her that he wa so entangl by ladi delacour that he could not extric himself from her snare whenev thi last idea struck her it excit in the most edifi manner her indign against coquetri in gener and against her ladyship in particular she becam wonder clearsight to all the improprieti of her ladyship conduct belinda newli acquir moral sens wa so much shock that she actual wrote a full statement of her observ and her scrupl to her aunt stanhop conclud by a request that she might not remain under the protect of a ladi of whose charact she could not approv and whose intimaci might perhap be injuri to her reput if not to her principl mr stanhop answer belinda letter in a veri guard style she rebuk her niec sever for her imprud in mention name in such a manner in a letter sent by the common post assur her that her reput wa in no danger that she hope no niec of her would set up for a prudea charact more suspect by men of the world than even that of a coquett that the person allud to wa a perfectli fit chaperon for ani young ladi to appear with in public as long as she wa visit by the first peopl in town that as to ani thing in the privat conduct of that person and as to ani privat brouillieri between her and her lord belinda should observ on these danger topic a profound silenc both in her letter and her convers that as long as the ladi continu under the protect of her husband the world might whisper but would not speak out that as to belinda own principl she would be utterli inexcus if after the educ she had receiv they could be hurt by ani bad exampl that she could not be too cautiou in her manag of a man of s charact that she could have no seriou caus for jealousi in the quarter she apprehend as marriag there could not be the object and there wa such a differ of age that no perman influenc could probabl be obtain by the ladi that the most certain method for miss portman to expos herself to the ridicul of one of the parti and to the total neglect of the other would be to betray anxieti or jealousi that in short if she were fool enough to lose her own heart there would be littl chanc of her be wise enough to win that of who wa evid a man of gallantri rather than of sentiment and who wa known to play hi card well and to have good luck whenev heart were trump belinda fear of ladi delacour as a danger rival were much quiet by the art insinu of mr stanhop with respect to her age c and in proport as her fear subsid she blame herself for have written too harshli of her ladyship conduct the idea that whilst she appear as ladi delacour friend she ought not to propag ani stori to her disadvantag oper power upon belinda mind and she reproach herself for have told even her aunt what she had seen in privat she thought that she had been guilti of treacheri and she wrote again immedi to mr stanhop to conjur her to burn her last letter to forget if possibl it content and to believ that not a syllabl of a similar natur should ever more be heard from her she wa just conclud with the wordsi hope my dear aunt will consid all thi as an error of my judgment and not of my heart when ladi delacour burst into the room exclaim in a tone of gaieti tragedi or comedi belinda the masquerad dress are come but how thi ad she look full in belinda facetear in the eye blush in the cheek tremor in the joint and letter shuffl away but you novic of novic how awkwardli shuffleda niec of mr stanhop and so unpractis a shufflerand is it credibl she should trembl in thi ridicul way about a lovelett or two no lovelett inde ladi delacour said belinda hold the paper fast as her ladyship half in play half in earnest attempt to snatch it from her no lovelett then it must be treason and see

of your aunt i declar said she pat belinda cheek what a treasur to meet with ani thing like a new heartal heart nowaday are secondhand at best ladi delacour spoke with a tone of feel which belinda had never heard from her befor and which at thi moment touch her so much that she took her ladyship hand and kiss it chapter ii mask where were we when all thi began cri ladi delacour forc herself to resum an air of gaietyo masquerad wa the order of the daytragedi or comedi which suit your geniu best my dear whichev suit your ladyship tast least whi my woman marriott say i ought to be tragedi and upon the notion that peopl alway succeed best when they take charact diametr opposit to their ownclar hervey principleperhap you dont think that he ha ani principl but there you are wrong i do assur you he ha sound principlesof tast of that said belinda with a constrain smile he give the most convinc proof by hi admir your ladyship so much and by hi admir miss portman so much more but whilst we are make speech to one anoth poor marriott is stand in distress like garrick between tragedi and comedi ladi delacour open her dressingroom door and point to her as she stood with the dress of the

the last resort at her mistresss toilett look extrem out of humour at have been kept wait so long and yet more so at the idea that her appel jurisdict could be disput your ladyship taller than miss

rule me with a rod of iron my dear so tragedi i need must bemarriott know her power there wa an air of extrem vexat in ladi delacour counten as she pronounc these last word in which evid more wa meant than met the ear upon mani occas miss portman had observ that marriott exercis despot author over her mistress and she had seen with surpris that a ladi who would not yield an iota of power to her husband submit herself to everi capric of the most insol of waitingwomen for some time belinda imagin that thi submiss wa mere an air as she had seen some other fine ladi proud of appear to be govern by a favourit maid but she wa soon convinc that marriott wa no favourit with ladi delacour that her ladyship wa not proud humil but fear it seem certain that a woman extravagantli fond of her own will would never have given it up without some veri substanti reason it seem as if marriott wa in possess of some secret which should for ever remain unknown thi idea had occur to miss portman more than onc but never so forcibl as upon the present occas there had alway been some mysteri about her ladyship toilett at certain hour door were bolt and it wa imposs for ani bodi but marriott to obtain admiss miss portman at first imagin that ladi delacour dread the discoveri of her cosmet secret but her ladyship roug wa so glare and her pearl powder wa so obviou that belinda wa convinc there must be some other caus for thi toilett secreci there wa a littl cabinet beyond her bedchamb which ladi delacour call her boudoir to which there wa an entranc by a back staircas but no one ever enter there but marriott one night ladi delacour after danc with great spirit at a ball at her own hous faint suddenli miss portman attend her to her bedchamb but marriott beg that her ladi might be left alon with her and she would by no mean suffer belinda to follow her into the boudoir all these thing belinda recollect in the space of a few second as she stood contempl marriott and the dress the hurri of get readi for the masquerad howev dispel these thought and by the time she wa dress the idea of what clarenc hervey would think of her appear wa uppermost in her mind she wa anxiou to know whether he would discov her in the charact of the comic muse ladi delacour wa discont with her tragic attir and she grew still more out of humour with herself when she saw belinda i protest marriott ha made a perfect fright of me said her ladyship as she got into her carriag and im posit my dress would becom you a million of time better than your own miss portman regret that it wa too late to chang not at

immedi went up stair to exchang dress poor belinda now that she felt herself in spirit to undertak the comic muse wa rather vex to be oblig to give up her becom charact but there wa no resist the

threw open the door when she wa complet dressedbut if your laship ha not been dress all thi time in that den without ani thing in the shape of a lookingglass and not to let me help i that should have been so proud ladi delacour put half a guinea into the waitingmaid hand laugh affectedli at her own whimsic and declar that she could alway dress herself better without a glass than with one all thi went off admir well with everi bodi but miss portman she could not help think it extraordinari that a person who wa obvious fond of be wait upon would never suffer ani person to assist her at her toilet except marriott a woman of whom she wa evid afraid ladi delacour quick eye saw curios paint in belinda counten and for a moment she wa embarrass but she soon recov herself and endeavour to turn the cours of miss portman thought by whisper to her some nonsens about clarenc herveya cabalist name which she knew had the power when pronounc in a certain tone of throw belinda into confus the first
