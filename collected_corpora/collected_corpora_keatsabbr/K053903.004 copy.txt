limb shake so tonight i thought onc or twice i should have drop as i wa a come emili seat her in a chair and desir that she would compos her spirit befor she enter upon the subject that had brought her thither ala said dorothe it is think of that i believ which ha disturb me so in my way hither too i pass the chamber where my dear ladi die and everi thing wa so still and gloomi about me that i almost fanci i saw her as she appear upon her deathb emili now drew her chair near to dorothe who went on it is about twenti year sinc my ladi marchio came a bride to the chateau o i well rememb how she look when she came into the great hall where we servant were all assembl to welcom her and how happi my lord the marqui seem ah who would have thought then but as i wa say maamsel i thought the marchio with all her sweet look did not look happi at heart and so i told my husband and he said it wa all fanci so i said no more but i made my remark for all that my ladi marchio wa then about your age and as i have often thought veri like you well my lord the marqui kept open hous for a long time and gave such entertain and there were such gay do as have never been in the chateau sinc i wa younger maamsel then than i am now and wa as gay as the best of them i rememb i danc with philip the butler in a pink gown with yellow ribbon and a coif not such as they wear now but plait high with ribbon all about it it wa veri becom truli my lord the marqui notic me ah he wa a goodnatur gentleman then who would have thought that he but the marchio dorothe said emili you wa tell me of her o ye my ladi marchio i thought she did not seem happi at heart and onc soon after the marriag i caught her cri in her chamber but when she saw me she dri her eye and pretend to smile i did not dare then to ask what wa the matter but the next time i saw her cri i did and she seem displeas so i said no more i found out some time after how it wa her father it seem had command her to marri my lord the marqui for hi money and there wa anoth nobleman or els a chevali that she like better and that wa veri fond of her and she fret for the loss of him i fanci but she never told me so my ladi alway tri to conceal her tear from the marqui for i have often seen her after she ha been so sorrow look so calm and sweet when he came into the room but my lord all of a sudden grew gloomi and fret and veri unkind sometim to my ladi thi afflict her veri much as i saw for she never complain and she use to tri so sweetli to oblig him and to bring him into a good humor that my heart ha often ach to see it but he use to be stubborn and give her harsh answer and then when she found it all in vain she would go to her own room and cri so i use to hear her in the antiroom poor dear ladi but i seldom ventur to go to her i use sometim to think my lord wa jealou to be sure my ladi wa greatli admir but she wa too good to deserv suspicion among the mani chevali that visit at the chateau there wa one that i alway thought seem just suit for my ladi he wa so courteou yet so spirit and there wa such a grace as it were in all he did or said i alway observ that whenev he had been there the marqui wa more gloomi and my ladi more thought and it came into my head that thi wa the chevali she ought to have marri but i never could learn for certain what wa the chevali name dorothe said emili whi that i will not tell even to you maamsel for evil may come of it i onc heard from a person who is sinc dead that the marchio wa not in law the wife of the marqui for that she had befor been privat marri to the gentleman she wa so much attach to and wa afterward afraid to own it to her father who wa a veri stern man but thi seem veri unlik and i never gave much faith to it as i wa say the marqui wa most out of humor as i thought when the chevali i spoke of had been at the chateau and at last hi ill treatment of my ladi made her quit miser he would see hardli ani visitor at the castl and made her live almost by herself i wa her constant attend and saw all she suffer but still she never eomplain after matter had gone on thu for near a year my ladi wa taken ill and i thought her long fret had made her so but ala i fear it wa wors than that wors dorothe said emili can that be possibl i fear it wa so madam there were strang appear but i will onli tell what happen my lord the marqui hush dorothe what sound were those said emili dorothe chang counten and while they both listen they heard on the still of the night music of uncommon sweet i have sure heard that voic befor said emili at length i have often heard it and at thi same hour said dorothe solemnli and if spirit ever bring music that is sure the music of one emili as the sound drew nearer knew them to be the same she had formerli heard at the time of her father death and whether it wa the remembr they now reviv of that melancholi event or that she wa struck with superstiti awe it is certain she wa so much affect that she had nearli faint i think i onc told you madam said dorothe that i first heard thi music soon after my ladi death i well rememb the night hark it come again said emili let us open the window and listen they did so but soon the sound float gradual away into distanc and all wa again still they seem to have sunk among the wood whose tuft top were visibl upon the clear horizon while everi other featur of the scene wa involv in the nightshad which howev allow the eye an indistinct view of some object in the garden below as emili lean on the window gaze with a kind of thrill awe upon the obscur beneath and then upon the cloudless arch abov enlighten onli by the star dorothe in a low voic resum her narr i wa say maamsel that i well rememb when first i heard that music it wa one night soon after my ladi death that i had sat up later than usual and i dont know how it wa but i had been think a great deal about my poor mistress and of the sad scene i had late wit the chateau wa quit still and i wa in a chamber at a good distanc from the restof the servant and thi with the mourn thing i had been think of i suppos made me low spirit for i felt veri lone and forlorn as it were and listen often wish to hear a sound in the chateau for you know maamsel when one can hear peopl move one doe not so much mind about one fear but all the servant were gone to bed and i sat think and think till i wa almost afraid to look round the room and my poor ladi counten often came to my mind such as i had seen her when she wa die and onc or twice i almost thought i saw her befor me when suddenli i heard such sweet mosic it seem just at my window and i shall never forget what i felt i had not power to move from my chair but then when i thought it wa my dear ladi voic the tear came to my eye i had often heard her sing in her lifetim and to be sure she had a veri fine voic it had made me cri to hear her mani a time when she ha sat in her oriel of an even play upon her lute such sad song and sing so o it went to one heart i have listen in the antichamb for the hour togeth and she would sometim sit play with the window open when it wa summer time till it wa quit dark and when i have gone in to shut it she ha hardli seem to know what hour it wa but as i said madam continu dorothe when first i heard the music that came just now i thought it wa my late ladi and i have often thought so again when i have heard it as i have done at interv ever sinc sometim mani month have gone by but still it ha return it is extraordinari observ emili that no person ha yet discov the musician aye maamsel if it had been ani thing earthli it would have been discov long ago but who could have courag to follow a spirit and if they had what good could it do for spirit you know maam can take ani shape or no shape and they will be here one minut and the next perhap in a quit differ place pray resum your stori of the marchio said emili and acquaint me with the manner of her death i will maam said dorothe but shall we leav the window thi cool air refresh me repli emili and i love to hear it creep along the wood and to look upon thi duski landscap you wa speak of my lord the marqui when the music interrupt us ye madam my lord the marqui becam more and more gloomi and my ladi grew wors and wors till one night she wa taken veri ill inde i wa call up and when i came to her bedsid i wa shock to see her counten it wa so chang she look piteous up at me and desir i would call the marqui again for he wa not yet come and tell him she had someth particular to say to him at last he came and he did to be sure seem veri sorri to see her but he said veri littl my ladi told him she felt herself to be die and wish to speak with him alon and then i left the room but i shall never forget hi look as i went when i return i ventur to remind my lord about send for a doctor for i fuppos he had forgot to do so in hi grief but my ladi said it wa then too late but my lord so far from think so seem to
