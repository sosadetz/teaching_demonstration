natur to fond parent will be beauti all the world over do thou appli but ala jack all thi is but a copi of my counten drawn to evad thi malic though t answer thi unfriendli purpos to own it i can not forbear to own it that i am stung to the veri soul with thi unhappi accid must i call it have i nobodi whose throat either for careless or treacheri i ought to cut in order to pacifi my vengeanc when i reflect upon my last iniquit intent the first outrag so nobli resent as well as so far as she wa abl so nobli resist i can not but conclud that i wa under the power of fascin from these accurs circ who pretend to know their own sex would have it that there is in everi woman a yield or a weakresist moment to be met with and that yet and yet and yet i had not tri enough but that if neither love nor terror should enabl me to hit that lucki moment when by help of their curs art she wa onc overcom she would be for ever overcom appeal to all my experi to all my knowledg of the sex for a justif of their assert my appeal to experi i own wa but too favor to their argument for do thou think i could have held my purpos against such an angel as thi had i ever befor met with one so much in earnest to defend her honor against the unweari artific and persever of the man she love whi then were there not more exampl of a virtu so immov or whi wa thi singular one to fall to my lot except inde to doubl my guilt and at the same time to convinc all that should hear of her stori that there are angel as well as devil in the flesh so much for confess and for the sake of humour my conscienc with a view likewis to disarm thi malic by acknowleg sinc no one shall say wors of me than i will of myself on thi occas one thing i will nevertheless add to show the sincer of my contrit it is thi that if thou can by ani mean find her out within these three day or ani time befor she ha discov the stori relat to captain tomlinson and her uncl to be what they are and if thou can prevail upon her to consent i will actual in thi presenc and hi he to repres her uncl marri her i am still in hope it may be so she can not be long conceal i have alreadi set all engin at work to find her out and if i do what indiffer person and no one of her friend as thou observest will look upon her will care to imbroil themselv with a man of my figur fortun and resolut show her thi part then or ani other part of thi letter at thi own discret if thou can find her for after all methink i would be glad that thi affair which is bad enough in itself should go off without wors person consequ to anybodi els and yet it run in my mind i know not whi that sooner or later it will draw a few drop of blood after it except she and i can make it up between ourselv and thi may be anoth reason whi she should not carri her resent too far not that such an affair would give me much concern neither were i to choos my man or men for i heartili hate all her famili but herself and ever shall let me add that the ladi plot to escap appear to me no extraordinari one there wa much more luck than probabl that it should do sinc to make it succeed it wa necessari that dorca and will and sinclair and her nymph should be all deceiv or off their guard it belong to me when i see them to give them my hearti thank that they were and that their selfish care to provid for their own futur secur should induc them to leav their outward door upon their boltlatch and be curs to them mabel deserv a pitchsuit and a bonfir rather than the lustr and as her cloth are return let the ladi be put to her other to be sent to her when it

to impart to you that then could happen cold as the wretch had made my heart to that best for how could i think to write to you with a confess that i wa not marri yet live in the hous nor could i help it with such a man who likewis had given it out to sever that we were actual marri although with restrict that depend on the reconcili with my friend and to disguis the truth or be guilti of a falsehood either direct or equivoc that wa what you had never learnt me but i might have written to you for advic in my precari situat perhap you will think but inde my dear mr norton i wa not lost for want of advic and thi will appear clear to you from what i have alreadi hint were i to explain myself no further for what need had the cruel spoiler to have had recours to unpreced art i will speak out plainer still but you must not at present report it to stupefi potion and to the most brutal and outrag forc had i been want in my duti a few word more upon thi grievou subject when i reflect upon all that ha happen to me it is appar that thi generallysuppos thoughtless seduc ha act by me upon a regular and preconcert plan of villaini in order to set all hi vile plot in motion noth wa want from the first but to prevail upon me either by forc or fraud to throw myself into hi power and when thi wa effect noth less than the intervent of the patern author which i had not deserv to be exert in my behalf could have save me from the effect of hi deep machin opposit from ani other quarter would but too probabl have precipit hi barbar and ungrat violenc and had you yourself been with me i have reason now to think that somehow or other you would have suffer in endeavor to save me for never wa there as now i see a plan of wicked more steadili and uniformli pursu than hi ha been against an unhappi creatur who merit better of him but the almighti ha thought fit accord to the gener cours of hi provid to make the fault bring on it own punish and that perhap in consequ of my father dread imprec that i might be punish here o my mamma norton pray with me that here it stop by the veri wretch in whom i had place my wick confid i am sorri for your sake to leav off so heavili yet the rest must be brief let me desir you to be secret in what i have commun to you at least till you have my consent to divulg it god preserv to you your more faultless child i will hope for hi merci although i should not obtain that of ani other person and i repeat my prohibit you must not think of come up to your everduti cl harlow the oblig person who left your for me thi day promis to call tomorrow to see if i should have anyth to return i would not lose so good an opportun letter xv mr norton to miss clarissa harlow monday night juli o the barbar villainli of thi detest man and is there a man in the world who could offer violenc to so sweet a creatur and are you sure you are now out of hi reach you command me to keep secret the particular of the vile treatment you have met with or els upon an unexpect visit which miss harlow favor me with soon after i had receiv your melancholi letter i should have been tempt to own i had heard from you and to have commun to her such part of your two letter as would have demonstr your penit and your earnest to obtain the revoc of your father maledict as well as hi protect from outrag that may still be offer to you but then your sister would probabl have expect a sight of the letter and even to been have permit to take them with her to the famili yet they must one day be acquaint with the sad stori and it is imposs but they must piti you and forgiv you when they know your earli penit and your unpreced suffer and that you have fallen by the brutal forc of a barbar ravish and not by the vile art of a seduc lover the wick man give it out at lord ms as miss harlow tell me that he is actual marri to you yet she believ it not nor had i the heart to let her know the truth she put it close to me whether i had not correspond with you from the time of your go away i could safe tell her as i did that i had not but i said that i wa well inform that you took extrem to heart your father imprec and that if she would excus me i would say it would be a kind and sisterli part if she would use her interest to get you discharg from it among other sever thing she told me that my partial fond for you made me veri littl consid the honor of the rest of the famili but if i had not heard thi from you she suppos i wa set on by miss how she express herself with a good deal of bitter against that young ladi who it seem everywher and to everybodi for you must think that your stori is the subject of all convers rail against your famili treat them as your sister say with contempt and even with ridicul i am sorri such angri freedom are taken for two reason first becaus such liberti never do ani good i have heard you own that miss how ha a satir vein but i should hope that a young ladi of her sens and right cast of mind must know that the end of satir is not to exasper but amend and should never be person if it be as my good father use to say it may make an imparti person suspect that the satirist ha a natur spleen to gratifi which may be as great a fault in him as ani of those which he pretend to censur and expos in other perhap a hint of thi from you will not be thrown away my second reason is that these freedom from so warm a friend to you as miss how is known to be are most like to be charg to your account my resent are so strong against thi vilest of men that i dare not touch upon the shock particular which you mention of hi base what defens inde could there be against so determin a wretch after you were in hi power i will onli repeat my earnest supplic to you that black as appear are you will not despair you calam are exceed great but then you have talent proport to your trial thi everybodi allow suppos the worst and that your famili will not be move in your favor your cousin morden will soon arriv as miss harlow told me if he should even be got over to their side he will howev see justic done you and then may you live an exemplari life make hundr happi and teach young ladi to shun the snare in which you have been so dread entangl as to the man you have lost is an union with such a perjur heart as hi with such an admir one as your to be wish for a base lowheart wretch as you justli call him with all hi pride of ancestri and more an enemi to himself with regard to hi present and futur happi than to you in the barbar and ungrat wrong he ha done you i need not i am sure exhort you to despis such a man as thi sinc not to be abl to do so would be a reflect upon a sex to which you have alway been an honor your moral charact is untaint the veri natur of your suffer as you well observ demonstr that cheer up therefor your dear heart and do not despair for is it not god who govern the world and permit some thing and direct other as he pleas and will he not reward temporari suffer innoc incur and piousli support with etern felic and what my dear is thi poor needl point of now to a boundless etern my heart howev labor under a doubl afflict for my poor boy is veri veri bad a violent fever nor can it be brought to intermit pray for him my dearest miss for hi recoveri if god see fit i hope god will see fit if not how can i bear to suppos that pray for me that he will give me that patienc and resign which i have been wish to you i am my dearest young ladi your everaffection judith norton letter xvi miss cl harlow to mr judith norton thursday juli i ought not especi at thi time to add to your afflict but yet i can not help commun to you who now are my onli sooth friend a new troubl that ha befallen me i had but one friend in the world besid you and she is utterli displeas with me see the next letter it is grievou but for one moment to lie under a belov person censur and thi through imput that affect one honor and prudenc there are point so delic you know my dear mr norton that it is a degre of dishonor to have a vindic of one self from them appear to be necessari in the present case my misfortun is that i know not how to account but by guess so subtl have been the work of the dark spirit i have been unhappili entangl by for some of the fact that i am call upon to explain miss how in short suppos she ha found a flaw in my charact i have just now receiv her sever letter but i shall answer it perhap in better temper if i first consid your for inde my patienc is almost at an end and yet i ought to consid that faith are the wound of a friend but so mani thing at onc o my dear mr norton how shall so young a scholar in the school of afflict be abl to bear such heavi and such variou evil but to leav thi subject for a while and turn to your letter i am veri sorri miss how is so live in her resent on my account i have alway blame her veri freeli for her liberti of thi sort with my friend i onc had a good deal of influenc over her kind heart and she made all i said a law to her but peopl in calam have but littl weight in anyth or with anybodi prosper and independ are charm thing on thi account that they give forc to the counsel of a friendli heart while it is thought insol in the miser to advis or so much as remonstr yet is miss how an invalu person and is it to be expect that she should preserv the same regard for my judgment that she had befor i forfeit all titl to discret with what face can i take upon me to reproach a want of prudenc in her but if i can be so happi as to reestablish myself in her evervalu opinion i shall endeavor to enforc upon her your just observ on thi head you need not you say exhort me to despis such a man as him by whom i have suffer inde you need not for i would choos the cruellest death rather than to be hi and yet my dear mr norton i will own to you that onc i could have love him ungrat man had he permit me i onc could have love him yet he never deserv my love and wa not thi a fault but now if i can but keep out of hi hand and procur the revoc of my father maledict it is all i wish for reconcili with my friend i do not expect nor pardon from
