their unenlighten idea on the power of natur which gave birth to the god they worship that it is again the imposs which the greater part of mankind find to withdraw themselv out of thi ignor the

welfar is a debt due to him from natur that when he suffer evil she doe him an injustic fulli persuad that thi natur wa made sole for himself he can not conceiv she would make him who is her lord paramount suffer if she wa not move thereto by a power who is inim to hi happi who ha reason with which he is unacquaint for afflict who ha motiv which he wish to discov for punish him from henc it

been a recent product of natur whether the larger anim we now behold were origin deriv from the smallest microscop one who have increas in bulk with the progress of time or whether as the egyptian philosoph thought mankind were origin hermaphrodit who like the aphi produc the sexual distinct after some gener which wa also the opinion of plato and seem to have been that of mose who wa educ
