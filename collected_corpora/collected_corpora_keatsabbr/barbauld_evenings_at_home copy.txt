him littl jack said to him papa pray tell us some stori about what you have seen in your voyag i have been vastli entertain while you were abroad with gulliv travel and the adventur of sinbad the sailor and i think as you have gone round and round the world you must have met with thing as wonder as they did—no my dear said the captain i never met with lilliputian or brobdignagian i assur you nor ever saw the black loadston mountain or the valley of diamond but to be sure i have seen a great varieti of peopl and their differ manner and way of live and if it will be ani entertain to you i will tell you some curiou particular of what i observed—pray do papa cri jack and all hi brother and sister so they drew close round him and he began as follows— well then—i wa onc about thi time of the year in a countri where it wa veri cold and the poor inhabit had much ado to keep themselv from starv they were clad partli in the skin of beast made smooth and soft by a particular art but chiefli in garment made from the outward cover of a middles quadrup which they were so cruel as to strip off hi back while he wa aliv they dwelt in habit part of which wa sunk underground the materi were either stone or earth harden by fire and so violent in that countri were the storm of wind and rain that mani of them cover their roof all over with stone the wall of their hous had hole to let in the light but to prevent the cold air and wet from come in they were cover by a sort of transpar stone made artifici of melt sand or flint as wood wa rather scarc i know not what they would have done for fire had they not discov in the bowel of the earth a veri extraordinari kind of stone which when put among burn wood caught fire and flame like a torch dear me said jack what a wonder stone i suppos it wa somewhat like what we call fireston that shine so when we rub them together—i dont think they would burn repli the captain besid these are of a darker colour well—but their diet too wa remark some of them ate fish that had been hung up in the smoke till they were quit dri and hard and along with it they ate either the root of plant or a sort of coars black cake made of powder seed these were the poorer class the richer had a whiter kind of cake which they were fond of daub over with a greasi matter that wa the product of a larg anim among them thi greas they use too in almost all their dish and when fresh it realli wa not unpalat they likewis devour the flesh of mani bird and beast when they could get it and ate the leav and other part of a varieti of veget grow in the countri some absolut raw other various prepar by the aid of fire anoth great articl of food wa the curd of milk press into a hard mass and salt thi had so rank a smell that person of weak stomach often could not bear to come near it for drink they made great use of the water in which certain dri leav had been steep these leav i wa told came from a great distanc they had likewis a method of prepar a liquor of the seed of a grasslik plant steep in water with the addit of a bitter herb and then set to work or ferment i wa prevail upon to tast it and thought it at first nauseou enough but in time i like it pretti well when a larg quantiti of the ingredi is use it becom perfectli intox but what astonish me most wa their use of a liquor so excess hot and pungent that it seem like liquid fire i onc got a mouth of it by mistak take it for water which it resembl in appear but i thought it would instantli have taken away my breath inde peopl are not unfrequ kill by it and yet mani of them will swallow it greedili whenev they can get it thi too is said to be prepar from the seed abovement which are innoc and even salutari in their natur state though made to yield such a pernici juic the strangest custom that i believ prevail in ani nation i found here which wa that some take a mighti pleasur in fill their mouth full of stink smoke and other in thrust a nasti powder up their nostril i should think it would choke them said jack it almost did me answer hi father onli to stand by while they did it—but use it is truli said is second natur i wa glad enough to leav thi cold climat and about half a year after i fell in with a peopl enjoy a delici temperatur of air and a countri full of beauti and verdur the tree and shrub were furnish with a great varieti of fruit which with other veget product constitut a larg part of the food of the inhabit i particularli relish certain berri grow in bunch some white and some red of a veri pleasant sourish tast and so transpar that one might see the seed at their veri centr here were whole field full of extrem odorifer flower which they told me were succeed by pod bear seed that afford good nourish to man and beast a great varieti of bird enliven the grove and wood among which i wa entertain with one that without ani teach spoke almost as articul as a parrot though inde it wa onli a repetit of a singl word the peopl were toler gentl and civil and possess mani of the art of life their dress wa veri variou mani were clad onli in a thin cloth made of the long fibr of the stalk of a plant cultiv for the purpos which they prepar by soak in water and then beat with larg mallet other wore cloth woven from a sort of veget wool grow in pod upon bush but the most singular materi wa a fine glossi stuff use chiefli by the richer class which as i wa credibl inform is manufactur out of the web of caterpillars—a most wonder circumst if we consid the immens number of caterpillar necessari to the product of so larg a quantiti of stuff as i saw use thi peopl are veri fantast in their dress especi the women whose apparel consist of a great number of articl imposs to be describ and strang disguis the natur form of the bodi in some instanc they seem veri cleanli but in other the hottentot can scarc go beyond them particularli in the manag of their hair which is all mat and stiffen with the fat of swine and other anim mix up with powder of variou colour and ingredi like most indian nation they use feather in their headdress one thing surpris me much which wa that they bring up in their hous an anim of the tigerkind with formid teeth and claw which notwithstand it natur feroc is play with and caress by the most timid and delic of their women i am sure i would not play with it said jack whi you might chanc to get an ugli scratch if you did said the captain the languag of thi nation seem veri harsh and unintellig to a foreign yet they convers among one anoth with great eas and quick one of the oddest custom is that which men use on salut each other let the weather be what it will they uncov their head and remain uncov for some time if they mean to be extraordinarili respect whi that like pull off our hat said jack—ah ah papa cri betsi i have found you out you have been tell us of our own countri and what is done at home all thi while—but said jack we dont burn stone or eat greas and powder seed or wear skin and caterpillar web or play with tigers—no said the captain—pray what are coal but stone and is not butter greas and corn seed and leather skin and silk the web of a kind of caterpillar and may we not as well call a cat an anim of the tiger kind as a tiger an anim of the catkind so if you recollect what i have been describ you will find with betsi help that all the other wonder thing i have told you of are matter familiar among ourselv but i meant to show you that a foreign might easili repres everyth as equal strang and wonder among us as we could do with respect to hi countri and also to make you sensibl that we daili call a great mani thing by their name without ever inquir into their natur and properti so that in realiti it is onli their name and not the thing themselv with which we are acquaint the discont squirrel in a pleasant wood on the western side of a ridg of mountain there live a squirrel who had pass two or three year of hi life veri happili at length he began to grow discont and one day fell into the follow soliloquy— what must i spend all my time in thi spot run up and down the same tree gather nut and acorn and doze away month togeth in a hole i see a great mani of the bird who inhabit thi wood rambl about to a distanc wherev their fanci lead them and at the approach of winter set out for some remot countri where they enjoy summer weather all the year round my neighbour cuckoo tell me he is just go and even littl nightingal will soon follow to be sure i have not wing like them but i have leg nimbl enough and if one doe not use them one might as well be a mole or a dormous i dare say i could easili reach to that blue ridg which i see from the top of the tree which no doubt must be a fine place for the sun come directli from it everi morn and it often appear all cover with red and yellow and the finest colour imagin there can be no harm at least in tri for i can soon get back again if i dont like it i am resolv to go and i will set out tomorrow morn when squirrel had taken thi resolut he could not sleep all night for think of it and at peep of day prudent take with him as much provis as he could conveni carri he began hi journey in high spirit he present got to the outsid of the wood and enter upon the open moor that reach to the foot of the hill these he cross befor the sun wa gotten high and then have eaten hi breakfast with an excel appetit he began to ascend it wa heavi toilsom work scrambl up the steep side of the mountain but squirrel wa use to climb so for awhil he proceed expediti often howev wa he oblig to stop and take breath so that it wa a good deal past noon befor he had arriv at the summit of the first cliff here he sat down to eat hi dinner and look back wa wonder pleas with the fine prospect the wood in which he live lay far beneath hi feet and he view with scorn the humbl habit in which he had been born and bred when he look forward howev he wa somewhat discourag to observ that anoth emin rose abov him full as distant as that to which he had alreadi reach and he now began to feel stiff and fatigu howev after a littl rest he set out again though not so briskli as befor the ground wa rug brown and bare and to hi great surpris instead of find it warmer as he got nearer the sun he felt it grow colder and colder he had not travel two hour befor hi strength and spirit were almost spent and he serious thought of give up the point and return befor night should come on while he wa thu deliber with himself cloud began to gather round the mountain and to take away all view of distant object present a storm of mingl snow and hail came down driven by a violent wind which pelt poor squirrel most piti and made him quit unabl to move forward or backward besid he had complet lost hi road and did not know which way to turn toward that despis home which it wa now hi onli desir again to reach the storm last till the approach of night and it wa as much as he could do benumb and weari as he wa to crawl to the hollow of a rock at some distanc which wa the best lodg he could find for the night hi provis were spent so that hungri and shiver he crept into the farthest corner of the cavern and roll himself up with hi bushi tail over hi back he got a littl sleep though disturb by the cold and the shrill whistl of the wind among the stone the morn broke over the distant top of the mountain when squirrel half frozen and famish came out of hi lodg and advanc as well as he could toward the brow of the hill that he might discov which way to take as he wa slowli creep along a hungri kite soar in the air abov descri him and make a stoop carri him off in her talon poor squirrel lose hi sens with the fright wa born away with vast rapid and seem inevit doom to becom food for the kite young one when an eagl who had seen the kite seiz her prey pursu her in order to take it from her and overtak her gave her such a buffet as caus her to drop the squirrel in order to defend herself the poor anim kept fall through the air a long time till at last he alight in the midst of a thick tree the leav and tender bough of which so broke hi fall that though stun and breathless he escap without materi injuri and after lie a while came to himself again but what wa hi pleasur and surpris to find himself in the veri tree which contain hi nest ah said he my dear nativ place and peac home if ever i am again tempt to leav you may i undergo a second time all the miseri and danger from which i have now so wonder escap illustr the mask of natur p even ii on the marten look up my dear said hi papa to littl william at those birdsnest abov the chamberwindow beneath the eav of the hous some you see are just begun—noth but a littl clay stuck against the wall other are half finish and other are quit built—clos and tight—leav noth but a small hole for the bird to come in and go out at what are they said william they are marten nest repli hi father and there you see the owner how busili they fli backward and forward bring clay and dirt in their bill and lay it upon their work form it into shape with their bill and feet the nest are built veri strong and thick like a mud wall and are line with feather to make a soft bed for the young marten are a kind of swallow they feed on fli gnat and other insect and alway build in town and villag about the hous peopl do not molest them for they do good rather than harm and it is veri amus to view their manner and action see how swiftli they skim through the air in pursuit of their prey in the morn they are up by daybreak and twitter about your window while you are asleep in bed and all day long they are upon the wing get food for themselv and their young as soon as they have caught a few fli they hasten to their nest pop into the hole and feed their littl one ill tell you a stori about the great care they take of their young a pair of marten onc built their nest in a porch and when they had young one it happen that one of them climb up to the hole befor he wa fledg fell out and light upon the stone wa kill the old bird perceiv thi accid went and got short bit of strong straw and stuck them with mud like palisad all round the hole of the nest in order to keep the other littl one from tumbl after their poor brother how cun that wa cri william ye said hi father and i can tell you anoth stori of their sagac and also of their disposit to help one anoth a sauci cocksparrow you know what impud rogu they are had got into a marten nest while the owner wa abroad and when he return the sparrow put hi head out of the hole and peck at the marten with open bill as he attempt to enter hi own hous the poor marten wa sadli provok at thi injustic but wa unabl by hi own strength to right himself so he flew away and gather a number of hi companion who all came with bit of clay in their bill with which they plaster up the hole of the nest and kept the sparrow in prison who die miser for want of food and air he wa rightli serv said william so he wa rejoin hi papa well i have more to say about the sagac of these bird in autumn when it begin to be cold weather the other swallow assembl upon the roof of high build and prepar for their departur to a warmer countri for as all the insect here die in the winter they would have noth to live on if they were to stay they take sever short flight in flock round and round in order to tri their strength and then on some fine calm day they set out togeth for a long journey southward over sea and land to a veri distant countri but how do they find their way said william we say answer hi father that they are taught by instinct that is god ha implant in their mind a desir of travel at the season which he know to be proper and ha also given them an impuls to take the right road they steer their cours through the wide air directli to the proper spot sometim howev storm and contrari wind meet them and drive the poor bird about till they are quit spent and fall into the sea unless they happen to meet with a ship on which they can light and rest themselv the swallow from thi countri are suppos to go as far as the middl of africa to spend the winter where the weather is alway warm and insect are to be met with all the year in spring they take anoth long journey back again to these northern countri sometim when we have fine weather veri earli a few of them come too soon for when it chang to frost and snow again the poor creatur are starv for want of food or perish from the cold henc aris the proverb one swallow doe not make a summer but when a great mani of them are come we may be sure that winter is over so that we are alway veri glad to see them again the marten find their way back over a great length of sea and land to the veri same villag and hous where they were bred thi ha been discov by catch some of them and mark them they repair their old nest or build new one and then set about lay egg and hatch their young pretti thing i
