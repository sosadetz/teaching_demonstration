aptalca olduğunu söylüyor yaşımı hatırlıyorum da para parti amcık ben de aynı şeylerin peşindeydim çocuklara büyümeleri için şan tanımalısın bugünlerd herk bir şeyler biliyormuş gibi konuşuyor zencil ayık gibi davranıyorlar ancak onlar parasızlar çabanızı takdir ediyorum ancak bu günlere sizler öncülük ediyorsunuz adamım daha araba sürecek yaşta bile değil onlara ne yapacaklarını söylemek mi ben kimim onlardan birinin beni disslediğini duydum şaşırdım yaklaş küçük adam seninl konuşmama izin ver bakalım senin için büyük resmi çizebilecek miyim tebrikl annenin evinden ayrılabildin umarım annen bir ev alabilecek kadar kazanırsın bakıyorum saatin parıltılı ve araban pahalı bir tavsiyem var tur yapmayı asla bırakma çünkü bu günlerd biz rapçil böyle kazanıyoruz garip lil rap isimlerinl dalga geçiyorum müziğini duyuyorum ve rapin değiştiğini biliyorum bazıları bunun kötü bir şey olduğunu söyleyebilir çünkü artık her şey reklama dayalı ve pop trap drumlar havalı olan şeyler artık görüyorsun yeni nesil için bir görevdeyim neys boşver bu sadec bir geçiş söylemem gerekli ki parçalarından etkilenmedim hey ancak siyahi birinin para kazanması hoşuma gidiyor ayrıca bu işten zevk alıyorsun ve buna saygı duyuyorum ancak yarattığın etki üzerind hiç düşündün mü bu beyaz çocuklar senin hiç bir şeyi umursamamanı seviyorlar çünkü tenin siyah olduğunda senden bunu bekliyorlar senin dab atmanı bekliyorlar senin hap atmanı bekliyorlar suratından topuklarına kadar dövme içind olmanı bekliyorlar ve derinlerd bir yerlerd siktir gerçekçi olmam lazım onlar siyahi olmak istiyorlar ve parçalarının öyle hissettirdiğini düşünüyorlar yani sen bir şey yaptığında onların da yaptığını görebilirsin sonraki şehir geç zamanı geldiğind paranı topla paranı alıp sürtükler içind yüzüyorsun seni suçlamıyorum ancak benim ve senin gibi gözükmey çalışan insanları düşünmüyorsun doğru yapman gereken daha önemli şeyler var kazandığın paralarla bir varoşu satın alabilirsin biliyorum bu gelir hiç bitmeyecekmiş gibi hissediyorsun ancak sana bunun doğru olmadığını söylemeliyim bir gün seni dinleyen çocuklar büyüyecek ve senin patlamana sebep olan şey için çok yaşlı olacaklar artık onlar gelmediği için şovların zayıf gözükecek ve bu ne yazık ki paranın azalması demek şimdi tekrar göz önüne gelmek için umuyor ve kıvranıyorsun ancak trendleri takip ettiğin için patladığını unutuyorsun şimdi sen eskidin ve pişmanlıklar içinden geçiyorsun çünkü o evi satın almadın yerin benz aldın onlarca mücevher ve ayakkabı aldın onlarca saht arkadaş edindin seni yargılamıyorum sadec rap yaptığın konu hakkında rap yapmaya devam edersen neler olacağını söylüyorum dibe gitmek için iyi bir rota sana iyi şanslar diliyorum i̇yiliğin için göründüğün kadar aptal olmadığını umuyorum ancak insanların
