lemuel gulliv is my ancient and intim friend there is likewis some relat between us on the mother side about three year ago mr gulliv grow weari of the concours of curiou peopl come to him at hi hous in redriff made a small purchas of land with a conveni hous near newark in nottinghamshir hi nativ countri where he now live retir yet in good esteem among hi neighbour although mr gulliv wa born in nottinghamshir where hi father dwelt yet i have heard him say hi famili came from oxfordshir to confirm which i have observ in the churchyard at banburi in that counti sever tomb and monument of the gulliv befor he quit redriff he left the custodi of the follow paper in my hand with the liberti to dispos of them as i should think fit i have care perus them three time the style is veri plain and simpl and the onli fault i find is that the author after the manner of travel is a littl too circumstanti there is an air of truth appar through the whole and inde the author wa so distinguish for hi verac that it becam a sort of proverb among hi neighbour at redriff when ani one affirm a thing to say it wa as true as if mr gulliv had spoken it by the advic of sever worthi person to whom with the author permiss i commun these paper i now ventur to send them into the world hope they may be at least for some time a better entertain to our young noblemen than the common scribbl of polit and parti thi volum would have been at least twice as larg if i had not made bold to strike out innumer passag relat to the wind and tide as well as to the variat and bear in the sever voyag togeth with the minut descript of the manag of the ship in storm in the style of sailor likewis the account of longitud and latitud wherein i have reason to apprehend that mr gulliv may be a littl dissatisfi but i wa resolv to fit the work as much as possibl to the gener capac of reader howev if my own ignor in sea affair shall have led me to commit some mistak i alon am answer for them and if ani travel hath a curios to see the whole work at larg as it came from the hand of the author i will be readi to gratifi him as for ani further particular relat to the author the reader will receiv satisfact from the first page of the book richard sympson a letter from captain gulliv to hi cousin sympson written in the year i hope you will be readi to own publicli whenev you shall be call to it that by your great and frequent urgenc you prevail on me to publish a veri loos and uncorrect account of my travel with direct to hire some young gentleman of either univers to put them in order and correct the style as my cousin dampier did by my advic in hi book call a voyag round the world but i do not rememb i gave you power to consent that ani thing should be omit and much less that ani thing should be insert therefor as to the latter i do here renounc everi thing of that kind particularli a paragraph about her majesti queen ann of most piou and gloriou memori although i did rever and esteem her more than ani of human speci but you or your interpol ought to have consid that it wa not my inclin so wa it not decent to prais ani anim of our composit befor my master houyhnhnm and besid the fact wa altogeth fals for to my knowledg be in england dure some part of her majesti reign she did govern by a chief minist nay even by two success the first whereof wa the lord of godolphin and the second the lord of oxford so that you have made me say the thing that wa not likewis in the account of the academi of projector and sever passag of my discours to my master houyhnhnm you have either omit some materi circumst or minc or chang them in such a manner that i do hardli know my own work when i formerli hint to you someth of thi in a letter you were pleas to answer that you were afraid of give offenc that peopl in power were veri watch over the press and apt not onli to interpret but to punish everi thing which look like an innuendo as i think you call it but pray how could that which i spoke so mani year ago and at about five thousand leagu distanc in anoth reign be appli to ani of the yahoo who now are said to govern the herd especi at a time when i littl thought or fear the unhappi of live under them have not i the most reason to complain when i see these veri yahoo carri by houyhnhnm in a vehicl as if they were brute and those the ration creatur and inde to avoid so monstrou and detest a sight wa one princip motiv of my retir hither thu much i thought proper to tell you in relat to yourself and to the trust i repos in you i do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgment in be prevail upon by the entreati and fals reason of you and some other veri much against my own opinion to suffer my travel to be publish pray bring to your mind how often i desir you to consid when you insist on the motiv of public good that the yahoo were a speci of anim utterli incap of amend by precept or exampl and so it ha prove for instead of see a full stop put to all abus and corrupt at least in thi littl island as i had reason to expect behold after abov six month warn i can not learn that my book ha produc one singl effect accord to my intent i desir you would let me know by a letter when parti and faction were extinguish judg learn and upright pleader honest and modest with some tinctur of common sens and smithfield blaze with pyramid of law book the young nobil educ entir chang the physician banish the femal yahoo abound in virtu honour truth and good sens court and leve of great minist thoroughli weed and swept wit merit and learn reward all disgrac of the press in prose and vers condemn to eat noth but their own cotton and quench their thirst with their own ink these and a thousand other reform i firmli count upon by your encourag as inde they were plainli deduc from the precept deliv in my book and it must be own that seven month were a suffici time to correct everi vice and folli to which yahoo are subject if their natur had been capabl of the least disposit to virtu or wisdom yet so far have you been from answer my expect in ani of your letter that on the contrari you are load our carrier everi week with libel and key and reflect and memoir and second part wherein i see myself accus of reflect upon great state folk of degrad human natur for so they have still the confid to style it and of abus the femal sex i find likewis that the writer of those bundl are not agre among themselv for some of them will not allow me to be the author of my own travel and other make me author of book to which i am wholli a stranger i find likewis that your printer ha been so careless as to confound the time and mistak the date of my sever voyag and return neither assign the true year nor the true month nor day of the month and i hear the origin manuscript is all destroy sinc the public of my book neither have i ani copi left howev i have sent you some correct which you may insert if ever there should be a second edit and yet i can not stand to them but shall leav that matter to my judici and candid reader to adjust it as they pleas i hear some of our sea yahoo find fault with my sealanguag as not proper in mani part nor now in use i can not help it in my first voyag while i wa young i wa instruct by the oldest marin and learn to speak as they did but i have sinc found that the sea yahoo are apt like the land one to becom newfangl in their word which the latter chang everi year insomuch as i rememb upon each return to my own countri their old dialect wa so alter that i could hardli understand the new and i observ when ani yahoo come from london out of curios to visit me at my hous we neither of us are abl to deliv our concept in a manner intellig to the other if the censur of the yahoo could ani way affect me i should have great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think my book of travel a mere fiction out of mine own brain and have gone so far as to drop hint that the houyhnhnm and yahoo have no more exist than the inhabit of utopia inde i must confess that as to the peopl of lilliput brobdingrag for so the word should have been spelt and not erron brobdingnag and laputa i have never yet heard of ani yahoo so presumptu as to disput their be or the fact i have relat concern them becaus the truth immedi strike everi reader with convict and is there less probabl in my account of the houyhnhnm or yahoo when it is manifest as to the latter there are so mani thousand even in thi countri who onli differ from their brother brute in houyhnhnmland becaus they use a sort of jabber and do not go nake i wrote for their amend and not their approb the unit prais of the whole race would be of less consequ to me than the neigh of those two degener houyhnhnm i keep in my stabl becaus from these degener as they are i still improv in some virtu without ani mixtur of vice do these miser anim presum to think that i am so degener as to defend my verac yahoo as i am it is well known through all houyhnhnmland that by the instruct and exampl of my illustri master i wa abl in the compass of two year although i confess with the utmost difficulti to remov that infern habit of lie shuffl deceiv and equivoc so deepli root in the veri soul of all my speci especi the european i have other complaint to make upon thi vexati occas but i forbear troubl myself or you ani further i must freeli confess that sinc my last return some corrupt of my yahoo natur have reviv in me by convers with a few of your speci and particularli those of my own famili by an unavoid necess els i should never have attempt so absurd a project as that of reform the yahoo race in thi kingdom but i have now done with all such visionari scheme for ever april part i a voyag to lilliput chapter i the author give some account of himself and famili hi first induc to travel he is shipwreck and swim for hi life get safe on shore in the countri of lilliput is made a prison and carri up the countri my father had a

brethren have therefor consult with my wife and some of my acquaint i determin to go again to sea i wa surgeon success in two ship and made sever voyag for six year to the east and west indi by which i got some addit to my fortun my hour of leisur i spent in read the best author ancient and modern be alway provid with a good number of book and when i wa ashor in observ the manner and disposit of the peopl as well as learn their languag wherein i had a great facil by the strength of my memori the last of these voyag not prove veri fortun i grew weari of the sea and intend to stay at home with my wife and famili i remov from the old jewri to fetter lane and from thenc to wap hope to get busi among the sailor but it would not turn to account after three year expect that thing would mend i accept an advantag offer from captain william prichard master of the antelop who wa make a voyag to the south sea we set sail from bristol may and our voyag wa at first veri prosper it would not be proper for some reason to troubl the reader with the particular of our adventur in those sea let it suffic to inform him that in our passag from thenc to the east indi we were driven by a violent storm to the northwest of van diemen land by an observ we found ourselv in the latitud of degre minut south twelv of our crew were dead by immoder labour and ill food the rest were in a veri weak condit on the th of novemb which wa the begin of summer in those part the weather be veri hazi the seamen spi a rock within half a cabl length of the ship but the wind wa so strong that we were driven directli upon it and immedi split six of the crew of whom i wa one have let down the boat into the sea made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock we row by my comput about three leagu till we were abl to work no longer be alreadi spent with labour while we were in the ship we therefor trust ourselv to the merci of the wave and in about half an hour the boat wa overset by a sudden flurri from the north what becam of my companion in the boat as well as of those who escap on the rock or were left in the vessel i can not tell but conclud they were all lost for my own part i swam as fortun direct me and wa push forward by wind and tide i often let my leg drop and could feel no bottom but when i wa almost gone and abl to struggl no longer i found myself within my depth and by thi time the storm wa much abat the decliv wa so small that i walk near a mile befor i got to the shore which i conjectur wa about eight oclock in the even i then advanc forward near half a mile but could not discov ani sign of hous or inhabit at least i wa in so weak a condit that i did not observ them i wa extrem tire and with that and the heat of the weather and about half a pint of brandi that i drank as i left the ship i found myself much inclin to sleep i lay down on the grass which wa veri short and soft where i slept sounder than ever i rememb to have done in my life and as i reckon about nine hour for when i awak it wa just daylight i attempt to rise but wa not abl to stir for as i happen to lie on my back i found my arm and leg were strongli fasten on each side to the ground and my hair which wa long and thick tie down in the same manner i likewis felt sever slender ligatur across my bodi from my armpit to my thigh i could onli look upward the sun began to grow hot and the light offend my eye i heard a confus nois about me but in the postur i lay could see noth except the sky in a littl time i felt someth aliv move on my left leg which advanc gentli forward over my breast came almost up to my chin when bend my eye downward as much as i could i perceiv it to be a human creatur not six inch high with a bow and arrow in hi hand and a quiver at hi back in the mean time i felt at least forti more of the same kind as i conjectur follow the first i wa in the utmost astonish and roar so loud that they all ran back in a fright and some of them as i wa afterward told were hurt with the fall they got by leap from my side upon the ground howev they soon return and one of them who ventur so far as to get a full sight of my face lift up hi hand and eye by way of admir cri out in a shrill but distinct voic hekinah degul the other repeat the same word sever time but then i knew not what they meant i lay all thi while as the reader may believ in great uneasi at length struggl to get loos i had the fortun to break the string and wrench out the peg that fasten my left arm to the ground for by lift it up to my face i discov the method they had taken to bind me and at the same time with a violent pull which gave me excess pain i a littl loosen the string that tie down my hair on the left side so that i wa just abl to turn my head about two inch but the creatur ran off a second time befor i could seiz them whereupon there wa a great shout in a veri shrill accent and after it ceas i heard one of them cri aloud tolgo phonac when in an instant i felt abov a hundr arrow discharg on my left hand which prick me like so mani needl and besid they shot anoth flight into the air as we do bomb in europ whereof mani i suppos fell on my bodi though i felt them not and some on my face which i immedi cover with my left hand when thi shower of arrow wa over i fell a groan with grief and pain and then strive again to get loos they discharg anoth volley larger than the first and some of them attempt with spear to stick me in the side but by good luck i had on a buff jerkin which they could not pierc i thought it the most prudent method to lie still and my design wa to continu so till night when my left hand be alreadi loos i could easili free myself and as for the inhabit i had reason to believ i might be a match for the greatest armi they could bring against me if they were all of the same size with him that i saw but fortun dispos otherwis of me when the peopl observ i wa quiet they discharg no more arrow but by the nois i heard i knew their number increas and about four yard from me over against my right ear i heard a knock for abov an hour like that of peopl at work when turn my head that way as well as the peg and string would permit me i saw a stage erect about a foot and a half from the ground capabl of hold four of the inhabit with two or three ladder to mount it from whenc one of them who seem to be a person of qualiti made me a long speech whereof i understood not one syllabl but i should have mention that befor the princip person began hi orat he cri out three time langro dehul san these word and the former were afterward repeat and explain to me whereupon immedi about fifti of the inhabit came and cut the string that fasten the left side of my head which gave me the liberti of turn it to the right and of observ the person and gestur of him that wa to speak he appear to be of a middl age and taller than ani of the other three who attend him whereof one wa a page that held up hi train and seem to be somewhat longer than my middl finger the other two stood one on each side to support him he act everi part of an orat and i could observ mani period of threaten and other of promis piti and kind i answer in a few word but in the most submiss manner lift up my left hand and both my eye to the sun as call him for a wit and be almost famish with hunger have not eaten a morsel for some hour befor i left the ship i found the demand of natur so strong upon me that i could not forbear show my impati perhap against the strict rule of decenc by put my finger frequent to my mouth to signifi that i want food the hurgo for so they call a great lord as i afterward learnt understood me veri well he descend from the stage and command that sever ladder should be appli to my side on which abov a hundr of the inhabit mount and walk toward my mouth laden with basket full of meat which had been provid and sent thither by the king order upon the first intellig he receiv of me i observ there wa the flesh of sever anim but could not distinguish them by the tast there were shoulder leg and loin shape like those of mutton and veri well dress but smaller than the wing of a lark i ate them by two or three at a mouth and took three loav at a time about the big of musket bullet they suppli me as fast as they could show a thousand mark of wonder and astonish at my bulk and appetit i then made anoth sign that i want drink they found by my eat that a small quantiti would not suffic me and be a most ingeni peopl they slung up with great dexter one of their largest hogshead then roll it toward my hand and beat out the top i drank it off at a draught which i might well do for it did not hold half a pint and tast like a small wine of burgundi but much more delici they brought me a second hogshead which i drank in the same manner and made sign for more but they had none to give me when i had perform these wonder they shout for joy and danc upon my breast repeat sever time as they did at first hekinah degul they made me a sign that i should throw down the two hogshead but first warn the peopl below to stand out of the way cri aloud borach mevolah and when they saw the vessel in the air there wa a univers shout of hekinah degul i confess i wa often tempt while they were pass backward and forward on my bodi to seiz forti or fifti of the first that came in my reach and dash them against the ground but the remembr of what i had felt which probabl might not be the worst they could do and the promis of honour i made them—for so i interpret my submiss behaviour—soon drove out these imagin besid i now consid myself as bound by the law of hospit to a peopl who had treat me with so much expens and magnific howev in my thought i could not suffici wonder at the intrepid of these diminut mortal who durst ventur to mount and walk upon my bodi while one of my hand wa at liberti without trembl at the veri sight of so prodigi a creatur as i must appear to them after some time when they observ that i made no more demand for meat there appear befor me a person of high rank from hi imperi majesti hi excel have mount on the small of my right leg advanc forward up to my face with about a dozen of hi retinu and produc hi credenti under the signet royal which he appli close to my eye spoke about ten minut without ani sign of anger but with a kind of determin resolut often point forward which as i afterward found wa toward the capit citi about half a mile distant whither it wa agre by hi majesti in council that i must be convey i answer in few word but to no purpos and made a sign with my hand that wa loos put it to the other but over hi excel head for fear of hurt him or hi train and then to my own head and bodi to signifi that i desir my liberti it appear that he understood me well enough for he shook hi head by way of disapprob and held hi hand in a postur to show that i must be carri as a prison howev he made other sign to let me understand that i should have meat and drink enough and veri good treatment whereupon i onc more thought of attempt to break my bond but again when i felt the smart of their arrow upon my face and hand which were all in blister and mani of the dart still stick in them and observ likewis that the number of my enemi increas i gave token to let them know that they might do with me what they pleas upon thi the hurgo and hi train withdrew with much civil and cheer counten soon after i heard a gener shout with frequent repetit of the word peplom selan and i felt great number of peopl on my left side relax the cord to such a degre that i wa abl to turn upon my right and to eas myself with make water which i veri plenti did to the great astonish of the peopl who conjectur by my motion what i wa go to do immedi open to the right and left on that side to avoid the torrent which fell with such nois and violenc from me but befor thi they had daub my face and both my hand with a sort of ointment veri pleasant to the smell which in a few minut remov all the smart of their arrow these circumst ad to the refresh i had receiv by their victual and drink which were veri nourish dispos me to sleep i slept about eight hour as i wa afterward assur and it wa no wonder for the physician by the emperor order had mingl a sleepi potion in the hogshead of wine it seem that upon the first moment i wa discov sleep on the ground after my land the emperor had earli notic of it by an express and determin in council that i should be tie in the manner i have relat which wa done in the night while i slept that plenti of meat and drink should be sent to me and a machin prepar to carri me to the capit citi thi resolut perhap may appear veri bold and danger and i am confid would not be imit by ani princ in europ on the like occas howev in my opinion it wa extrem prudent as well as gener for suppos these peopl had endeavour to kill me with their spear and arrow while i wa asleep i should certainli have awak with the first sens of smart which might so far have rous my rage and strength as to have enabl me to break the string wherewith i wa tie after which as they were not abl to make resist so they could expect no merci these peopl are most excel mathematician and arriv to a great perfect in mechan by the counten and encourag of the emperor who is a renown patron of learn thi princ ha sever machin fix on wheel for the carriag of tree and other great weight he often build hi largest men of war whereof some are nine feet long in the wood where the timber grow and ha them carri on these engin three or four hundr yard to the sea five hundr carpent and engin were immedi set at work to prepar the greatest engin they had it wa a frame of wood rais three inch from the ground about seven feet long and four wide move upon twentytwo wheel the shout i heard wa upon the arriv of thi engin which it seem set out in four hour after my land it wa brought parallel to me as i lay but the princip difficulti wa to rais and place me in thi vehicl eighti pole each of one foot high were erect for thi purpos and veri strong cord of the big of packthread were fasten by hook to mani bandag which the workmen had girt round my neck my hand my bodi and my leg nine hundr of the strongest men were employ to draw up these cord by mani pulley fasten on the pole and thu in less than three hour i wa rais and slung into the engin and there tie fast all thi i wa told for while the oper wa perform i lay in a profound sleep by the forc of that soporifer medicin infus into my liquor fifteen hundr of the emperor largest hors each about four inch and a half high were employ to draw me toward the metropoli which as i said wa half a mile distant about four hour after we began our journey i awak by a veri ridicul accid for the carriag be stop a while to adjust someth that wa out of order two or three of the young nativ had the curios to see how i look when i wa asleep they climb up into the engin and advanc veri softli to my face one of them an offic in the guard put the sharp end of hi halfpik a good way up into my left nostril which tickl my nose like a straw and made me sneez violent whereupon they stole off unperceiv and it wa three week befor i knew the caus of my wake so suddenli we made a long march the remain part of the day and rest at night with five hundr guard on each side of me half with torch and half with bow and arrow readi to shoot me if i should offer to stir the next morn at sunris we continu our march and arriv within two hundr yard of the citi gate about noon the emperor and all hi court came out to meet us but hi great offic would by no mean suffer hi majesti to endang hi person by mount on my bodi at the place where the carriag stop there stood an ancient templ esteem to be the largest in the whole kingdom which have been pollut some year befor by an unnatur murder wa accord to the zeal of those peopl look upon as profan and therefor had been appli to common use and all the ornament and furnitur carri away in thi edific it wa determin i should lodg the great gate front to the north wa about four feet high and almost two feet wide through which i could easili creep on each side of the gate wa a small window not abov six inch from the ground into that on the left side the king smith convey fourscor and eleven chain like those that hang to a ladi watch in europ and almost as larg which were lock to my left leg with sixandthirti padlock over against thi templ on the other side of the great highway at twenti feet distanc there wa a turret at least five feet high here the emperor ascend with mani princip lord of hi court to have an opportun of view me as i wa told for i could not see them it wa reckon that abov a hundr thousand inhabit came out of the town upon the same errand and in spite of my guard i believ there could not be fewer than ten thousand at sever time who mount my bodi by the help of ladder but a proclam wa soon issu to forbid it upon pain of death when the workmen found it wa imposs for me to break loos they cut all the string that bound me whereupon i rose up with as melancholi a disposit as ever i had in my life but the nois and astonish of the peopl at see me rise and walk are not to be express the chain that held my left leg were about two yard long and gave me not onli the liberti of walk backward and forward in a semicircl but be fix within four inch of the gate allow me to creep in and lie at my full length in the templ chapter ii the emperor of lilliput attend by sever of the nobil come to see the author in hi confin the emperor person and habit describ learn men appoint to teach the author their languag he gain favour by hi mild disposit hi pocket are search and hi sword and pistol taken from him when i found myself on my feet i look about me and must confess i never beheld a more entertain prospect the countri around appear like a continu garden and the enclos field which were gener forti feet squar resembl so mani bed of flower these field were intermingl with wood of half a stang and the tallest tree as i could judg appear to be seven feet high i view the town on my left hand which look like the paint scene of a citi in a theatr i had been for some hour extrem press by the necess of natur which wa no wonder it be almost two day sinc i had last disburden myself i wa under great difficulti between urgenc and shame the best expedi i could think of wa to creep into my hous which i accordingli did and shut the gate after me i went as far as the length of my chain would suffer and discharg my bodi of that uneasi load but thi wa the onli time i wa ever guilti of so uncleanli an action for which i can not but hope the candid reader will give some allow after he ha matur and imparti consid my case and the distress i wa in from thi time my constant practic wa as soon as i rose to perform that busi in open air at the full extent of my chain and due care wa taken everi morn befor compani came that the offens matter should be carri off in wheelbarrow by two servant appoint for that purpos i would not have dwelt so long upon a circumst that perhap at first sight may appear not veri moment if i had not thought it necessari to justifi my charact in point of cleanli to the world which i am told some of my malign have been pleas upon thi and other occas to call in question when thi adventur wa at an end i came back out of my hous have occas for fresh air the emperor wa alreadi descend from the tower and advanc on horseback toward me which had like to have cost him dear for the beast though veri well train yet wholli unus to such a sight which appear as if a mountain move befor him rear up on it hinder feet but that princ who is an excel horseman kept hi seat till hi attend ran in and held the bridl while hi majesti had time to dismount when he alight he survey me round with great admir but kept beyond the length of my chain he order hi cook and butler who were alreadi prepar to give me victual and drink which they push forward in a sort of vehicl upon wheel till i could reach them i took these vehicl and soon empti them all twenti of them were fill with meat and ten with liquor each of the former afford me two or three good mouth and i empti the liquor of ten vessel which wa contain in earthen vial into one vehicl drink it off at a draught and so i did with the rest the empress and young princ of the blood of both sex attend by mani ladi sat at some distanc in their chair but upon the accid that happen to the emperor hors they alight and came near hi person which i am now go to describ he is taller by almost the breadth of my nail than ani of hi court which alon is enough to strike an awe into the behold hi featur are strong and masculin with an austrian lip and arch nose hi complexion oliv hi counten erect hi bodi and limb well proport all hi motion grace and hi deport majest he wa then past hi prime be twentyeight year and three quarter old of which he had reign about seven in great felic and gener victori for the better conveni of behold him i lay on my side so that my face wa parallel to hi and he stood but three yard off howev i have had him sinc mani time in my hand and therefor can not be deceiv in the descript hi dress wa veri plain and simpl and the fashion of it between the asiat and the european but he had on hi head a light helmet of gold adorn with jewel and a plume on the crest he held hi sword drawn in hi hand to defend himself if i should happen to break loos it wa almost three inch long the hilt and scabbard were gold enrich with diamond hi voic wa shrill but veri clear and articul and i could distinctli hear it when i stood up the ladi and courtier were all most magnific clad so that the spot they stood upon seem to resembl a petticoat spread upon the ground embroid with figur of gold and silver hi imperi majesti spoke often to me and i return answer but neither of us could understand a syllabl there were sever of hi priest and lawyer present as i conjectur by their habit who were command to address themselv to me and i spoke to them in as mani languag as i had the least smatter of which were high and low dutch latin french spanish italian and lingua franca but all to no purpos after about two hour the court retir and i wa left with a strong guard to prevent the impertin and probabl the malic of the rabbl who were veri impati to crowd about me as near as they durst and some of them had the impud to shoot their arrow at me as i sat on the ground by the door of my hous whereof one veri narrowli miss my left eye but

we began alreadi to convers togeth in some sort and the first word i learnt were to express my desir that he would pleas give me my liberti which i everi day repeat on my knee hi answer as i could comprehend it wa that thi must be a work of time not to be thought on without the advic of hi council and that first i must lumo kelmin pesso desmar lon emposo that is swear a peac with him and hi

knew thi could not be done without my consent and assist and he had so good an opinion of my generos and justic as to trust their person in my hand that whatev they took from me should be return when i left the countri or paid for at the rate which i would set upon them i took up the two offic in my hand put them first into my coatpocket and then into everi other pocket about me except my two fob and anoth secret pocket which i had no mind should be search wherein i had some littl necessari that were of no consequ to ani but myself in one of my fob there wa a silver watch and in the other a small quantiti of gold in a purs these gentlemen have pen ink and paper about them made an exact inventori of everi thing they saw and when they had done desir i would set them down that they might deliv it to the emperor thi inventori i afterward translat into english and is word for word as follow imprimi in the right coatpocket of the great manmountain for so i interpret the word quinbu flestrin after the strictest search we found onli one great piec of coarsecloth larg enough to be a footcloth for your majesti chief room of state in the left pocket we saw a huge silver chest with a cover of the same metal which we the searcher were not abl to lift we desir it should be open and one of us step into it found himself up to the mid leg in a sort of dust some part whereof fli up to our face set us both a sneez for sever time togeth in hi right waistcoatpocket we found a prodigi bundl of white thin substanc fold one over anoth about the big of three men tie with a strong cabl and mark with black figur which we humbl conceiv to be write everi letter almost half as larg as the palm of our hand in the left there wa a sort of engin from the back of which were extend twenti long

understand us in the larg pocket on the right side of hi middl cover so i translat the word ranfulo by which they meant my breech we saw a hollow pillar of iron about the length of a man fasten to a strong piec of timber larger than the pillar and upon one side of the pillar were huge piec of iron stick out cut into strang figur which we know not what to make of in the left pocket anoth engin of the same kind in the smaller pocket on the right side were sever round flat piec of white and red metal of differ bulk some of the white which seem to be silver were so larg and heavi that my comrad and i could hardli lift them in the left pocket were two black pillar irregularli shape we could not without difficulti reach the top of them as we stood at the bottom of hi pocket one of them wa cover and seem all of a piec but at the upper end of the other there appear a white round substanc about twice the big of our head within each of these wa enclos a prodigi plate of steel which by our

hi meat with the other there were two pocket which we could not enter these he call hi fob they were two larg slit cut into the top of hi middl cover but squeez close by the pressur of hi belli out of the right fob hung a great silver chain with a wonder kind of engin at the bottom we direct him to draw out whatev wa at the end of that chain which appear to be a globe half silver and half of some transpar metal for on the transpar side we saw certain strang figur circularli drawn and thought we could touch them till we found our finger stop by the lucid substanc he put thi engin into our ear which made an incess nois like that of a watermil and we conjectur it is either some unknown anim or the god that he worship but we are more inclin to the latter opinion becaus he assur us if we understood him right for he express himself veri imperfectli that he seldom did ani thing without consult it he call it hi oracl and said it point out the time for everi action of hi life from the left fob he took out a net almost larg enough for a fisherman but contriv to open and shut like a purs and serv him for the same use we found therein sever massi piec of yellow metal which if they be real gold must be of immens valu have thu in obedi to your majesti command dilig search all hi pocket we observ a girdl about hi waist made of the hide of some prodigi anim from which on the left side hung a sword of the length of five men and on the right a bag or pouch divid into two cell each cell capabl of hold three of your majesti subject in one of these cell were sever globe or ball of a most ponder metal about the big of our head and requir a strong hand to lift them the other cell contain a heap of certain black grain but of no great bulk or weight for we could hold abov fifti of them in the palm of our hand thi is an exact inventori of what we found about the bodi of the manmountain who use us with great civil and due respect to your majesti commiss sign and seal on the

their bow and arrow just readi to discharg but i did not observ it for mine eye were wholli fix upon hi majesti he then desir me to draw my scimitar which although it had got some rust by the sea water wa in most part exceed bright i did so and immedi all the troop gave a shout between terror and surpris for the sun shone clear and the reflect dazzl their eye as i wave the scimitar to and fro in my hand hi majesti who is a most magnanim princ wa less daunt than i could expect he order me to return it into the scabbard and cast it on the ground as gentli as i could about six feet from the end of my chain the next thing he demand wa one of the hollow iron pillar by which he meant my pocket pistol i drew it out and at hi desir as well as i could express to him the use of it and charg it onli with powder which by the close of my pouch happen to escap wet in the sea an inconveni against which all prudent marin take special care to provid i first caution the emperor not to be afraid and then i let it off in the air the astonish here wa much greater than at the sight of my scimitar hundr fell down as if they had been struck dead and even the emperor although he stood hi ground could not recov himself for some time i deliv up both my pistol in the same manner as i had done my scimitar and then my pouch of powder and bullet beg him that the former might be kept from fire for it would kindl with the smallest spark and blow up hi imperi palac into the air i likewis deliv up my watch which the emperor wa veri curiou to see and command two of hi tallest yeomen of the guard to bear it on a pole upon their shoulder as draymen in england do a barrel of ale he wa amaz at the continu nois it made and the motion of the minutehand which he could easili discern for their sight is much more acut than our he ask the opinion of hi learn men about it which were variou and remot as the reader may well imagin without my repeat although inde i could not veri perfectli understand them i then gave up my silver and copper money my purs with nine larg piec of gold and some smaller one my knife and razor my comb and silver snuffbox my handkerchief and journalbook my scimitar pistol and

princip secretari for privat affair is in my opinion if i am not partial the second after the treasur the rest of the great offic are much upon a par these divers are often attend with fatal accid whereof great number are on record i myself have seen two or three candid break a limb but the danger is much greater when the minist themselv are command to show their dexter for by contend to excel themselv and their fellow they strain so far that there is hardli one of them who ha not receiv a fall and some of them two or three i wa assur that a year or two befor my arriv flimnap would infal

those of the royal stabl have been daili led befor me were no longer shi but would come up to my veri feet without start the rider would leap them over my hand as i held it on the ground and one of the emperor huntsmen upon a larg courser took my foot shoe and all which wa inde a prodigi leap i had the good fortun to divert the emperor one day after a veri extraordinari manner i desir he would order sever stick of two feet high and the thick of an ordinari cane to be brought me whereupon hi majesti command the master of hi wood to give direct accordingli and the next morn six woodmen arriv with as mani carriag drawn by eight hors to each i took nine of these stick and fix them firmli in the ground in a quadrangular figur two feet and a half squar i took four other stick and tie them parallel at each corner about two feet from the ground then i fasten my handkerchief to the nine stick that stood erect and extend it on all side till it wa tight as the top of a drum and the four parallel stick rise about five inch higher than the handkerchief serv as ledg on each side when i had finish my work i desir the emperor to let a troop of hi best hors twentyfour in number come and

immedi reliev them both and cover the hole with one hand i set down the troop with the other in the same manner as i took them up the hors that fell wa strain in the left shoulder but the rider got no hurt and i repair my handkerchief as well as i could howev i would not trust to the strength of it ani more in such danger enterpris about two or three day befor i wa set at liberti as i wa entertain the court with thi kind of feat there arriv an express to inform hi majesti that some of hi subject ride near the place where i wa first taken up had seen a great black substanc lie on the around veri

and some of them had walk round it sever time that by mount upon each other shoulder they had got to the top which wa flat and even and stamp upon it they found that it wa hollow within that they humbl conceiv it might be someth belong to the manmountain and if hi majesti pleas they would undertak to bring it with onli five hors i present knew what they meant and wa glad at heart to receiv thi
