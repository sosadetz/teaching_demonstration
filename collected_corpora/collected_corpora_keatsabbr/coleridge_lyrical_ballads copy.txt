black cloud is cleft and the moon is at it side like water shot from some high crag the lightn fall with never a jag a river steep and wide the strong wind reachd the ship it roard and droppd down like a stone beneath the lightn and the moon the dead men gave a groan they groand they stirrd they all upros ne spake ne movd their eye it had been strang even in a dream to have seen those dead men rise the helmsman steerd the ship movd on yet never a breez upblew the mariner all gan work the rope where they were wont to do they raisd their limb like lifeless tool we were a ghastli crew the bodi of my brother son stood by me knee to knee the bodi and i pulld at one rope but he said nought to me and i quakd to think of my own voic how fright it would be the daylight dawndthey droppd their arm and clusterd round the mast sweet sound rose slowli thro their mouth and from their bodi passd around around flew each sweet sound then dart to the sun slowli the sound came back again now mixd now one by one sometim a drop from the sky i heard the lavrock sing sometim all littl bird that are how they seemd to fill the sea and air with their sweet jargon and now twa like all instrument now like a lone flute and now it is an angel song that make the heaven be mute it ceasd yet still the sail made on a pleasant nois till noon a nois like of a hidden brook in the leafi month of june that to the

movd onward from beneath under the keel nine fathom deep from the land of mist and snow the spirit slid and it wa he that made the ship to go the sail at noon left off their tune and the ship stood still also the sun right up abov the mast had fixd her to the ocean but in a minut she gan stir with a short uneasi motion backward and forward half her length with a short uneasi motion then like a paw hors let go she made a sudden bound it flung the blood into my head and i fell into a swound how long in that same fit i lay i have not to declar but ere my live life returnd i heard and in my soul discernd two voic in the air is it he quoth one is thi the man by him who die on cross with hi cruel bow he layd full low the harmless albatross the spirit who bideth by himself in the land of

that there wa pleasur there if i these thought may not prevent if such be of my creed the plan have i not reason to lament what man ha made of man the thorn i there is a thorn it look so old in truth youd find it hard to say how it could ever have been young it look so old and grey not higher than a twoyear child it stand erect thi age thorn no leav it ha no thorni point it is a mass of knot joint a wretch thing forlorn it stand erect and like a stone with lichen it is overgrown ii like rock or stone it is oergrown with lichen to the veri top and hung with heavi tuft of moss a melancholi crop up from the earth these moss creep and thi poor thorn they clasp it round so close youd say that they were bent with plain and manifest intent to drag it to the ground and all had join in one endeavour to buri thi poor thorn for ever iii high on a mountain highest ridg where oft the stormi winter gale cut like a scyth while through the cloud it sweep from vale to vale not five yard from the mountainpath thi thorn you on your left espi and to the left three yard beyond you see a littl muddi pond of water never dri ive measur it from side to side ti three feet long and two feet wide iv and close besid thi age thorn there is a fresh and love sight a beauteou heap a hill of moss just half a foot in height all love colour there you see all colour that were ever seen and mossi network too is there as if by hand of ladi fair the work had woven been and cup the darl of the eye so deep is their vermilion dye v ah me what love tint are there of olivegreen and scarlet bright in spike in branch and in star green red and pearli white thi heap of earth oergrown with moss which close besid the thorn you see so fresh in all it beauteou dye is like an infant grave in size as like as like can be but never never ani where an infant grave wa half so fair vi now would you see thi age thorn thi pond and beauteou hill of moss you must take care and chuse your time the mountain when to cross for oft there sit between the heap that like an infant grave in size and that same pond of which i spoke a woman in a scarlet cloak and to herself she cri oh miseri oh miseri oh woe is me oh miseri vii at all time of the day and night thi wretch woman thither goe and she is known to everi star and everi wind that blow and there besid the thorn she sit when the blue daylight in the sky and when the whirlwind on the hill or frosti air is keen and still and to herself she cri oh miseri oh miseri oh woe is me oh miseri viii now wherefor thu by day and night in rain in tempest and in snow thu to the dreari mountaintop doe thi poor woman go and whi sit she besid the thorn when the blue daylight in the sky or when the whirlwind on the hill or frosti air is keen and still and wherefor doe she cri oh wherefor wherefor tell me whi doe she repeat that dole cri ix i can not tell i wish i could for the true reason no one know but if youd gladli view the spot the spot to which she goe the heap that like an infant grave the pondand thorn so old and grey pass by her doorti seldom shut and if you see her in her hut then to the spot away i never heard of such as dare approach the spot when she is there x but wherefor to the mountaintop can thi unhappi woman go whatev star is in the sky whatev wind may blow nay rack your brainti all in vain ill tell you everi thing i know but to the thorn and to the pond which is a littl step beyond i wish that you would go perhap when you are at the place you someth of her tale may trace xi ill give you the best help i can befor you up the mountain go up to the dreari mountaintop ill tell you all i know ti now some two and twenti year sinc she her name is martha ray gave with a maiden true good will her compani to stephen hill and she wa blith and gay and she wa happi happi still wheneer she thought of stephen hill xii and they had fixd the weddingday the morn that must wed them both but stephen to anoth maid had sworn anoth oath and with thi other maid to church unthink stephen went poor martha on that woful day a cruel cruel fire they say into her bone wa sent it dri her bodi like a cinder and almost turnd her brain to tinder xiii they say full six month after thi while yet the summerleav were green she to the mountaintop would go and there wa often seen ti said a child wa in her womb as now to ani eye wa plain she wa with child and she wa mad yet often she wa sober sad from her exceed pain oh me ten thousand time id rather that he had die that cruel father xiv sad case for such a brain to hold communion with a stir child sad case as you may think for one who had a brain so wild last christma when we talk of thi old farmer simpson did maintain that in her womb the infant wrought about it mother heart and brought her sens back again and when at last her time drew near her look were calm her sens clear xv no more i know i wish i did and i would tell it all to you for what becam of thi poor child there none that ever knew and if a child wa born or no there no one that could ever tell and if twa born aliv or dead there no one know as i have said
