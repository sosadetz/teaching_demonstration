from the bodi aris appetit for worldli thing and pleasur in them from the soul desir of thing spiritu and etern and a relish for them we live an anim or a natur life and we live at the same time a ration or spiritu life thu by the veri constitut of our natur our attent is drawn differ way our view are direct to contrari object and we are engag in dissimilar employ by concern about the one we may becom neglig of the other the thing of thi world are the object of sens they are continu solicit our notic they forc themselv into our view they affect us strongli by these mean they are veri apt to render us regardless of spiritu and etern thing which can be perceiv onli by faith which make but a weak impress on the thoughtless which can not influenc our conduct except we set ourselv voluntarili and designedli to medit upon them while we are intent on our occup for the support of the anim life we may veri readili fall into neglect with respect to that occup which belong to us as reason and immort creatur we should guard against thi with a care proport to the danger of our becom guilti of it the scriptur perpetu inculc upon us that the etern happi of our soul and the practic of holi by which it is secur ought to be our princip concern and to engag us more earnestli than ani of the possess and enjoy which can profit us onli in the present life or ani of those worldli employ which are subservi to the attain of them the least reflect is suffici to convinc us of the proprieti and the import of thi conduct to those who at all think serious the difficulti lie onli in preserv a command impress of the necess of thi conduct and put it in practic amidst the busi scene and the diffip of common life these frequent obliter the convict and effac the sentiment which are produc by the most affect represent of the superior valu of spiritu and etern thing exhibit in an hour of retir and devot it is of great moment therefor to acquir a strike sens of the manner in which a concern for the salvat of our soul and applic to the duti of religion may be intermingl with our whole worldli employ and exert in the variou circumst of ordinari life for discours on thi subject we may natur take occas from the word now read i will walk say david befor the lord in the land of the live to walk befor the lord genesi xvii xxiv xlviii king iii king xx pro lv and to walk with the lord genesi v vi mich vi mal ii are beauti express use in scriptur on purpos to convey thi veri view of religion and the former of them convey it the more explicitli in thi place by the psalmist have ad in the land of the live by these last word he no doubt design to express the constanc of that obedi to god which he promis in return for the merci acknowledg in thi psalm he meant to intim that he would persist in it to the end of hi life but they likewis natur impli that he would incorpor hi religion with hi whole ordinari life and make it to run through all the occup in which he might ever be employ in common with other men and to blend itself with all the transact rel to the present world in which he might be at ani time engag it is certain that the scriptur alway suppos religion to be connect with common life and design for influenc us in all the affair of it they never repres it as a thing which may be laid asid when we come into the world or for which we have no occas while we are busi in the labor of our station to consid religion in thi import point of view as what ought to mix with all our secular employ and give a tinctur and complexion to all those action which have the most intim relat to the present anim life is what i now propos by set religion in thi light i do not mean to affirm that it contain no duti distinct from the right conduct of our ordinari busi or that there are no exercis belong to it which are abstract from common life there are time and season appropri to particular religi duti into which no concern about our ordinari busi should be allow to intrud there are assembl call togeth for partak in the sacrament for public worship and for hear the word where we must be intent on these exercis alon and whenc we must exclud all worldli thought and care there are exercis of devot which must be perform in the secresi and still of retir prayer the read of the scriptur medit on the principl of religion and the oblig of our sever duti selfexamin confess of our sin and resolut of amend we are not truli religi if we allow concern for our tempor interest and dilig in our worldli busi to lead us into the neglect of these they have not an immedi relat to the employ of our station but they are consist with them they suspend them for a littl but they can be perform without ani inconveni interrupt of them these duti of religion enter not directli into common life nor are intim incorpor with it function they are rather in appear abstract from them but they are in realiti subservi to the right discharg of them they form impress which may influenc us in life they reviv sentiment which without them the hurri of busi would dissip they invigor principl of conduct which the avoc of the world would enfeebl but which the good man must act upon everi day without attend on these duti of religion we could have no good sentiment or principl to carri into the world with us but we attend upon them to no purpos if we carri not into the world with us if we maintain not amidst all the bustl of the world the good sentiment and principl which they are fit to infus the church and the closet are the place where these duti are perform but the world is the place where we must display the effect which they produc and exert the temper of holi which they cherish the spiritu life must be recruit by the exercis of retir and retreat but when it is recruit by these as the nourish adap to it it is in the world that it must show it vigor it function must mix themselv with all those of the anim life our employ for etern must be interwoven with all our occup for time in the sequel i shall first point out the import of thi view of religion and secondli explain it first i shall point out the import of consid religion as connect with all the part of our ordinari life there is no mistak about the natur of religion more danger than an opinion that it is inconsist or even unconnect with the ordinari busi of life thi opinion will produc differ effect on differ person but all the effect which it can produc will be pernici if it be entertain it will infal lead the gener to neglect religion altogeth present thing are so constantli in our view the want and the demand of the natur life are felt so strongli that most men will be engross by them if they apprehend that without neglect them they can not secur futur and unseen thing did all men perceiv clearli that they may walk with god while they are mix in the societi and employ of men and that they may most effectu promot their etern happi while they are occupi in the busi of their tempor vocat mani would endeavor to work out their salvat phil ii who scarc think of it becaus they imagin it unconnect with their ordinari busi or incompat with their worldli pursuit some howev have so deep a sens of the import of their etern interest and so strong a solicitud to secur them that an opinion of their inconsist with the busi and pursuit of life will drive them into the opposit extrem under the influenc of thi mistak mani have seclud themselv from the world withdrawn from all the occup of life and given up themselv to idl contempl and solitari devot the life of such person may be harmless but it is useless it may be freer from vice than the live of other but it is less virtuou they have not been expos to the same temptat with other their innoc ha in mani case arisen onli from their want of opportun for commit sin not from strength of mind or the vigor of virtuou principl were a life of monkish indol necessari or conduc to the improv and salvat of our soul god would not have place us in a world where we have so mani want that can not be satisfi without dilig applic to a varieti of occup an activ and busi life is perfectli consist with all that god requir of us for pleas him or for obtain etern happi holi preserv uncorrupt and exercis vigor in activ life is much worthier than the inoffens blameless of the mere reclus you should yield your activ servic unto god you can not pleas him more effectu than by follow your sever vocat by engag in the ordinari employ of life by pursu them with industri and be convers about them in a right manner you do not serv god you do not labor for etern you do not take care of your soul onli when you are medit or read or hear or pray or partak of the lord supper but also as effectu though these purpos be not perhap so directli in your thought when you are go about your worldli busi in a virtuou manner when you are honestli and conscienti do the work of your station you may live to god and yet live in the world to renounc the world and fli to solitud is to renounc the station which god ha allot us and abandon the opportun of do good and becom good which he ha given us men may entertain the mistak of which we are speak without run into either of the extrem now mention they may regard religion as someth wholli abstract from life and yet may engag in the ordinari busi of life without neglect religion altogeth in thi case they will take up with a fals speci of religion they will be concern perhap anxious concern for their salvat but they will pursu it in an improp manner they imagin that the state of their soul depend onli on some formal transact with god on some solitari and secret exert of the will and the affect in dedic themselv to him and accept of jesu christ and that it is no wise affect by the manner in which they carri on their ordinari busi they think that they may be religi though they be immor that they may provid for etern though they neglect the duti of time that they may be in a state of grace though they be bad husband bad wive unnatur parent unduti children unfaith servant unkind and quarrelsom neighbor or dishonest dealer they regard the grace of the spirit as total distinct from the moral virtu the conduct which god approv as perfectli differ from that behavior which is use to mankind they make an unnatur divorc between religion and moral in the place of true holi they substitut an absurd and unprofit superstit ala my brethren they deceiv themselv if they act accord to thi idea their religion will have no greater influenc upon their conduct than if they made no pretens to religion and therefor it will have no more influenc upon their etern salvat genuin religion is wholli practic grace is but the principl of virtu and good work your religion can be of no valu i should rather say you have no real religion if it do not enter into life with you if it do not pervad and anim all your action a veri great part of that conduct by which your etern happi may be promot consist in transact your ordinari busi in a proper and virtuou manner there is scarc an action of your live so insignific as not either to promot or to obstruct your salvat the most trivial and common action may be perform right or they may be perform wrong we should all therefor maintain an uninterrupt care to perform all the action of our live aright if we maintain thi care we shall forward our everlast happi by the veri same action by which we obtain or enjoy present thing mani of the common action of life are far from be trivial or unimport in a religi and moral view it is by live in societi and employ ourselv in the ordinari busi of it that we can find opportun for mani of our most import duti for mani of the princip function of the spiritu and christian life and by seiz these opportun and use them properli we shall most effectu provid for etern it is from the ordinari occurr of life that we find occas for the princip exert of those virtu which regard either ourselv our neighbor or our god and these virtu comprehend the whole of our duti and constitut that holi which is the necessari prepar for heaven the observ which have been hitherto made abundantli show the import of that view of religion which i am endeavor to give you they likewis explain it in some measur for the more particular explic of it which wa the second thing propos let us briefli point out how the three great branch of our duti now mention interweav themselv with the ordinari action and employ of life there are mani duti which we owe properli to ourselv for practic which we find the opportun in the cours of ordinari life as long as we dwell in these earthli tabernacl some foresight and dilig about the necessari and conveni of the present life is unavoid god doe not forbid it he ha not made it inconsist with the pursuit of futur happi none would wish to starv or to be nake god doe not requir you to court these hardship you may be dilig you ought to be dilig in your call god not onli allow but command you to be dilig not sloth in busi roman xii is a precept of divin author there are mani similar precept god promis hi bless to dilig and give frequent encourag to it that man sin and obstruct hi own progress to heaven who is idl in hi station religion render industri a duti toward ourselv enforc by the author of god by reflect on thi oblig to it and allow it to have some influenc upon us we shall convert everi exert of industri in our trade or profess into an act of obedi to god and if while we are prompt to industri by the instinct and prospect of the anim life common to all men we be also impel to it by a regard to the command of god thi addit motiv can not fail to quicken our industri to increas it and to render it more success god requir that the immedi object of your industri should not engross your whole heart that you should not imagin the attain of them suffici to make you happi that amidst your labor for them you should maintain a

which god requir of you to embrac and improv these opportun thi is to do good to be rich in good work readi to distribut will to commun by thi you lay up in store for yourselv a good foundat against the time to come that you may lay hold on etern life timothi vi i can not mention particularli all the way in which true holi will enter into social life and exert itself toward other in all the vari scene and complic situat which turn up in the cours of ordinari busi in addit to the instanc alreadi given i shall onli observ in gener that everi act of proper behavior which we show as parent as children as master as servant as we belong to a particular occup or profess as we are place in a particular relat is a real act of holi pleas to god and conduc to our etern happi on the other hand everi instanc of improp behavior in ani of these relat or situat displeas god and retard our progress to heaven when we contempl religion as thu concern in our whole behavior toward other as either observ or violat in all our social action how extens doe it appear to be how uninterrupt are our opportun for it how constant should be our attent to it how often do we neglect or transgress it oblig when we imagin our action perfectli indiffer and remov wholli out of the provinc of religion we must likewis carri pieti along with us through the whole cours of our live we must exercis godli in all our occup els we have no true religion nor can be fit for the enjoy of god thi is an import part of our subject the illustr of which we can not now enter upon sermon ii religion intim connect with ordinari life psalm cxvi i will walk befor the lord in the land of the live religion consid in it just extent contain two sort of duti the duti of pieti and those which regard the action of the natur and social life both are essenti to it but men show a strong propens to consid the former as unconnect with life and the latter as unconnect with religion and by a misconcept of both sort equal though in differ respect to disunit religion from the occup of common life it proce from a partial view of both these and it tend to render our practic of both defect men confin their idea of pieti to the act of immedi worship they consid it not as what should as what can enter into common life they think that they serv god onli when they are worship him and disengag from their worldli employ conceiv religion in so fals and contract a light they necessarili regard the action of the natur and social life as without the verg of religion as not requir or admit ani regul or direct from it influenc in consequ of these partial and imperfect concept some have withdrawn from the busi of life that they might give up themselv wholli to devot or have becom neglig in their law call as interrupt their applic to religion and mani more intent on their worldli employ and interest and regard all act of devot as encroach upon these neglect them total or crowd them into as littl time as possibl god is not in all their thought psalm x person of a seriou turn and sensibl of the import of pieti will appli to what they consid as belong to it but if they imagin act of immedi worship to be all that belong to it their applic will be of littl valu they will be punctual in perform these but they will think that when they have perform these they have done all that pieti requir and are abundantli religi and too often they imagin that if they spend some hour of the day in devot they may do through the rest of it whatev they pleas whatev their viciou passion prompt them to at least they are not suffici care to avoid do so thu their religion becom a mere round of extern servic attend perhap with transient and unmean emot of soul but not a prepar for the right conduct of life and they bear in themselv that charact of corrupt which the apostl assign to the men of the last day have a form of godli but deni the power thereof timothi iii whether men have a regard to religion or have not if the action of the natur and social life be consid as without the provinc of religion the necessari consequ will be that men shall think themselv at liberti to perform them not accord to the rule of religion whenev we look upon the ordinari action of common life as indiffer whenev we forget that there is either virtu or vice in almost everi one of them we are in great danger of indulg vice and contract guilt in the perform of them whenev we allow ourselv to imagin that these action have no influenc on our salvat we shall be readi to do them in such a manner as must obstruct our salvat of the three class of duti which are incumb upon us those which regard ourselv and those which regard other men are too often consid as littl connect with religion and are for that reason reckon such as may be in some measur neglect without great danger to our salvat i have therefor shown that our habitu behavior both toward ourselv and toward other in the variou situat of common life necessarili impli good or evil and promot or obstruct our everlast happi the other class of duti those which regard god and are comprehend under the name of pieti are on the contrari often consid as unconnect with the ordinari busi of life in opposit to thi mistak i now proceed to show that we must carri pieti along with us through the whole cours of our live that we must exercis godli in all our occup els we can have no true religion nor be fit for the enjoy of god in heaven we may acquir some live impress of god in retir or in the ordin of worship but if these impress do not remain with us and actuat us when we enter into the world and all the time we are convers in the world they are of no moment religi affect may be nourish in the retreat of devot as a child is fed within door but it is in the open air and by the bustl of exercis that the child acquir and show health vigor and agil and it is in the field of the world and by be introduc into it sever occup that the religi affect obtain and display strength firm and energi it is in the world they are put to the trial it is there we find opportun for exert them and it is by be exert there that they are improv into a command temper of pieti there is no situat in life which give not scope for some exercis of godli and which requir it not if we would not be want to our duti pieti or a regard to god is a vital spirit which may run through and ought to run through all the virtu which respect either ourselv or other to anim to model and direct them it is not exclud from ani place or condit which admit ani virtu whatev it can not be dispens with from ani such place or condit but that virtu lose much of it luster and is even in danger of perish love to god is an affect which doe not spend itself in silent admir or warm feel it is fit to enter into life and to act in life we are command to keep ourselv in the love of god jude ver it is a temper which may possess us as constantli and influenc us as regularli as affect to a parent or a friend it should influenc us through life in the whole of our behavior in a manner similar to that in which affect to a parent or a friend oper on such part of our behavior as have a respect to them love to god doe not display itself so much or ascertain it sincer and ardour so unexception by ani emot inwardli felt or by ani raptur of devot as by it effect upon our action by make us delight to obey and pleas god in everi part of our behavior by make us will to relinquish what we most fondli desir or to incur what we most vehement dread rather than offend him in commit ani sin or neglect ani duti by allur us to the imit of all those moral attribut which render god the object of our love and by cherish benevol and draw out benefic to all men who are the children of our father in heaven love to god will find opportun for some of these exercis of it in all our worldli busi in all the action and event of common life and if ani man neglect these exercis of it whenev he find opportun for them how dwell the love of god in him john iii hi heart is void of it though liveli of imagin or a constitut warmth of affect may lead him to presum that hi love to god is ardent rever of god is not more analog to the love of god in itself than in it effect upon our ordinari conduct it is not exercis onli when we set ourselv to contempl and celebr hi great we may be and we ought to be in the fear of the lord all the day long prove xxiii if we have ani rever of god it will show itself everi hour in our most common behavior in the shade of solitud amidst the temptat of societi the care of busi and the relax of amus in everi situat it will make us to stand in awe and not sin psalm iv it will prompt us to act in a manner worthi of the presenc the majesti and the perfect of god gratitud is due to god for the bless which we receiv from him the event of ordinari life furnish us with constant subject of gratitud you eat your daili food you find yourselv in health you receiv the price of your labor you obtain someth which you desir you prosper in your way your duti in all these situat the apostl paul point out in everi thing give thank be grate for thi is the will of god in christ jesu concern you thessalonian v the exercis of gratitud is not confin to profess acknowledg of the merci which we have receiv in prais and thanksgiv in privat or public devot the world also is a field for the exercis of gratitud it is exercis whenev it implant in the heart a new motiv to abstin from sin and hatr of it whenev it warm the soul with addit alacr in do good and make us take greater pleasur in it these exercis of gratitud should be diffus through life as much as the bless are which demand our gratitud they should influenc us as often as we are engag in ani action which can impli either good or evil and what one action of our live doe not impli them common life is the acknowledg sphere of resign to the will of god pieti exert itself in resign is the proper root and the onli firm support of mani of those duti to ourselv the oper of which through the occurr of common life either ha been alreadi delin or may easili be trace composur for instanc amidst the tumult and fluctuat of the world tranquil in the uncertainti of it prospect content and selfenjoy under it disappoint fortitud in the view of it danger if these virtu are nipt off from

strength all the event of life are uncertain we are often in advers our favorit design are disappoint our dearest comfort are taken from us we becom interest about trifl and they fail us we can not perform the duti which we owe to ourselv in these season without deriv aid from pieti these are the season which demand the practic of resign submiss and trust in god these are the season in which we

suggest the veri idea which i have made it my busi to unfold it intim that we have no religion no christian if we do not carri it into the world with us and exercis it in all the circumst of life the apostl jame give us the same view of religion though in a differ manner of express pure religion and undefil befor god even the father is thi to visit the fatherless and the widow in their afflict and

religion consist in guard against the former and embrac and improv the latter whenev they occur when our savior wa most solicit for the happi of hi discipl when he had the most immedi view of the danger to which they were expos in a world that hate them as it had befor hate him john xvii when he declar that they were not of the world ver even then he said to hi father i pray not that thou should take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from the evil ver it wa by be sent forth into the world and act in it that they could be use and that they could becom happi the exampl of our savior as well as the intim of scriptur set religion in thi point of view through all the earli part of hi life he labor in joseph vocat as a carpent he left it not till the season came when he

and in thi situat continu to be without sin heb iv exhibit an exampl of everi virtu in perfect and by that exampl show mankind in what manner religion should exert itself in the sever occurr of common life it is for the same purpos that the live and action of good men are record in scriptur it is to let us see how they exercis their religion in the scene of action and in secular employ and the wisdom of god by deliv a great part of the scriptur in the form of histori ha provid for record so great a number and varieti of exampl that in them we may observ the oper of religion in almost everi

god ha in some sens reserv peculiarli to himself on it we ought to abstain from our worldli occup but it exercis are not unrel to these occup they are design to prepar us for the right and virtuou

of ceremoni is neither serv god nor a mean of our salvat except the ceremoni be of divin appoint and if they were yet still the multipl of ceremoni would multipli our danger of neglect hi will and fall into sin would increas the difficulti of religion would render mani thing necessari which might have been safe omit if god had not requir them by posit precept and would thu prove a snare to our
