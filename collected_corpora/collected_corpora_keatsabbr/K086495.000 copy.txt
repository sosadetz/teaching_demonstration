the vaniti to flatter myself even my attract great as they are and violent as the effect is they have produc on her would have power to fix a woman of her principi for ani consider period but to rob her of her captiv in the veri height of her passion to rival her in my love at the moment she believ me blind to the perfect of everi other woman is thi to be born charl by a femal of her spirit i sear not i own i have my suspicion as i think she over act her part i doubt the sincer of those smile she favor me with and shrewdli suspect they are intend to conceal some hidden purpos it is unnatur to believ she could so easili pardon the emot to which she wa a wit the first sight of her rival gave birth to it is true i said all that man could say to appeaf the storm and as i wa tell you she endeavor to persuad me i have succeed though i doubt the fact but thi is not the worst how shall i presum to sue for the affect of the love emili at the time when everi soul in the neighborhood are talk most impertin of my passion for the widow you will easili guess our flirtat ha afford ampl scope for teatabl chat and that she ha alreadi been let into the whole secret my constanc to be sure will appear to no great advantag yet must it not be more flatter to her to find her charm have had the power to diffolv such an attach than if she had mere captiv an unengag heart certainli and depend upon it thi reflect will have it due weight thu i reason upon it charl and i hope you will think it reason pardon the pun should it strike you as one well dont you think i am in a hope way entangl with one woman for whom i never in realiti care sixpenc and die for anoth who probabl care as littl for me but i will not think my case so desper becaus i should be tempt to shoot myself through the

actual driven to despair by the perfidi of her fickl admir no such thing believ me it is not the fashion my dear in the beau mond in love to pine and languish is quit out of the question there such a conduct would impli a degre of constanc at which a fine london ladi would blush what their real feel may be is anoth affair but to appear as if they felt themselv forsaken what woman of spirit would submit to not ladi stanley at least i can answer for her and certainli it is the wisest cours though everi one ha not a suffici share of philosophi to put it in practic my aunt is now fulli convinc there never wa ani other than a friendli regard between them perhap she is the more inclin to be of thi opinion becaus she ha i verili believ from the particular attent my lord begin to honor her niec
