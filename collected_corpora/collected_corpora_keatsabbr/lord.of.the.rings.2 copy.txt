the two tower be the second part of the lord of the ring chapter the departur of boromir aragorn sped on up the hill everi now and again he bent to the ground hobbit go light and their footprint are not easi even for a ranger to read but not far from the top a spring cross the path and in the wet earth he saw what he wa seek i read the sign aright he said to himself frodo ran to the hilltop i wonder what he saw there but he return by the same way and went down the hill again aragorn hesit he desir to go to the high seat himself hope to see there someth that would guid him in hi perplex but time wa press suddenli he leap forward and ran to the summit across the great flagston and up the step then sit in the high seat he look out but the sun seem darken and the world dim and remot he turn from the north back again to north and saw noth save the distant hill unless it were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagl high in the air descend slowli in wide circl down toward the earth even as he gaze hi quick ear caught sound in the woodland below on the west side of the river he stiffen there were cri and among them to hi horror he could distinguish the harsh voic of orc then suddenli with a deepthroat call a great horn blew and the blast of it smote the hill and echo in the hollow rise in a mighti shout abov the roar of the fall the horn of boromir he cri he is in need he sprang down the step and away leap down the path ala an ill fate is on me thi day and all that i do goe amiss where is sam as he ran the cri came louder but fainter now and desper the horn wa blow fierc and shrill rose the yell of the orc and suddenli the horncal ceas aragorn race down the last slope but befor he could reach the hill foot the sound die away and as he turn to the left and ran toward them they retreat until at last he could hear them no more draw hi bright sword and cri elendil elendil he crash through the tree a mile mayb from parth galen in a littl glade not far from the lake he found boromir he wa sit with hi back to a great tree as if he wa rest but aragorn saw that he wa pierc with mani blackfeath arrow hi sword wa still in hi hand but it wa broken near the hilt hi horn cloven in two wa at hi side mani orc lay slain pile all about him and at hi feet aragorn knelt besid him boromir open hi eye and strove to speak at last slow word came i tri to take the ring from frodo he said i am sorri i have paid hi glanc stray to hi fallen enemi twenti at least lay there they have gone the halfl the orc have taken them i think they are not dead orc bound them he paus and hi eye close wearili after a moment he spoke again farewel aragorn go to mina tirith and save my peopl i have fail no said aragorn take hi hand and kiss hi brow you have conquer few have gain such a victori be at peac mina tirith shall not fall boromir smile which way did they go wa frodo there said aragorn but boromir did not speak again ala said aragorn thu pass the heir of denethor lord of the tower of guard thi is a bitter end now the compani is all in ruin it is i that have fail vain wa gandalf trust in me what shall i do now boromir ha laid it on me to go to mina tirith and my heart desir it but where are the ring and the bearer how shall i find them and save the quest from disast he knelt for a while bent with weep still clasp boromir hand so it wa that legola and gimli found him they came from the western slope of the hill silent creep through the tree as if they were hunt gimli had hi axe in hand and legola hi long knife all hi arrow were spent when they came into the glade they halt in amaz and then they stood a moment with head bow in grief for it seem to them plain what had happen ala said legola come to aragorn side we have hunt and slain mani orc in the wood but we should have been of more use here we came when we heard the hornbut too late it seem i fear you have taken deadli hurt boromir is dead said aragorn i am unscath for i wa not here with him he fell defend the hobbit while i wa away upon the hill the hobbit cri gimli where are they then where is frodo i do not know answer aragorn wearili befor he die boromir told me that the orc had bound them he did not think that they were dead i sent him to follow merri and pippin but i did not ask him if frodo or sam were with him not until it wa too late all that i have done today ha gone amiss what is to be done now first we must tend the fallen said legola we can not leav him lie like carrion among these foul orc but we must be swift said gimli he would not wish us to linger we must follow the orc if there is hope that ani of our compani are live prison but we do not know whether the ringbear is with them or not said aragorn are we to abandon him must we not seek him first an evil choic is now befor us then let us do first what we must do said legola we have not the time or the tool to buri our comrad fitli or to rais a mound over him a cairn we might build the labour would be hard and long there are no stone that we could use nearer than the watersid said gimli then let us lay him in a boat with hi weapon and the weapon of hi vanquish foe said aragorn we will send him to the fall of rauro and give him to anduin the river of gondor will take care at least that no evil creatur dishonour hi bone quickli they search the bodi of the orc gather their sword and cloven helm and shield into a heap see cri aragorn here we find token he pick out from the pile of grim weapon two knive leafblad damask in gold and red and search further he found also the sheath black set with small red gem no orctool these he said they were born by the hobbit doubtless the orc despoil them but fear to keep the knive know them for what they are work of westerness wound about with spell for the bane of mordor well now if they still live our friend are weaponless i will take these thing hope against hope to give them back and i said legola will take all the arrow that i can find for my quiver is empti he search in the pile and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamag and longer in the shaft than such arrow as the orc were accustom to use he look at them close and aragorn look on the slain and he said here lie mani that are not folk of mordor some are from the north from the misti mountain if i know anyth of orc and their kind and here are other strang to me their gear is not after the manner of orc at all there were four goblinsoldi of greater statur swart slantey with thick leg and larg hand they were arm with short broadblad sword not with the curv scimitar usual with orc and they had bow of yew in length and shape like the bow of men upon their shield they bore a strang devic a small white hand in the centr of a black field on the front of their iron helm wa set an srune wrought of some white metal i have not seen these token befor said aragorn what do they mean s is for sauron said gimli that is easi to read nay said legola sauron doe not use the elfrun neither doe he use hi right name nor permit it to be spelt or spoken said aragorn and he doe not use white the orc in the servic of baraddûr use the sign of the red eye he stood for a moment in thought s is for saruman i guess he said at length there is evil afoot in isengard and the west is no longer safe it is as gandalf fear by some mean the traitor saruman ha had news of our journey it is like too that he know of gandalf fall pursuer from moria may have escap the vigil of lórien or they may have avoid that land and come to isengard by other path orc travel fast but saruman ha mani way of learn news do you rememb the bird well we have no time to ponder riddl said gimli let us bear boromir away but after that we must guess the riddl if we are to choos our cours rightli answer aragorn mayb there is no right choic said gimli take hi axe the dwarf now cut sever branch these they lash togeth with bowstr and spread their cloak upon the frame upon thi rough bier they carri the bodi of their companion to the shore togeth with such trophi of hi last battl as they chose to send forth with him it wa onli a short way yet they found it no easi task for boromir wa a man both tall and strong at the watersid aragorn remain watch the bier while legola and gimli hasten back on foot to parth galen it wa a mile or more and it wa some time befor they came back paddl two boat swiftli along the shore there is a strang tale to tell said legola there are onli two boat upon the bank we could find no trace of the other have orc been there ask aragorn we saw no sign of them answer gimli and orc would have taken or destroy all the boat and the baggag as well i will look at the ground when we come there said aragorn now they laid boromir in the middl of the boat that wa to bear him away the grey hood and elvencloak they fold and place beneath hi head they comb hi long dark hair and array it upon hi shoulder the golden belt of lórien gleam about hi waist hi helm they set besid him and across hi lap they laid the cloven horn and the hilt and shard of hi sword beneath hi feet they put the sword of hi enemi then fasten the prow to the stern of the other boat they drew him out into the water they row sadli along the shore and turn into the swiftrun channel they pass the green sward of parth galen the steep side of tol brandir were glow it wa now midafternoon as they went south the fume of rauro rose and shimmer befor them a haze of gold the rush and thunder of the fall shook the windless air sorrow they cast loos the funer boat there boromir lay rest peac glide upon the bosom of the flow water the stream took him while they held their own boat back with their paddl he float by them and slowli hi boat depart wane to a dark spot against the golden light and then suddenli it vanish rauro roar on unchang the river had taken boromir son of denethor and he wa not seen again in mina tirith stand as he use to stand upon the white tower in the morn but in gondor in afterday it long wa said that the elvenboat rode the fall and the foam pool and bore him down through osgiliath and past the mani mouth of anduin out into the great sea at night under the star for a while the three companion remain silent gaze after him then aragorn spoke they will look for him from the white tower he said but he will not return from mountain or from sea then slowli he began to sing through rohan over fen and field where the long grass grow the west wind come walk and about the wall it goe what news from the west o wander wind do you bring to me tonight have you seen boromir the tall by moon or by starlight i saw him ride over seven stream over water wide and grey i saw him walk in empti land until he pass away into the shadow of the north i saw him then no more the north wind may have heard the horn of the son of denethor o boromir from the high wall westward i look afar but you came not from the empti land where no men are then legola sang from the mouth of the sea the south wind fli from the sandhil and the stone the wail of the gull it bear and at the gate it moan what news from the south o sigh wind do you bring to me at eve where now is boromir the fair he tarri and i griev ask not of me where he doth dwellso mani bone there lie on the white shore and the dark shore under the stormi sky so mani have pass down anduin to find the flow sea ask of the north wind news of them the north wind send to me o boromir beyond the gate the seaward road run south but you came not with the wail gull from the grey sea mouth then aragorn sang again from the gate of king the north wind ride and past the roar fall and clear and cold about the tower it loud horn call what news from the north o mighti wind do you bring to me today what news of boromir the bold for he is long away beneath amon hen i heard hi cri there mani foe he fought hi cloven shield hi broken sword they to the water brought hi head so proud hi face so fair hi limb they laid to rest and rauro golden raurosfal bore him upon it breast o boromir the tower of guard shall ever northward gaze to rauro golden raurosfal until the end of day so they end then they turn their boat and drove it with all the speed they could against the stream back to parth galen you left the east wind to me said gimli but i will say naught of it that is as it should be said aragorn in mina tirith they endur the east wind but they do not ask it for tide but now boromir ha taken hi road and we must make hast to choos our own he survey the green lawn quickli but thoroughli stoop often to the earth the orc have been on thi ground he said otherwis noth can be made out for certain all our footprint are here cross and recross i can not tell whether ani of the hobbit have come back sinc the search for frodo began he return to the bank close to where the rill from the spring trickl out into the river there are some clear print here he said a hobbit wade out into the water and back but i can not say how long ago how then do you read thi riddl ask gimli aragorn did not answer at onc but went back to the campingplac and look at the baggag two pack are miss he said and one is certainli sam it wa rather larg and heavi thi then is the answer frodo ha gone by boat and hi servant ha gone with him frodo must have return while we were all away i met sam go up the hill and told him to follow me but plainli he did not do so he guess hi master s mind and came back here befor frodo had gone he did not find it easi to leav sam behind but whi should he leav us behind and without a word said gimli that wa a strang deed and a brave deed said aragorn sam wa right i think frodo did not wish to lead ani friend to death with him in mordor but he knew that he must go himself someth happen after he left us that overcam hi fear and doubt mayb hunt orc came on him and he fled said legola he fled certainli said aragorn but not i think from orc what he thought wa the caus of frodo sudden resolv and flight aragorn did not say the last word of boromir he long kept secret well so much at least is now clear said legola frodo is no longer on thi side of the river onli he can have taken the boat and sam is with him onli he would have taken hi pack our choic then said gimli is either to take the remain boat and follow frodo or els to follow the orc on foot there is littl hope either way we have alreadi lost preciou hour let me think said aragorn and now may i make a right choic and chang the evil fate of thi unhappi day he stood silent for a moment i will follow the orc he said at last i would have guid frodo to mordor and gone with him to the end but if i seek him now in the wilder i must abandon the captiv to torment and death my heart speak clearli at last the fate of the bearer is in my hand no longer the compani ha play it part yet we that remain can not forsak our companion while we have strength left come we will go now leav all that can be spare behind we will press on by day and dark they drew up the last boat and carri it to the tree they laid beneath it such of their good as they did not need and could not carri away then they left parth galen the afternoon wa fade as they came back to the glade where boromir had fallen there they pick up the trail of the orc it need littl skill to find no other folk make such a trampl said legola it seem their delight to slash and beat down grow thing that are not even in their way but they go with a great speed for all that said aragorn and they do not tire and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare land well after them said gimli dwarv too can go swiftli and they do not tire sooner than orc but it will be a long chase they have a long start ye said aragorn we shall all need the endur of dwarv but come with hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemi and woe to them if we prove the swifter we will make such a chase as shall be account a marvel among the three kindr elv dwarv and men forth the three hunter like a deer he sprang away through the tree he sped on and on he led them tireless and swift now that hi mind wa at last made up the wood about the lake they left behind long slope they climb dark hardedg against the sky alreadi red with sunset dusk came they pass away grey shadow in a stoni land chapter the rider of rohan dusk deepen mist lay behind them among the tree below and brood on the pale margin of the anduin but the sky wa clear star came out the wax moon wa ride in the west and the shadow of the rock were black they had come to the feet of stoni hill and their pace wa slower for the trail wa no longer easi to follow here the highland of the emyn muil ran from north to south in two long tumbl ridg the western side of each ridg wa steep and difficult but the eastward slope were gentler furrow with mani gulli and narrow ravin all night the three companion scrambl in thi boni land climb to the crest of the first and tallest ridg and down again into the dark of a deep wind valley on the other side there in the still cool hour befor dawn they rest for a brief space the moon had long gone down befor them the star glitter abov them the first light of day had not yet come over the dark hill behind for the moment aragorn wa at a loss the orctrail had descend into the valley but there it had vanish which way would they turn do you think said legola northward to take a straighter road to isengard or fangorn if that is their aim as you guess or southward to strike the entwash they will not make for the river whatev mark they aim at said aragorn and unless there is much amiss in rohan and the power of saruman is greatli increas they will take the shortest way that they can find over the field of the rohirrim let us search northward the dale ran like a stoni trough between the ridg hill and a trickl stream flow among the boulder at the bottom a cliff frown upon their right to their left rose grey slope dim and shadowi in the late night they went on for a mile or more northward aragorn wa search bent toward the ground among the fold and gulli lead up into the western ridg legola wa some way ahead suddenli the elf gave a cri and the other came run toward him we have alreadi overtaken some of those that we are hunt he said look he point and they saw that what they had at first taken to be boulder lie at the foot of the slope were huddl bodi five dead orc lay there they had been hewn with mani cruel stroke and two had been behead the ground wa wet with their dark blood here is anoth riddl said gimli but it need the light of day and for that we can not wait yet howev you read it it seem not unhop said legola enemi of the orc are like to be our friend do ani folk dwell in these hill no said aragorn the rohirrim seldom come here and it is far from mina tirith it might be that some compani of men were hunt here for reason that we do not know yet i think not what do you think said gimli i think that the enemi brought hi own enemi with him answer aragorn these are northern orc from far away among the slain are none of the great orc with the strang badg there wa a quarrel i guess it is no uncommon thing with these foul folk mayb there wa some disput about the road or about the captiv said gimli let us hope that they too did not meet their end here aragorn search the ground in a wide circl but no other trace of the fight could be found they went on alreadi the eastward sky wa turn pale the star were fade and a grey light wa slowli grow a littl further north they came to a fold in which a tini stream fall and wind had cut a stoni path down into the valley in it some bush grew and there were patch of grass upon it side at last said aragorn here are the track that we seek up thi waterchannel thi is the way that the orc went after their debat swiftli now the pursuer turn and follow the new path as if fresh from a night rest they sprang from stone to stone at last they reach the crest of the grey hill and a sudden breez blew in their hair and stir their cloak the chill wind of dawn turn back they saw across the river the far hill kindl day leap into the sky the red rim of the sun rose over the shoulder of the dark land befor them in the west the world lay still formless and grey but even as they look the shadow of night melt the colour of the wake earth return green flow over the wide mead of rohan the white mist shimmer in the waterval and far off to the left thirti leagu or more blue and purpl stood the white mountain rise into peak of jet tip with glimmer snow flush with the rose of morn gondor gondor cri aragorn would that i look on you again in happier hour not yet doe my road lie southward to your bright stream gondor gondor between the mountain and the sea west wind blew there the light upon the silver tree fell like bright rain in garden of the king of old o proud wall white tower o wing crown and throne of gold o gondor gondor shall men behold the silver tree or west wind blow again between the mountain and the sea now let us go he said draw hi eye away from the south and look out west and north to the way that he must tread the ridg upon which the companion stood went down steepli befor their feet below it twenti fathom or more there wa a wide and rug shelf which end suddenli in the brink of a sheer cliff the east wall of rohan so end the emyn muil and the green plain of the rohirrim stretch away befor them to the edg of sight look cri legola point up into the pale sky abov them there is the eagl again he is veri high he seem to be fli now away from thi land back to the north he is go with great speed look no not even my eye can see him my good legola said aragorn he must be far aloft inde i wonder what is hi errand if he is the same bird that i have seen befor but look i can see someth nearer at hand and more urgent there is someth move over the plain mani thing said legola it is a great compani on foot but i can not say more nor see what kind of folk they may be they are mani leagu away twelv i guess but the flat of the plain is hard to measur i think nonetheless that we no longer need ani trail to tell us which way to go said gimli let us find a path down to the field as quick as may be i doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the orc chose said aragorn they follow their enemi now by the clear light of day it seem that the orc had press on with all possibl speed everi now and again the pursuer found thing that had been drop or cast away foodbag the rind and crust of hard grey bread a torn black cloak a heavi ironnail shoe broken on the stone the trail led them north along the top of the escarp and at length they came to a deep cleft carv in the rock by a stream that splash noisili down in the narrow ravin a rough path descend like a steep stair into the plain at the bottom they came with a strang sudden on the grass of rohan it swell like a green sea up to the veri foot of the emyn muil the fall stream vanish into a deep growth of cress and waterpl and they could hear it tinkl away in green tunnel down long gentl slope toward the fen of entwash vale far away they seem to have left winter cling to the hill behind here the air wa softer and warmer and faintli scent as if spring wa alreadi stir and the sap wa flow again in herb and leaf legola took a deep breath like one that drink a great draught after long thirst in barren place ah the green smell he said it is better than much sleep let us run light feet may run swiftli here said aragorn more swiftli mayb than ironshod orc now we have a chanc to lessen their lead they went in singl file run like hound on a strong scent and an eager light wa in their eye nearli due west the broad swath of the march orc tramp it ugli slot the sweet grass of rohan had been bruis and blacken as they pass present aragorn gave a cri and turn asid stay he shout do not follow me yet he ran quickli to the right away from the main trail for he had seen footprint that went that way branch off from the other the mark of small unshod feet these howev did not go far befor they were cross by orcprint also come out from the main trail behind and in front and then they curv sharpli back again and were lost in the trampl at the furthest point aragorn stoop and pick up someth from the grass then he ran back ye he said they are quit plain a hobbit footprint pippin i think he is smaller than the other and look at thi he held up a thing that glitter in the sunlight it look like the newopen leaf of a beechtre fair and strang in that treeless plain the brooch of an elvencloak cri legola and gimli togeth not idli do the leav of lórien fall said aragorn thi did not drop by chanc it wa cast away as a token to ani that might follow i think pippin ran away from the trail for that purpos then he at least wa aliv said gimli and he had the use of hi wit and of hi leg too that is hearten we do not pursu in vain let us hope that he did not pay too dearli for hi bold said legola come let us go on the thought of those merri young folk driven like cattl burn my heart the sun climb to the noon and then rode slowli down the sky light cloud came up out of the sea in the distant south and were blown away upon the breez the sun sank shadow rose behind and reach out long arm from the east still the hunter held on one day now had pass sinc boromir fell and the orc were yet far ahead no longer could ani sight of them be seen in the level plain as nightshad wa close about them aragorn halt onli twice in the day march had they rest for a brief while and twelv leagu now lay between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn we have come at last to a hard choic he said shall we rest by night or shall we go on while our will and strength hold unless our enemi rest also they will leav us far behind if we stay to sleep said legola sure even orc must paus on the march said gimli seldom will orc journey in the open under the sun yet these have done so said legola certainli they will not rest by night but if we walk by night we can not follow their trail said gimli the trail is straight and turn neither right nor left as far as my eye can see said legola mayb i could lead you at guess in the dark and hold to the line said aragorn but if we stray or they turn asid then when light came there might be long delay befor the trail wa found again and there is thi also said gimli onli by day can we see if ani track lead away if a prison should escap or if one should be carri off eastward say to the great river toward mordor we might pass the sign and never know it that is true said aragorn but if i read the sign back yonder rightli the orc of the white hand prevail and the whole compani is now bound for isengard their present cours bear me out yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsel said gimli and what of escap in the dark we should have pass the sign that led you to the brooch the orc will be doubli on their guard sinc then and the prison even wearier said legola there will be no escap again if we do not contriv it how that is to be done can not be guess but first we must overtak them and yet even i dwarf of mani journey and not the least hardi of my folk can not run all the way to isengard without ani paus said gimli my heart burn me too and i would have start sooner but now i must rest a littl to run the better and if we rest then the blind night is the time to do so i said that it wa a hard choic said aragorn how shall we end thi debat you are our guid said gimli and you are skill in the chase you shall choos my heart bid me go on said legola but we must hold togeth i will follow your counsel you give the choic to an ill chooser said aragorn sinc we pass through the argonath my choic have gone amiss he fell silent gaze north and west into the gather night for a long while we will not walk in the dark he said at length the peril of miss the trail or sign of other come and go seem to me the greater if the moon gave enough light we would use it but ala he set earli and is yet young and pale and tonight he is shroud anyway gimli murmur would that the ladi had given us a light such a gift as she gave to frodo it will be more need where it is bestow said aragorn with him lie the true quest our is but a small matter in the great deed of thi time a vain pursuit from it begin mayb which no choic of mine can mar or mend well i have chosen so let us use the time as best we may he cast himself on the ground and fell at onc into sleep for he had not slept sinc their night under the shadow of tol brandir befor dawn wa in the sky he woke and rose gimli wa still deep in slumber but legola wa stand gaze northward into the dark thought and silent as a young tree in a windless night they are far far away he said sadli turn to aragorn i know in my heart that they have not rest thi night onli an eagl could overtak them now nonetheless we will still follow as we may said aragorn stoop he rous the dwarf come we must go he said the scent is grow cold but it is still dark said gimli even legola on a hilltop could not see them till the sun is up i fear they have pass beyond my sight from hill or plain under moon or sun said legola where sight fail the earth may bring us rumour said aragorn the land must groan under their hate feet he stretch himself upon the ground with hi ear press against the turf he lay there motionless for so long a time that gimli wonder if he had swoon or fallen asleep again dawn came glimmer and slowli a grey light grew about them at last he rose and now hi friend could see hi face it wa pale and drawn and hi look wa troubl the rumour of the earth is dim and confus he said noth walk upon it for mani mile about us faint and far are the feet of our enemi but loud are the hoof of the hors it come to my mind that i heard them even as i lay on the ground in sleep and they troubl my dream hors gallop pass in the west but now they are draw ever further from us ride northward i wonder what is happen in thi land let us go said legola so the third day of their pursuit began dure all it long hour of cloud and fit sun they hardli paus now stride now run as if no weari could quench the fire that burn them they seldom spoke over the wide solitud they pass and their elvencloak fade against the background of the greygreen field even in the cool sunlight of midday few but elvish eye would have mark them until they were close at hand often in their heart they thank the ladi of lórien for the gift of lemba for they could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran all day the track of their enemi led straight on go northwest without a break or turn as onc again the day wore to it end they came to long treeless slope where the land rose swell up toward a line of low humpback down ahead the orctrail grew fainter as it bent north toward them for the ground becam harder and the grass shorter far away to the left the river entwash wound a silver thread in a green floor no move thing could be seen often aragorn wonder that they saw no sign of beast or man the dwell of the rohirrim were for the most part mani leagu away to the south under the wood eav of the white mountain now hidden in mist and cloud yet the horselord had formerli kept mani herd and stud in the eastemnet thi easterli region of their realm and there the herdsmen had wander much live in camp and tent even in wintertim but now all the land wa empti and there wa silenc that did not seem to be the quiet of peac at dusk they halt again now twice twelv leagu they had pass over the plain of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil wa lost in the shadow of the east the young moon wa glimmer in a misti sky but it gave small light and the star were veil now do i most grudg a time of rest or ani halt in our chase said legola the orc have run befor us as if the veri whip of sauron were behind them i fear they have alreadi reach the forest and the dark hill and even now are pass into the shadow of the tree gimli ground hi teeth thi is a bitter end to our hope and to all our toil he said to hope mayb but not to toil said aragorn we shall not turn back here yet i am weari he gaze back along the way that they had come toward the night gather in the east there is someth strang at work in thi land i distrust the silenc i distrust even the pale moon the star are faint and i am weari as i have seldom been befor weari as no ranger should be with a clear trail to follow there is some will that lend speed to our foe and set an unseen barrier befor us a weari that is in the heart more than in the limb truli said legola that i have known sinc first we came down from the emyn muil for the will is not behind us but befor us he point away over the land of rohan into the darkl west under the sickl moon saruman mutter aragorn but he shall not turn us back halt we must onc more for see even the moon is fall into gather cloud but north lie our road between down and fen when day return as befor legola wa first afoot if inde he had ever slept awak awak he cri it is a red dawn strang thing await us by the eav of the forest good or evil i do not know but we are call awak the other sprang up and almost at onc they set off again slowli the down drew near it wa still an hour befor noon when they reach them green slope rise to bare ridg that ran in a line straight toward the north at their feet the ground wa dri and the turf short but a long strip of sunken land some ten mile wide lay between them and the river wander deep in dim thicket of reed and rush just to the west of the southernmost slope there wa a great ring where the turf had been torn and beaten by mani trampl feet from it the orctrail ran out again turn north along the dri skirt of the hill aragorn halt and examin the track close they rest here a while he said but even the outward trail is alreadi old i fear that your heart spoke truli legola it is thrice twelv hour i guess sinc the orc stood where we now stand if they held to their pace then at sundown yesterday they would reach the border of fangorn i can see noth away north or west but grass dwindl into mist said gimli could we see the forest if we climb the hill it is still far away said aragorn if i rememb rightli these down run eight leagu or more to the north and then northwest to the

but thi endless chase began to tell on him as all hope fail in hi heart aragorn walk behind him grim and silent stoop now and again to scan some print or mark upon the ground onli legola still step as lightli as ever hi feet hardli seem to press the grass leav no footprint as he pass but in the waybread of the elv he found all the susten that he need and he could sleep if sleep it could be call by men rest hi mind in the strang path of elvish dream even as he walk openey in the light of thi world let us go up on to thi green hill he said wearili they follow him climb the long slope until they came out upon the top it wa a round hill smooth and bare stand by itself the most northerli of the down the sun sank and the shadow of even fell like a curtain they were alon in a grey formless world without mark or measur onli far away northwest there wa a deeper dark against the die light the mountain of mist and the forest at their feet noth can we see to guid us here said gimli well now we must halt again and wear the night away it is grow cold the wind is north from the snow said aragorn and ere morn it will be in the east said legola but rest if you must yet do not cast all hope away tomorrow is unknown rede oft is found at the rise of the sun three sun alreadi have risen on our chase and brought no counsel said gimli the night grew ever colder aragorn and gimli slept fit and whenev they awok they saw legola stand besid them or walk to and fro sing softli to himself in hi own tongu and as he sang the white star open in the hard black vault abov so the night pass togeth they watch the dawn grow slowli in the sky now bare and cloudless until at last the sunris came it wa pale and clear the wind wa in the east and all the mist had roll away wide land lay bleak about them in the bitter light ahead and eastward they saw the windi upland of the wold of rohan that they had alreadi glimps mani day ago from the great river northwestward stalk the dark forest of fangorn still ten leagu away stood it shadowi eav and it further slope fade into the distant blue beyond there glimmer far away as if float on a grey cloud the white head of tall methedra the last peak of the misti mountain out of the forest the entwash flow to meet them it stream now swift and narrow and it bank deepcloven the orctrail turn from the down toward it follow with hi keen eye the trail to the river and then the river back toward the forest aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green a dark swiftmov blur he cast himself upon the ground and listen again intent but legola stood besid him shade hi bright elveney with hi long slender hand and he saw not a shadow nor a blur but the small figur of horsemen mani horsemen and the glint of morn on the tip of their spear wa like the twinkl of minut star beyond the edg of mortal sight far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curl thread there wa a silenc in the empti field arid gimli could hear the air move in the grass rider cri aragorn spring to hi feet mani rider on swift steed are come toward us ye said legola there are one hundr and five yellow is their hair and bright are their spear their leader is veri tall aragorn smile keen are the eye of the elv he said nay the rider are littl more than five leagu distant said legola five leagu or one said gimli we can not escap them in thi bare land shall we wait for them here or go on our way we will wait said aragorn i am weari and our hunt ha fail or at least other were befor us for these horsemen are ride back down the orctrail we may get new s from them or spear said gimli there are three empti saddl but i see no hobbit said legola i did not say that we should hear good news said aragorn but evil or good we will await it here the three companion now left the hilltop where they might be an easi mark against the pale sky and they walk slowli down the northward slope a littl abov the hill foot they halt and wrap their cloak about them they sat huddl togeth upon the fade grass the time pass slowli and heavili the wind wa thin and search gimli wa uneasi what do you know of these horsemen aragorn he said do we sit here wait for sudden death i have been among them answer aragorn they are proud and wil but they are trueheart gener in thought and deed bold but not cruel wise but unlearn write no book but sing mani song after the manner of the children of men befor the dark year but i do not know what ha happen here of late nor in what mind the rohirrim may now be between the traitor saruman and the threat of sauron they have long been the friend of the peopl of gondor though they are not akin to them it wa in forgotten year long ago that eorl the young brought them out of the north and their kinship is rather with the bard of dale and with the beorn of the wood among whom may still be seen mani men tall and fair as are the rider of rohan at least they will not love the orc but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribut to mordor said gimli i believ it no more than did boromir answer aragorn you will soon learn the truth said legola alreadi they approach at length even gimli could hear the distant beat of gallop hoof the horsemen follow the trail had turn from the river and were draw near the down they were ride like the wind now the cri of clear strong voic came ring over the field suddenli they swept up with a nois like thunder and the foremost horseman swerv pass by the foot of the hill and lead the host back southward along the western skirt of the down after him they rode a long line of mailclad men swift shine fell and fair to look upon their hors were of great statur strong and cleanlimb their grey coat glisten their long tail flow in the wind their mane were braid on their proud neck the men that rode them match them well tall and longlimb their hair flaxenpal flow under their light helm and stream in long braid behind them their face were stern and keen in their hand were tall spear of ash paint shield were slung at their back long sword were at their belt their burnish skirt of mail hung down upon their knee in pair they gallop by and though everi now and then one rose in hi stirrup and gaze ahead and to either side they appear not to perceiv the three stranger sit silent and watch them the host had almost pass when suddenli aragorn stood up and call in a loud voic what news from the north rider of rohan with astonish speed and skill they check their steed wheel and came charg round soon the three companion found themselv in a ring of horsemen move in a run circl up the hillslop behind them and down round and round them and draw ever inward aragorn stood silent and the other two sat without move wonder what way thing would turn without a word or cri suddenli the rider halt a thicket of spear were point toward the stranger and some of the horsemen had bow in hand and their arrow were alreadi fit to the string then one rode forward a tall man taller than all the rest from hi helm as a crest a white horsetail flow he advanc until the point of hi spear wa within a foot of aragorn breast aragorn did not stir who are you and what are you do in thi land said the rider use the common speech of the west in manner and tone like to the speech of boromir man of gondor i am call strider answer aragorn i came out of the north i am hunt orc the rider leap from hi hors give hi spear to anoth who rode up and dismount at hi side he drew hi sword and stood face to face with aragorn survey him keenli and not without wonder at length he spoke again at first i thought that you yourselv were orc he said but now i see that it is not so inde you know littl of orc if you go hunt them in thi fashion they were swift and wellarm and they were mani you would have chang from hunter to prey if ever you had overtaken them but there is someth strang about you strider he bent hi clear bright eye again upon the ranger that is no name for a man that you give and strang too is your raiment have you sprung out of the grass how did you escap our sight are you elvish folk no said aragorn one onli of us is an elf legola from the woodland realm in distant mirkwood but we have pass through lothlórien and the gift and favour of the ladi go with us the rider look at them with renew wonder but hi eye harden then there is a ladi in the golden wood as old tale tell he said few escap her net they say these are strang day but if you have her favour then you also are netweav and sorcer mayb he turn a cold glanc suddenli upon legola and gimli whi do you not speak silent one he demand gimli rose and plant hi feet firmli apart hi hand grip the handl of hi axe and hi dark eye flash give me your name horsemast and i will give you mine and more besid he said as for that said the rider stare down at the dwarf the stranger should declar himself first yet i am name éomer son of éomund and am call the third marshal of riddermark then éomer son of éomund third marshal of riddermark let gimli the dwarf glóin son warn you against foolish word you speak evil of that which is fair beyond the reach of your thought and onli littl wit can excus you éomer eye blaze and the men of rohan murmur angrili and close in advanc their spear i would cut off your head beard and all master dwarf if it stood but a littl higher from the ground said éomer he stand not alon said legola bend hi bow and fit an arrow with hand that move quicker than sight you would die befor your stroke fell éomer rais hi sword and thing might have gone ill but aragorn sprang between them and rais hi hand your pardon éomer he cri when you know more you will understand whi you have anger my companion we intend no evil to rohan nor to ani of it folk neither to man nor to hors will you not hear our tale befor you strike i will said éomer lower hi blade but wander in the riddermark would be wise to be less haughti in these day of doubt first tell me your right name first tell me whom you serv said aragorn are you friend or foe of sauron the dark lord of mordor i serv onli the lord of the mark théoden king son of thengel answer éomer we do not serv the power of the black land far away but neither are we yet at open war with him and if you are flee from him then you had best leav thi land there is troubl now on all our border and we are threaten but we desir onli to be free and to live as we have live keep our own and serv no foreign lord good or evil we welcom guest kindli in the better day but in these time the unbidden stranger find us swift and hard come who are you whom do you serv at whose command do you hunt orc in our land i serv no man said aragorn but the servant of sauron i pursu into whatev land they may go there are few among mortal men who know more of orc and i do not hunt them in thi fashion out of choic the orc whom we pursu took captiv two of my friend in such need a man that ha no hors will go on foot and he will not ask for leav to follow the trail nor will he count the head of the enemi save with a sword i am not weaponless aragorn threw back hi cloak the elvensheath glitter as he grasp it and the bright blade of andúril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out elendil he cri i am aragorn son of arathorn and am call elessar the elfston dúnadan the heir of isildur elendil son of gondor here is the sword that wa broken and is forg again will you aid me or thwart me choos swiftli gimli and legola look at their companion in amaz for they had not seen him in thi mood befor he seem to have grown in statur while éomer had shrunk and in hi live face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesti of the king of stone for a moment it seem to the eye of legola that a white flame flicker on the brow of aragorn like a shine crown éomer step back and a look of awe wa in hi face he cast down hi proud eye these are inde strang day he mutter dream and legend spring to life out of the grass tell me lord he said what bring you here and what wa the mean of the dark word long ha boromir son of denethor been gone seek an answer and the hors that we lent him came back riderless what doom do you bring out of the north the doom of choic said aragorn you may say thi to théoden son of thengel open war lie befor him with sauron or against him none may live now as they have live and few shall keep what they call their own but of these great matter we will speak later if chanc allow i will come myself to the king now i am in great need and i ask for help or at least for tide you heard that we are pursu an orchost that carri off our friend what can you tell us that you need not pursu them further said éomer the orc are destroy and our friend we found none but orc but that is strang inde said aragorn did you search the slain were there no bodi other than those of orckind they would be small onli children to your eye unshod but clad in grey there were no dwarv nor children said éomer we count all the slain and despoil them and then we pile the carcas and burn them as is our custom the ash are smoke still we do not speak of dwarv or children said gimli our friend were hobbit hobbit said éomer and what may they be it is a strang name a strang name for a strang folk said gimli but these were veri dear to us it seem that you have heard in rohan of the word that troubl mina tirith they spoke of the halfl these hobbit are halfl halfl laugh the rider that stood besid éomer halfl but they are onli a littl peopl in old song and children tale out of the north do we walk in legend or on the green earth in the daylight a man may do both said aragorn for not we but those who come after will make the legend of our time the green earth say you that is a mighti matter of legend though you tread it under the light of day time is press said the rider not heed aragorn we must hasten south lord let us leav these wild folk to their fanci or let us bind them and take them to the king peac éothain said éomer in hi own tongu leav me a while tell the éore to assembl on the path and make readi to ride to the entwad mutter éothain retir and spoke to the other soon they drew off and left éomer alon with the three companion all that you say is strang aragorn he said yet you speak the truth that is plain the men of the mark do not lie and therefor they are not easili deceiv but you have not told all will you not now speak more fulli of your errand so that i may judg what to do i set out from imladri as it is name in the rhyme mani week ago answer aragorn with me went boromir of mina tirith my errand wa to go to that citi with the son of denethor to aid hi folk in their war against sauron but the compani that i journey with had other busi of that i can not speak now gandalf the grey wa our leader gandalf éomer exclaim gandalf greyham is known in the mark but hi name i warn you is no longer a password to the king favour he ha been a guest in the land mani time in the memori of men come as he will after a season or after mani year he is ever the herald of strang event a bringer of evil some now say inde sinc hi last come in the summer all thing have gone amiss at that time our troubl with saruman began until then we count saruman our friend hut gandalf came then and warn us that sudden war wa prepar in isengard he said that he himself had been a prison in orthanc and had hardli escap and he beg for help but théoden would not listen to him and he went away speak not the name of gandalf loudli in théoden ear he is wroth for gandalf took the hors that is call shadowfax the most preciou of all the king steed chief of the meara which onli the lord of the mark may ride for the sire of their race wa the great hors of eorl that knew the speech of men seven night ago shadowfax return but the king anger is not less for now the hors is wild and will let no man handl him then shadowfax ha found hi way alon from the far north said aragorn for it wa there that he and gandalf part but ala gandalf will ride no longer he fell into dark in the mine of moria and come not again that is heavi tide said éomer at least to me and to mani though not to all as you may find if you come to the king it is tide more grievou than ani in thi land can understand though it may touch them sore ere the year is much older said aragorn but when the great fall the less must lead my part it ha been to guid our compani on the long road from moria through lórien we came – of which it were well that you should learn the truth ere you speak of it again – and thenc down the leagu of the great river to the fall of rauro there boromir wa slain by the same orc whom you destroy your news is all of woe cri éomer in dismay great harm is thi death to mina tirith and to us all that wa a worthi man all spoke hi prais he came seldom to the mark for he wa ever in the war on the eastbord but i have seen him more like to the swift son of eorl than to the grave men of gondor he seem to me and like to prove a great captain of hi peopl when hi time came but we have had no word of thi grief out of gondor when did he fall it is now the fourth day sinc he wa slain answer aragorn and sinc the even of that day we have journey from the shadow of tol brandir on foot cri éomer ye even as you see us wide wonder came into éomer eye strider is too poor a name son of arathorn he said wingfoot i name you thi deed of the three friend should be sung in mani a hall forti leagu and five you have measur ere the fourth day is end hardi is the race of elendil but now lord what would you have me do i must return in hast to théoden i spoke warili befor my men it is true that we are not yet at open war with the black land and there are some close to the king ear that speak craven counsel but war is come we shall not forsak our old allianc with gondor and while they fight we shall aid them so say i and all who hold with me the eastmark is my charg the ward of the third marshal and i have remov all our herd and herdfolk withdraw them beyond entwash and leav none here but guard and swift scout then you do not pay tribut to sauron said gimli we do not and we never have said éomer with a flash of hi eye though it come to my ear that that lie ha been told some year ago the lord of the black land wish to purchas hors of us at great price but we refus him for he put beast to evil use then he sent plunder orc and they carri off what they can choos alway the black hors few of these are now left for that reason our feud with the orc is bitter but at thi time our chief concern is with saruman he ha claim lordship over all thi land and there ha been war between us for mani month he ha taken orc into hi servic and wolfrid and evil men and he ha close the gap against us so that we are like to be beset both east and west it is ill deal with such a foe he is a wizard both cun and dwimmercrafti have mani guis he walk here and there they say as an old man hood and cloak veri like to gandalf as mani now recal hi spi slip through everi net and hi bird of ill omen are abroad in the sky i do not know how it will all end and my heart misgiv me for it seem to me that hi friend do not all dwell in isengard but if you come to the king hous you shall see for yourself will you not come do i hope in vain that you have been sent to me for a help in doubt and need i will come when i may said aragorn come now said éomer the heir of elendil would be a strength inde to the son of eorl in thi evil tide there is battl even now upon the westemnet and i fear that it may go ill for us inde in thi ride north i went without the king leav for in my absenc hi hous is left with littl guard but scout warn me of the orchost come down out of the east wall three night ago and among them they report that some bore the white badg of saruman so suspect what i most fear a leagu between orthanc and the dark tower i led forth my éore men of my own household and we overtook the orc at nightfal two day ago near to the border of the entwood there we surround them and gave battl yesterday at dawn fifteen of my men i lost and twelv hors ala for the orc were greater in number than we count on other join them come out of the east across the great river their trail is plain to see a littl north of thi spot and other too came out of the forest great orc who also bore the white hand of isengard that kind is stronger and more fell than all other nonetheless we put an end to them but we have been too long away we are need south and west will you not come there are spare hors as you see there is work for the sword to do ye and we could find a use for gimli axe and the bow of legola if they will pardon my rash word concern the ladi of the wood i spoke onli as do all men in my land and i would gladli learn better i thank you for your fair word said aragorn and my heart desir to come with you but i can not desert my friend while hope remain hope doe not remain said éomer you will not find your friend on the northbord yet my friend are not behind we found a clear token not far from the east wall that one at least of them wa still aliv there but between the wall and the down we have found no other trace of them and no trail ha turn asid thi way or that unless my skill ha wholli left me then what do you think ha becom of them i do not know they may have been slain and burn among the orc but that you will say can not be and i do not fear it i can onli think that they were carri off into the forest befor the battl even befor you encircl your foe mayb can you swear that none escap your net in such a way i would swear that no orc escap after we sight them said éomer we reach the foresteav befor them and if after that ani live thing broke through our ring then it wa no orc and had some elvish power our friend were attir even as we are said aragorn and you pass us by under the full light of day i had forgotten that said éomer it is hard to be sure of anyth among so mani marvel the world is all grown strang elf and dwarf in compani walk in our daili field and folk speak with the ladi of the wood and yet live and the sword come back to war that wa broken in the long age ere the father of our father rode into the mark how shall a man judg what to do in such time as he ever ha judg said aragorn good and ill have not chang sinc yesteryear nor are they one thing among elv and dwarv and anoth among men it is a man part to discern them as much in the golden wood as in hi own hous true inde said éomer but i do not doubt you nor the deed which my heart would do yet i am not free to do all as i would it is against our law to let stranger wander at will in our land until the king himself shall give them leav and more strict is the command in these day of peril i have beg you to come back willingli with me and you will not loth am i to begin a battl of one hundr against three i do not think your law wa made for such a chanc said aragorn nor inde am i a stranger for i have been in thi land befor more than onc and ridden with the host of the rohirrim though under other name and in other guis you i have not seen befor for you are young but i have spoken with éomund your father and with théoden son of thengel never in former day would ani high lord of thi land have constrain a man to abandon such a quest as mine my duti at least is clear to go on come now son of éomund the choic must be made at last aid us or at the worst let us go free or seek to carri out your law if you do so there will be fewer to return to your war or to your king éomer wa silent for a moment then he spoke we both have need of hast he said my compani chafe to be away and everi hour lessen your hope thi is my choic you may go and what is more i will lend you hors thi onli i ask when your quest is achiev or is prove vain return with the hors over the entwad to meduseld the high hous in edora where théoden now sit thu you shall prove to him that i have not misjudg in thi i place myself and mayb my veri life in the keep of your good faith do not fail i will not said aragorn there wa great wonder and mani dark and doubt glanc among hi men when éomer gave order that the spare hors were to be lent to the stranger but onli éothain dare to speak openli it may be well enough for thi lord of the race of gondor as he claim he said but who ha heard of a hors of the mark be given to a dwarf no one said gimli and do not troubl no one will ever hear of it i would sooner walk than sit on the back of ani beast so great free or begrudg but you must ride now or you will hinder us said aragorn come you shall sit behind me friend gimli said legola then all will be well and you need neither borrow a hors nor be troubl by one a great darkgrey hors wa brought to aragorn and he mount it hasufel is hi name said éomer may he bear you well and to better fortun than gárulf hi late master a smaller and lighter hors but restiv and fieri wa brought to legola arod wa hi name but legola ask them to take off saddl and rein i need them not he said and leap lightli up and to their wonder arod wa tame and will beneath him move here and there with but a spoken word such wa the elvish way with all good beast gimli wa lift up behind hi friend and he clung to him not much more at eas than sam gamge in a boat farewel and may you find what you seek cri éomer return with what speed you may and let our sword hereaft shine togeth i will come said aragorn and i will come too said gimli the matter of the ladi galadriel lie still between us i have yet to teach you gentl speech we shall see said éomer so mani strang thing have chanc that to learn the prais of a fair ladi under the love stroke of a dwarf axe will seem no great wonder farewel with that they part veri swift were the hors of rohan when after a littl gimli look back the compani of éomer were alreadi small and far away aragorn did not look back he wa watch the trail as they sped on their way bend low with hi head besid the neck of hasufel befor long they came to the border of the entwash and there they met the other trail of which éomer had spoken come down from the east out of the wold aragorn dismount and survey the ground then leap back into the saddl he rode away for some distanc eastward keep to one side and take care not to overrid the footprint then he again dismount and examin the ground go backward and forward on foot there is littl to discov he said when he return the main trail is all confus with the passag of the horsemen as they came back their outward cours must have lain nearer the river but thi eastward trail is fresh and clear there is no sign there of ani feet go the other way back toward anduin now we must ride slower and make sure that no trace or footstep branch off on either side the orc must have been awar from thi point that they were pursu they may have made some attempt to get their captiv away befor they were overtaken as they rode forward the day wa overcast low grey cloud came over the wold a mist shroud the sun ever nearer the treeclad slope of fangorn loom slowli darkl as the sun went west they saw no sign of ani trail to right or left but here and there they pass singl orc fallen in their track as they ran with greyfeath arrow stick in back or throat at last as the afternoon wa wane they came to the eav of the forest and in an open glade among the first tree they found the place of the great burn the ash were still hot and smoke besid it wa a great pile of helm and mail cloven shield and broken sword bow and dart and other gear of war upon a stake in the middl wa set a great goblin head upon it shatter helm the white badg could still be seen further away not far from the river where it came stream out from the edg of the wood there wa a mound it wa newli rais the raw earth wa cover with freshcut turv about it were plant fifteen spear aragorn and hi companion search far and
