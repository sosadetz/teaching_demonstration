find all just all right on your side and all impati all inconsider on mine i stare you may suppos whenc thi chang sir and so soon i am so much convinc that you must be in the right in all you think fit to insist upon that i shall for the futur mistrust myself and if it be possibl whenev i differ with you take an hour time for recollect befor i give way to that vehem which an opposit to which i have not been accustom too often give me all thi is mighti good sir but to what doe it tend whi madam when i came to consid what you had propos as to the term of reconcili with your friend and when i recollect that you had alway refer to yourself to approv or reject me accord to my merit or demerit i plainli saw that it wa rather a condescens in you that you were pleas to ask my consent to those term than that you were impos a new law and i now madam beg your pardon for my impati whatev term you think proper to come into with your relat which will enabl you to honor me with the condit effect
