occas hi ecstasi to thi high spiritu with it rich emot color wa unit a power and subtleti of intellect such as is possess by onli the veri greatest master of the mind the spiritu world in which edward move wa for him no mere shadowi realm of piou sentiment or vagu aspir but a world whose main outlin at least were sharpli defin for thought he conceiv it name in accord with the scheme of thing

thi in gener is the scheme which edward stand for he most conspicu of all men of modern time hi specul geniu gave to thi scheme a metaphys background hi logic acumen elabor and defenc he modifi it in some respect eg in hi doctrin of the will what is more import he gave a promin to the inward state of manth disposit and affect of hi mind and heartwhich appreci affect the rel valu of the scheme and which ha in fact chang the entir complexion of the religi thought of new england but as to the gener scheme itself the philosophi of religion the philosophi of life it express there is noth in that which is essenti origin with edward in stand for these doctrin he but champion the great orthodox tradit but howev littl origin may be the content of hi thought there is noth that is not in the highest degre origin in hi manner of think the signific thing about edward is the way he enter into the tradit infus it with hi person and make it live the vital of hi thought give to it product the valu of a uniqu creation two qualiti in him especi contribut to thi result larg construct imagin and a marvel acut power of abstract reason with the vision of the seer he look steadili upon hi world which is the world of all time and space and exist and see it as a whole god and soul are in it the great realiti and the transact between them the great busi in which all it movement is concern and thi movement ha in it noth haphazard it is etern determin with refer to a suprem and gloriou end the manifest of the excel of god the highest excel of be all the dark and tragic aspect of the vision which for him is intens real take their place along with the other aspect in a system a system wherein everi part deriv mean and worth from it relat to the whole peopl have wonder how edward the gentlest of men could contempl as he said he did with sweet and delight the aw doctrin of the divin sovereignti interpret as he interpret it as impli the everlast miseri of a larg part of the human race the reason is no revolt indiffer callou and inhuman to suffer the reason is rather the person detach the disinterest interest the freedom from the pathet fallaci of the great poet the great construct thinker it is thi larg qualiti in edwardss imagin which is one sourc of hi power anoth is the thorough and abil with which he intellectu elabor the detail of hi scheme he wrote inde no system of divin yet he is the veri opposit of a fragmentari thinker and few mind have been less episod than wa hi hi intellectu construct are larg and solid of the doctrin with which he deal he leav noth undevelop with infinit patienc he push hi inquiri into everi minut detail and remot consequ put hi adversari to confus by the unremit attack the overwhelm massiv of the argument rare inde can one escap hi conclus who accept hi premis moreov by the thorough acut and sincer of hi reason he power stimul the intellectu faculti even in hi most terrif sermon he never appeal to mere hope and fear nor to mere author in them as in hi theolog treatis he is bent on demonstr within the limit prescrib by the underli assumpt the reason of hi doctrin it agreement with the fact of life and the constitut of thing as well as with the inspir teach of the word now these qualiti appear as in hi other write so also and perhap most conspicu in hi sermon edwardss chief public work and hi chief reput in hi lifetim wa as a preacher the fame of hi theolog treatis is larg inde posthum he wa a great preacher in the case of mani of the older divin it is difficult for us now to understand how they could ever have been consid great preacher to us their sermon seem dri and insipid but it is not so with edward even in print after more than a hundr and fifti year and notwithstand the gulf which separ our age from hi hi sermon are still deepli interest they are interest becaus among other thing they reveal a great and interest person they are instinct with the energi of hi intellect they are vital with the vital touch of hi geniu he preach hi theolog some of hi sermonsfor instanc the sermon or rather combin of sermon on justif by faithseem to be less sermon than highli elabor theolog disquisit adapt to the use of profession student and there is doubtless no sermon of hi which doe not reflect to some extent hi theolog system edward wa certainli impress with the import and advantag of a thorough knowledg of divin truthth theme and titl of one of hi ablest discours he held that god had reveal himself not onli to the heart but to the mind of man and that an intellig apprehens of the revel wa indispens in some measur alik to save faith and to the develop of christian charact but it would be a mistak to think of edward as preach the dri bone of hi theolog he wa far inde from suppos as some now seem to suppos that a christian societi can be the more perfectli organ in proport as all definit of theolog that is distinct religi concept is elimin he had too profound a respect for the intellect to exclud it from matter of the deepest specul as well as practic moment and he had too lofti an idea of religion to identifi it either with vagu transcendent emot or with mere person social or polit moral hi sermon howev are by no mean all of one type on the contrari they are of a great varieti of type they are doctrin practic experiment andtak into account the unpublish manuscriptsther is an unusu larg number of occasion sermon and there are a good mani varieti within the type but even when the sermon are most doctrin the practic interest of a live convict of the truth is never absent the abstract antithesi of thought and life of theori and practic as though think were not itself a do or as though an attitud toward truth were not itself practic or capabl of determin other practic attitud is an error from which edward is wholesom free to say thi is not necessarili to approv the content of hi doctrin preach the thought of the church with which edward wa associ ha move away from hi thought he contend stoutli for hi scheme of thing but he fought it would seem a lose fight it is not that he ha been refut by abstract logic the argument by which he ha been set asid so far as he ha been set asid is the logic of event the chang ha been brought about no doubt by mani influenc some of them seem pure sentiment but there are two thing at least of fundament diverg in the charact of our timeth develop in us of a critic disciplin histor sens and the domin influenc in our modern scienc and philosophi of the idea of evolut these have broken down those hard and fast distinct between natur and the supernatur natur and grace human reason and divin revel in which edward delight at least in the form in which he habitu preach them with the establish on the line of histor critic of new canon of exegesi in the interpret of scriptur and with the gradual disappear of the idea of the bibl as an extern author protest christian is at present confront the question whether the entir claim of christian to be a supernatur revel in the sens in which the term supernatur is use by orthodox theologian ha not been misplac thi is a question which edward never rais and which he doe not help us directli to solv he ha the mind of a specul philosoph ha a veri profound thought of god grasp firmli the etern spiritu signific of thing but he is defici in the histor sensehi histori of redempt is a wholli uncrit dogmat construct and he is not specul enough to find or at least he work under condit which prevent him from show the mediat principl by which the antithes and contradict of experi and theori can be reconcil and annul but to return to the sermon edwardss sermon are construct in gener on a definit model we have first the exposit of the text we have secondli a clearli formul statement of the doctrin which is then develop under it appropri and preannounc divis final we have what is various call the improv use or applic similarli develop the doctrin is not usual an abstract theolog dogma it is simpli the theme of the discours state in proposit form thu an unpublish sermon on john i ha thi for it statement of doctrin when person have truli come to christ themselv they natur desir to bring other also to him anoth unpublish sermon on john iii ha thi ti no wonder that christ said that we must be born again in anotheralso unpublishedfrom the text john i the doctrin is the similarli simpl statement ti a great thing to be inde a convert person sometim though rare the statement of a doctrin is omit altogeth the text itself be regard as suffici defin the subject thi howev is never the case with the applic inde so practic is edward in hi preach that the applic is sometim much the larger part of the discours in the sermon on john i for exampl it fill about twothird of the manuscript in fact the proport of these part exposit develop of doctrin and applic depend entir on the natur of the theme and the special end of the sermon and similarli of the length and number of the subdivis one featur is constantstrictli logic arrang howev fine articul the sermon may be they are construct so as to make a distinctli unifi impress nor is thi uniti of impress serious interf with as a rule by the length of the sermon edward wa not in the habit of exhaust the attent of hi audienc occasion howev he would develop hi theme through two or more sermon when these appear in the print edit as a singl discours the length natur seem inordin in the manuscript the part of such compound sermon are indic by the word doc doctrin at the divis suggest that the preacher wa wont in renew the theme to remind hi hearer of the precis natur of the subject under discuss and as there wa no confus in the thought so the style of edwardss sermon is singularli clear simpl and unstudi he affect no grace seek no adorn which the subjectmatt itself and hi interest in it do not natur lend the style is the man is a say which peculiarli appli to him the nobil strength and direct of hi thought the vivid and larg of hi imagin the truth and elev of hi charact the intens of hi convict hi impass earnest are reflect in hi discours they seem to have been to an unusu degre a spontan form of selfexpress but attent is never divert from the subject to the skill of the workmanship the object is not to delight but to convinc and the attain of thi end is sought by direct method of argument persuas and appeal yet the style though simpl and straightforward is veri far from be barren the sermon are full of great rich beauti word and there are mani passag in them of wonder charm as well as mani of great sublim and rhetor power but edwardss interest in these seem never mere verbal he is not a maker of phrase he make use of strike metaphor and startl antithesi hi style is often picturesqu he well know the rhetor valu of iter when the repeat phrase is employ in a vari context but he never seek to produc hi effect by literari indirect he can be easi familiar colloqui even on occas if that suit hi purpos but he is never undignifi never vulgarli sensat nor doe he seem ever to be intent humor the construct of hi sentenc is often such as the pedantri of modern standard would condemn but howev oldfashion it is seldom inde that the express can be call whimsic or quaint the most determin extern influenc on hi style wa unquestion the old socal king jame version of the english bibl hi languag is satur with it thought and phraseolog and as he is intim acquaint with it in all it part so he is continu quot it and constantli surpris us with fresh discoveri in novel colloc of it varieti beauti and impress he wa influenc also doubtless by hi too exclus theolog and philosoph read but it is in the end the origin of hi own geniu the depth and subtleti and forc of hi mind and the rich of hi spiritu experi which we must regard as set the stamp upon hi style edwardss sermon are hallmark they have not onli interest as histor memori of the religi condit of their time as the person express of an origin mind work in tradit materi inde but anim and so refashion it with the uniqu form of a great person they have also the valu of literatur larg to the union of the intellectu and emot element mentionedth definit of the messag the logic uniti of the thought the singl and sincer of the aim the intens of the convict the thorough knowledg of scriptur the profound acquaint through person experi of the religi move of the human heartmust be attribut in connect with the state of religi thought and feel of the time and the respect arous by the charact of the preacher the power which he exercis on hi contemporari of hi manner of preach we have from hi pupil hopkin the follow authent testimoni hi appear in the desk wa with a good grace and hi deliveri easi natur and veri solemn he had not a strong loud voic but appear with such graviti and solemn and spake with such distinct clear and precis hi word were so full of idea set in such a plain and strike light that few speaker have been so abl to demand the attent of an audienc as he hi word often discov a great degre of inward fervor without much nois or extern emot and fell with great weight on the mind of hi hearer he made but littl motion of hi head or hand in the desk but spake as to discov the motion of hi own heart which tend in the most natur and effectu manner to move and affect other as he wrote hi sermon out at larg for mani year and alway wrote a consider part of most of hi public discours so he carri hi note into the desk with him and read the most that he wrote yet he wa not so confin to hi note when he wrote at larg but that if some thought were suggest while he wa speak which did not occur when write and appear to him pertin and strike he would deliv them and that with as great proprieti and often with greater patho and attend with a more sensibl good effect on hi hearer than all he had wrote the sermon in the present volum have been select as repres of edward the preacher rather than of edward the theologian ani such collect must includ at least the follow four the sermon on man depend the sermon on spiritu light the enfield sermon and the farewel sermon these are classic moreov they repres edward in four of hi most distinguish aspect as the power champion of a theolog rest ultim on the principl of a transcend righteou sovereign will as the equal convinc advoc of the mystic principl of an immedi intuit apprehens through supernatur illumin of divin truth as the flame revivalist with pitiless logic and terribl realism of descript arous startl overwhelm the sinner with the sens of impend doom final as the reject minist appeal without rancor or bitter from the judgment of thi world to the judgment of an infal tribun and display what must ever make him more interest more preciou as a heritag to the church and the world than ani of hi opinion or hi work the digniti and repos the patienc strength and depth of a great charact perfect through suffer and appar defeat in what wa virtual the apologia of hi ministeri life these sermon alon would suffic to justifi edwardss reput as the foremost preacher of hi age still they can not of cours be taken as adequ repres the whole rang and power of hi discours in particular the enfield sermon which ha loom so larg in the popular imagin of jonathan edward and which in fact is but oneto be sure the most extremeof a number of the same type can not be taken as fairli repres even of edwardss reviv sermon there ha therefor been ad in thi refer a reviv sermon of anoth type the sermon on ruth resolut thi sermon wa chosen not becaus it is better than some other but becaus while be an excel sermon of it kind it is also brief and so better adapt to the scope of thi volum there ha been further ad as repres a type distinctli differ from ani of the other the funer sermon entitl a strong rod broken and wither which is certainli one of the noblest in thought and express of edwardss discours and which is probabl uniqu among hi write as deal with the subject of civil govern and the manag of affair had space permit the pictur of the christian statesman in thi sermon might have been match by the pictur of the christian minist in one of the ordin sermon but the omiss is the less seriou sinc the concept is so larg realiz in edward himself the abov six sermon were select independ of the fact that they are among the ten publish by their author but thi circumst confirm the choic and moreov serv to authent the text edward ha suffer not a littl at the hand of hi editor particularli dwight who seem to have been possess by the idea that hi author would appear to better advantag in a style and languag more eleg and refin dont do as orpah did plead edward in the ruth sermon do not as orpah did is the feebl refin of hi editor but even the gener accur worcest or first american edit is not to be implicitli trust for instanc two whole page are omit at the end of the enfield sermon give to that sermon a startl and bizarr close wholli out of keep with edwardss habitu manner later edit import other error and even while profess to follow the worcest edit sometim in fact follow not that edit but dwight eg in the ruth sermon the present text is base upon a care comparison of the origin edit now veri scarc in the boston athenæum the origin express ti wont dont etc as edward himself print them have been restor a number of verbal error in the later edit correct and sever omit line recov besid the long passag alreadi mention which is howev in dwight at the end of the enfield sermon no attempt howev ha been made to give a facsimil reproduct of the first edit with all their printer error caprici spell antiqu punctuat and uncouth use of capit and ital these extern could but distract the modern reader while ad noth essenti to accuraci in these respect therefor the more modern usag ha been follow the aim ha simpli been to give the exact word of the origin and to preserv their spirit treat the sermon as sermon to be preach and not as essay to be read accordingli while avoid the extrem of the first edit ital have been use where edward use them to mark divis or for special emphasi somewhat more freeli than would be customari now thi edit also follow hi and the biblic use of ordinari type in person pronoun refer to divin be the verbal rever in the modern use of capit be regard as needless to enhanc the real rever of edwardss thought and possibl a littl out of place ad word are enclos within squar bracket besid the six sermon mention the present collect includ one the

dependence° cor i that no flesh should glori in hi presenc but of him are ye in christ jesu who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteous and sanctif and redempt that accord as it is written he that glorieth let him glori in the lord those christian to whom the apostl direct thi epistl dwelt in a part of the world where human wisdom wa in great reput as the apostl observ in the d vers of thi chapter the greek seek after wisdom corinth wa not far from athen that had been for mani age the most famou seat of philosophi and learn in the world the apostl therefor observ to them how that god by the gospel destroy and brought to nought their human wisdom the learn grecian and their great philosoph by all their wisdom did not know god they were not abl to find out the truth in divin thing but after they had done their utmost to no effect it pleas god at length to reveal himself by the gospel which they account foolish he chose the foolish thing of the world to confound the wise and the weak thing of the world to confound the thing which are mighti and the base thing of the world and thing that are despis yea and thing which are not to bring to nought the thing that are and the apostl inform them whi he thu did in the vers of the text that no flesh should glori in hi presenc c in which word may be observ what god aim at in the disposit of thing in the affair of redempt viz that man should not glori in himself but alon in god that no flesh should glori in hi presencethat accord as it is written he that glorieth let him glori in the lord how thi end is attain in the work of redempt viz by that absolut and immedi depend which men have upon god in that work for all their good inasmuch as first all the good that they have is in and through christ he is made unto us wisdom righteous sanctif and redempt all the good of the fallen and redeem creatur is concern in these four thing and can not be better distribut than into them but christ is each of them to us and we have none of them ani otherwis than in him he is made of god unto us wisdom in him are all the proper good and true excel of the understand wisdom wa a thing that the greek admir but christ is the true light of the world it is through him alon that true wisdom is impart to the mind ti in and by christ that we have righteous it is by be in him that we are justifi have our sin pardon and are receiv as righteou into god favor ti by christ that we have sanctif we have in him true excel of heart as well as of understand and he is made unto us inher as well as imput righteous ti by christ that we have redempt or actual deliver from all miseri and the bestow of all happi and glori thu we have all our good by christ who is god secondli anoth instanc wherein our depend on god for all our good appear is thi that it is god that ha given us christ that we might have these benefit through him he of god is made unto us wisdom righteous c thirdli ti of him that we are in christ jesu and come to have an interest in him and so do receiv those bless which he is made unto us it is god that give us faith wherebi we close with christ so that in thi vers is shown our depend on each person in the triniti for all our good we are depend on christ the son of god as he is our wisdom righteous sanctif and redempt we are depend on the father who ha given us christ and made him to be these thing to us we are depend on the holi ghost for ti of him that we are in christ jesu ti the spirit of god that give faith in him wherebi we receiv him and close with him doctrin god is glorifi in the work of redempt in thi that there appear in it so absolut and univers a depend of the redeem on him here i propos to show i that there is an absolut and univers depend of the redeem on god for all their good and ii that god herebi is exalt and glorifi in the work of redempt i there is an absolut and univers depend of the redeem on god the natur and contriv of our redempt is such that the redeem are in everi thing directli immedi and entir depend on god they are depend on him for all and are depend on him everi way the sever way wherein the depend of one be may be upon anoth for it good and wherein the redeem of jesu christ depend on god for all their good are these viz that they have all their good of him and that they have all through him and that they have all in him that he is the caus and origin whenc all their good come therein it is of him and that he is the medium by which it is obtain and convey therein they have it through him and that he is that good itself that is given and convey therein it is in him now those that are redeem by jesu christ do in all these respect veri directli and entir depend on god for their all first the redeem have all their good of god god is the great author of it he is the first caus of it and not onli so but he is the onli proper caus ti of god that we have our redeem it is god that ha provid a saviour for us jesu christ is not onli of god in hi person as he is the onli begotten son of god but he is from god as we are concern in him and in hi offic of mediat he is the gift of god to us god chose and anoint him appoint him hi work and sent him into the world and as it is god that give so ti god that accept the saviour as it is god that provid and give the redeem to buy salvat for us so it is of god that salvat is bought he give the purchas and he afford the thing purchas ti of god that christ becom our that we are brought to him and are unit to him it is of god that we receiv faith to close with him that we may have an interest in him eph ii for by grace ye are save through faith and that not of yourselv it is the gift of god ti of god that we actual do receiv all the benefit that christ ha purchas ti god that pardon and justifi and deliv from go down to hell and it is hi favor that the redeem are receiv into and are made the object of when they are justifi so it is god that deliv from the dominion of sin and cleans us from our filthi and chang us from our deform it is of god that the redeem do receiv all their true excel wisdom and holi and that two way viz as the holi ghost by whom these thing are immedi wrought is from god proce from him and is sent by him and also as the holi ghost himself is god by whose oper and indwel the knowledg of divin thing and a holi disposit and all grace are confer and upheld and though mean are made use of in confer grace on men soul yet ti of god that we have these mean of grace and ti god that make them effectu ti of god that we have the holi scriptur they are the word of god ti of god that we have ordin and their efficaci depend on the immedi influenc of the spirit of god the minist of the gospel are sent of god and all their suffici is of him cor iv we have thi treasur in earthen vessel that the excel of the power may be of god and not of us their success depend entir and absolut on the immedi bless and influenc of god the redeem have all of the grace of god it wa of mere grace that god gave us hi onli begotten son the grace is great in proport to the digniti and excel of what is given the gift wa infinit preciou becaus it wa a person infinit worthi a person of infinit glori and also becaus it wa a person infinit near and dear to god the grace is great in proport to the benefit we have given us in him the benefit is doubli infinit in that in him we have deliver from an infinit becaus an etern miseri and do also receiv etern joy and glori the grace in bestow thi gift is great in proport to our unworthi to whom it is given instead of deserv such a gift we merit infinit ill of god hand the grace is great accord to the manner of give or in proport to the humili and expens of the method and mean by which way is made for our have of the gift he gave him to us dwell amongst us he gave him to us incarn or in our natur he gave him to us in our natur in the like infirm in which we have it in our fallen state and which in us do accompani and are occas by the sin corrupt of our natur he gave him to us in a low and afflict state and not onli so but he gave him to us slain that he might be a feast for our souls° the grace of god in bestow thi gift is most free it wa what god wa under no oblig to bestow he might have reject fallen man as he did the fallen angel it wa what we never did ani thing to merit twa given while we were yet enemi and befor we had so much as repent it wa from the love of god that saw no excel in us to attract it and it wa without expect of ever be requit for it and ti from mere grace that the benefit of christ are appli to such and such particular person those that are call and sanctifi are to attribut it alon to the good pleasur of god good by which they are distinguish he is sovereign and hath merci on whom he will have merci and whom he will he harden man hath now a greater depend on the grace of god than he had befor the fall he depend on the free good of god for much more than he did then then he depend on god good for confer the reward of perfect obedi for god wa not oblig to promis and bestow that reward but now we are depend on the grace of god for much more we stand in need of grace not onli to bestow glori upon us but to deliv us from hell and etern wrath under the first coven we depend on god good to give us the reward of righteous and so we do now and not onli so but we stand in need of god free and sovereign grace to give us that righteous and yet not onli so but we stand in need of hi grace to pardon our sin and releas us from the guilt and infinit demerit of it and as we are depend on the good of god for more now than under the first coven so we are depend on a much greater more free and wonder good we are now more depend on god arbitrari and sovereign good pleasur we were in our first estat depend on god for holi we had our origin righteous from him but then holi wa not bestow in such a way of sovereign good pleasur as it is now man wa creat holi and it becam god to creat holi all the reason creatur he creat it would have been a disparag to the holi of god natur if he had made an intellig creatur unholi but now when a man is made holi it is from mere and arbitrari grace god may forev deni holi to the fallen creatur if he pleas without ani disparag to ani of hi perfect and we are not onli inde more depend on the grace of god but our depend is much more conspicu becaus our own insuffici and helpless in ourselv is much more appar in our fallen and undon state than it wa befor we were either sin or miser we are more appar depend on god for holi becaus we are first sin and utterli pollut and afterward holi so the product of the effect is sensibl and it deriv from god more obviou if man wa ever holi and alway wa so it would not be so appar that he had not holi necessarili as an insepar qualif of human natur so we are more appar depend on free grace for the favor of god for we are first justli the object of hi displeasur and afterward are receiv into favor we are more appar depend on god for happi be first miser and afterward happi it is more appar free and without merit in us becaus we are actual without ani kind of excel to merit if there could be ani such thing as merit in creatur excel and we are not onli without ani true excel but are full of and wholli defil with that which is infinit odiou all our good is more appar from god becaus we are first nake and wholli without ani good and afterward enrich with all good we receiv all of the power of god man redempt is often spoken of as a work of wonder power as well as grace the great power of god appear in bring a sinner from hi low state from the depth of sin and miseri to such an exalt state of holi and happi eph i and what is the exceed great of hi power to usward who believ accord to the work of hi mighti power we are depend on god power through everi step of our redempt we are depend on the power of god to convert us and give faith in jesu christ and the new natur ti a work of creation if ani man be in christ he is a new creatur cor v we are creat in christ jesu eph ii the fallen creatur can not attain to true holi but by be creat again eph iv and that ye put on the new man which after god is creat in righteous and true holi it is a rais from the dead col ii wherein ye also are risen with him through the faith of the oper of god who hath rais him from the dead yea it is a more gloriou work of power than mere creation or rais a dead bodi to life in that the effect attain is greater and more excel that holi and happi be and spiritu life which is reach in the work of convers is a far greater and more gloriou effect than mere be and life and the state from whenc the chang is made of such a death in sin and total corrupt of natur and depth of miseri is far more remot from the state attain than mere death or nonent ti by god power also that we are preserv in a state of grace pet i who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvat as grace is at first from god so ti continu from him and is maintain by him as much as light in the atmospher is all day long from the sun as well as at first dawn or at sunris men are depend on the power of god for everi exercis of grace and for carri on the work of grace in the heart for the subdu of sin and corrupt and increas holi principl and enabl to bring forth fruit in good work and at last bring grace to it perfect in make the soul complet amiabl in christ gloriou like and fill of it with a satisfi joy and blessed and for the rais of the bodi to life and to such a perfect state that it shall be suitabl for a habit and organ for a soul so perfect and bless these are the most gloriou effect of the power of god that are seen in the seri of god act with respect to the creatur man wa depend on the power of god in hi first estat but he is more depend on hi power now he need god power to do more thing for him and depend on a more wonder exercis of hi power it wa an effect of the power of god to make man holi at the first but more remark so now becaus there is a great deal of opposit and difficulti in the way ti a more gloriou effect of power to make that holi that wa so deprav and under the dominion of sin than to confer holi on that which befor had noth of the contrari it is a more gloriou work of power to rescu a soul out of the hand of the devil and from the power of dark and to bring it into a state of salvat than to confer holi where there wa no prepossess or opposit luke xi when a strong man arm keepeth hi palac hi good are in peac but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcom him he taketh from him all hi armor wherein he trust and divideth hi spoil so ti a more gloriou work of power to uphold a soul in a state of grace and holi and to carri it on till it is brought to glori when there is so much sin remain in the heart resist and satan with all hi might oppos than it would have been to have kept man from fall at first when satan had noth in man thu we have shown how the redeem are depend on god for all their good as they have all of him secondli they are also depend on god for all as they have all through him ti god that is the medium of it as well as the author and fountain of it all that we have wisdom and the pardon of sin deliver from hell accept in god favor grace and holi true comfort and happi etern life and glori we have from god by a mediat and thi mediat is god which mediat we have an absolut depend upon as he through whom we receiv all so that here is anoth way wherein we have our depend on god for all good god not onli give us the mediat and accept hi mediat and of hi power and grace bestow the thing purchas by the mediat but he is the mediat our bless are what we have by purchas and the purchas is made of god the bless are purchas of him and god give the purchas and not onli so but god is the purchas yea god is both the purchas and the price for christ who is god purchas these bless for us by offer up himself as the price of our salvat he purchas etern life by the sacrific of himself heb vii he offer up himself and ix he hath appear to take away sin by the sacrific of himself inde it wa the human natur that wa offer but it wa the same person with the divin and therefor wa an infinit price it wa look upon as if god had been offer in sacrific as we thu have our good through god we have a depend on god in a respect that man in hi first estat had not man wa to have etern life then through hi own righteous so that he had partli a depend upon what wa in himself for we have a depend upon that through which we have our good as well as that from which we have it and though man righteous that he then depend on wa inde from god yet it wa hi own it wa inher in himself so that hi depend wa not so immedi on god but now the righteous that we are depend on is not in ourselv but in god we are save through the righteous of christ he is made unto us righteous and therefor is prophesi of jer xxiii under that name of the lord our righteous in that the righteous we are justifi by is the righteous of christ it is the righteous of god cor v that we might be made the righteous of god in him thu in redempt we hant onli all thing of god but by and through him cor viii but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all thing and we in him and one lord jesu christ by whom are all thing and we by him thirdli the redeem have all their good in god we not onli have it of him and through him but it consist in him he is all our good the good of the redeem is either object or inher by their object good i mean that intrins object in the possess and enjoy of which they are happi their inher good is that excel or pleasur which is in the soul itself with respect to both of which the redeem have all their good in god or which is the same thing god himself is all their good the redeem have all their object good in god god himself is the great good which they are brought to the possess and enjoy of by redempt he is the highest good and the sum of all that good which christ purchas god is the inherit of the saint he is the portion of their soul god is their wealth and treasur their food their life their dwellingplac their ornament and diadem and their everlast honor and glori they have none in heaven but god he is the great good which the redeem are receiv to at death and which they are to rise to at the end of the world the lord god he is the light of the heavenli jerusalem and is the river of the water of life that run and the tree of life that grow in the midst of the paradis of god the gloriou excel and beauti of god will be what will forev entertain the mind of the saint and the love of god will be their everlast feast the redeem will inde enjoy other thing they will enjoy the angel and will enjoy one anoth but that which they shall enjoy in the angel or each other or in ani thing els whatsoev that will yield them delight and happi will be what will be seen of god in them the redeem have all their inher good in god inher good is twofold ti either excel or pleasur these the redeem not onli deriv from god as caus by him but have them in him they have spiritu excel and joy by a kind of particip of god they are made excel by a commun of god excel god put hi own beauti ie hi beauti like upon their soul they are made partak of the divin natur or moral imag of god pet i they are holi by be made partak of god holi heb xii the saint are beauti and bless by a commun of god holi and joy as the moon and planet are bright by the sun light the saint hath spiritu joy and pleasur by a kind of effus of god on the soul in these thing the redeem have communion with god that is they partak with him and of him the saint have both their spiritu excel and blessed by the gift of the holi ghost or spirit of god and hi dwell in them they are not onli caus by the holi ghost but are in the holi ghost as their principl the holi spirit becom an inhabit is a vital principl in the soul he act in upon and with the soul becom a fountain of true holi and joy as a spring is of water by the exert and diffus of itself john iv but whosoev drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water spring up into everlast lifecompar with chap vii he that believeth on me as the scriptur hath said out of hi belli shall flow river of live water but thi spake he of the spirit which they that believ on him should receiv the sum of what christ ha purchas for us is that spring of water spoken of in the former of those place and those river of live water spoken of in the latter and the sum of the bless which the redeem shall receiv in heaven is that river of water of life that proce from the throne of god and the lamb rev xxii which doubtless signifi the same with those river of live water explain john vii which is elsewher call the river of god pleasur herein consist the ful of good which the saint receiv by christ ti by partak of the holi spirit that they have communion with christ in hi ful god hath given the spirit not by measur unto him and they do receiv of hi ful and grace for grace thi is the sum of the saint inherit and therefor that littl of the holi ghost which believ have in thi world is said to be the earnest of their inherit cor i who hath also seal us and given us the spirit in our heart and chap v now he that hath wrought us for the selfsam thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit and eph i ye were seal with that holi spirit of promis which is the earnest of our inherit until the redempt of the purchas possess the holi spirit and good thing are spoken of in scriptur as the same as if the spirit of god commun to the soul compris all good thing matt vii how much more shall your heavenli father give good thing to them that ask him in luke it is chap xi how much more shall your heavenli father give the holi spirit to them that ask him thi is the sum of the bless that christ die to procur and that are the subject of gospel promis gal iii he wa made a curs for us that we might receiv the promis of the spirit through faith the spirit of god is the great promis of the father luke xxiv behold i send the promis of my father upon you the spirit of god therefor is call the spirit of promis eph i thi promis thing christ receiv and had given into hi hand as soon as he had finish the work of our redempt to bestow on all that he had redeem act ii therefor be by the right hand of god exalt and have receiv of the father the promis of the holi ghost he hath shed forth thi which ye both see and hear so that all the holi and happi of the redeem is in god ti in the commun indwel and act of the spirit of god holi and happi are in the fruit here and hereaft becaus god dwell in them and they in god thu ti god that ha given us the redeem and ti of him that our good is purchas so ti god that is the redeem and the price and ti god also that is the good purchas so that all that we have is of god and through him and in him rom xi for of him and through him and to him or in him are all thing the same in the greek that is here render to him is render in him cor vii ii god is glorifi in the work of redempt by thi mean viz by there be so great and univers a depend of the redeem on him man hath so much the greater occas and oblig to take notic and acknowledg god perfect and allsuffici the greater the creatur depend is on god perfect and the greater concern he ha with them so much the greater occas ha he to take notic of them so much the greater concern ani one ha with and depend upon the power and grace of god so much the greater occas ha he to take notic of that power and grace so much the greater and more immedi depend there is on the divin holi so much the greater occas to take notic of and acknowledg that so much the greater and more absolut depend we have on the divin perfect as belong to the sever person of the triniti so much the greater occas have we to observ and own the divin glori of each of them that which we are most concern with is sure most in the way of our observ and notic and thi kind of concern with ani thing viz depend doe especi tend to commend and oblig the attent and observ those thing that we are not much depend upon ti easi to neglect but we can scarc do ani other than mind that which we have a great depend on by reason of our so great depend on god and hi perfect and in so mani respect he and hi glori are the more directli set in our view which way soever we turn our eye we have the greater occas to take notic of god allsuffici when all our suffici is thu everi way of him we have the more occas to contempl him as an infinit good and as the fountain of all good such a depend on god demonstr god allsuffici so much as the depend of the creatur is on god so much the greater doe the creatur empti in himself appear to be and so much the greater the creatur empti so much the greater must the ful of the be be who suppli him our have all of god show the ful of hi power and grace our have all through him show the ful of hi merit and worthi and our have all in him demonstr hi ful of beauti love and happi and the redeem by reason of the great of their depend on god hant onli so much the greater occas but oblig to contempl and acknowledg the glori and ful of god how unreason and ungrat should we be if we did not acknowledg that suffici and glori that we do absolut immedi and univers depend upon herebi is demonstr how great god glori is consid compar or as compar with the creatur by the creatur be thu wholli and univers depend on god it appear that the creatur is noth and that god is all herebi it appear that god is infinit abov us that god strength and wisdom and holi are infinit greater than our howev great and gloriou the creatur apprehend god to be yet if he be not sensibl of the differ between god and him so as to see that god glori is great compar with hi own he will not be dispos to give god the glori due to hi name if the creatur in ani respect set himself upon a level with god or exalt himself to ani competit with him howev he may apprehend that great honor and profound respect may belong to god from those that are more inferior and at a greater distanc he will not be so sensibl of it be due from him so much the more men exalt themselv so much the less will they sure be dispos to exalt god ti certainli a thing that god aim at in the disposit of thing in the affair of redempt if we allow the scriptur to be a revel of god mind that god should appear full and man in himself empti that god should appear all and man noth ti god declar design that other should not glori in hi presenc which impli that ti hi design to advanc hi own compar glori so much the more man glori in god presenc so much the less glori is ascrib to god by it be thu order that the creatur should have so absolut and univers a depend on god provis is made that god should have our whole soul and should be the object of our undivid respect if we had our depend partli on god and partli on someth els man respect would be divid to those differ thing on which he had
