therefor a veri fine gentleman and such as consid what power ingredi a good figur fine cloth and fortun are in that charact will easili forgiv her mr thornhil notwithstand hi real ignor talk with eas and could expati upon the common topic of convers with fluenci it is not surpris then that such talent should win the affect of a girl who by educ wa taught to valu an appear in herself and consequ to set a valu upon it when found in anoth upon hi departur we again enter into a debat upon the merit of our young landlord as he direct hi look and convers to olivia it wa no longer doubt but that she wa the object that induc him to be our visitor nor did she seem to be much displeas at the innoc railleri of her brother and sister upon thi occas even deborah herself seem to share the glori of the

heaven will never arraign him for what he think but for what he doe everi man ha a thousand viciou thought which aris without hi power to suppress think freeli of religion may be involuntari with thi

morn we were again visit by mr burchel though i began for certain reason to be displeas with the frequenc of hi return but i could not refus him my compani and firesid it is true hi labor more than requit hi entertain sor he wrought among us with vigor and either in the meadow or at the hayrick put himself foremost besid he had alway someth amus to say that lessen our toil and wa at onc so out of the way and yet so sensibl that i love laugh at and piti him my onli dislik aros from an attach he discov to my daughter he would in a jest manner call her hi littl mistress and when he bought each of the girl a set of ribband her wa the finest i knew not how but he everi day seem to becom more amiabl hi wit to improv and hi simplic to assum the superior air of wisdom our famili dine in the

opposit hedg the familiar redbreast came and peck the crumb from our hand and everi sound seem but the echo of tranquil i never sit thu say sophia but i think of the two lover so sweetli describ by mr gay who were struck dead in each other arm under a barley mow there is someth so pathet in the descript that i have read it an hundr time with new raptur in my opinion cri my son the finest stroke in that descript are much below those in the aci and galatea of ovid the roman poet understand the use of contrast better and upon that figur art manag all strength in the pathet depend it is remark cri mr burchel that both the poet you mention have equal contribut to introduc a fals tast into their respect countri by load all their line with epithet men of littl geniu found them most easili imit in their defect and english poetri like that in the latter empir of rome is noth at present but a combin of luxuri imag without plot or connect a string of epithet that improv the sound without carri on the sens but perhap madam while i thu reprehend other you will think it just that i should give them an opportun to retali and inde i have made thi remark onli to have an opportun of introduc to the

report and so near startl my daughter and i could perceiv that sophia in the fright had thrown herself into mr burchel arm for protect the gentleman came up and ask pardon for have disturb us affirm that he wa ignor of our be so near he therefor sat down by my youngest daughter and sportsman like offer her what he had kill that morn she wa go to refus but a privat look from her mother soon induc her to correct the mistak and accept hi present though with some reluct my wife as usual discov her pride in a whisper observ that sophi had made a conquest of the chaplain as well as her sister had of the squir i suspect howev with more probabl that her affect were place upon a differ object the chaplain errand wa to inform us that mr thornhil had provid music and refresh and intend that night give the young ladi a ball by moonlight on the grassplot befor our door nor can i deni continu he but i have an interest in be first to deliv thi messag as i expect for my reward to be honor with miss sophi hand as a partner to thi my girl repli that she should have no object if she could do it with honor but here continu she is a gentleman look at mr burchel who ha been my companion in the task for the day and it is fit he should share in it amus mr burchel return her a compliment for her intent but resign her up to the chaplain ad that he wa to go that night five mile be invit to an harvest supper hi refus appear to me a littl extraordinari nor could i conceiv how so sensibl a girl as my youngest could thu prefer a middl age man of broken fortun to a sprightli young fellow of twentytwo but as men are most capabl of distinguish merit in women so the ladi often form the truest judgment upon us the two sex seem place as spi upon each other and are furnish with differ abil adapt for mutual inspect chap ix two ladi of great distinct introduc superior fineri ever seem to confer superior breed mr burchel had scarc taken leav and sophia consent to danc with the chaplain when my littl one came run out to tell us that the squir wa come with a crowd of compani upon our return we found our landlord with a coupl of under gentlemen and two young ladi richli dress whom he introduc as women of veri great distinct and fashion from town we happen not to have chair enough for the whole compani but mr thornhil immedi propos that everi gentleman should sit in a ladi lap thi i posit object to notwithstand a look of disapprob from my wife mose wa therefor dispatch to borrow a coupl of chair and as we were in want of ladi also to make up a set at countri danc the two gentlemen went with him in quest of a coupl of partner chair and partner were soon provid the gentlemen return with my neighbor flamborough rosi daughter flaunt with red topknot but there wa an unlucki circumst which wa not advert to though the miss flamborough were reckon the veri best dancer in the parish and understood the jig and the roundabout to perfect yet they were total unacquaint with countri danc thi at first discompos us howev after a littl shove and drag they began to go merrili on our music consist of two fiddl with a pipe and tabor the moon shone bright mr thornhil and my eldest daughter led up the ball to the great delight of the spectat for the neighbor hear what wa go forward came flock about us my girl move with so much grace and vivac that my wife could not avoid discov the pride of her heart by assur me that though the littl chit did it so cleverli all the step were stolen from herself the ladi of the town strove hard to be equal easi but without success they swam sprawl languish and frisk but all would not do the gazer inde own that it wa fine but neighbor flamborough observ that miss livi feet seem as pat to the music as it echo after the danc had continu about an hour the two ladi who were apprehens of catch cold move to break up the ball one of them i thought express her sentiment upon thi occas in a veri coars manner when she observ that by the live jingo she wa all of a muck of sweat upon our return to the hous we found a veri eleg cold supper which mr thornhil had order to be brought with him the convers at thi time wa more reserv than befor the two ladi threw my girl quit into the shade for they would talk of noth but high life and high live compani with other fashion topic such as pictur tast shakespear and the music glass it is true they onc or twice mortifi us sensibl by slip out an oath but that appear to me as the surest symptom of their distinct though i am sinc inform swear is now perfectli unfashion their fineri howev threw a veil over ani gross in their convers my daughter seem to regard their superior accomplish with envi and what appear amiss wa ascrib to tiptop qualiti breed but the condescens of the ladi wa still superior to their other accomplish one of them observ that had miss olivia seen a littl more of the world it would greatli improv her to which the other ad that a singl winter in town would make her littl sophia quit anoth thing my wife warmli assent to both ad that there wa noth she more ardent wish than to give her girl a singl winter polish to thi i could not help repli that their breed wa alreadi superior to their fortun and that greater refin would onli serv to make their poverti ridicul and give them a tast for pleasur they had no right to possess and what pleasur cri mr thornhil do they not deserv who have so much in their power to bestow as for my part continu he my fortun is pretti larg love liberti and pleasur are my maxim but curs me if a settlement of half my estat could give my charm olivia pleasur it should be her and the onli favor i would ask in return would be to add myself to the benefit i wa not such a stranger to the world as to be ignor that thi wa the fashion cant to disguis the insol of the basest propos but i made an effort to suppress my resent sir cri i the famili which you now condescend to favor with your compani ha been bred with as nice a sens of honor as you ani attempt to injur that may be attend with veri danger consequ honor sir is our onli possess at present and of that
