correspond and offici paper – thoma jefferson juli monticello samuel kerchev to samuel kerchev j mss monticello juli sir —i duli receiv your favor of june the th with the copi of the letter on the call a convent on which you are pleas to ask my opinion i have not been in the habit of mysteri reserv on ani subject nor of button up my opinion within my own doublet on the contrari while in public servic especi i thought the public entitl to frank and intim to know whom they employ but i am now retir i resign myself as a passeng with confid to those at present at the helm and ask but for rest peac and good will the question you propos on equal represent ha becom a parti one in which i wish to take no public share yet if it be ask for your own satisfact onli and not to be quot befor the public i have no motiv to withhold it and the less from you as it coincid with your own at the birth of our republ i commit that opinion to the world in the draught of a constitut annex to the note on virginia in which a provis wa insert for a represent perman equal the infanc of the subject at that moment and our inexperi of selfgovern occas gross departur in that draught from genuin republican canon in truth the abus of monarchi had so much fill all the space of polit contempl that we imagin everyth republican which wa not monarchi we had not yet penetr to the mother principl that govern are republican onli in proport as they embodi the will of their peopl and execut it henc our first constitut had realli no lead principl in them but experi and reflect have but more and more confirm me in the particular import of the equal represent then propos on that point then i am entir in sentiment with your letter and onli lament that a copyright of your pamphlet prevent their appear in the newspap where alon they would be gener read and produc gener effect the present vacanc too of other matter would give them place in everi paper and bring the question home to everi man conscienc but inequ of represent in both hous of our legislatur is not the onli republican heresi in thi first essay of our revolutionari patriot at form a constitut for let it be agre that a govern is republican in proport as everi member compos it ha hi equal voic in the direct of it concern not inde in person which would be impractic beyond the limit of a citi or small township but by repres chosen by himself and respons to him at short period and let us bring to the test of thi canon everi branch of our constitut in the legislatur the hous of repres is chosen by less than half the peopl and not at all in proport to those who do choos the senat are still more disproportion and for long term of irrespons in the execut the governor is entir independ of the choic of the peopl and of their control hi council equal so and at best but a fifth wheel to a wagon in the judiciari the judg of the highest court are depend on none but themselv in england where judg were name and remov at the will of an hereditari execut from which branch most misrul wa fear and ha flow it wa a great point gain by fix them for life to make them independ of that execut but in a govern found on the public will thi principl oper in an opposit direct and against that will there too they were still remov on a concurr of the execut and legisl branch but we have made them independ of the nation itself they are irremov but by their own bodi for ani deprav of conduct and even by their own bodi for the imbecil of dotag the justic of the inferior court are selfchosen are for life and perpetu their own bodi in success forev so that a faction onc possess themselv of the bench of a counti can never be broken up but hold their counti in chain forev indissolubl yet these justic are the real execut as well as judiciari in all our minor and most ordinari concern they tax us at will fill the offic of sheriff the most import of all the execut offic of the counti name nearli all our militari leader which leader onc name are remov but by themselv the juri our judg of all fact and of law when they choos it are not select by the peopl nor amen to them they are chosen by an offic name by the court and execut chosen did i say pick up by the sheriff from the loung of the court yard after everyth respect ha retir from it where then is our republican to be found not in our constitut certainli but mere in the spirit of our peopl that would oblig even a despot to govern us republicanli owe to thi spirit and to noth in the form of our constitut all thing have gone well but thi fact so triumphantli misquot by the enemi of reform is not the fruit of our constitut but ha prevail in spite of it our functionari have done well becaus gener honest men if ani were not so they fear to show it but it will be said it is easier to find fault than to amend them i do not think their amend so difficult as is pretend onli lay down true principl and adher to them inflex do not be frighten into their surrend by the alarm of the timid or the croak of wealth against the ascend of the peopl if experi be call for appeal to that of our fifteen or twenti govern for forti year and show me where the peopl have done half the mischief in these forti year that a singl despot would have done in a singl year or show half the riot and rebellion the crime and the punish which have taken place in ani singl nation under kingli govern dure the same period the true foundat of republican govern is the equal right of everi citizen in hi person and properti and in their manag tri by thi as a talli everi provis of our constitut and see if it hang directli on the will of the peopl reduc your legislatur to a conveni number for full but orderli discuss let everi man who fight or pay exercis hi just and equal right in their elect submit them to approb or reject at short interv let the execut be chosen in the same way and for the same term by those whose agent he is to be and leav no screen of a council behind which to skulk from respons it ha been thought that the peopl are not compet elector of judg learn in the law but i do not know that thi is true and if doubt we should follow principl in thi as in mani other elect they would be guid by reput which would not err often perhap than the present mode of appoint in one state of the union at least it ha long been tri and with the most satisfactori success the judg of connecticut have been chosen by the peopl everi six month for nearli two centuri and i believ there ha hardli ever been an instanc of chang so power is the curb of incess respons if prejudic howev deriv from a monarch institut is still to prevail against the vital elect principl of our own and if the exist exampl among ourselv of period elect of judg by the peopl be still mistrust let us at least not adopt the evil and reject the good of the english preced let us retain amov on the concurr of the execut and legisl branch and nomin by the execut alon nomin to offic is an execut function to give it to the legislatur as we do is a violat of the principl of the separ of power it swerv the member from correct by temptat to intrigu for offic themselv and to a corrupt barter of vote and destroy respons by divid it among a multitud by leav nomin in it proper place among execut function the principl of the distribut of power is preserv and respons weigh with it heaviest forc on a singl head the organ of our counti administr may be thought more difficult but follow principl and the knot unti itself divid the counti into ward of such size as that everi citizen can attend when call on and act in person ascrib to them the govern of their ward in all thing relat to themselv exclus a justic chosen by themselv in each a constabl a militari compani a patrol a school the care of their own poor their own portion of the public road the choic of one or more juror to serv in some court and the deliveri within their own ward of their own vote for all elect offic of higher sphere will reliev the counti administr of nearli all it busi will have it better done and by make everi citizen an act member of the govern and in the offic nearest and most interest to him will attach him by hi strongest feel to the independ of hi countri and it republican constitut the justic thu chosen by everi ward would constitut the counti court would do it judiciari busi direct road and bridg levi counti and poor rate and administ all the matter of common interest to the whole countri these ward call township in new england are the vital principl of their govern and have prove themselv the wisest invent ever devis by the wit of man for the perfect exercis of selfgovern and for it preserv we should thu marshal our govern into the gener feder republ for all concern foreign and feder that of the state for what relat to our own citizen exclus the counti republ for the duti and concern of the counti and the ward republ for the small and yet numer and interest concern of the neighborhood and in govern as well as in everi other busi of life it is by divis and subdivis of duti alon that all matter great and small can be manag to perfect and the whole is cement by give to everi citizen person a part in the administr of the public affair the sum of these amend is gener suffrag equal represent in the legislatur an execut chosen by the peopl judg elect or amov justic juror and sheriff elect ward divis and period amend of the constitut i have thrown out these as loos head of amend for consider and correct and their object is to secur selfgovern by the republican of our constitut as well as by the spirit of the peopl and to nourish and perpetu that spirit i am not among those who fear the peopl they and not the rich are our depend for continu freedom and to preserv their independ we must not let our ruler load us with perpetu debt we must make our elect between economi and liberti or profus and servitud if we run into such debt as that we must be tax in our meat and in our drink in our necessari and our comfort in our labor and our amus for our call and our creed as the peopl of england are our peopl like them must come to labor sixteen hour in the twentyfour give the earn of fifteen of these to the govern for their debt and daili expens and the sixteenth be insuffici to afford us bread we must live as they now do on oatmeal and potato have no time to think no mean of call the mismanag to account but be glad to obtain subsist by hire ourselv to rivet their chain on the neck of our fellowsuffer our landhold too like their retain inde the titl and stewardship of estat call their but held realli in trust for the treasuri must wander like their in foreign countri and be content with penuri obscur exil and the glori of the nation thi exampl read to us the salutari lesson that privat fortun are destroy by public as well as by privat extravag and thi is the tendenc of all human govern a departur from principl in one instanc becom a preced for a second that second for a third and so on till the bulk of the societi is reduc to be mere automaton of miseri and to have no sensibl left but for sin and suffer then begin inde the bellum omnium in omnia which some philosoph observ to be so gener in thi world have mistaken it for the natur instead of the abus state of man and the fore hors of thi fright team is public debt taxat follow that and in it train wretched and oppress some men look at constitut with sanctimoni rever and deem them like the arc of the coven too sacr to be touch they ascrib to the men of the preced age a wisdom more than human and suppos what they did to be beyond amend i knew that age well i belong to it and labor with it it deserv well of it countri it wa veri like the present but without the experi of the present and forti year of experi in govern is worth a centuri of bookread and thi they would say themselv were they to rise from the dead i am certainli not an advoc for frequent and untri chang in law and constitut i think moder imperfect had better be born with becaus when onc known we accommod ourselv to them and find practic mean of correct their ill effect but i know also that law and institut must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becom more develop more enlighten as new discoveri are made new truth disclos and manner and opinion chang with the chang of circumst institut must advanc also and keep pace with the time we might as well requir a man to wear still the coat which fit him when a boy as civil societi to remain ever under the regimen of their barbar ancestor it is thi preposter idea which ha late delug europ in blood their monarch instead of wise yield to the gradual chang of circumst of favor progress accommod to progress improv have clung to old abus entrench themselv behind steadi habit and oblig their subject to seek through blood and violenc rash and ruinou innov which had they been refer to the peac deliber and collect wisdom of the nation would have been put into accept and salutari form let us follow no such exampl nor weakli believ that one gener is not as capabl as anoth of take care of itself and of order it own affair let us as our sister state have done avail ourselv of our reason and experi to correct the crude essay of our first and unexperienc although wise virtuou and wellmean council and lastli let us provid in our constitut for it revis at state period what these period should be natur herself indic by the european tabl of mortal of the adult live at ani one moment of time a major will be dead in about nineteen year at the end of that period then a new major is come into place or in other word a new gener each gener is as independ as the one preced as that wa of all which had gone befor it ha then like them a right to choos for itself the form of govern it believ most promot of it own happi consequ to accommod to the circumst in which it find itself that receiv from it predecessor and it is for the peac and good of mankind that a solemn opportun of do thi everi nineteen or twenti year should be provid by the constitut so that it may be hand on with period repair from gener to gener to the end of time if anyth human can so long endur it is now forti year sinc the constitut of virginia wa form the same tabl inform us that within that period twothird of the adult then live are now dead have then the remain third even if they had the wish the right to hold in obedi to their will and to law heretofor made by them the other twothird who with themselv compos the present mass of adult if they have not who ha the dead but the dead have no right they are noth and noth can not own someth where there is no substanc there can be no accid thi corpor globe and everyth upon it belong to it present corpor inhabit dure their gener they alon have a right to direct what is the concern of themselv alon and to declar the law of that direct and thi declar can onli be made by their major that major then ha a right to deput repres to a convent and to make the constitut what they think will be the best for themselv but how collect their voic thi is the real difficulti if invit by privat author or counti or district meet these divis are so larg that few will attend and their voic will be imperfectli or fals pronounc here then would be one of the advantag of the ward divis i have propos the mayor of everi ward on a question like the present would call hi ward togeth take the simpl yea or nay of it member convey these to the counti court who would hand on those of all it ward to the proper gener author and the voic of the whole peopl would be thu fairli fulli and peaceabl express discuss and decid by the common reason of the societi if thi avenu be shut to the call of suffer it will make itself heard through that of forc and we shall go on as other nation are do in the endless circl of oppress rebellion reform and oppress rebellion reform again and so on forev these sir are my opinion of the govern we see among men and of the principl by which alon we may prevent our own from fall into the same dread track i have given them at greater length than your letter call for but i can not say thing by halv and i confid them to your honor so to use them as to preserv me from the gridiron of the public paper if you shall approv and enforc them as you have done that of equal represent they may do some good if not keep them to yourself as the effus of wither age and useless time i shall with not the less truth

eulog of him and a proposit to publish hi life in one vo volum i have no doubt but that what he ha written of himself dure the portion of the revolutionari period he pass with us would furnish some good materi for our histori of which there is alreadi a wonder scarciti but where thi undertak of hi histori is to get hi materi i know not nor who he is i have receiv mr carmigniani letter request

equal to the amount of our whole incom and a season among the most unfavor to agricultur ever known made it a year of war as to it pressur oblig me to postpon the commenc of the annual remitt until the ensu spring the receipt of your letter and of mr carmigniani onli render it necessari to chang the address of mine the sale wa made dure the war when the remitt of the price wa imposs nor wa there here ani depot for it at that time which would have been safe profit and readi to repay the princip on demand i retain it therefor myself to avoid the risk of the bank to yield the profit the treasuri could have given and to admit a command of the princip at a shorter term it wa of cours therefor that i must invest it in some way to countervail the interest and be but a farmer receiv rent and profit but onc a year it will take time to restor it to the form of money again which i explain to mr mazzei in the letter i wrote to him at the time exchang is much against us at present owe to the immens import made immedi after peac and to the redund of our paper medium the legislatur have gener requir the bank to call in thi redund they are accordingli curtail discount collect their debt so that by the spring when the first remitt will be made our medium will be greatli reduc and it valu increas proportion the crop of thi year too when export will so far lessen the foreign debt the

breviti admit no superflu word the essenti fact in the two inscript propos are these found —burnt by a british armi —restor by congress the reason for thi breviti are that the letter must be of extraordinari magnitud to be read from below that littl space is allow them be usual put into a pediment or in a frize or on a small tablet on the wall and in our case a third reason may be ad that no passion can be imput to thi inscript everi word be justifi from the most classic exampl but a question of more import is whether there should be one at all the barbar of the conflagr will immort that of the nation it will place them forev in degrad comparison with the execr bonapart who in possess of almost everi capitol in europ injur no one of thi histori will take care which all will read while our inscript will be seen by few great britain in her pride and ascend ha certainli hate and despis us beyond everi earthli object her hatr may remain but the hour of her contempt is pass and is succeed by dread not at present but a distant and deep one it is the greater as she feel herself plung into an abyss of ruin from which no human mean point out an issu we also have more reason to hate her than ani nation on earth but she is not now an object for hatr she is fall from her transcend sphere which all men ought to have wish but not that she should lose all place among nation it is for the interest of all that she should be maintain nearli on a par with other member of the republ of nation her power absorb into that of ani other would be an object of dread to all and to us more than all becaus we are access to her alon and through her alon the armi of bonapart with the fleet of britain would chang the aspect of our destini under these prospect should we perpetu hatr against her should we not on the contrari begin to open ourselv to other and more ration disposit it is not improb that the circumst of the war and her own circumst may have brought her wise men to begin to view
