swirl around him taran caught hi breath in horror each huntsman bore a crimson brand on hi forehead the sight of it fill taran with dread for he knew the strang symbol must be a mark of arawn power he fought against the fear that chill hi heart and drain hi strength behind him he heard eilonwi cri out then he wa seiz by the belt and drag from melynla a huntsman tumbl with him to the ground close grappl taran could not bring hi sword into play the huntsman rais himself abruptli and thrust a knee against taran chest the warrior eye glint he bare hi teeth in a horribl grin as he rais a dagger the huntsman voic froze in the midst of a shout of triumph and he suddenli fell backward ellidyr see taran plight had brought down hi sword in one power blow thrust the lifeless bodi asid he heav taran to hi feet for an instant their eye met ellidyr face below a bloodstain mat of tawni hair held a look of scorn and pride he seem about to speak but turn quickli without a word and ran toward the fray in the grove there wa a sudden moment of silenc then a long sigh rippl among the attack as though each man had drawn breath taran heart sank as he rememb gwydion warn with a roar the huntsmen renew their attack with even greater feroc dash themselv against the struggl companion in a surg of furi from astrid melynla eilonwi fit an arrow to her bow taran hurri to her side do not slay them he

tree dri leav flew in a whirlwind beneath churn hoov as the stallion sped to the brown crest of a hill for a moment taran dare to glanc behind him below a number of huntsmen had separ from the band and with great stride held to the track of the flee companion they were swift even as gwydion had warn in their jacket of bristl skin they seem wild beast rather than men as they spread in a wide arc across the slope as they ran they call out to one anoth in a weird wordless cri that echo almost from the brood crag of dark gate itself cold with dread taran urg melynla on clump of grass rose high among fallen tree trunk and wither branch ahead lluagor gallop down an embank adaon had brought them to a river bed dark water lay in a few shallow pool but for the most part it wa dri and the clay bank rose high enough to offer conceal adaon rein in lluagor and cast a quick glanc behind him to make sure all had follow then beckon the companion to move forward they set off at a rapid gait the river bed wound it way through highstand fir and tatter alder but after a littl time the embank fell away and a spars forest becam their onli cover although melynla did not slacken speed taran saw the
