honor design it signifi the minist or benefactor of a templ accord to the dictionari of trévoux some antiquari have discov inscript in which roman citizen of consider consequ assum the titl of fanaticu in cicero orat pro domo sua a passag occur in which the word fanaticu appear to me of difficult explan the sediti and libertin clodiu who had brought about the banish of cicero for have save the republ had not onli plunder and demolish the hous of that great man but in order that cicero might never be abl to return to hi citi resid he procur the consecr of the land on which it stood and the priest had erect there a templ to liberti or rather to slaveri in which cæsar pompey crassu and clodiu then held the republ thu in all age ha religion been employ as an instrument in the persecut of great men when at length in a happier period cicero wa recal he plead befor the peopl in order to obtain the restor of the ground on which hi hous had stood and the rebuild of the hous at the expens of the roman peopl he thu express himself in the speech against clodiu oratio pro domo sua chap xl adspicit adspicit pontific hominem religiosum monet eum modum quemdam ess religioni nimium ess superstitiosum non oporter quid tibi necess fuit anili superstition homo fanatic sacrificium quod aliænæ domi fieret inviser doe the word fanaticu as use abov mean senseless pitiless abomin fanat accord to the present accept or doe it rather impli the piou religi man the frequent and consecr of templ is it use here in the mean of decid censur or iron prais i do not feel myself compet to determin but will give a translat of the passag behold reverend pontiff behold the piou man suggest to him that even religion itself ha it limit that a man ought not to be so overscrupul what occas wa there for a sacr person a fanat like yourself to have recours to the superstit of an old woman in order to assist at a sacrific perform in anoth person hous cicero allud here to the mysteri of the bona dea which had been profan by clodiu who in the disguis of a femal and accompani by an old woman had obtain an introduct to them with a view to an assign with cæsar wife the passag is in consequ evid iron cicero call clodiu a religi man and the ironi requir to be kept up through the whole passag he employ term of honor mean more clearli to exhibit clodiuss infami it appear to me therefor that he use the word in question fanaticu in it respect sens as a word convey the idea of a sacrific a piou man a zealou minist of templ the term might be afterward appli to those who believ themselv inspir by the god who bestow a somewhat curiou gift on the interpret of their will by ordain that in order to be a prophet the loss of reason is indispens le dieux à leur interprèt ont fait un étrang

exclaim the eye of god is at thi moment upon you sacrific everi mere human possess and feel fight the battl of the lord—and they rush to the fight fanatic is in refer to superstit what delirium is to

equal labor under morbid furi with diaz the most strike exampl of fanatic is that exhibit on the night of st bartholomew when the peopl of pari rush from hous to hous to stab slaughter throw out of

of malchu and at anoth even deni me be more lenient and decor and take neither the properti nor the ear of ani one for fear of thine own fever it is not as a physician but as a patient that i wish to say a word or two on fever we can not help now and then speak of our enemi and thi one ha been attack me for more than twenti year not fréron himself ha been more implac i ask pardon of sydenham who defin fever to be an effort of natur labor with all it power to expel the peccant matter we might thu defin smallpox measl diarrhœa vomit cutan erupt and twenti other diseas but if thi physician defin

acut fever these are the word of a great master but he set out with acknowledg that the natur of fever is profoundli hidden he doe not tell us what that secret principl is which develop itself at regular period in intermitt fever—what that intern poison is which after the laps of a day is renewed—wher that flame is which die and reviv at state moment we know fairli well that we are liabl to fever after excess or in unseason weather we know that quinin judici administ will cure it thi is quit enough the how we do not know everi anim that doe not perish suddenli die by fever the fever seem to be the inevit effect of the fluid that compos the blood or that which is in the place of blood the structur of everi anim prove to natur philosoph that it must at all time have enjoy a veri short life theologian have held as have promulg other opinion it is not for us to examin thi question the philosoph and physician have been right in sensu humano and the theologian in sensu divino it is said in deuteronomi xxviii that if the jew do not serv the law they shall be smitten with a consumpt and with a fever and with an inflamm and with an extrem burn it is onli in deuteronomi and in molièr physician in spite of himself that peopl have been threaten with fever it seem imposs that fever should not be an accid natur to an anim bodi in which so mani fluid circul just as it is imposs for an anim bodi not to be crush by the fall of a rock blood make life it furnish the viscera the limb the skin the veri extrem of the hair and nail with the fluid the humor proper for them thi blood

with which he may row for some time on the sea of the world when diseas doe not swallow him up it is ask how is it that natur ha abandon the anim her work to so mani horribl diseas almost alway

and if they are incoher and heap togeth without choic are they anyth better than dream you will possibl tell me that there are ancient fiction which are veri incoher without ingenu and even absurd
