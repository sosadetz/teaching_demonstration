more wisdom than appear upon my outsid and as we jogg on either laugh with me or at me or in short do ani thing onli keep your temper chap vii in the same villag where my father and my mother dwelt dwelt also a thin upright motherli notabl good old bodi of a midwif who with the help of a littl plain good sens and some year full employ in her busi in which she had all along trust littl to her own effort and a great deal to those of dame natur had acquir in her way no small degre of reput in the world by which word world need i in thi place inform your worship that i would be understood to mean no more of it than a small circl describ upon the circl of the great world of four english mile diamet or thereabout of which the cottag where the good old woman live is suppos to be the center she had been left it seem a widow in great distress with three or four small children in her fortyseventh year and as she wa at that time a person of decent carriag grave deport a woman moreov of few word and withal an object of compass whose distress and silenc under it call out the louder for a friendli lift the wife of the parson of the parish wa touch with piti and have often lament an inconveni to which her husband flock had for mani year been expos inasmuch as there wa no such thing as a midwif of ani kind or degre to be got at let the case have been never so urgent within less than six or seven long mile ride which said seven long mile in dark night and dismal road the countri thereabout be noth but a deep clay wa almost equal to fourteen and that in effect wa sometim next to have no midwif at all it came into her head that it would be do as season a kind to the whole parish as to the poor creatur herself to get her a littl instruct in some of the plain principl of the busi in order to set her up in it as no woman thereabout wa better qualifi to execut the plan she had form than herself the gentlewoman veri charit undertook it and have great influenc over the femal part of the parish she found no difficulti in effect it to the utmost of her wish in truth the parson join hi interest with hi wife in the whole affair and in order to do thing as they should be and give the poor soul as good a titl by law to practic as hi wife had given by institut he cheer paid the fee for the ordinari licens himself amount in the whole to the sum of eighteen shill and fourpenc so that betwixt them both the good woman wa fulli invest in the real and corpor possess of her offic togeth with all it right member and appurten whatsoev these last word you must know were not accord to the old form in which such licens faculti and power usual ran which in like case had heretofor been grant to the sisterhood but it wa accord to a neat formula of didiu hi own devis who have a particular turn for take to piec and new frame over again all kind of instrument in that way not onli hit upon thi dainti amend but coaxd mani of the old licens matron in the neighborhood to open their faculti afresh in order to have thi whimwham of hi insert i own i never could envi didiu in these kind of fanci of hi but everi man to hi own tast did not dr kunastrokiu that great man at hi leisur hour take the greatest delight imagin in comb of ass tail and pluck the dead hair out with hi teeth though he had tweezer alway in hi pocket nay if you come to that sir have not the wisest of men in all age not except solomon himself have they not had their hobbyhors their run hors their coin and their cockleshel their drum and their trumpet their fiddl their pallet their maggot and their butterfli and so long as a man ride hi hobbyhors peaceabl and quietli along the king highway and neither compel you or me to get up behind him pray sir what have either you or i to do with it chap viii degustibu non est disputandum that is there is no disput against hobbyhors and for my part i seldom do nor could i with ani sort of grace had i been an enemi to them at the bottom for happen at certain interv and chang of the moon to be both fiddler and painter accord as the fli sting be it known to you that i keep a coupl of pad myself upon which in their turn nor do i care who know it i frequent ride out and take the air though sometim to my shame be it spoken i take somewhat longer journi than what a wise man would think altogeth right but the truth is i am not a wise man and besid am a mortal of so littl consequ in the world it is not much matter what i do so i seldom fret or fume at all about it nor doe it much disturb my rest when i see such great lord and tall personag as hereaft follow such for instanc as my lord a b c d e f g h i k l m n o p q and so on all of a row mount upon their sever hors some with larg stirrup get on in a more grave and sober pace other on the contrari tuck up to their veri chin with whip across their mouth scour and scamper it away like so mani littl partycolor devil astrid a mortgag and as if some of them were resolv to break their neck so much the better say i to myself for in case the worst should happen the world will make a shift to do excel well without them and for the rest whi god speed them even let them ride on without opposit from me for were their lordship unhors thi veri night it is ten to one but that mani of them would be wors mount by one half befor tomorrow morn not one of these instanc therefor can be said to break in upon my rest but there is an instanc which i own put me off my guard and that is when i see one born for great action and what is still more for hi honor whose natur ever inclin him to good one when i behold such a one my lord like yourself whose principl and conduct are as gener and nobl as hi blood and whom for that reason a corrupt world can not spare one moment when i see such a one my lord mount though it is but for a minut beyond the time which my love to my countri ha prescrib to him and my zeal for hi glori wish then my lord i ceas to be a philosoph and in the first transport of an honest impati i wish the hobbyhors with all hi fratern at the devil my lord i maintain thi to be a dedic notwithstand it singular in the three great essenti of matter form and place i beg therefor you will accept it as such and that you will permit me to lay it with the most respect humil at your lordship feet when you are upon them which you can be when you pleas and that is my lord when ever there is occas for it and i will add to the best purpos too i have the honor to be my lord your lordship most obedi and most devot and most humbl servant tristram shandi chap ix i solemnli declar to all mankind that the abov dedic wa made for no one princ prelat pope or potent duke marqui earl viscount or baron of thi or ani other realm in christendom nor ha it yet been hawkd about or offer publicli or privat directli or indirectli to ani one person or personag great or small but is honestli a true virginded untri on upon ani soul live i labor thi point so particularli mere to remov ani offens or object which might aris against it from the manner in which i propos to make the most of it which is the put it up fairli to public sale which i now do everi author ha a way of hi own in bring hi point to bear for my own part as i hate chaffer and higgl for a few guinea in a dark entri i resolv within myself from the veri begin to deal squar and openli with your great folk in thi affair and tri whether i should not come off the better by it if therefor there is ani one duke marqui earl viscount or baron in these hi majesti dominion who stand in need of a tight genteel dedic and whom the abov will suit for by the bye unless it suit in some degre i will not part with it it is much at hi servic for fifti guinea which i am posit is twenti guinea less than it ought to be afford for by ani man of geniu my lord if you examin it over again it is far from be a gross piec of daub as some dedic are the design your lordship see is good the color transpar the draw not amiss or to speak more like a man of scienc and measur my piec in the painter scale divid into i believ my lord the outlin will turn out as the composit as the color as the express and a half and the design if i may be allow my lord to understand my own design and suppos absolut perfect in design to be as i think it can not well fall short of besid all thi there is keep in it and the dark stroke in the hobbyhors which is a secondari figur and a kind of background to the whole give great forc to the princip light in your own figur and make it come off wonder and besid there is an air of origin in the tout ensembl be pleas my good lord to order the sum to be paid into the hand of mr dodsley for the benefit of the author and in the next edit care shall be taken that thi chapter be expung and your lordship titl distinct arm and good action be place at the front of the preced chapter all which from the word de gustibu non est disputandum and whatev els in thi book relat to hobbyhors but no more shall stand dedic to your lordship the rest i dedic to the moon who by the bye of all the patron or matron i can think of ha most power to set my book ago and make the world run mad after it bright goddess if thou art not too busi with candid and miss cunegund affair take tristram shandi under thi protect also chap x whatev degre of small merit the act of benign in favor of the midwif might justli claim or in whom that claim truli rest at first sight seem not veri materi to thi histori certain howev it wa that the gentlewoman the parson wife did run away at that time with the whole of it and yet for my life i can not help think but that the parson himself though he had not the good fortun to hit upon the design first yet as he heartili concur in it the moment it wa laid befor him and as heartili part with hi money to carri it into execut had a claim to some share of it if not to a full half of whatev honor wa due to it the world at that time wa pleas to determin the matter otherwis lay down the book and i will allow you half a day to give a probabl guess at the ground of thi procedur be it known then that for about five year befor the date of the midwif licens of which you have had so circumstanti an account the parson we have to do with had made himself a countrytalk by a breach of all decorum which he had commit against himself hi station and hi offic and that wa in never appear better or otherwis mount than upon a lean sorri jackass of a hors valu about one pound fifteen shill who to shorten all descript of him wa full brother to rosinant as far as similitud congeni could make him for he answer hi descript to a hairbreadth in everi thing except that i do not rememb it is ani where said that rosinant wa broken wind and that moreov rosinant as is the happi of most spanish hors fat or lean wa undoubtedli a hors at all point i know veri well that the hero hors wa a hors of chast deport which may have given ground for a contrari opinion but it is as certain at the same time that rosinant contin as may be demonstr from the adventur of the yanguesian carrier proceed from no bodili defect or caus whatsoev but from the temper and orderli current of hi blood and let me tell you madam there is a great deal of veri good chastiti in the world in behalf of which you could not say more for your life let that be as it may as my purpos is to do exact justic to everi creatur brought upon the stage of thi dramat work i could not stifl thi distinct in favor of don quixot hors in all other point the parson hors i say wa just such anoth for he wa as lean and as lank and as sorri a jade as humil herself could have bestrid in the estim of here and there a man of weak judgment it wa greatli in the parson power to have help the figur of thi hors of hi for he wa master of a veri handsom demipeakd saddl quilt on the seat with green plush garnish with a doubl row of silverhead stud and a nobl pair of shine brass stirrup with a hous altogeth suitabl of gray superfin cloth with an edg of black lace termin in a deep black silk fring poudr dor all which he had purchas in the pride and prime of hi life togeth with a grand emboss bridl ornament at all point as it should be but not care to banter hi beast he had hung all these up behind hi studi door and in lieu of them had serious befit him with just such a bridl and such a saddl as the figur and valu of such a steed might well and truli deserv in the sever salli about hi parish and in the neighbor visit to the gentri who live around him you will easili comprehend that the parson so appoint would both hear and see enough to keep hi philosophi from rust to speak the truth he never could enter a villag but he caught the attent of both old and young labor stood still as he pass the bucket hung suspend in the middl of the well the spinningwheel forgot it round even chuckfarth and shufflecap themselv stood gape till he had got out of sight and as hi movement wa not of the quickest he had gener time enough upon hi hand to make hi observ to hear the groan of the seriou and the laughter of the lightheart all which he bore with excel tranquil hi charact wa he love a jest in hi heart and as he saw himself in the true point of ridicul he would say he could not be angri with other for see him in a light in which he so strongli saw himself so that to hi friend who knew hi foibl wa not the love of money and who therefor made the less scrupl in banter the extravag of hi humor instead of give the true caus he chose rather to join in the laugh against himself and as he never carri one singl ounc of flesh upon hi own bone be altogeth as spare a figur as hi beast he would sometim insist upon it that the hors wa as good as the rider deserv that they were centaurlik both of a piec at other time and in other mood when hi spirit were abov the temptat of fals wit he would say he found himself go off fast in a consumpt and with great graviti would pretend he could not bear the sight of a fat hors without a deject of heart and a sensibl alter in hi puls and that he had made choic of the lean one he rode upon not onli to keep himself in counten but in spirit at differ time he would give fifti humour and opposit reason for ride a meekspirit jade of a brokenwind hors prefer to one of mettl for on such a one he could sit mechan and medit as delight de vanit mundi et fuga saeculi as with the advantag of a death head befor him that in all other exercit he could spend hi time as he rode slowli along to as much account as in hi studi that he could draw up an argument in hi sermon or a hole in hi breech as steadili on the one as in the other that brisk trot and slow argument like wit and judgment were two incompat movement but that upon hi steed he could unit and reconcil everi thing he could compos hi sermon he could compos hi cough and in case natur gave a call that way he could likewis compos himself to sleep in short the parson upon such encount would assign ani caus but the true caus and he withheld the true one onli out of a niceti of temper becaus he thought it did honor to him but the truth of the stori wa as follow in the first year of thi gentleman life and about the time when the superb saddl and bridl were purchas by him it had been hi manner or vaniti or call it what you will to run into the opposit extrem in the languag of the counti where he dwelt he wa said to have love a good hors and gener had one of the best in the whole parish stand in hi stabl alway readi for saddl and as the nearest midwif as i told you did not live nearer to the villag than seven mile and in a vile countri it so fell out that the poor gentleman wa scarc a whole week togeth without some piteou applic for hi beast and as he wa not an unkindheart man and everi case wa more press and more distress than the last as much as he love hi beast he had never a heart to refus him the upshot of which wa gener thi that hi hors wa either clap or spavind or greazd or he wa twitterbond or brokenwind or someth in short or other had befallen him which would let him carri no flesh so that he had everi nine or ten month a bad hors to get rid of and a good hors to purchas in hi stead what the loss in such a balanc might amount to communibu anni i would leav to a special juri of suffer in the same traffic to determin but let it be what it would the honest gentleman bore it for mani year without a murmur till at length by repeat ill accid of the kind he found it necessari to take the thing under consider and upon weigh the whole and sum it up in hi mind he found it not onli disproport to hi other expens but withal so heavi an articl in itself as to disabl him from ani other act of generos in hi parish besid thi he consid that with half the sum thu gallop away he could do ten time as much good and what still weigh more with him than all other consider put togeth wa thi that it confin all hi chariti into one particular channel and where as he fanci it wa the least want name to the childbear and childget part of hi parish reserv noth for the impot noth for the age noth for the mani comfortless scene he wa hourli call forth to visit where poverti and sick and afflict dwelt togeth for these reason he resolv to discontinu the expens and there appear but two possibl way to extric him clearli out of it and these were either to make it an irrevoc law never more to lend hi steed upon ani applic whatev or els be content to ride the last poor devil such as they had made him with all hi ach and infirm to the veri end of the chapter as he dread hi own constanc in the first he veri cheer betook himself to the second and though he could veri well have explain it as i said to hi honor yet for that veri reason he had a spirit abov it choos rather to bear the contempt of hi enemi and the laughter of hi friend than undergo the pain of tell a stori which might seem a panegyr upon himself i have the highest idea of the spiritu and refin sentiment of thi reverend gentleman from thi singl stroke in hi charact which i think come up to ani of the honest refin of the peerless knight of la mancha whom by the bye with all hi folli i love more and would actual have gone further to have paid a visit to than the greatest hero of antiqu but thi is not the moral of my stori the thing i had in view wa to show the temper of the world in the whole of thi affair for you must know that so long as thi explan would have done the parson credit the devil a soul could find it out i suppos hi enemi would not and that hi friend could not but no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf of the midwif and pay the expens of the ordinari licens to set her up but the whole secret came out everi hors he had lost and two hors more than ever he had lost with all the circumst of their destruct were known and distinctli rememb the stori ran like wildfir the parson had a return fit of pride which had just seiz him and he wa go to be well mount onc again in hi life and if it wa so twa plain as the sun at noonday he would pocket the expens of the licens ten time told the veri first year so that everi bodi wa left to judg what were hi view in thi act of chariti what were hi view in thi and in everi other action of hi life or rather what were the opinion which float in the brain of other peopl concern it wa a thought which too much float in hi own and too often broke in upon hi rest when he should have been sound asleep about ten year ago thi gentleman had the good fortun to be made entir easi upon that score it be just so long sinc he left hi parish and the whole world at the same time behind him and stand account to a judg of whom he will have no caus to complain but there is a fatal attend the action of some men order them as they will they pass through a certain medium which so twist and refract them from their true direct that with all the titl to prais which a rectitud of heart can give the doer of them are nevertheless forc to live and die without it of the truth of which thi gentleman wa a pain exampl but to know by what mean thi came to pass and to make that knowledg of use to you i insist upon it that you read the two follow chapter which contain such a sketch of hi life and convers as will carri it moral along with it when thi is done if noth stop us in our way we will go on with the midwif chap xi yorick wa thi parson name and what is veri remark in it as appear from a most ancient account of the famili wrote upon strong vellum and now in perfect preserv it had been exactli so spelt for near i wa within an ace of say nine hundr year but i would not shake my credit in tell an improb truth howev indisput in itself and therefor i shall content myself with onli say it had been exactli so spelt without the least variat or transposit of a singl letter for i do not know how long which is more than i would ventur to say of one half of the best surnam in the kingdom which in a cours of year have gener undergon as mani chop and chang as their owner ha thi been owe to the pride or to the shame of the respect proprietor in honest truth i think sometim to the one and sometim to the other just as the temptat ha wrought but a villain affair it is and will one day so blend and confound us all togeth that no one shall be abl to stand up and swear that hi own great grand father wa the man who did either thi or that thi evil had been suffici fenc against by the prudent care of the yorick famili and their religi preserv of these record i quot which do further inform us that the famili wa origin of danish extract and had been transplant into england as earli as in the reign of horwendillu king of denmark in whose court it seem an ancestor of thi mr yorick and from whom he wa lineal descend held a consider post to the day of hi death of what natur thi consider post wa thi record say not it onli add that for near two centuri it had been total abolish as altogeth unnecessari not onli in that court but in everi other court of the christian world it ha often come into my head that thi post could be no other than that of the king chief jester and that hamlet yorick in our shakespear mani of whose play you know are found upon authent fact wa certainli the veri man i have not the time to look into saxogrammaticuss danish histori to know the certainti of thi but if you have leisur and can easili get at the book you may do it full as well yourself i had just time in my travel through denmark with mr noddi eldest son whom in the year i accompani as governor ride along with him at a prodigi rate through most part of europ and of which origin journey perform by us two a most delect narr will be given in the progress of thi work i had just time i say and that wa all to prove the truth of an observ made by a long sojourn in that countri name that natur wa neither veri lavish nor wa she veri stingi in her gift of geniu and capac to it inhabit but like a discreet parent wa moder kind to them all observ such an equal tenor in the distribut of her favor as to bring them in those point pretti near to a level with each other so that you will meet with few instanc in that kingdom of refin part but a great deal of good plain household understand amongst all rank of peopl of which everi bodi ha a share which is i think veri right with us you see the case is quit differ we are all up and down in thi matter you are a great geniu or it is fifti to one sir you are a great dunc and a blockhead not that there is a total want of intermedi step no we are not so irregular as that come to but the two extrem are more common and in a greater degre in thi unsettl island where natur in her gift and disposit of thi kind is most whimsic and caprici fortun herself not be more so in the bequest of her good and chattel than she thi is all that ever stagger my faith in regard to yorick extract who by what i can rememb of him and by all the account i could ever get of him seem not to have had one singl drop of danish blood in hi whole crasi in nine hundr year it might possibl have all run out i will not philosoph one moment with you about it for happen how it would the fact wa thi that instead of that cold phlegm and exact regular of sens and humor you would have look for in one so extract he wa on the contrari as mercuri and sublim a composit as heteroclit a creatur in all hi declens with as much life and whim and gait de coeur about him as the kindliest climat could have engend and put togeth with all thi sail poor yorick carri not one ounc of ballast he wa utterli unpractis in the world and at the age of twentysix knew just about as well how to steer hi cours in it as a romp unsuspici girl of thirteen so that upon hi first set out the brisk gale of hi spirit as you will imagin ran him foul ten time in a day of some bodi tackl and as the grave and more slowpac were oftenest in hi way you may likewis imagin twa with such he had gener the ill luck to get the most entangl for aught i know there might be some mixtur of unlucki wit at the bottom of such fraca for to speak the truth yorick had an invinc dislik and opposit in hi natur to graviti not to graviti as such for where graviti wa want he would be the most grave or seriou of mortal men for day and week togeth but he wa an enemi to the affect of it and declar open war against it onli as it appear a cloak for ignor or for folli and then whenev it fell in hi way howev shelter and protect he seldom gave it much quarter sometim in hi wild way of talk he would say that graviti wa an errant scoundrel and he would add of the most danger kind too becaus a fli one and that he verili believ more honest wellmean peopl were bubbl out of their good and money by it in one twelvemonth than by pocketpick and shoplift in seven in the nake temper which a merri heart discov he would say there wa no danger but to itself wherea the veri essenc of graviti wa design and consequ deceit twa a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more sens and knowledg than a man wa worth and that with all it pretens it wa no better but often wors than what a french wit had long ago defin it viz a mysteri carriag of the bodi to cover the defect of the mind which definit of graviti yorick with great imprud would say deserv to be wrote in letter of gold but in plain truth he wa a man unhackney and unpractis in the world and wa altogeth as indiscreet and foolish on everi other subject of discours where polici is wont to impress restraint yorick had no impress but one and that wa what aros from the natur of the deed spoken of which impress he would usual translat into plain english without ani periphrasi and too often without much distinct of either personag time or place so that when mention wa made of a piti or an ungener proceed he never gave himself a moment time to reflect who wa the hero of the piec what hi station or how far he had power to hurt him hereaft but if it wa a dirti action without more ado the man wa a dirti fellow and so on and as hi comment had usual the ill fate to be termin either in a bon mot or to be enliven throughout with some drolleri or humor of express it gave wing to yorick indiscret in a word though he never sought yet at the same time as he seldom shun occas of say what came uppermost and without much ceremoni he had but too mani temptat in life of scatter hi wit and hi humor hi gibe and hi jest about him they were not lost for want of gather what were the consequ and what wa yorick catastroph thereupon you will read in the next chapter chap xii the mortgag and mortgage differ the one from the other not more in length of purs than the jester and jeste do in that of memori but in thi the comparison between them run as the scholiast call it upon allfour which by the bye is upon one or two leg more than some of the best of homer can pretend to name that the one rais a sum and the other a laugh at your expens and think no more about it interest howev still run on in both case the period or accident payment of it just serv to keep the memori of the affair aliv till at length in some evil hour pop come the creditor upon each and by demand princip upon the spot togeth with full interest to the veri day make them both feel the full extent of their oblig as the reader for i hate your if ha a thorough knowledg of human natur i need not say more to satisfi him that my hero could not go on at thi rate without some slight experi of these incident memento to speak the truth he had wantonli involv himself in a multitud of small bookdebt of thi stamp which notwithstand eugeniuss frequent advic he too much disregard think that as not one of them wa contract through ani malign but on the contrari from an honesti of mind and a mere jocund of humor they would all of them be cross out in cours eugeniu would never admit thi and would often tell him that one day or other he would certainli be reckon with and he would often add in an accent of sorrow apprehens to the uttermost mite to which yorick with hi usual careless of heart would as often answer with a pshaw and if the subject wa start in the field with a hop skip and a jump at the end of it but if close pent up in the social chimney corner where the culprit wa barricadod in with a tabl and a coupl of arm chair and could not so readili fli off in a tangent eugeniu would then go on with hi lectur upon discret in word to thi purpos though somewhat better put togeth trust me dear yorick thi unwari pleasantri of thine will sooner or later bring thee into scrape and difficulti which no afterwit can extric thee out of in these salli too often i see it happen that a person laugh at consid himself in the light of a person injur with all the right of such a situat belong to him

a tear steal from hi eye and a promissori look attend it that he wa resolv for the time to come to ride hi tit with more sobrieti but ala too late a grand confederaci with and at the head of it wa form befor the first predict of it the whole plan of the attack just as eugeniu had forebod wa put in execut all at onc with so littl merci on the side of the alli and so littl suspicion in yorick of what wa carri on against him that when he thought good easi man full sure prefer wa oripen they had smote hi root and then he fell as mani a worthi man had fallen befor him yorick howev fought it out with all imagin gallantri for some time till overpow by number and worn out at length by the calam of the war but more so by the ungener manner in which it wa carri on he threw down the sword and though he kept up hi spirit in appear to the last he die nevertheless as wa gener thought quit broken heart what inclin eugeniu to the same opinion wa as follow a few hour befor yorick breath hi last eugeniu step in with an intent to take hi last sight and last farewel of him upon hi draw yorick curtain and ask how he felt himself yorick look up in hi face took hold of hi hand and after thank him for the mani token of hi friendship to him for which he said if it wa their fate to meet hereaft he would thank him again and again he told him he wa within a few hour of give hi enemi the slip for

rhapsod work ha been part from the midwif that it is high time to mention her again to him mere to put him in mind that there is such a bodi still in the world and whom upon the best judgment i can form upon my own plan at present i am go to introduc to him for good and all but as fresh matter may be start and much unexpect busi fall out betwixt the reader and myself which may requir immedi dispatch twa right to take care that the poor woman should not be lost in the mean time becaus when she is want we can no way do without her i think i told you that thi good woman wa a person of no small note and consequ throughout our whole villag and township that her fame had spread itself to the veri outedg and circumfer of that circl of import of which kind everi soul live whether he ha a

fanci in a compoundratio of the station profess knowledg abil height and depth measur both way of the personag brought befor you in the present case if i rememb i fix it at about four or five mile which not onli comprehend the whole parish but extend itself to two or three of the adjac hamlet in the skirt of the next parish which made a consider thing of it i must add that she wa moreov veri well look on at one larg grangehous and some other odd hous and farm within two or three mile as i said from the smoke of her own chimney but i must here onc for all inform you that all thi will be more exactli delin and explain in a map now in the hand of the engrav which with mani other piec and develop to thi work will be ad to the end of the twentieth volum not to swell the work i detest the thought of such a thing but by way of commentari scholium illustr and key to such passag incid or inuendo as shall be thought to be either of privat interpret or of dark or doubt mean after my life and my opinion shall have been read over now dont forget the mean of the word by all the world which betwixt you and me and in spite of all the gentlemen review in great britain and of all that their worship shall undertak to write or say to the contrari i am determin shall be the case i need not tell your worship that all thi is spoke in confid chap xiv upon look into my mother marriag settlement in order to satisfi myself and reader in a point necessari to be clear up befor we could proceed ani further in thi histori i had the good fortun to pop upon the veri thing i want befor i had read a day and a half straight forward it might have taken me up a month which show plainli that when a man sit down to write a histori though it be but the histori of jack hickathrift or tom thumb he know no more than hi heel what let and confound hindranc he is to meet with in hi way or what a danc he may be led by one excurs or anoth befor all is over could a historiograph drive on hi histori as a
