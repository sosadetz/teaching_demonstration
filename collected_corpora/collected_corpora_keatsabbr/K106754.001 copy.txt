envi not to admir miss fenton wa imposs to find a fault in her person or sentiment wa equal imposs and yet to love her wa veri unlik that serin of mind which kept her featur in a continu placid form though enchant at the first glanc upon a second or third fatigu the sight for a want of varieti and to have seen her distort with rage convuls with mirth or in deep deject had been to her advantag but her superior soul appear abov those natur commot of the mind and there wa more induc to worship her as a saint than to love her as a woman yet dorriforth whose heart wa not form at least not educ for love regard her in the light of friendship beheld her as the most perfect model for her sex lord frederick on first see her wa struck with her beauti and miss milner apprehend she had introduc a rival but he had not seen her three time befor he call her the most insuffer of heaven creatur and vow there wa more charm variat in the featur of miss woodley miss milner had a heart affection to her sex even where she saw them in the possess of charm superior to her own but whether from the spirit of contradict whether from feel herself more than ordinarili offend by her guardian prais of thi ladi or whether there wa someth in the reserv of miss fenton that did not accord with her own frank and ingenu disposit so as to engag her esteem it is certain she took infinit satisfact in hear her beauti and her virtu depreci or turn to ridicul particularli if mr dorriforth wa present thi wa veri pain to him upon mani account perhap regard to miss milner conduct wa not among the least and whenev the

young earl accustom in hi infanc to fear him as hi master in hi youth and manhood receiv everi new indulg with which hi preceptor favor him with gratitud and becam at length to love him as hi father nor had dorriforth as yet shook off similar sensat mr sandford perfectli knew how to work upon the passion of all human natur but yet had the conscienc not to draw all heart toward him there were of mankind those whose hate he thought not unworthi hi holi labor and in that he wa more rapid in hi success than even in procur esteem in thi enterpris he succeed with miss milner even beyond hi most sanguin wish she had been educ at an english board school and had no idea of the superior and subordin state of a foreign seminari besid as a woman she wa privileg to say ani thing she pleas and as a beauti woman she had a right to expect whatev she pleas to say should be admir sandford knew the heart of women as well as those of men notwithstand he had pass but littl of hi time in their societi he saw miss milner heart at the first view of her person and behold in that littl circumfer a weight of folli he wish to see erad he began to toil in the vineyard eager to draw upon him her detest in the hope he could also make her abomin herself the mortif of slight he wa expert in and be a man of talent such as all compani especi those miss milner often frequent look on with respect he did not begin by wast that rever so highli valu upon ineffectu remonstr of which he could forese the recept but awaken the attent of the ladi sole by hi neglect of her he spoke of her in her presenc as of an indiffer person sometim forgot to name her when the subject requir it and then would ask her pardon and say he did not recollect her with such seem sorrow for hi fault she could not think the offens intend and of cours felt the affront much more sever while with everi other person she wa the principl the first caus upon which a whole compani depend for convers music card or danc with mr sandford she found she wa of no import sometim she tri to consid thi disregard of her as mere the effect of illbreed but he wa not an illbr man he wa a gentleman by birth and one who had kept the best compani a man of sens and learn and doe such a man slight me without know it she cri for she had not dive so deep into the power of simul as to suspect such careless manner were the result of art thi behavior of mr sandford had it desir effect it humbl miss milner in her own opinion more than a thousand sermon would have done preach on the vaniti of youth and beauti she felt an inward nothing she never knew befor and had been cure of all her pride had she not possess a degre of spirit beyond the gener of her sex and such as even mr sandford with all hi penetr did not expect she determin to resent hi treatment and enter the list as hi declar enemi give reason to the behold whi he did not with them acknowledg her sovereignti she now commenc hostil on all hi argument hi learn and hi favorit axiom and by a happi turn for ridicul in want of other weapon threw in the way of the holi father as great trial for hi patienc as ani hi order could have substitut in penanc some thing he bore like a

combat with hi fret but a few minut longer she would have acknowledg hi right to cannon but have yield to the salli of hi anger he must now go through numer other probat if miss fenton wa admir by dorriforth by sandford she wa ador and instead of give her as an exampl to miss milner he spoke of her as of one endow beyond miss milner power of imit often with a shake of hi head and a sigh would he say no i am not so hard upon you as your guardian i onli desir you to love miss fenton to resembl her i believ is abov your abil thi wa someth too much and poor miss woodley who wa gener a wit of these controversi suffer a degre of sorrow at everi sentenc that distress miss milner yet as she suffer for mr sandford too the joy of her friend repli wa abat by the uneasi it gave to him but mr horton felt for none but the right reverend priest and often did she feel so violent interest in hi caus she could not refrain give an answer herself in hi behalf thu do the duti of an adversari chapter x mr sandford find hi friend dorriforth frequent perplex in the manag of hi ward and he himself think her incorrig gave hi advic that a proper match should be immedi sought out for her and the
