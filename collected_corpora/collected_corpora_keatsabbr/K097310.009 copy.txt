format of the planet vol i p i on the distanc of the earth from the sun in p i said that the earth is situat thirti million of leagu from the sun thi wa the gener opinion of astronom in the year when i compos the treatis on the format of the planet but later observ and particularli those deriv from the transit of venu over the sun disc in show that thi distanc of thirti million should be augment three or four million of leagu it is for thi reason that in the epoqu de la natur i have alway reckon the mean distanc of the sun from the earth to be thirtythre million of leagu instead of thirti thi remark wa necessari to prevent the suspicion of my have contradict myself i must farther remark that the sun is not onli thirtythre or thirtyfour million of leagu distant from the earth but from the same observ it ha likewis been discov that the volum of the sun is a tenth part larger than wa formerli suppos and consequ that the whole mass of the planet is onli an eight hundredth part of that of the sun and not a six hundredth and fiftieth part as i had advanc from the inform we possess in the year thi differ strengthen the probabl that the matter of the planet wa project from the bodi of the sun ii of the matter of the sun and planet i had remark in p that the opaqu bodi of the planet were detach from the lumin matter of which the sun is compos these express are not correct for the matter of the planet when project from the sun wa equal lumin as that of the sun itself and the planet becam not opaqu till their state of fluid bright had ceas the durat of thi state in sever kind of matter i determin by experi and from analog i calcul the continu of thi bright state in each of the planet see epoqu de la natur besid as the torrent of matter project from the bodi of the sun by the comet travers the immens atmospher of that luminari it carri off the volatil aqueou and aerial part of which the sea and atmospher of the differ planet are now compos henc we may conclud that the matter of the planet is the same in everi respect with that of the sun and that there is no other differ but in the degre of heat which is extrem in the sun and greater or smaller in the planet accord to the compound ratio of their thick and densiti iii of the relat between the densiti of the planet and their celer in p i said that accord to thi relat between the celer and densiti of the planet the densiti of the earth ought not to exceed instead of which is it real densiti the densiti here ascrib to the earth is too great with relat to the quick of it motion round the sun and ought to be a littl diminish for a reason which had formerli escap me the moon which in thi comput should be regard as form a part of the earth is less dens in the ratio of to and the lunar globe is th of the bulk of the terrestri henc if the moon were as larg as the earth we should diminish the densiti of the latter in the ratio of to which produc i e of diminut in the densiti but as the moon is onli th part of the bulk of the earth it will produc onli or th of diminut consequ the densiti of our globe with relat to it celer instead of ought to be estim at i e nearli besid we may suppos that our globe at the begin wa less dens than it is at present and that it is becom much more compact both by cool and by the sink of vast cavern with which it interior part abound thi opinion accord with those revolut which happen and still continu to happen both on the surfac of the earth and even at consider depth by the aid of thi fact we are enabl to explain the possibl that the water of the sea were formerli fathom abov those part of the globe which are now inhabit for these water would still cover the whole surfac of the earth if by immens depress differ part had not sunk and form those receptacl for the water which at present exist if we suppos the diamet of the globe to be leagu it would be two leagu more when cover with fathom of water thi differ in the bulk of the earth produc by the sink of the water give an augment of a th part of it densiti thi augment of the densiti or diminut of the bulk of the globe may be doubl and perhap tripl by the sink and overturn of mountain and the consequ fill up of valley so that sinc the water fell upon the earth it densiti may be suppos to have increas one hundredth part iv on the relat assign by newton between the densiti of the planet and the degre of heat to which they are expos in p i remark that notwithstand the regard due to the conjectur of newton i can not help think that the densiti of the planet have a nearer relat to their celer than to the degre of heat to which they are expos from calcul the action of the solar heat upon the planet it appear that thi heat in gener is inconsider and that it ha never produc ani great chang in the densiti of each planet for the action of the solar heat which is weak in itself ha no influenc on the densiti of the matter of which the planet are compos except at their surfac it can not act on the intern part becaus it penetr to a veri small depth onli henc the total densiti of a planet ha no relat to the heat transmit to it by the sun it appear to be certain therefor that the densiti of the planet ha no depend on the solar heat on the contrari that their densiti have relat with their celer which last increas or diminish in proport to their distanc from the sun we have seen that at the gener project the more dens part were not remov so far from the sun as the less dens mercuri which is compos of the most dens matter project from the sun remain in the neighborhood of that luminari while saturn which consist of the lightest matter is remov to a great distanc from the sun and as the most distant planet revolv round the sun with greater celer than those that are nearer it follow that their densiti ha a direct relat with their celer and still more with their distanc from the sun the distanc of the six planet from the sun are as and their densiti as and if we suppos the densiti to be in the invers ratio of the distanc they will be as thi last relat between their respect densiti is perhap more just than the former becaus it seem to be found on the physic caus which must have produc the differ of densiti in each planet addit to the articl concern geographi vol i p i on the extent of terrestri contin page i said that the longest line which can be drawn in the ancient contin is about leagu by leagu i mean those use in the environ of pari which are or fathom long and about of them make a degre besid though in thi articl of gener geographi i endeavor to reach that degre of exact which subject of that natur requir yet a few slight error have escap me for exampl i have not use the name adopt or given by the french to sever part of america i uniformli follow the british globe made by senex of two feet diamet from which my chart were exactli copi the british are more just than the french with regard to countri they discov or through which they travel they preserv the origin name of each countri or that which wa bestow on it by the first discover we on the contrari often give french name to the countri we visit which is the caus of that obscur in the geograph nomenclatur of our languag but as the line which travers the two contin in their greatest length are well mark in my chart by the two extrem point and sever other intermedi one whose name are gener adopt no essenti ambigu can aris from thi circumst i likewis neglect to give the calcul of the surfac of the two contin becaus it is easili made on a larg globe but as mani person have express a desir to see thi calcul i here subjoin that which m robert de vaugondi transmit to me at the time calcul of our contin by geometr leagu squar d d d d d e d c b a d calcul of the left half calcul of the right half a x a x a x a x b x b x b x b x c x c x c x c x d x d x d x d x e x e x e x e x differ which is scarc a degre and a half squar calcul of the contin of america accord to the same measur calcul of the left half calcul of the right half d x d x c x c x b x a x a x a x a x b x b x c x c x d x d x differ which is scarc a degre and one fifth squar superfici of the new contin superfici of the old contin total squar leagu from thi calcul it appear that on the left of the line of partitio there are of squar leagu and squar leagu on the right of the same line and consequ that the old contin consist of about squar leagu which is not one fifth part of the earth surfac in the same manner the part on the left of the line of partit in the new contin contain squar leagu and that on the right of the same line consist of in all about squar leagu which make not one half of the surfac of the old contin as both contin contain but squar leagu their superfici is not near one third of the total surfac of the globe which is about million of squar leagu i ought to have mention the small differ of inclin that subsist between the two line by which i divid the two contin i content myself with say that they were both inclin to the equat in opposit side about degre which is not the precis fact for that of the old contin is a littl more than degre and that of the new a littl less if i had given thi explan i should have avoid the imput of have drawn two line of unequ length under the same angl between two parallel which would have prove as an anonym critic remark lettr a un americain that i am unacquaint with the element of geometri i neglect to distinguish upper from lower egypt so that in p and there is the appear of a contradict in the first of these passag egypt seem to be rank among the most ancient land while in the second it is reckon among the most recent i wa wrong in not distinguish as i had elsewher done upper egypt which is a veri ancient land from lower egypt which is a veri new territori ii of the form of contin with regard to the figur of contin i shall transcrib a passag from the ingeni author of the philosoph and polit histori of the two indi it is now thought to be certain he remark that the surfac of the new contin is not one half of that of the old besid in their figur there are some strike analog they seem to form two immens band of earth which aris from the arctic pole termin in the south and separ on the east and west by the ocean that invest them independ of the structur of these two band and of the counterpois or symmetri which take place in their figur it is appar that their equilibrium depend not on their posit it is the fluctuat of the sea which produc the stabil of the earth to fix the globe on it base it wa necessari to have an element which by float continu around thi planet should counterbal by it weight the other substanc and restor that equilibrium which the collis of the other element might have disturb water by it fluiditi and graviti is well fit to support that harmoni and that balanc of the differ part of the globe around it center if the water which still moisten the bowel of the new hemispher had not delug it surfac man would soon have cut down the wood drain the marsh and given consist to a wateri soil he would have open vent to the wind and confin the river within their bank the climat of cours would have alreadi been chang but an uncultiv and thinli inhabit hemispher announc a recent land while the water which environ it coast still creep silent through it vein on thi subject i shall remark that although there is more water on the surfac of america than on that of other countri we ought not to conclud from thi circumst that an intern sea is contain in the bowel of thi new land we should onli infer from thi number of lake marsh and larg river that america ha been peopl long after asia africa and europ where the quantiti of stagnant water is much less besid a thousand other circumst concur in show that the contin of america in gener ought to be regard as new land in which natur ha not had time to acquir all her power nor to exhibit them by a numer popul iii of the terra australi p to what i have said concern the terra australi i shall add that within these few year new attempt have been made to discov it and that some point of it have been found after depart either from the cape of good hope or from the isl of franc but that these new voyag have uniformli met with thick fog snow and ice in the th or th degre of south latitud after convers with some of these voyag and collect all the inform i could deriv from other sourc i perceiv that they all agre with regard to thi fact and that they found ice in much lower latitud than is to be met with in the northern hemispher they likewis uniformli met with fog in the same latitud where they found ice though it wa summer in these climat at the time the experi were made it is therefor extrem probabl that below the th degre it will be in vain to search for temper countri in the southern hemispher where the freez cold is much farther extend than in the northern the thick fog is produc by the presenc or neighborhood of the ice thi fog consist of minut particl of snow which are suspend in the air and render it obscur it often accompani the great float mass of ice and reign perpetu in frozen region besid the british have late sail round new holland as well as new zealand these southern countri are more extens than the whole of europ new zealand is divid into sever island but new holland ought rather to be regard as a part of asia than as an island belong to the southern contin for new holland is onli separ from the land of the papou or new guiney by a narrow strait and the whole archipelago which extend southward from the philippin isl as far as the countri of arnhem in new holland and toward the west and south as far as sumatra and java appear to belong as much to the contin of new holland as to the southern part of asia captain cook who ought to be regard as the greatest navig of thi age and to whom we are indebt for an infinit number of new discoveri ha not onli given a chart of the coast of zealand and new holland but ha likewis explor an immens tract of the south sea in the neighborhood of america he depart from the south point of america on the th of januari and he travers a great part of the ocean under the th degre without discov ani land from captain cook chart we may perceiv the great extent of sea which he explor and hi tract demonstr that if ani land exist in thi part of the globe they must be far remov from the contin of america for new zealand which is situat between the th and th degre is veri distant from america but it is still to be hope that other navig follow the tract of captain cook will travers the southern ocean under the th degre and that they will discov whether these immens region which extend more than two thousand leagu consist of land or of sea howev i do not imagin that the southern region beyond the th degre are so temper that ani advantag could be deriv to us from the discoveri of them iv concern the invent of the marin compass p with regard to the invent of the marin compass i have to add that from the testimoni of chines author of which m le rous and m de guign have made an abridg it appear to be certain that the polar of the magnet needl ha been veri ancient known to the inhabit of china the figur of these first compass wa those of a man who turn upon a pivot and whose right arm point to the south the time of thi invent accord to certain chines chronicl wa year befor the christian era and accord to other see lextrait de annal de la china par mr rous and de guign but notwithstand the antiqu of thi discoveri it doe not appear that the chines had ever deriv from it the advantag of make long voyag homer in the odyssey tell us that the greek employ the loadston to direct their navig when they went to besieg troy and thi era is nearli the same with that record in the chines chronicl henc we can no longer doubt that the direct of the loadston toward the pole and even the use of the marin compass in navig were known to the ancient at least three thousand year ago v of the discoveri of america p to what i said p concern the discoveri of america a critic of more judgment than the author of lettr a un americain ha accus me of do a kind of injuri to the memori of so great a man as christoph columbu it is confound he remark columbu with hi sailor to think that he could believ the sea rose toward the sky and that they perhap touch each other on the southern part of the globe thi critic is extrem just i ought to have soften thi fact which i had extract from some histor relat for thi great navig it is to be presum must have had veri distinct notion concern the figur of the earth which he deriv both from hi own voyag and from those of the portugues to the cape of good hope and the east indi it is well known howev that columbu when he arriv at the new contin thought himself at no great distanc from the east coast of asia as no man at that period had circumnavig the world he could not know it circumfer and did not imagin that the earth wa so extens as it ha been demonstr by later discoveri besid it must be acknowledg that thi first navig toward the west could not fail to be astonish to find that when below the antil it wa imposs for him to gain the southern region and that he wa continu forc back thi obstacl still subsist we can not in ani season sail directli from the antil to guiana becaus the current are extrem rapid and constantli run from guiana to those island ship sail from guiana to the antil in five or six day but they requir two month to return in order to return they are oblig to make a larg circuit toward the old contin from whenc they direct their cours toward the terra firma of south america these rapid and perpetu current from guiana to the antil are so violent that they can not be surmount by the aid of the wind and as thi circumst is unexampl in the atlant ocean it is not surspris that columbu who notwithstand all the resourc of hi geniu and knowledg in the art of navig could not advanc toward the southern region should think that someth of a veri extraordinari natur exist in thi place and perhap that there wa a greater elev in thi part of the sea than in ani other for the current from guiana to the antil actual run with as much rapid as if they descend from a height the motion of the follow river may give rise to the current from cayenn to the antil the impetu river of the amazon whose mouth is seventi leagu broad and it direct more to the north than the south the river ouassa is likewis rapid ha the same direct and it mouth is nearli a leagu wide the oyapok is still more rapid than the ouassa pass through a greater tract of land and it mouth is nearli of the same dimens the aprouak ha nearli the same extent of cours and of mouth as the ouassa the river kaw is less extens both in it cours and mouth but though it issu from a savannah about twentyf or thirti leagu from the sea it is extrem rapid the oyak which is a consider river divid into two branch at it mouth and form the island of cayenn thi river at the distanc of twenti or twentyf leagu receiv anoth call oraput it is veri impetu and deriv it sourc from a mountain of rock from whenc it descend in rapid torrent one branch of the oyak run near it mouth into the river of cayenn and these two river when unit are more than a leagu broad the other branch exce not half a leagu the river of kourou which is veri rapid and not abov half a leagu wide at the mouth without reckon the macousia which though it furnish much water come from no great distanc the sinamari is an impetu river it come from a great distanc and it bed is pretti narrow the river maroni though it be veri rapid come from a great distanc it mouth is more than a leagu broad and next to the amazon it discharg the greatest quantiti of water it give rise to no island while the mouth of the amazon and oronoko are interspers with a great number the river of surinam of barbich of essequeb and some other till we reach the oronoko which is a veri larg river by the accumul of mud and of earth brought down from the mountain by these river it should appear all the valley of thi vast contin have been form in the middl of the contin there are some mountain most of which have formerli been volcano and are not suffici elev to allow their summit to be cover with snow or ice henc it is appar that the unit forc of all these river give rise to that gener current of the sea from cayenn or rather from the amazon to the antil and that thi gener current extend perhap abov sixti leagu from the eastern coast of guiana addit to the articl of the product of strata vol i p i concern the strata in differ part of the earth we have some exampl of quarri and pit of consider depth of which the differ strata have been examin and describ such as the pit of amsterdam which descend feet and that of marlylavil which is feet deep mani other exampl might be given if observ had agre in their denomin but some give the name of marl to white clay other appli the term sint to round calcar stone and other give the denomin of sand to calcar gravel henc littl advantag can be deriv either from their research or their long dissert on these subject becaus we are under a perpetu uncertainti with regard to the natur of the substanc they describ we shall therefor confin ourselv to the follow exampl an excel observ ha written to one of my friend in the follow term concern the strata in the neighborhood of toulon to the north of the citi of toulon he remark there is an immens quantiti of stoni matter which occupi the deliv of the chain of mountain and stretch through the valley from east to west and one part of it form the soil of the valley and lose itself in the sea thi stoni matter is commonli call saffr but it is that speci of tufa which is denomin marga toffacea fisiulosa by naturalist m guettard desir me to furnish him with all the inform i could obtain concern thi saffr as well as specimen of the matter itself that he might examin it and give a detail of it qualiti in hi memoir i sent them both and i believ i have satisfi him for he ha thank me for the inform i commun he tell me that he is to return to provenc and toulon in the begin of may m guettard howev will probabl give us noth new upon thi subject for m de buffon ha exhaust it in the first volum of hi natur histori under the articl proof of the theori of the earth and it appear that in compos thi articl he had in hi eye the mountain of toulon and their ridg at the commenc of thi ridg which consist of a more or less hard tufa we find in small caviti of the nucleu of the mountain quantiti of veri fine sand which are probabl the ball mention by m de buffon after break other superfici part of the nucleu we find number of seashel incorpor with the stone i have sever of these shell the enamel of which is well preserv i will send them soon to m de buffon m guettard who ha made more observ of thi kind than ani other naturalist express himself in the follow term when he treat of the mountain in the neighborhood of pari lettr de m buffi a m gue de montbeil avril below the veget soil which exce not two or three feet is place a bed of sand from four or six to twenti and often thirti feet thick thi bed is commonli replet with stone of the natur of grindston in some district we meet with detach mass of freeston in thi sand bed below thi sand we find a tufa from ten or twelv to thirti forti and even fifti feet thick thi tufa is not commonli of one equal thick it is frequent cut by differ strata of spuriou or clayey marl of the co which the workmen call tripoli or of good marl and even by small bed of pretti hard stone under thi bed of tufa are found those which furnish stone for build these bed vari in thick at first they exceed not one foot in some district three or four of them lie abov each other they are succeed by one of about ten feet both the surfac and interior part of which are interspers with mould or impress of shell it is follow by anoth about four feet which rest upon one from seven to eight or rather upon two of three or four feet after these bed there are sever other which togeth form a mass of at least three fathom thi mass after pierc a bed of sand is succeed by clay thi bed of sand is earthi and reddish and is from two and a half to three feet thick after thi come a bed of spuriou clay of a blueish color it is a clayey earth mix with sand the thick of thi bed is about two feet and is follow by anoth of five which consist of a smooth black clay the broken portion of which are nearli as brilliant as jet lastli thi black clay is succeed by a blue which form a stratum from five to six feet thick in these differ clay we find pyrit of a pale yellow color and of variou figur the water found below all these clay prevent us from penetr ani deeper the strata in the quarri of the district of moxouri abov the suburb of

chapel of castl and of dome they are sometim fortif compos of long curtin and defend with bulwark after examin these object and the correspond of their strata we can hardli entertain a doubt that the circumjac land ha not at some period been realli sunk it appear that those mountain whose base were most solidli support remain as monument to indic the height which the soil of these countri ancient possess bouguer figur de la terr p the mountain of bird call in arab gebelit is so equal from top to bottom for the space of half a leagu that it rather resembl a wall regularli built by the hand of man than a rock form in thi manner by the oper of natur the nile wash thi mountain a long way and it is distant from cairo in upper egypt four and a half day journey voyag du p vansleb to these observ i shall add a remark made by most travel that in arabia the soil is of variou natur the region nearest to mount libanu present noth but broken and overturn rock and is call arabia petrea the remov of the soil by the movement of the water ha render thi countri almost total barren whilst the lighter mud and all the good earth have been carri to a greater distanc and deposit in that part of the countri call arabia felix besid the rever in arabia felix as well as everi where els are more rug toward the african sea i e to the west than toward the red sea which is on the east ii of the interior rock of the globe in p i remark that solid rock are often support by bed of earth clay or sand which have much less specif graviti thi is the case with most hill and is easili perceiv but in high mountain the summit are not onli rock but these rock are support by other and thi structur run through such an extent of countri where one mountain rise out of anoth that it is difficult to determin whether they are found on earth or of what natur thi earth is i have seen rock cut perpendicularli for some hundr of feet but these rock rest upon other rock without my be abl to perceiv where they end may we not howev be allow to conclud from the less to the greater sinc the rock of small mountain the base of which are visibl rest upon earth less heavi and less solid than stone is it not reason to think that earth is likewis the basi of high mountain i acknowledg that thi conjectur deriv from analog is suffici found the conjectur i then hazard wa written thirtyfour year ago sinc that time i have acquir idea and collect fact which convinc me that the great mountain compos of vitresc materi and produc by the action of the primit fire are connect immedi with the interior rock of the globe which is also a vitreou rock of the same kind these great mountain are a part of thi immens rock and are onli prolong or emin form upon the surfac of the globe at the time of it consolid henc we ought to regard them as constitu part of the origin mass of the earth but the hill or smaller mountain which rest upon clay or vitrifi sand have been form by the motion and sediment of the water at a time long posterior to the format of the great mountain by the primit sire the intern part of the primit mountain which i have penetr either in pit or in the galleri of mine to the depth of twelv and fifteen hundr feet are entir compos of pure vitreou rock in which there are slight and irregular fissur through which the water issu and vitriol and metal solut from thi fact we may conclud that the
