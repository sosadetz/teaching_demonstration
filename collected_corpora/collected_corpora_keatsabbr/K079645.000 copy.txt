account of the lazi of their live thought he had now found a fair occas to expos them he drew up therefor and present publish a treatis against abl beggari in which he first show the differ between the poverti of christ and that of the friar and the oblig which all christian lay under to labor in some way for the good of societi he then lash the friar with great acrimoni prove them to be an infam and useless set of men wallow in luxuri and so far from be object of chariti that they were a reproach not onli to religion but even to human societi thi piec wa calcul for the mani on whom it made a great impress at the same time it increas hi reput with the learn all men of sens and freedom admir the work and applaud the spirit of the author from thi time the univers began to consid him

so bad a caus so well defend undertook to oppos the monk and did it in so masterli a way that he wa no longer consid as unanswer soon after thi book wa publish the suit at rome wa determin against him and when men saw an effect correspond so exactli with a probabl caus they could not avoid assign that probabl caus as a real one in a word nobodi doubt but hi opposit to the pope at so critic a time wa the true caus of hi be nonsuit at rome notwithstand hi disappoint wicliff still continu at oxford where hi friend about thi time procur him a benefic soon after the divin professor chair fall vacant he took a doctor degre and wa elect into it the univers pay him thi compliment not onli as the reward of hi merit but as a compens for hi loss dr wicliff had now attain the summit of hi hope hi station afford him that opportun which he want of throw some new light as he imagin upon religi subject a long cours of reason had now fulli convinc him that the romish religion wa a system of error the scandal live of the monast clergi first led him into thi train of think and an inquiri into antiqu had confirm him in it but it wa a bold undertak to encount error of so long a stand error which had taken so deep a root and had spread themselv so wide the undertak at least requir the greatest caution he resolv therefor at first to go on with the popular argument which he had begun and continu hi attack upon the monast clergi it wa a circumst in hi favor that the beg friar were at thi time in the highest discredit at oxford the occasion opposit he had alreadi given them had by no mean hurt hi reput and as he realli thought the monast clergi the princip instrument of the prevail corrupt he wa fulli determin not to spare them in hi public lectur therefor he repres them as a set of men who profess inde to live under the rule of holi saint but had now so far degener from their first institut that they were becom a scandal to their founder men might well cri out he said against the decay of religion but he could show them from whenc thi decay proceed while the preacher of religion never inculc religi duti but entertain the peopl with idl stori and lie miracl while they never enforc the necess of a good life but taught their hearer to put their trust in a bit of seal parchment and the prayer of hypocrit it wa imposs he said but religion must decay such treacher friend did more hurt than open enemi but a regard for religion he ad wa not to be expect from them they had noth in view but the advanc of their order in everi age they had made it their practic to invent and multipli such new opinion and doctrin as suit their avariti view nay they had in a manner set asid christian by bind men with their tradit in prefer to the rule of christ who it might well be suppos left noth use out of hi scheme in such languag did dr wicliff inveigh against the monast clergi and open the eye of men to a varieti of abus which were befor hidden in the dark of superstit he had not howev yet avowedli question ani doctrin of the church all he had hitherto attempt wa to loosen the prejudic of the vulgar hi success in thi warrant a further progress and he began next to think of attack some of the fundament of poperi in thi design he still proceed with hi usual caution at first he thought it suffici to lead hi adversari into logic and metaphys disput accustom them to hear novelti and to bear contradict noth pass in the school but learn argument on the form of thing on the increas of time on space substanc and ident in these disput he art intermix and push as far as he durst new opinion in divin sound as it were the mind of hi hearer at length find he had a great parti in the school and that he wa listen to with attent he ventur to be more explicit and by degre open himself at larg he began by invalid all the write of the father after the tenth centuri at that time he said an age of dark and error commenc and the honest enquir after truth could never satisfi himself among the opinion and doctrin which then took their birth the specul corrupt which had crept into religion were the first subject of hi enquiri mani of these he trace out from their earliest origin and with egrat accuraci and acut show the progress they had made as they descend through the age of superstit he proceed next to the usurp of the court of rome on thi subject he wa veri copiou it wa hi favorit topic and seldom fail howev coolli he might begin to give him warmth and spirit as he proceed on these and mani other subject of the same kind he insist with great freedom and a strength of reason far superior to the learn of those time thi spirit attack upon the church of rome ha been attribut by hi enemi to motiv of resent hi depriv it is said wa the unlucki caus of all thi heat and bitter and inde hi conduct in thi instanc ha unquestion the appear of be influenc by hi passion but the candid of all parti will be veri caution in assign motiv and the friend of wicliff may with truth remonstr that he began hi attack upon the church of rome befor he had been injur by the pope they may add too that he never befor had so proper an occas to question publicli the erron tenet of religion from whatev motiv howev thi spirit attack proceed we are not surpris to find a violent clamor rais against him by the romish clergi the archbishop of canterburi take the lead resolv to prosecut him with the utmost vigor but heresi wa a new crime the church had slept in it error through so mani age that it wa unprepar for an attack record howev were search and preced examin till with some difficulti at length dr wicliff wa depriv and silenc edward iii after a gloriou and activ reign wa at thi time too much impair both in bodi and mind to bear the fatigu of govern the whole administr of affair wa in the hand of hi son the duke of lancast commonli known by the name of john of ghent thi princ had a spirit answer to hi birth and preserv the form of royalti as much as ani monarch of hi time he had violent passion of which hi enemi and friend were equal sensibl in religion he had free notion and whether hi creed gave offens to the popish clergi or whether he had made some effort to curb the exorbit of their power it is certain they were vehement incens against him and some of thi is particularli charg upon william of wickham bishop of winchest but a late veri accur and ingeni writer ha suffici exculp him on thi head the lead churchmen it is said had use veri base art to blacken hi charact with equal fire the duke retort their illtreat and have long despis them and be now so exceedingli provok he conceiv a settl prejudic against the whole order and endeavor by all the mean in hi power to bring them into the same contempt with other in which he held them himself thi quarrel between the duke of lancast and the clergi wa the occas of introduc dr wicliff into public life and thi introduct afford him afterward an opportun of signal himself still more in the great caus of religi liberti the duke it seem had heard with pleasur of the attack he had made upon the church of rome and had wait the consequ of it with great attent and when he now found that dr wicliff wa like to be the suffer he interpos rescu him out of the hand of hi enemi who were persu their advantag and brought him to court where through a passion vibrat of temper from one extrem to anoth he took him into hi confid and treat him with a kind proport to the enmiti which he bore the clergi the oppress of the court of rome were at thi time sever felt in england mani thing were complain of but noth more than the state of churchprefer almost all of which and even rectori and vicarag of ani valu in whomsoev origin vest were now through one fiction or anoth claim by the pope with these he pension hi friend and favorit most of whom be foreign resid abroad and left their benefic in the hand of illpaid and neglig curat by these mean religion decay the countri wa drain of money and what wa look upon as most vexati a bodi of insol tythegather were set over the peopl who had their own fortun to make out of the surplu of their exact these hardship notwithstand the blind obedi paid at that time to the sea of rome creat great unquiet the nation saw itself wrong and parliamentari petit in veri warm languag were prefer to the conclav but to littl purpos the pope lend a veri neglig ear to ani motion which so nearli affect hi revenu the duke of lancast howev at thi time though the nation had now complain in vain dure more than year wa determin if possibl to obtain redress and in the first place to open the eye of the peopl in the most effectu manner he oblig all bishop to send in list of the number and valu of such prefer and benefic in each of their diocess as were in the hand of foreign from these list it appear what immens sum in that one way were convey everi year out of the kingdom the next step taken wa to send an embassi to the pope to treat of the liberti of the church of england at the head of which embassi were the bishop of bangor and dr wicliff they were met at bruge on the part of rome by the bishop of pampelon and semigaglia and the provost of valenza these agent practic in the polici of their court spun out the negoti with great dexter some historian mention the continu of it dure the space of two year the romish ambassador howev find themselv hard press by their antagonist and prudent consid that it would be easier to evad a treati when made than in the present circumst not to make one determin at last to bring matter to a conclus accordingli it wa agre that the pope should no longer dispos of ani benefic belong to the church of england no mention wa made of bishopr thi wa thought a voluntari omiss in the bishop of bangor and men the rather believ so when they saw him twice afterward translat by the pope author but though dr wicliff fail in hi endeavor to serv hi countri by thi treati for inde it wa never observ he made hi journey howev of some servic to himself it wa hi great care to use the opportun it afford him of sift out the real design of the court of rome not onli in thi affair but in all it other negoti he inquir into the end it had in view and the mean it employ and by frequent convers with the ambassador upon these subject he penetr so far into the constitut and polici of that corrupt court that he began to think of it in a much harsher manner than he had ever yet done and to be more convinc of it avaric and ambit prejud as he had long been against it doctrin and ministri he had never yet thought so ill of it design thu influenc when he came home we find him inveigh in hi lectur against the church of rome in warmer languag than he had hitherto use the exempt of the clergi from the jurisdict of the civil power wa one of hi topic of invect the use of sanctuari wa anoth indulg a third in short there ha scarc been a corrupt principl or practic in the roman church detect by later age which hi penetr had not at that earli day discov and though hi reason want much of that acut and strength with which the best writer of these time have discuss those subject yet when we consid the uninlighten age in which he live we rather stand astonish at that forc of geniu which carri him so far than in ani degre wonder at hi not go farther the pope himself wa often the subject of hi invect hi infal hi usurp hi pride hi avaric and hi tyranni were hi frequent theme and inde hi languag wa never warmer than when on these topic the celebr epithet of antichrist which in after age wa so liber bestow upon the pope seem to have been first given him by thi reform the pomp and luxuri of bishop he would frequent lash and would ask the peopl when they saw their prelat ride abroad accompani with fourscor horsemen in silver trap whether they perceiv ani resembl between such splendour and the simplic of primit bishop where these lectur were read doe not certainli appear it is most probabl howev that they were read in oxford where dr wicliff seem by thi time to have recov hi former station and where he had still a consider parti in hi favor in the mean time he wa frequent at court where he continu in great credit with the duke of lancast mani inde expect some high prefer in the church wa intend for him but we meet with no account of hi have had the offer of ani such whether he himself declin it or the duke thought an emin station in the church would onli the more expos him to the malic of hi enemi the duke howev took care to make him independ by confer a good benefic upon him the rectori of lutterworth in leicestershir whither he immedi repair and set himself faith to discharg the duti of it we hear noth more of hi other benefic so that it is probabl he gave it up when he accept lutterworth dr wicliff wa scarc settl in hi parish when hi enemi take the advantag of hi retir began to persecut him again with fresh vigor at the head of thi persecut were sudburi archbishop of canterburi and courtney bishop of london the former wa a man of uncommon moder for the time in which he live the latter wa an inflam bigot the archbishop inde seem to have been press into thi servic to which he afford onli the counten of hi name courtney took upon himself the manag of it and have procur proper letter from rome dr wicliff wa cite to appear befor him on a day fix at st paul in london thi wa an unexpect summon to dr wicliff who imagin probabl that the obscur of hi retreat would have screen him from hi enemi he repair howev immedi to the duke of lancast to consult with him on a busi of such import the duke did what he could to avert the prosecut but find himself unabl to oppos a forc compos of littl less than the whole ecclesiast order he thought it more probabl that he should be abl to protect hi friend from the futur consequ of the clergi malic than to screen him from the present effect of it determin howev to give him what counten he could he attend him in person to hi trial and engag also the lord pierci earlmarsh of england to accompani them when they came to st paul they found the court sit and a veri great crowd assembl through which the earlmarsh made use of hi author to gain an entranc the arriv of such personag with their attend occas no littl disturb in the church and the bishop of london piqu to see dr wicliff so attend told the earl with a peevish air that if he had known befor what disturb he would have made he should have been stop at the door he wa greatli offend also at the duke for insist that dr wicliff should sit dure hi trial and let fall some express which that haughti princ wa ill abl to bear he immedi fire and reproach the bishop with great bitter warm languag ensu the prelat howev had the advantag of which the duke seem consciou from rail began to threaten and look disdain at the bishop told him that he would bring down the pride not onli of him but of all the prelaci of england and turn to a person near him he said

possess of the mind of men it must have been a sensibl mortif to the haughti pontiff to see the neglect with which he wa treat on thi occas opposit to hi exact he had sometim found befor but thi wa the first occas on which he had ever been treat with contempt the univers deliber whether it should even receiv hi bull and by what appear it did not and the regenc were so littl dispos to show him

the expedi of the measur wa acknowledg by all but the legal of it wa doubt at last it wa agre both by the regenc and the parliament to put the question to dr wicliff it appear as if they onli want the

univers of oxford the zeal of the bishop made ampl amend the bishop of london especi compli not onli with the letter but enter into the spirit of the pontiff mandat he had taken howev onli the first step in thi busi when he receiv a peremptori order from the duke of lancast not to proceed to imprison to imprison a man for hold an opinion the duke told him could not be justifi by the law of england he took the liberti therefor to inform him that if he proceed to ani such extrem he must abid the consequ thi menac alarm the bishop he drop the design of an imprison and content himself with cite wicliff to make hi appear on such a day befor a provinci synod in the chapel at lambeth send him at the same time a copi of the articl which had been object to and desir hi explan of them on the

which at thi day would seem of veri littl import the curiou reader may see them at larg in the first volum of fox act and monument we can not howev avoid observ that dr wicliff by no mean appear in the most favor light on thi occas the ingeni mr hume allud to thi passag of hi life tell us that wicliff notwithstand hi enthusiasm seem not to have been actuat by the spirit of martyrdom and in all

author which yet doe not appear were in some confus at the messag the tumult at the door in the mean time increas and ad to their perplex at length they dissolv the assembl have forbidden dr wicliff to preach ani more those doctrin which had been object to him to thi prohibit it seem he paid littl respect go about barefoot as we are inform in a long friezegown preach everi where occasion to the

all part of europ occas delug of blood and gave a more fatal blow to poperi than ani thing had yet done dr wicliff it may easili be suppos wa among those who took most offens at thi unchristian schism he consid it as a new argument against poperi and as such he fail not to use it a tract soon appear in hi name against the schism of the roman pontiff in which he show what littl credit wa due to either of the contend parti thi tract wa eagerli read by all sort of peopl and tend not a littl to open the eye of the vulgar about the end of the year dr wicliff wa seiz with a violent distemp which it wa fear might have prove fatal upon thi occas we are told he wa wait upon by a veri extraordinari deput the beg friar it seem whom he had heretofor so sever treat sent four of their order accompani with four of the most emin citizen of oxford to attend him who have gain admitt to hi bedchamb acquaint him that hear he lay at the point of death they were come in the name of their order to put him in mind of the mani injuri he had done them and hope for hi soul sake that he would do them all the justic now in hi power by retract in the presenc of those respect person the mani sever and unjust thing he had said of them wicliff surpris at thi solemn messag rais himself in hi bed and we are inform with a stern counten cri out i shall not die but live to declar the evil deed of the friar the unexpect forc of hi express togeth with the stern of hi manner the stori add drove away the friar in confus soon after hi recoveri dr wicliff set about a great work which he had often intend the translat of the scriptur into english it had long given him great offens and inde he alway consid it as one of the capit error of poperi that the bibl should be lock up from the peopl he resolv therefor to free it from thi bondag but befor hi great work appear he publish a tract in which with great strength of argument he show the necess of engag in it the bibl he affirm contain the whole of god will christ law he said wa suffici to guid hi church and everi christian might there gather knowledg enough to make him accept to god and as to comment he said a good life wa the best guid to the knowledg of scriptur or in hi own languag he that keep righteous ha the true understand of holi writ when he thought these argument were suffici digest hi great work came abroad much to the satisfact of all sober men some have contend that dr wicliff wa not the first translat of the bibl into english the truth seem to be that he wa the first who translat the whole togeth of which it is probabl other might have given detach part it doe not howev appear that dr wicliff understood the hebrew languag hi method wa to collect what latin bibl he could find from these he made one correct copi and from thi translat he afterward examin the best comment then extant particularli nicola lyra and from them insert in hi margin those passag in which the latin differ from the hebrew in hi translat of the bibl he seem to have been liter exact in hi other work hi languag wa wonder eleg for the time in which he live but here he wa studiou onli of the plain sens which led him often through the confus of idiom within the limit of nonsens quid nobi and tibi jesu fili dei we find translat thu what to us and to thee jesu the son of god thi work it may easili be imagin had no tendenc to reinstat him in the good opinion of the clergi an univers clamor wa immedi rais knighton a canon of leicest and a contemporari with wicliff ha left us upon record the languag of the time christ entrust hi gospel say that ecclesiast to the clergi and doctor of the church to minist it to the laiti and weaker sort accord to their exig and sever occas but thi master john wicliff by translat it ha made it vulgar and ha laid it more open to the laiti and even to women who can read than it use to be to the most learn of the clergi and those of the best understand and thu the gospel jewel the evangel pearl is thrown about and trodden under foot of swine such languag wa look upon as good reason by the clergi of that day who saw not with what satyr it wa edg against themselv the bishop in the mean time and mitr abbot not content with rail took more effectu pain to stop thi grow evil after much consult they brought a bill into parliament to suppress wicliff bibl the advoc for it set forth in their usual manner the alarm prospect of heresi which thi version of the scriptur open and the ruin of all religion which must inevit ensu these zealot were answer by the princip reform who judici encount them with their own weapon it appear said the wiclivit from the decret that more than sixti differ speci of heresi sprang up in the church after the translat of the bibl into latin but the util of that translat notwithstand it bad consequ all parti acknowledg with what face therefor they ask could the bishop pretend to discounten an english translat when they could not produc one argument against it which did not equal conclud against the latin one thi reason silenc all opposit and the bill wa thrown out by a great major the zeal of the bishop to suppress wicliff bibl onli made it as is gener the case the more sought after they who were abl among the reform purchas copi and they who were not abl procur at least transcript of particular gospel or epistl as their inclin led in after time when lollardi increas and the flame were kindl it wa a common practic to fasten about the neck of the condemn heret such of these scrap of scriptur as were found in hi possess which gener share hi fate befor the clamor which wa rais against dr wicliff on the account of hi bibl wa in ani degre silenc he ventur a step farther and attack that favorit doctrin of the roman church the doctrin of transubstanti about the year thi strang opinion wa first heard of it owe it birth to paschas radbert a wild enthusiast who publish it not as falsehood gener gain ground by littl and littl but at onc glare in it full absurd he inform the world in plain languag that in the sacrament of the lord supper the element after consecr are entir chang into the bodi and blood of christ that veri bodi which wa born of mari suffer upon the cross and rose from the dead it is amaz that an opinion so big with absurd and yet unaid by prejudic could fasten upon the mind of men howev rude of scienc yet the improb tale we find went down as if the greater the improb the more vener the mysteri it wa found a doctrin well adapt to impress the peopl with that aw and superstiti horror which is the necessari foundat of fals religion as such therefor the church of rome with great zeal upheld it and if ani were stagger by the appear of an imposs they were present told that the accid or form of bread and wine it wa true still remain after consecr but by the omnipot of god they remain without a subject thi wa the argument of the clergi and it wa thought conclus for who could doubt the omnipot of god dr wicliff after a thorough examin of thi doctrin wa entir satisfi that it had no scriptur foundat in hi lectur therefor befor the univers of oxford in the year which he seem still to have continu everi summer as professor of divin he took upon him to confut thi error and to explain the real design of the lord supper he princip endeavor to establish that the substanc of the bread and wine in the lord supper remain the same after consecr and that the bodi and blood of christ were not substanti in them but onli figur these conclus he offer to defend publicli in the school but the religi who were now it seem get ground in the univers would not suffer ani question of thi kind to be move upon which dr wicliff without further ceremoni publish a treatis upon that subject in which he went great length and attack the doctrin of transubstanti with all the freedom of a man not hesit but fulli convinc of the truth of what he maintain dr barton wa at that time vice chancellor of oxford he wa a person of great zeal against innov in religion which he consid as the symptom of it ruin and had alway use a bitter of express in speak of dr wicliff which easili show with how much pleasur he would take hold of ani fair occas against him an occas now offer he call togeth therefor the head of the univers and find he could influenc a major obtain a decre by which wicliff doctrin wa condemn as heret and himself and hi hearer threaten if they persist in their error with imprison and excommun dr wicliff we are told wa greatli mortifi on find himself thu treat at oxford which had till now been hi sanctuari he had one resourc howev still left hi gener patron the duke of lancast to whom he resolv to fli for protect and through the hope of whose interest he appeal to the king from the vicechancellor sentenc while dr wicliff and hi follow who were now veri numer were thu censur at oxford a calumni wa rais against them which might have prove of more danger consequ it took it rise from an insurrect which at thi time alarm the whole kingdom vex by the sever exact of a sever impost the counti of kent and sussex took arm their bodi increas as it move and under the conduct of one tiler approach london with a forc greatli superior to ani tumultuari troop that could be brought against it here the rebel have done infinit mischief and brought even the govern to a treati were dispers by the mere address and resolut of the young king the behavior of richard on thi occas ought never to be omit even in a slight account of these thing as it is the onli part of hi behavior through hi whole life that deserv record when all danger wa over and the thought of the ministri were now turn upon punish the guilti great pain were taken by the enemi of wicliff to fix the odium of thi insurrect upon him but with veri littl effect for after the strictest scrutini noth wa produc to prove their accus but that one ball a priest wa seiz among the rebel whom the archbishop of canterburi had formerli thrown into prison for preach wicliff doctrin but it appear that ball wa a conceit empti fellow who through motiv of vaniti wa readi to adopt ani singular and inde the whole tenor of histori ha exculp wicliff and hi discipl on thi head by assign other and more probabl caus of thi rebellion we left dr wicliff in the midst of hi distress carri up an appeal from the univers to the king but hi appeal it seem met with no counten the duke of lancast find hi credit declin suppos probabl that the protect he afford wicliff might be the princip caus of it declin perhap too he might think thi bold reform by attack transubstanti had gone greater length than could well be warrant it is certain howev that he now for the first time desert him and when dr wicliff press hi high in the affair and urg him with religi motiv he wa answer coolli that of these thing the church wa the most proper judg and that the best advic he could give him wa to quit these novelti and submit quietli to hi ordinari wicliff find himself thu expos had onli to wrap himself in hi own integr and push through the storm as he wa abl it wa a circumst greatli against him that william courtney wa at thi time promot to the sea of canterburi simon of sudburi hi predecessor have been murder by the rebel in the late insurrect courtney when bishop of london had been wicliff most activ adversari and wa now glad to find hi hand strengthen by the addit of so much power were it onli for the abil it gave him to crush the wiclivit he highli approv therefor of what the vice chancellor of oxford had done and resolv to go vigor on with the prosecut hi pieti howev allow wicliff some respit so scrupul wa the primat even in matter of form that he forbor ani public exercis of hi offic till he should receiv the consecr pall from rome which did not arriv till the may of the next year be thu duli invest dr wicliff wa cite to appear befor him in the monasteri of the gray friar on the th day of the same month so eager wa the archbishop to enter upon thi busi but befor we proceed in the relat it may not be improp to inform the reader that we find great obscur in the account of thi part of wicliff life mani of these account differ from each other and mani be plainli contradictori all therefor which in such a case can be done is to select from a varieti of circumst such as seem most probabl and best found dr wicliff be thu cite befor the archbishop refus to appear alleg that as he wa a member of the univers and held an offic in it he wa exempt from episcop jurisdict the univers wa now it seem under differ influenc the vice chancellor wa chang and the determin of the major wa to support their member with thi plea therefor the archbishop remain satisfi but though he could not proceed against the person of wicliff he resolv howev to proceed against hi opinion when the court therefor met on the appoint day a larg collect of articl extract from hi book and sermon wa produc in the instant as the bishop and divin of which thi court consist were about to enter upon busi a violent earthquak shook the monasteri the affright bishop threw down their paper cri out the busi wa displeas to god and came to a hasti resolut to proceed no farther the archbishop alon remain unmov with equal spirit and address he chid their superstiti fear and told them that if the earthquak portend ani thing it portend the downfal of heresi that as noxiou vapor are lodg in the bowel of the earth and are expel by these violent concuss so by their strenuou endeavor the kingdom should be purifi from the pestilenti taint of heresi which had infect it in everi part thi speech togeth with the news that the earthquak had been gener through the citi as it wa afterward inde found to have been through the island dispel their fear dr wicliff would often merrili speak of thi accid and would call thi assembl the council of the heryden heryden be the old english word for earthquak the court again compos enter warmli into the busi and went through the examin of all the articl in fine they came to a determin that some of them were erron and some plainli heret thi determin wa publish and afterward answer by dr wicliff who show how much hi enemi had misrepres him in sever point and defend hi opinion with a spirit of truth and freedom which brought over mani to hi parti the primat took new offens at thi audac as he call it of wicliff and be determin at all event to crush him prefer a bill in parliament to enabl sheriff upon proper inform from bishop to proceed as far as imprison against the preacher of heresi thi bill pass the lord but wa reject by the common who be alreadi jealou of the power of the clergi were in no degre inclin to make ani addit to it the archbishop notwithstand thi

refus noth to the clergi who were so readi on all occas to compli with him letter patent therefor were immedi made out grant the full power which the archbishop requir the practic heretofor had been in case of thi kind for the king to grant special licens on particular occas thi unlimit power therefor befor unheard of wa veri disagre to the whole nation accordingli when the parliament met which it did soon after heavi complaint came from everi counti to their repres set forth how much the peopl thought themselv aggriev the alarm spread through the hous where the affair wa taken up with a

word and might bear as wide a construct as a bishop might choos to give it nor could it be doubt but it would often be made to signifi whatev the pride or avaric of the clergi might think expedi thi languag wa carri in a petit from the common to the king the king as wa usual be in want of money and afraid at thi time of disoblig the common revok the licens through the hope of a subsidi from the laiti which he had just befor grant through the hope of an aid from the clergi such were the weak polit of richard and thu wa the archbishop zeal baffl a second time in one point howev the primat succeed better he obtain letter from the king direct to the vice chancellor and proctor of the univers of oxford by which they were requir to make dilig search in their colleg and hall for all who maintain heret opinion particularli those condemn by the archbishop of canterburi and for all who had in their possess the book of john wicliff such delinqu were order to be expel the univers and the
