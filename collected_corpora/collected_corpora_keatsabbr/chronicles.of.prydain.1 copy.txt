dallben had spoken it in a whisper and with king arawn lord of annuvin dallben said know thi he continu quickli annuvin is more than a land of death it is a treasur hous not onli of gold and jewel but of all thing of advantag to men long ago the race of men own these treasur by craft and deceit arawn stole them one by one for hi own evil use some few of the treasur have been wrest from him though most lie hidden deep in annuvin where arawn guard them jealous but arawn did not becom ruler of prydain taran said you may be thank he did not said dallben he would have rule had it not been for the children of don the son of the ladi don and her consort belin king of the sun long ago they voyag to prydain from the summer countri and found the land rich and fair though the race of men had littl for themselv the son of don built their stronghold at caer dathyl far north in the eagl mountain from there they help regain at least a portion of what arawn had stolen and stood as guardian against the lurk threat of annuvin i hate to think what would have happen if the son of don hadnt come taran said it wa a good destini that brought them i am not alway sure said dallben with a wri smile the men of prydain came to reli on the strength of the hous of don as a child cling to it mother they do so even today math the high king is descend from the hous of don so is princ gwydion but that is all by the way prydain ha been at peac as much as men can be peac until now what you do not know dallben said is thi it ha reach my ear that a new and mighti warlord ha risen as power as gwydion some say more power but he is a man of evil for whom death is a black joy he sport with death as you might sport with a dog who is he cri taran dallben shook hi head no man know hi name nor ha ani man seen
