friend he smile at the angri look and gestur of trullib and tell him he wa sorri to see such men in order depart without further ceremoni chapter xv an adventur the consequ of a new instanc which parson adam gave of hi forget when he came back to the inn he found joseph and fanni sit togeth they were so far from think hi absenc long as he had fear they would that they never onc miss or thought of him inde i have been often assur by both that they spent these hour in a most delight convers but as i never could prevail on either to relat it so i can not commun it to the reader adam acquaint the lover with the ill success of hi enterpr they were all greatli confound none be abl to propos ani method of depart till joseph at last advis call in the hostess and desir her to trust them which fanni said she despair of her do as she wa one of the sourestfac women she had ever beheld but she wa agreeabl disappoint for the hostess wa no sooner ask the question than she readili agre and with a curtsi and smile wish them a good journey howev lest fanni skill in physiognomi should be call in question we will ventur to assign one reason which might probabl inclin her to thi confid and goodhumour when adam said he wa go to visit hi brother he had unwittingli impos on joseph and fanni who both believ he had meant hi natur brother and not hi brother in divin and had so inform the hostess on her enquiri after him now mr trullib had by hi profess of pieti by hi graviti auster reserv and the opinion of hi great wealth so great an author in hi parish that they all live in the utmost fear and apprehens of him it wa therefor no wonder that the hostess who knew it wa in hi option whether she should ever sell anoth mug of drink did not dare to affront hi suppos brother by deni him credit they were now just on their departur when adam recollect he had left hi greatcoat and hat at mr trullib as he wa not desir of renew hi visit the hostess herself have no servant at home offer to fetch it thi wa an unfortun expedi for the hostess wa soon undeceiv in the opinion she had entertain of adam whom trullib abus in the grossest term especi when he heard he had had the assur to pretend to be hi near relat at her return therefor she entir chang her note she said folk might be asham of travel about and pretend to be what they were not that tax were high and for her part she wa oblig to pay for what she had she could not therefor possibl nor would she trust anybodi no not her own father that money wa never scarcer and she want to make up a sum that she expect therefor they should pay their reckon befor they left the hous adam wa now greatli perplex but as he knew that he could easili have borrow such a sum in hi own parish and as he knew he would have lent it himself to ani mortal in distress so he took fresh courag and salli out all round the parish but to no purpos he return as pennyless as he went groan and lament that it wa possibl in a countri profess christian for a wretch to starv in the midst of hi fellowcreatur who abound whilst he wa gone the hostess who stay as a sort of guard with joseph and fanni entertain them with the good of parson trullib and inde he had not onli a veri good charact as to other qualiti in the neighbourhood but wa reput a man of great chariti for though he never gave a farth he had alway that word in hi mouth adam wa no sooner return the second time than the storm grew exceedingli high the hostess declar among other thing that if they offer to stir without pay her she would soon overtak them with a warrant plato and aristotl or somebodi els hath said that when the most exquisit cun fail chanc often hit the mark and that by mean the least expect virgil express thi veri boldli turn quod optanti divum promitter nemo auderet volvenda die en attulit ultro i would quot more great men if i could but my memori not permit me i will proceed to exemplifi these observ by the follow instanc there chanc for adam had not cun enough to contriv it to be at that time in the alehous a fellow who had been formerli a drummer in an irish regiment and now travel the countri as a pedlar thi man have attent listen to the discours of the hostess at last took adam asid and ask him what the sum wa for which they were detain as soon as he wa inform he sigh and said he wa sorri it wa so much for that he had no more than six shill and sixpenc in hi pocket which he would lend them with all hi heart adam gave a caper and cryd out it would do for that he had sixpenc himself and thu these poor peopl who could not engag the compass of rich and pieti were at length deliv out of their distress by the chariti of a poor pedlar i shall refer it to my reader to make what observ he pleas on thi incid it is suffici for me to inform him that after adam and hi companion had return him a thousand thank and told him where he might call to be repaid they all salli out of the hous without ani compliment from their hostess or inde without pay her ani adam declar he would take particular care never to call there again and she on her side assur them she want no such guest chapter xvi a veri curiou adventur in which mr adam gave a much greater instanc of the honest simplic of hi heart than of hi experi in the way of thi world our travel had walk about two mile from that inn which they had more reason to have mistaken for a castl than don quixot ever had ani of those in which he sojourn see they had met with such difficulti in escap out of it wall when they came to a parish and beheld a sign of invit hang

chiefli with regard to the sailor you should say the extravag of life repli the parson but admit they were the necessari there is someth more necessari than life itself which is provid by learn i mean the learn of the clergi who cloth you with pieti meek humil chariti patienc and all the other christian virtu who feed your soul with the milk of brotherli love and diet them with all the dainti food of holi which at onc cleans them of all impur carnal affect and fatten them with the truli rich spirit of grace who doth thi ay who inde cri the host for i do not rememb ever to have seen ani such cloth or such feed and so in the mean time master my servic to you adam wa go to answer with some sever when joseph and fanni return and press hi departur so eagerli that he would not refus them and so grasp hi crabstick he took leav of hi host neither of them be so well pleas with each other as they had been at their first sit down togeth and with joseph and fanni who both express much impati depart and now all togeth renew their journey book iii chapter i matter prefatori in prais of biographi notwithstand the prefer which may be vulgarli given to the author of those romanc writer who entitl their book the histori of england the histori of franc of spain c it is most certain that truth is to be found onli in the work of those who celebr the live of great men and are commonli call biograph as the other should inde be term topograph or chorograph word which might well mark the distinct between them it be the busi of the latter chiefli to describ countri and citi which with the assist of map they do pretti justli and may be depend upon but as to the action and charact of men their write are not quit so authent of which there need no other proof than those etern contradict occur between two topograph who undertak the histori of the same countri for instanc between my lord clarendon and mr whitelock between mr echard and rapin and mani other where fact be set forth in a differ light everi reader believ as he pleas and inde the more judici and suspici veri justli esteem the whole as no other than a romanc in which the writer hath indulg a happi and fertil invent but though these wide differ in the narr of fact some ascrib victori to the one and other to the other parti some repres the same man as a rogu while other give him a great and honest charact yet all agre in the scene where the fact is suppos to have happen and where the person who is both a rogu and an honest man live now with us biograph the case is differ the fact we deliv may be reli on though we often mistak the age and countri wherein they happen for though it may be worth the examin of critic whether the shepherd chrysostom who as cervant inform us die for love of the fair marcella who hate him wa ever in spain will ani one doubt but that such a silli fellow hath realli exist is there in the world such a sceptic as to disbeliev the mad of cardenio the perfidi of ferdinand the impertin curios of anselmo the weak of camilla the irresolut friendship of lothario though perhap as to the time and place where those sever person live that good historian may be deplor defici but the most known instanc of thi kind is in the true histori of gil bla where the inimit biograph hath made a notori blunder in the countri of dr sangrado who use hi patient as a vintner doth hi winevessel by let out their blood and fill them up with water doth not everi one who is the least vers in physic histori know that spain wa not the countri in which thi doctor live the same writer hath likewis er in the countri of hi archbishop as well as that of those great personag whose understand were too sublim to tast anyth but tragedi and in mani other the same mistak may likewis be observ in scarron the arabian night the histori of mariann and le paisan parvenu and perhap some few other writer of thi class whom i have not read or do not at present recollect for i would by no mean be thought to comprehend those person of surpriz geniu the author of immens romanc or the modern novel and atalanti writer who without ani assist from natur or histori record person who never were or will be and fact which never did nor possibl can happen whose hero are of their own creation and their brain the chao whenc all their materi are select not that such writer deserv no honour so far otherwis that perhap they merit the highest for what can be nobler than to be as an exampl of the wonder extent of human geniu one may appli to them what balzac say of aristotl that they are a second natur for they have no commun with the first by which author of an inferior class who can not stand alon are oblig to support themselv as with crutch but these of whom i am now speak seem to be possess of those stilt which the excel voltair tell us in hi letter carri the geniu far off but with an regular pace inde far out of the sight of the reader beyond the realm of chao and old night but to return to the former class who are content to copi natur instead of form origin from the confus heap of matter in their own brain is not such a book as that which record the achiev of the renown don quixot more worthi the name of a histori than even mariana for wherea the latter is confin to a particular period of time and to a particular nation the former is the histori of the world in gener at least that part which is polish by law art and scienc and of that from the time it wa first polish to thi day nay and forward as long as it shall so remain i shall now proceed to appli these observ to the work befor us for inde i have set them down princip to obviat some construct which the good natur of mankind who are alway forward to see their friend virtu record may put to particular part i question not but sever of my reader will know the lawyer in the stagecoach the moment they hear hi voic it is likewis odd but the wit and the prude meet with some of their acquaint as well as all the rest of my charact to prevent therefor ani such malici applic i declar here onc for all i describ not men but manner not an individu but a speci perhap it will be answer are not the charact then taken from life to which i answer in the affirm nay i believ i might aver that i have writ littl more than i have seen the lawyer is not onli aliv but hath been so these four thousand year and i hope g will indulg hi life as mani yet to come he hath not inde confin himself to one profess one religion or one countri but when the first mean selfish creatur appear on the human stage who made self the centr of the whole creation would give himself no pain incur no danger advanc no money to assist or preserv hi fellowcreatur then wa our lawyer born and whilst such a person as i have describ exist on earth so long shall he remain upon it it is therefor do him littl honour to imagin he endeavour to mimick some littl obscur fellow becaus he happen to resembl him in one particular featur or perhap in hi profess wherea hi appear in the world is calcul for much more gener and nobl purpos not to expos one piti wretch to the small and contempt circl of hi acquaint but to hold the glass to thousand in their closet that they may contempl their deform and endeavour to reduc it and thu by suffer privat mortif may avoid public shame thi place the boundari between and distinguish the satirist from the libel for the former privat correct the fault for the benefit of the person like a parent the latter publickli expos the person himself as an exampl to other like an execution there are besid littl circumst to be consid as the draperi of a pictur which though fashion vari at differ time the resembl of the counten is not by those mean diminish thu i believ we may ventur to say mr towwous is coeval with our lawyer and though perhap dure the chang which so long an exist must have pass through she may in her turn have stood behind the bar at an inn i will not scrupl to affirm she hath likewis in the revolut of age sat on a throne in short where extrem turbul of temper avaric and an insens of human miseri with a degre of hypocrisi have unit in a femal composit mr towwous wa that woman and where a good inclin eclips by a poverti of spirit and understand hath glimmer forth in a man that man hath been no other than her sneak husband i shall detain my reader no longer than to give him one caution more of an opposit kind for as in most of our particular charact we mean not to lash individu but all of the like sort so in our gener descript we mean not univers but would be understood with mani except for instanc in our descript of high peopl we can not be intend to includ such as whilst they are an honour to their high rank by a wellguid condescens make their superior as easi as possibl to those whom fortun chiefli hath place below them of thi number i could name a peer no less elev by natur than by fortun who whilst he wear the noblest ensign of honour on hi person bear the truest stamp of digniti on hi mind adorn with great enrich with knowledg and embellish with geniu i have seen thi man reliev with generos while he hath convers with freedom and be to the same person a patron and a companion i could name a common rais higher abov the multitud by superior talent than is in the power of hi princ to exalt him whose behaviour to those he hath oblig is more amiabl than the oblig itself and who is so great a master of affabl that if he could divest himself of an inher great in hi manner would often make the lowest of hi acquaint forget who wa the master of that palac in which they are so courteous entertain these are pictur which must be i believ known i declar they are taken from the life and not intend to exceed it by those high peopl therefor whom i have describ i mean a set of wretch who while they are a disgrac to their ancestor whose honour and fortun they inherit or perhap a greater to their mother for such degeneraci is scarc credibl have the insol to treat those with disregard who are at least equal to the founder of their own splendor it is i fanci imposs to conceiv a spectacl more worthi of our indign than that of a fellow who is not onli a blot in the escutcheon of a great famili but a scandal to the human speci maintain a supercili behaviour to men who are an honour to their natur and a disgrac to their fortun and now reader take these hint along with you you may if you pleas proceed to the sequel of thi our true histori chapter ii a night scene wherein sever wonder adventur befel adam and hi fellowtravel it wa so late when our travel left the inn or alehous for it might be call either that they had not travel mani mile befor night overtook them or met them which you pleas the reader must excus me if i am not particular as to the way they took for as we are now draw near the seat of the boobi and as that is a ticklish name which malici person may appli accord to their evil inclin to sever worthi countri squir a race of men whom we look upon as entir inoffens and for whom we have an adequ regard we shall lend no assist to ani such malici purpos dark had now overspread the hemispher when fanni whisper joseph that she beg to rest herself a littl for that she wa so tire she could walk no farther joseph immedi prevail with parson adam who wa as brisk as a bee to stop he had no sooner seat

accord to milton dark visibl thi wa a circumst howev veri favour to joseph for fanni not suspici of be overseen by adam gave a loos to her passion which she had never done befor and reclin her head on hi bosom threw her arm carelessli round him and suffer him to lay hi cheek close to her all thi infus such happi into joseph that he would not have chang hi turf for the finest down in the finest palac in the univers adam sat at some distanc from the lover and be unwil to disturb them appli himself to medit in which he had not spent much time befor he discov a light at some distanc that seem approach toward him he immedi hail it but to hi sorrow and surpriz it stop for a moment and then disappear he then call to joseph ask him if he had not seen the light joseph answer he hadand did you not mark how it vanish return he though i am not afraid of ghost i do not absolut disbeliev them he then enter into a medit on those unsubstanti be which wa soon interrupt by sever voic which he thought almost at hi elbow though in fact they were not so extrem near howev he could distinctli hear them agre on the murder of ani one they met and a littl after heard one of them say he had kill a dozen sinc that day fortnight adam now fell on hi knee and commit himself to the care of provid and poor fanni who likewis heard those terribl word embrac joseph so close that had not he whose ear were also open been apprehens on her account he would have thought no danger which threaten onli himself too dear a price for such embrac joseph now drew forth hi penknif and adam have finish hi ejacul grasp hi crabstick hi onli weapon and come up to joseph would have had him quit fanni and place her in the rear but hi advic wa fruitless she clung closer to him not at all regard the presenc of adam and in a sooth voic declar she would die in hi arm joseph clasp her with inexpress eager whisper her that he prefer death in her to life out of them adam brandish hi crabstick said he despis death as much as ani man and then repeat aloud est hic est animu luci contemptor et illum qui vita bene credat emi quo tendi honorem upon thi the voic ceas for a moment and then one of them call out dn you who is there to which adam wa prudent enough to make no repli and of a sudden he observ halfadozen light which seem to rise all at onc from the ground and advanc briskli toward him thi he immedi conclud to be an apparit and now begin to conceiv that the voic were of the same kind he call out in the name of the ld what wouldst thou have he had no sooner spoke than he heard one of the voic cri out dn them here they come and soon after heard sever hearti blow as if a number of men had been engag at quarterstaff he wa just advanc toward the place of combat when joseph catch him by the skirt beg him that they might take the opportun of the dark to convey away fanni from the danger which threaten her he present compli and joseph lift up fanni they all three made the best of their way and without look behind them or be overtaken they had travel full two mile poor fanni not onc complain of be tire when they saw afar off sever light scatter at a small distanc from each other and at the same time found themselv on the descent of a veri steep hill adamss foot slip he instantli disappear which greatli frighten both joseph and fanni inde if the light had permit them to see it they would scarc have refrain laugh to see the parson roll down the hill which he did from top to bottom without receiv ani harm he then hollow as loud as he could to inform them of hi safeti and reliev them from the fear which they had conceiv for him joseph and fanni halt some time consid what to do at last they advanc a few pace where the decliv seem least steep and then joseph take hi fanni in hi arm walk firmli down the hill without make a fals step and at length land her at the bottom where adam soon came to them learn henc my fair countrywomen to consid your own weak and the mani occas on which the strength of a man may be use to you and duli weigh thi take care that you match not yourselv with the spindleshank beau and petitmaîtr of the age who instead of be abl like

nearest light present itself and have cross a common field they came to a meadow where they seem to be at a veri littl distanc from the light when to their grief they arriv at the bank of a river adam here made a full stop and declar he could swim but doubt how it wa possibl to get fanni over to which joseph answer if they walk along it bank they might be certain of soon find a bridg especi as by
