had i not had him to urg and draw me after him especi as i beheld a man who must have come out of the gardendoor keep us in hi eye run backward and forward beckon and call out to other whom i suppos

endeavor to put it out of my power to do so in short that he who had art forborn to send for my letter for he could not be watch my dear lest he should find in it a countermand to my appoint as i myself could apprehend although i profit not by the apprehens would want a devic to keep me with him till the danger of have our meet discov might throw me absolut into hi power to avoid my own wors usag and the mischief which might have ensu perhap in my veri sight had my friend and he met but if it shall come out that the person within the garden wa hi corrupt implement employ to frighten me away with him do you think my dear that i shall not have reason to hate him and myself still more i hope hi heart can not be so deep and so vile a one i hope not but how came it to pass that one man could get out at the gardendoor and no more how that that man kept aloof as it were and pursu us not nor run back to alarm the hous my fright and my distanc would not let me be certain but realli thi singl man had the air of that vile joseph leman as i recollect o whi whi my dear friend but wherefor blame i them when i had argu myself into a hope not improb that even the dread trial i wa to

thi gave him opportun to proceed and that he did assum a still more seriou air as to what further remain for him to say in answer to what i had said he hope i would pardon him but upon hi soul he wa concern infinit concern he repeat hi color and hi voic rise that it wa necessari for him to observ how much i chose rather to have run the risqu of be solmess wife than to have it in my power to
