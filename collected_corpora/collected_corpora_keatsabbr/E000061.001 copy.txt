optick or a treatis of the reflect refract inflect and colour of light the fourth edit correct by sir isaac newton knt london print for william inni at the westend of st paul mdccxxx titl page of the edit sir isaac newton advertis advertis i part of the ensu discours about light wa written at the desir of some gentlemen of the royalsocieti in the year and then sent to their secretari and read at their meet and the rest wa ad about twelv year after to complet the theori except the third book and the last proposit of the second which were sinc put togeth out of scatterd paper to avoid be engag in disput about these matter i have hitherto delay the print and should still have delay it had not the importun of friend prevail upon me if ani other paper writ on thi subject are got out of my hand they are imperfect and were perhap written befor i had tri all the experi here set down and fulli satisfi my self about the law of refract and composit of colour i have here publishd what i think proper to come abroad wish that it may not be translat into anoth languag without my consent the crown of colour which sometim appear about the sun and moon i have endeavour to give an account of but for want of suffici observ leav that matter to be farther examin the subject of the third book i have also left imperfect not have tri all the experi which i intend when i wa about these matter nor repeat some of those which i did tri until i had satisfi my self about all their circumst to commun what i have tri and leav the rest to other for farther enquiri is all my design in publish these paper in a letter written to mr leibnitz in the year and publish by dr walli i mentiond a method by which i had found some gener theorem about squar curvilinear figur or compar them with the conic section or other the simplest figur with which they may be compar and some year ago i lent out a manuscript contain such theorem and have sinc met with some thing copi out of it i have on thi occas made it publick prefix to it an introduct and subjoin a scholium concern that method and i have join with it anoth small tract concern the curvilinear figur of the second kind which wa also written mani year ago and made known to some friend who have solicit the make it publick i n april advertis ii in thi second edit of these optick i have omit the mathemat tract publishd at the end of the former edit as not belong to the subject and at the end of the third book i have ad some question and to shew that i do not take graviti for an essenti properti of bodi i have ad one question concern it caus chuse to propos it by way of a question becaus i am not yet satisfi about it for want of experi i n juli advertis to thi fourth edit thi new edit of sir isaac newton optick is care print from the third edit as it wa correct by the author own hand and left befor hi death with the booksel sinc sir isaac lection opticæ which he publickli read in the univers of cambridg in the year and are late print it ha been thought proper to make at the bottom of the page sever citat from thenc where may be found the demonstr which the author omit in these optick transcrib note there are sever greek letter use in the descript of the illustr they are signifi by greek letter squar root are note by the letter sqrt befor the equat the first book of optick part i my design in thi book is not to explain the properti of light by hypothes but to propos and prove them by reason and experi in order to which i shall premis the follow definit and axiom definit defin i by the ray of light i understand it least part and those as well success in the same line as contemporari in sever line for it is manifest that light consist of part both success and contemporari becaus in the same place you may stop that which come one moment and let pass that which come present after and in the same time you may stop it in ani one place and let it pass in ani other for that part of light which is stoppd can not be the same with that which is let pass the least light or part of light which may be stoppd alon without the rest of the light or propag alon or do or suffer ani thing alon which the rest of the light doth not or suffer not i call a ray of light defin ii refrang of the ray of light is their disposit to be refract or turn out of their way in pass out of one transpar bodi or medium into anoth and a greater or less refrang of ray is their disposit to be turn more or less out of their way in like incid on the same medium mathematician usual consid the ray of light to be line reach from the lumin bodi to the bodi illumin and the refract of those ray to be the bend or break of those line in their pass out of one medium into anoth and thu may ray and refract be consid if light be propag in an instant but by an argument taken from the æquation of the time of the eclips of jupit satellit it seem that light is propag in time spend in it passag from the sun to us about seven minut of time and therefor i have chosen to defin ray and refract in such gener term as may agre to light in both case defin iii reflex of ray is their disposit to be reflect or turn back into the same medium from ani other medium upon whose surfac they fall and ray are more or less reflex which are turn back more or less easili as if light pass out of a glass into air and by be inclin more and more to the common surfac of the glass and air begin at length to be total reflect by that surfac those sort of ray which at like incid are reflect most copious or by inclin the ray begin soonest to be total reflect are most reflex defin iv the angl of incid is that angl which the line describ by the incid ray contain with the perpendicular to the reflect or refract surfac at the point of incid defin v the angl of reflexion or refract is the angl which the line describ by the reflect or refract ray containeth with the perpendicular to the reflect or refract surfac at the point of incid defin vi the sine of incid reflexion and refract are the sine of the angl of incid reflexion and refract defin vii the light whose ray are all alik refrang i call simpl homogen and similar and that whose ray are some more refrang than other i call compound heterogen and dissimilar the former light i call homogen not becaus i would affirm it so in all respect but becaus the ray which agre in refrang agre at least in all those their other properti which i consid in the follow discours defin viii the colour of homogen light i call primari homogen and simpl and those of heterogen light heterogen and compound for these are alway compound of the colour of homogen light as will appear in the follow discours axiom ax i the angl of reflexion and refract lie in one and the same plane with the angl of incid ax ii the angl of reflexion is equal to the angl of incid ax iii if the refract ray be return directli back to the point of incid it shall be refract into the line befor describ by the incid ray ax iv refract out of the rarer medium into the denser is made toward the perpendicular that is so that the angl of refract be less than the angl of incid ax v the sine of incid is either accur or veri nearli in a given ratio to the sine of refract whenc if that proport be known in ani one inclin of the incid ray ti known in all the inclin and therebi the refract in all case of incid on the same refract bodi may be determin thu if the refract be made out of air into water the sine of incid of the red light is to the sine of it refract as to if out of air into glass the sine are as to in light of other colour the sine have other proport but the differ is so littl that it need seldom be consid illustr fig suppos therefor that rs in fig repres the surfac of stagnat water and that c is the point of incid in which ani ray come in the air from a in the line ac is reflect or refract and i would know whither thi ray shall go after reflexion or refract i erect upon the surfac of the water from the point of incid the perpendicular cp and produc it downward to q and conclud by the first axiom that the ray after reflexion and refract shall be found somewher in the plane of the angl of incid acp produc i let fall therefor upon the perpendicular cp the sine of incid ad and if the reflect ray be desir i produc ad to b so that db be equal to ad and draw cb for thi line cb shall be the reflect ray the angl of reflexion bcp and it sine bd be equal to the angl and sine of incid as they ought to be by the second axiom but if the refract ray be desir i produc ad to h so that dh may be to ad as the sine of refract to the sine of incid that is if the light be red as to and about the center c and in the plane acp with the radiu ca describ a circl abe i draw a parallel to the perpendicular cpq the line he cut the circumfer in e and join ce thi line ce shall be the line of the refract ray for if ef be let fall perpendicularli on the line pq thi line ef shall be the sine of refract of the ray ce the angl of refract be ecq and thi sine ef is equal to dh and consequ in proport to the sine of incid ad as to in like manner if there be a prism of glass that is a glass bound with two equal and parallel triangular end and three plain and well polish side which meet in three parallel line run from the three angl of one end to the three angl of the other end and if the refract of the light in pass cross thi prism be desir let acb in fig repres a plane cut thi prism transversli to it three parallel line or edg there where the light passeth through it and let de be the ray incid upon the first side of the prism ac where the light goe into the glass and by put the proport of the sine of incid to the sine of refract as to find ef the first refract ray then take thi ray for the incid ray upon the second side of the glass bc where the light goe out find the next refract ray fg by put the proport of the sine of incid to the sine of refract as to for if the sine of incid out of air into glass be to the sine of refract as to the sine of incid out of glass into air must on the contrari be to the sine of refract as to by the third axiom illustr fig much after the same manner if acbd in fig repres a glass spheric convex on both side usual call a len such as is a burningglass or spectacleglass or an objectglass of a telescop and it be requir to know how light fall upon it from ani lucid point q shall be refract let qm repres a ray fall upon ani point m of it first spheric surfac acb and by erect a perpendicular to the glass at the point m find the first refract ray mn by the proport of the sine to let that ray in go out of the glass be incid upon n and then find the second refract ray nq by the proport of the sine to and after the same manner may the refract be found when the len is convex on one side and plane or concav on the other or concav on both side illustr fig ax vi homogen ray which flow from sever point of ani object and fall perpendicularli or almost perpendicularli on ani reflect or refract plane or spheric surfac shall afterward diverg from so mani other point or be parallel to so mani other line or converg to so mani other point either accur or without ani sensibl error and the same thing will happen if the ray be reflect or refract success by two or three or more plane or spheric surfac the point from which ray diverg or to which they converg may be call their focu and the focu of the incid ray be given that of the reflect or refract one may be found by find the refract of ani two ray as abov or more readili thu ca let acb in fig be a reflect or refract plane and q the focu of the incid ray and qqc a perpendicular to that plane and if thi perpendicular be produc to q so that qc be equal to qc the point q shall be the focu of the reflect ray or if qc be taken on the same side of the plane with qc and in proport to qc as the sine of incid to the sine of refract the point q shall be the focu of the refract ray illustr fig ca let acb in fig be the reflect surfac of ani sphere whose centr is e bisect ani radiu thereof suppos ec in t and if in that radiu on the same side the point t you take the point q and q so that tq te and tq be continu proport and the point q be the focu of the incid ray the point q shall be the focu of the reflect one illustr fig ca let acb in fig be the refract surfac of ani sphere whose centr is e in ani radiu thereof ec produc both way take et and ct equal to one anoth and sever in such proport to that radiu as the lesser of the sine of incid and refract hath to the differ of those sine and then if in the same line you find ani two point q and q so that tq be to et as et to tq take tq the contrari way from t which tq lieth from t and if the point q be the focu of ani incid ray the point q shall be the focu of the refract one illustr fig and by the same mean the focu of the ray after two or more reflexion or refract may be found illustr fig ca let acbd in fig be ani refract len spheric convex or concav or plane on either side and let cd be it axi that is the line which cut both it surfac perpendicularli and pass through the centr of the sphere and in thi axi produc let f and f be the foci of the refract ray found as abov when the incid ray on both side the len are parallel to the same axi and upon the diamet ff bisect in e describ a circl suppos now that ani point q be the focu of ani incid ray draw qe cut the said circl in t and t and therein take tq in such proport to te as te or te hath to tq let tq lie the contrari way from t which tq doth from t and q shall be the focu of the refract ray without ani sensibl error provid the point q be not so remot from the axi nor the len so broad as to make ani of the ray fall too obliqu on the refract surfacesa and by the like oper may the reflect or refract surfac be found when the two foci are given and therebi a len be form which shall make the ray flow toward or from what place you pleaseb so then the mean of thi axiom is that if ray fall upon ani plane or spheric surfac or len and befor their incid flow from or toward ani point q they shall after reflexion or refract flow from or toward the point q found by the forego rule and if the incid ray flow from or toward sever point q the reflect or refract ray shall flow from or toward so mani other point q found by the same rule whether the reflect and refract ray flow from or toward the point q is easili known by the situat of that point for if that point be on the same side of the reflect or refract surfac or len with the point q and the incid ray flow from the point q the reflect flow toward the point q and the refract from it and if the incid ray flow toward q the reflect flow from q and the refract toward it and the contrari happen when q is on the other side of the surfac ax vii wherev the ray which come from all the point of ani object meet again in so mani point after they have been made to converg by reflect or refract there they will make a pictur of the object upon ani white bodi on which they fall so if pr in fig repres ani object without door and ab be a len place at a hole in the windowshut of a dark chamber wherebi the ray that come from ani point q of that object are made to converg and meet again in the point q and if a sheet of white paper be held at q for the light there to fall upon it the pictur of that object pr will appear upon the paper in it proper shape and colour for as the light which come from the point q goe to the point q so the light which come from other point p and r of the object will go to so mani other correspond point p and r as is manifest by the sixth axiom so that everi point of the object shall illumin a correspond point of the pictur and therebi make a pictur like the object in shape and colour thi onli except that the pictur shall be invert and thi is the reason of that vulgar experi of cast the speci of object from abroad upon a wall or sheet of white paper in a dark room in like manner when a man view ani object pqr in fig the light which come from the sever point of the object is so refract by the transpar skin and humour of the eye that is by the outward coat efg call the tunica cornea and by the crystallin humour ab which is beyond the pupil mk as to converg and meet again in so mani point in the bottom of the eye and there to paint the pictur of the object upon that skin call the tunica retina with which the bottom of the eye is cover for anatomist when they have taken off from the bottom of the eye that outward and most thick coat call the dura mater can then see through the thinner coat the pictur of object live paint thereon and these pictur propag by motion along the fibr of the optick nerv into the brain are the caus of vision for accordingli as these pictur are perfect or imperfect the object is seen perfectli or imperfectli if the eye be ting with ani colour as in the diseas of the jaundic so as to ting the pictur in the bottom of the eye with that colour then all object appear ting with the same colour if the humour of the eye by old age decay so as by shrink to make the cornea and coat of the crystallin humour grow flatter than befor the light will not be refract enough and for want of a suffici refract will not converg to the bottom of the eye but to some place beyond it and by consequ paint in the bottom of the eye a confus pictur and accord to the indistinct of thi pictur the object will appear confus thi is the reason of the decay of sight in old men and shew whi their sight is mend by spectacl for those convex glass suppli the defect of plump in the eye and by increas the refract make the ray converg sooner so as to conven distinctli at the bottom of the eye if the glass have a due degre of convex and the contrari happen in shortsight men whose eye are too plump for the refract be now too great the ray converg and conven in the eye befor they come at the bottom and therefor the pictur made in the bottom and the vision caus therebi will not be distinct unless the object be brought so near the eye as that the place where the converg ray conven may be remov to the bottom or that the plump of the eye be taken off and the refract diminish by a concaveglass of a due degre of concav or lastli that by age the eye grow flatter till it come to a due figur for shortsight men see remot object best in old age and therefor they are account to have the most last eye illustr fig ax viii an object seen by reflexion or refract appear in that place from whenc the ray after their last reflexion or refract diverg in fall on the spectat eye illustr fig if the object a in fig be seen by reflexion of a lookingglass mn it shall appear not in it proper place a but behind the glass at a from whenc ani ray ab ac ad which flow from one and the same point of the object do after their reflexion made in the point b c d diverg in go from the glass to e f g where they are incid on the spectat eye for these ray do make the same pictur in the bottom of the eye as if they had come from the object realli place at a without the interposit of the lookingglass and all vision is made accord to the place and shape of that pictur in like manner the object d in fig seen through a prism appear not in it proper place d but is thenc translat to some other place d situat in the last refract ray fg drawn backward from f to d illustr fig and so the object q in fig seen through the len ab appear at the place q from whenc the ray diverg in pass from the len to the eye now it is to be note that the imag of the object at q is so much bigger or lesser than the object it self at q as the distanc of the imag at q from the len ab is bigger or less than the distanc of the object at q from the same len and if the object be seen through two or more such convex or concaveglass everi glass shall make a new imag and the object shall appear in the place of the big of the last imag which consider unfold the theori of microscop and telescop for that theori consist in almost noth els than the describ such glass as shall make the last imag of ani object as distinct and larg and lumin as it can conveni be made i have now given in axiom and their explic the sum of what hath hitherto been treat of in optick for what hath been gener agre on i content my self to assum under the notion of principl in order to what i have farther to write and thi may suffic for an introduct to reader of quick wit and good understand not yet vers in optick although those who are alreadi acquaint with thi scienc and have handl glass will more readili apprehend what followeth footnot a in our author lection opticæ part i sect iv prop there is an eleg method of determin these foci not onli in spheric surfac but likewis in ani other curv figur whatev and in prop the same thing is done for ani ray lie out of the axi b ibid prop proposit prop i theor i light which differ in colour differ also in degre of refrang the proof by experi exper i took a black oblong stiff paper termin by parallel side and with a perpendicular right line drawn cross from one side to the other distinguish it into two equal part one of these part i paint with a red colour and the other with a blue the paper wa veri black and the colour intens and thickli laid on that the phænomenon might be more conspicu thi paper i viewd through a prism of solid glass whose two side through which the light pass to the eye were plane and well polish and contain an angl of about sixti degre which angl i call the refract angl of the prism and whilst i viewd it i held it and the prism befor a window in such manner that the side of the paper were parallel to the prism and both those side and the prism were parallel to the horizon and the cross line wa also parallel to it and that the light which fell from the window upon the paper made an angl with the paper equal to that angl which wa made with the same paper by the light reflect from it to the eye beyond the prism wa the wall of the chamber under the window cover over with black cloth and the cloth wa involv in dark that no light might be reflect from thenc which in pass by the edg of the paper to the eye might mingl itself with the light of the paper and obscur the phænomenon thereof these thing be thu order i found that if the refract angl of the prism be turn upward so that the paper may seem to be lift upward by the refract it blue half will be lift higher by the refract than it red half but if the refract angl of the prism be turn downward so that the paper may seem to be carri lower by the refract it blue half will be carri someth lower therebi than it red half wherefor in both case the light which come from the blue half of the paper through the prism to the eye doe in like circumst suffer a greater refract than the light which come from the red half and by consequ is more refrang illustr in the eleventh figur mn repres the window and de the paper termin with parallel side dj and he and by the transvers line fg distinguish into two half the one dg of an intens blue colour the other fe of an intens red and baccab repres the prism whose refract plane abba and acca meet in the edg of the refract angl aa thi edg aa be upward is parallel both to the horizon and to the paralleledg of the paper dj and he and the transvers line fg is perpendicular to the plane of the window and de repres the imag of the paper seen by refract upward in such manner that the blue half dg is carri higher to dg than the red half fe is to fe and therefor suffer a greater refract if the edg of the refract angl be turn downward the imag of the paper will be refract downward suppos to greek de and the blue half will be refract lower to greek dg than the red half is to greek pe illustr fig exper about the aforesaid paper whose two half were paint over with red and blue and which wa stiff like thin pasteboard i lap sever time a slender thred of veri black silk in such manner that the sever part of the thred might appear upon the colour like so mani black line drawn over them or like long and slender dark shadow cast upon them i might have drawn black line with a pen but the thred were smaller and better defin thi paper thu colour and line i set against a wall perpendicularli to the horizon so that one of the colour might stand to the right hand and the other to the left close befor the paper at the confin of the colour below i place a candl to illumin the paper strongli for the experi wa tri in the night the flame of the candl reach up to the lower edg of the paper or a veri littl higher then at the distanc of six feet and one or two inch from the paper upon the floor i erect a glass len four inch and a quarter broad which might collect the ray come from the sever point of the paper and make them converg toward so mani other point at the same distanc of six feet and one or two inch on the other side of the len and so form the imag of the colour paper upon a white paper place there after the same manner that a len at a hole in a window cast the imag of object abroad upon a sheet of white paper in a dark room the aforesaid white paper erect perpendicular to the horizon and to the ray which fell upon it from the len i move sometim toward the len sometim from it to find the place where the imag of the blue and red part of the colour paper appear most distinct those place i easili knew by the imag of the black line which i had made by wind the silk about the paper for the imag of those fine and slender line which by reason of their black were like shadow on the colour were confus and scarc visibl unless when the colour on either side of each line were termin most distinctli note therefor as dilig as i could the place where the imag of the red and blue half of the colour paper appear most distinct i found that where the red half of the paper appear distinct the blue half appear confus so that the black line drawn upon it could scarc be seen and on the contrari where the blue half appear most distinct the red half appear confus so that the black line upon it were scarc visibl and between the two place where these imag appear distinct there wa the distanc of an inch and a half the distanc of the white paper from the len when the imag of the red half of the colour paper appear most distinct be greater by an inch and an half than the distanc of the same white paper from the len when the imag of the blue half appear most distinct in like incid therefor of the blue and red upon the len the blue wa refract more by the len than the red so as to converg sooner by an inch and a half and therefor is more refrang illustr in the twelfth figur p de signifi the colour paper dg the blue half fe the red half mn the len hj the white paper in that place where the red half with it black line appear distinct and hi the same paper in that place where the blue half appear distinct the place hi wa nearer to the len mn than the place hj by an inch and an half scholium the same thing succeed notwithstand that some of the circumst be vari as in the first experi when the prism and paper are ani way inclin to the horizon and in both when colour line are drawn upon veri black paper but in the descript of these experi i have set down such circumst by which either the phænomenon might be renderd more conspicu or a novic might more easili tri them or by which i did tri them onli the same thing i have often done in the follow experi concern all which thi one admonit may suffic now from these experi it follow not that all the light of the blue is more refrang than all the light of the red for both light are mix of ray differ refrang so that in the red there are some ray not less refrang than those of the blue and in the blue there are some ray not more refrang than those of the red but these ray in proport to the whole light are but few and serv to diminish the event of the experi but are not abl to destroy it for if the red and blue colour were more dilut and weak the distanc of the imag would be less than an inch and a half and if they were more intens and full that distanc would be greater as will appear hereaft these experi may suffic for the colour of natur bodi for in the colour made by the refract of prism thi proposit will appear by the experi which are now to follow in the next proposit prop ii theor ii the light of the sun consist of ray differ refrang the proof by experi illustr fig illustr fig exper in a veri dark chamber at a round hole about one third part of an inch broad made in the shut of a window i place a glass prism wherebi the beam of the sun light which came in at that hole might be refract upward toward the opposit wall of the chamber and there form a colourd imag of the sun the axi of the prism that is the line pass through the middl of the prism from one end of it to the other end parallel to the edg of the refract angl wa in thi and the follow experi perpendicular to the incid ray about thi axi i turn the prism slowli and saw the refract light on the wall or colour imag of the sun first to descend and then to ascend between the descent and ascent when the imag seem stationari i stoppd the prism and fixd it in that postur that it should be move no more for in that postur the refract of the light at the two side of the refract angl that is at the entranc of the ray into the prism and at their go out of it were equal to one anotherc so also in other experi as often as i would have the refract on both side the prism to be equal to one anoth i note the place where the imag of the sun form by the refract light stood still between it two contrari motion in the common period of it progress and regress and when the imag fell upon that place i made fast the prism and in thi postur as the most conveni it is to be understood that all the prism are place in the follow experi unless where some other postur is describ the prism therefor be place in thi postur i let the refract light fall perpendicularli upon a sheet of white paper at the opposit wall of the chamber and observ the figur and dimens of the solar imag form on the paper by that light thi imag wa oblong and not oval but termin with two rectilinear and parallel side and two semicircular end on it side it wa bound pretti distinctli but on it end veri confusedli and indistinctli the light there decay and vanish by degre the breadth of thi imag answer to the sun diamet and wa about two inch and the eighth part of an inch includ the penumbra for the imag wa eighteen feet and an half distant from the prism and at thi distanc that breadth if diminish by the diamet of the hole in the windowshut that is by a quarter of an inch subtend an angl at the prism of about half a degre which is the sun appar diamet but the length of the imag wa about ten inch and a quarter and the length of the rectilinear side about eight inch and the refract angl of the prism wherebi so great a length wa made wa degre with a less angl the length of the imag wa less the breadth remain the same if the prism wa turn about it axi that way which made the ray emerg more obliqu out of the second refract surfac of the prism the imag soon becam an inch or two longer or more and if the prism wa turn about the contrari way so as to make the ray fall more obliqu on the first refract surfac the imag soon becam an inch or two shorter and therefor in tri thi experi i wa as curiou as i could be in place the prism by the abovementiond rule exactli in such a postur that the refract of the ray at their emerg out of the prism might be equal to that at their incid on it thi prism had some vein run along within the glass from one end to the other which scatter some of the sun light irregularli but had no sensibl effect in increas the length of the colour spectrum for i tri the same experi with other prism with the same success and particularli with a prism which seem free from such vein and whose refract angl wa degre i found the length of the imag or inch at the distanc of feet from the prism the breadth of the hole in the windowshut be of an inch as befor and becaus it is easi to commit a mistak in place the prism in it due postur i repeat the experi four or five time and alway found the length of the imag that which is set down abov with anoth prism of clearer glass and better polish which seem free from vein and whose refract angl wa degre the length of thi imag at the same distanc of feet wa also about inch or beyond these measur for about a or of an inch at either end of the spectrum the light of the cloud seem to be a littl ting with red and violet but so veri faintli that i suspect that tinctur might either wholli or in great measur aris from some ray of the spectrum scatter irregularli by some inequ in the substanc and polish of the glass and therefor i did not includ it in these measur now the differ magnitud of the hole in the windowshut and differ thick of the prism where the ray pass through it and differ inclin of the prism to the horizon made no sensibl chang in the length of the imag neither did the differ matter of the prism make ani for in a vessel made of polish plate of glass cement togeth in the shape of a prism and fill with water there is the like success of the experi accord to the quantiti of the refract it is farther to be observ that the ray went on in right line from the prism to the imag and therefor at their veri go out of the prism had all that inclin to one anoth from which the length of the imag proceed that is the inclin of more than two degre and an half and yet accord to the law of optick vulgarli receiv they could not possibl be so much inclin to one anotherd for let eg fig p repres the windowshut f the hole made therein through which a beam of the sun light wa transmit into the darken chamber and abc a triangular imaginari plane wherebi the prism is feign to be cut transvers through the middl of the light or if you pleas let abc repres the prism it self look directli toward the spectat eye with it nearer end and let xy be the sun mn the paper upon which the solar imag or spectrum is cast and pt the imag it self whose side toward v and w are rectilinear and parallel and end toward p and t semicircular ykhp and xljt are two ray the first of which come from the lower part of the sun to the higher part of the imag and is refract in the prism at k and h and the latter come from the higher part of the sun to the lower part of the imag and is refract at l and j sinc the refract on both side the prism are equal to one anoth that is the refract at k equal to the refract at j and the refract at l equal to the refract at h so that the refract of the incid ray at k and l taken togeth are equal to the refract of the emerg ray at h and j taken togeth it follow by ad equal thing to equal thing that the refract at k and h taken togeth are equal to the refract at j and l taken togeth and therefor the two ray be equal refract have the same inclin to one anoth after refract which they had befor that is the inclin of half a degre answer to the sun diamet for so great wa the inclin of the ray to one anoth befor refract so then the length of the imag pt would by the rule of vulgar optick subtend an angl of half a degre at the prism and by consequ be equal to the breadth vw and therefor the imag would be round thu it would be were the two ray xljt and ykhp and all the rest which form the imag pwtv alik refrang and therefor see by experi it is found that the imag is not round but about five time longer than broad the ray which go to the upper end p of the imag suffer the greatest refract must be more refrang than those which go to the lower end t unless the inequ of refract be casual thi imag or spectrum pt wa colour be red at it least refract end t and violet at it most refract end p and yellow green and blue in the intermedi space which agre with the first proposit that light which differ in colour do also differ in refrang the length of the imag in the forego experi i measur from the faintest and outmost red at one end to the faintest and outmost blue at the other end except onli a littl penumbra whose breadth scarc exceed a quarter of an inch as wa said abov exper in the sun beam which wa propag into the room through the hole in the windowshut at the distanc of some feet from the hole i held the prism in such a postur that it axi might be perpendicular to that beam then i look through the prism upon the hole and turn the prism to and fro about it axi to make the imag of the hole ascend and descend when between it two contrari motion it seem stationari i stoppd the prism that the refract of both side of the refract angl might be equal to each other as in the former experi in thi situat of the prism view through it the said hole i observ the length of it refract imag to be mani time greater than it breadth and that the most refract part thereof appear violet the least refract red the middl part blue green and yellow in order the same thing happend when i remov the prism out of the sun light and look through it upon the hole shine by the light of the cloud beyond it and yet if the refract were done regularli accord to one certain proport of the sine of incid and refract as is vulgarli suppos the refract imag ought to have appear round so then by these two experi it appear that in equal incid there is a consider inequ of refract but whenc thi inequ aris whether it be that some of the incid ray are refract more and other less constantli or by chanc or that one and the same ray is by refract disturb shatterd dilat and as it were split and spread into mani diverg ray as grimaldo suppos doe not yet appear by these experi but will appear by those that follow exper consid therefor that if in the third experi the imag of the sun should be drawn out into an oblong form either by a dilat of everi ray or by ani other casual inequ of the refract the same oblong imag would by a second refract made sideway be drawn out as much in breadth by the like dilat of the ray or other casual inequ of the refract sideway i tri what would be the effect of such a second refract for thi end i order all thing as in the third experi and then place a second prism immedi after the first in a cross posit to it that it might again refract the beam of the sun light which came to it through the first prism in the first prism thi beam wa refract upward and in the second sideway and i found that by the refract of the second prism the breadth of the imag wa not increas but it superior part which in the first prism suffer the greater refract and appear violet and blue did again in the second prism suffer a greater refract than it inferior part which appear red and yellow and thi without ani dilat of the imag in breadth illustr fig illustr let s fig repres the sun f the hole in the window abc the first prism dh the second prism y the round imag of the sun made by a direct beam of light when the prism are taken away pt the oblong imag of the sun made by that beam pass through the first prism alon when the second prism is taken away and pt the imag made by the cross refract of both prism togeth now if the ray which tend toward the sever point of the round imag y were dilat and spread by the refract of the first prism so that they should not ani longer go in singl line to singl point but that everi ray be split shatter and chang from a linear ray to a superfici of ray diverg from the point of refract and lie in the plane of the angl of incid and refract they should go in those plane to so mani line reach almost from one end of the imag pt to the other and if that imag should thenc becom oblong those ray and their sever part tend toward the sever point of the imag pt ought to be again dilat and spread sideway by the transvers refract of the second prism so as to compos a four squar imag such as is repres at greek pt for the better understand of which let the imag pt be distinguish into five equal part pqk kqrl lrsm msvn nvt and by the same irregular that the orbicular light y is by the refract of the first prism dilat and drawn out into a long imag pt the light pqk which take up a space of the same length and breadth with the light y ought to be by the refract of the second prism dilat and drawn out into the long imag greek pqkp and the light kqrl into the long imag kqrl and the light lrsm msvn nvt into so mani other long imag lrsm msvn nvtgreek t and all these long imag would compos the four squar imag greek pt thu it ought to be were everi ray dilat by refract and spread into a triangular superfici of ray diverg from the point of refract for the second refract would spread the ray one way as much as the first doth anoth and so dilat the imag in breadth as much as the first doth in length and the same thing ought to happen were some ray casual refract more than other but the event is otherwis the imag pt wa not made broader by the refract of the second prism but onli becam obliqu as ti repres at pt it upper end p be by the refract translat to a greater distanc than it lower end t so then the light which went toward the upper end p of the imag wa at equal incid more refract in the second prism than the light which tend toward the lower end t that is the blue and violet than the red and yellow and therefor wa more refrang the same light wa by the refract of the first prism translat farther from the place y to which it tend befor refract and therefor suffer as well in the first prism as in the second a greater refract than the rest of the light and by consequ wa more refrang than the rest even befor it incid on the first prism sometim i place a third prism after the second and sometim also a fourth after the third by all which the imag might be often refract sideway but the ray which were more refract than the rest in the first prism were also more refract in all the rest and that without ani dilat of the imag sideway and therefor those ray for their constanc of a greater refract are deservedli reput more refrang illustr fig but that the mean of thi experi may more clearli appear it is to be consid that the ray which are equal refrang do fall upon a circl answer to the sun disqu for thi wa prove in the third experi by a circl i understand not here a perfect geometr circl but ani orbicular figur whose length is equal to it breadth and which as to sens may seem circular let therefor ag in fig repres the circl which all the most refrang ray propag from the whole disqu of the sun would illumin and paint upon the opposit wall if they were alon el the circl which all the least refrang ray would in like manner illumin and paint if they were alon bh cj dk the circl which so mani intermedi sort of ray would success paint upon the wall if they were singli propag from the sun in success order the rest be alway intercept and conceiv that there are other intermedi circl without number which innumer other intermedi sort of ray would success paint upon the wall if the sun should success emit everi sort apart and see the sun emit all these sort at onc they must all togeth illumin and paint innumer equal circl of all which be accord to their degre of refrang place in order in a continu seri that oblong spectrum pt is compos which i describ in the third experi now if the sun circular imag y in fig which is made by an unrefract beam of light wa by ani dilat of the singl ray or by ani other irregular in the refract of the first prism convert into the oblong spectrum pt then ought everi circl ag bh cj c in that spectrum by the cross refract of the second prism again dilat or otherwis scatter the ray as befor to be in like manner drawn out and transform into an oblong figur and therebi the breadth of the imag pt would be now as much augment as the length of the imag y wa befor by the refract of the first prism and thu by the refract of both prism togeth would be form a four squar figur pgreek ptgreek t as i describ abov wherefor sinc the breadth of the spectrum pt is not increas by the refract sideway it is certain that the ray are not split or dilat or otherway irregularli scatterd by that refract but that everi circl is by a regular and uniform refract translat entir into anoth place as the circl ag by the greatest refract into the place ag the circl bh by a less refract into the place bh the circl cj by a refract still less into the place ci and so of the rest by which mean a new spectrum pt inclin to the former pt is in like manner compos of circl lie in a right line and these circl must be of the same big with the former becaus the breadth of all the spectrum y pt and pt at equal distanc from the prism are equal i consid farther that by the breadth of the hole f through which the light enter into the dark chamber there is a penumbra made in the circuit of the spectrum y and that penumbra remain in the rectilinear side of the spectrum pt and pt i place therefor at that hole a len or objectglass of a telescop which might cast the imag of the sun distinctli on y without ani penumbra at all and found that the penumbra of the rectilinear side of the oblong spectrum pt and pt wa also therebi taken away so that those side appear as distinctli defin as did the circumfer of the first imag y thu it happen if the glass of the prism be free from vein and their side be accur plane and well polish without those numberless wave or curl which usual aris from sandhol a littl smooth in polish with putti if the glass be onli well polish and free from vein and the side not accur plane but a littl convex or concav as it frequent happen yet may the three spectrum y pt and pt want penumbra but not in equal distanc from the prism now from thi want of penumbra i knew more certainli that everi one of the circl wa refract accord to some most regular uniform and constant law for if there were ani irregular in the refract the right line ae and gl which all the circl in the spectrum pt do touch could not by that refract be translat into the line ae and gl as distinct and straight as they were befor but there would aris in those translat line some penumbra or crooked or undul or other sensibl perturb contrari to what is found by experi whatsoev penumbra or perturb should be made in the circl by the cross refract of the second prism all that penumbra or perturb would be conspicu in the right line ae and gl which touch those circl and therefor sinc there is no such penumbra or perturb in those right line there must be none in the circl sinc the distanc between those tangent or breadth of the spectrum is not increas by the refract the diamet of the circl are not increas therebi sinc those tangent continu to be right line everi circl which in the first prism is more or less refract is exactli in the same proport more or less refract in the second and see all these thing continu to succeed after the same manner when the ray are again in a third prism and again in a fourth refract sideway it is evid that the ray of one and the same circl as to their degre of refrang continu alway uniform and homogen to one anoth and that those of sever circl do differ in degre of refrang and that in some certain and constant proport which is the thing i wa to prove there is yet anoth circumst or two of thi experi by which it becom still more plain and convinc let the second prism dh in fig be place not immedi after the first but at some distanc from it suppos in the midway between it and the wall on which the oblong spectrum pt is cast so that the light from the first prism may fall upon it in the form of an oblong spectrum greek pt parallel to thi second prism and be refract sideway to form the oblong spectrum pt upon the wall and you will find as befor that thi spectrum pt is inclin to that spectrum pt which the first prism form alon without the second the blue end p and p be farther distant from one anoth than the red one t and t and by consequ that the ray which go to the blue end greek p of the imag greek pt and which therefor suffer the greatest refract in the first prism are again in the second prism more refract than the rest illustr fig illustr fig the same thing i tryd also by let the sun light into a dark room through two littl round hole f and greek ph in fig made in the window and with two parallel prism abc and greek abg place at those hole one at each refract those two beam of light to the opposit wall of the chamber in such manner that the two colourd imag pt and mn which they there paint were join end to end and lay in one straight line the red end t of the one touch the blue end m of the other for if these two refract beam were again by a third prism dh place cross to the two first refract sideway and the spectrum therebi translat to some other part of the wall of the chamber suppos the spectrum pt to pt and the spectrum mn to mn these translat spectrum pt and mn would not lie in one straight line with their end contigu as befor but be broken off from one anoth and becom parallel the blue end m of the imag mn be by a greater refract translat farther from it former place mt than the red end t of the other imag pt from the same place mt which put the proposit past disput and thi happen whether the third prism dh be place immedi after the two first or at a great distanc from them so that the light refract in the two first prism be either white and circular or colour and oblong when it fall on the third exper in the middl of two thin board i made round hole a third part of an inch in diamet and in the windowshut a much broader hole be made to let into my darkn chamber a larg beam of the sun light i place a prism behind the shut in that beam to refract it toward the opposit wall and close behind the prism i fix one of the board in such manner that the middl of the refract light might pass through the hole made in it and the rest be intercept by the board then at the distanc of about twelv feet from the first board i fix the other board in such manner that the middl of the refract light which came through the hole in the first board and fell upon the opposit wall might pass through the hole in thi other board and the rest be intercept by the board might paint upon it the colour spectrum of the sun and close behind thi board i fix anoth prism to refract the light which came through the hole then i return speedili to the first prism and by turn it slowli to and fro about it axi i caus the imag which fell upon the second board to move up and down upon that board that all it part might success pass through the hole in that board and fall upon the prism behind it and in the mean time i note the place on the opposit wall to which that light after it refract in the second prism did pass and by the differ of the place i found that the light which be most refract in the first prism did go to the blue end of the imag wa again more refract in the second prism than the light which went to the red end of that imag which prove as well the first proposit as the second and thi happen whether the axi of the two prism were parallel or inclin to one anoth and to the horizon in ani given angl illustr let f in fig be the wide hole in the windowshut through which the sun shine upon the first prism abc and let the refract light fall upon the middl of the board de and the middl part of that light upon the hole g made in the middl part of that board let thi traject part of that light fall again upon the middl of the second board de and there paint such an oblong colour imag of the sun as wa describ in the third experi by turn the prism abc slowli to and fro about it axi thi imag will be made to move up and down the board de and by thi mean all it part from one end to the other may be made to pass success through the hole g which is made in the middl of that board in the mean while anoth prism abc is to be fix next after that hole g to refract the traject light a second time and these thing be thu order i mark the place m and n of the opposit wall upon which the refract light fell and found that whilst the two board and second prism remain unmov those place by turn the first prism about it axi were chang perpetu for when the lower part of the light which fell upon the second board de wa cast through the hole g it went to a lower place m on the wall and when the higher part of that light wa cast through the same hole g it went to a higher place n on the wall and when ani intermedi part of the light wa cast through that hole it went to some place on the wall between m and n the unchang posit of the hole in the board made the incid of the ray upon the second prism to be the same in all case and yet in that common incid some of the ray were more refract and other less and those were more refract in thi prism which by a greater refract in the first prism were more turn out of the way and therefor for their constanc of be more refract are deservedli call more refrang illustr fig illustr fig exper at two hole made near one anoth in my windowshut i place two prism one at each which might cast upon the opposit wall after the manner of the third experi two oblong colour imag of the sun and at a littl distanc from the wall i place a long slender paper with straight and parallel edg and order the prism and paper so that the red colour of one imag might fall directli upon one half of the paper and the violet colour of the other imag upon the other half of the same paper so that the paper appear of two colour red and violet much after the manner of the paint paper in the first and second experi then with a black cloth i cover the wall behind the paper that no light might be reflect from it to disturb the experi and view the paper through a third prism held parallel to it i saw that half of it which wa illumin by the violet light to be divid from the other half by a greater refract especi when i went a good way off from the paper for when i view it too near at hand the two half of the paper did not appear fulli divid from one anoth but seem contigu at one of their angl like the paint paper in the first experi which also happen when the paper wa too broad illustr fig sometim instead of the paper i use a white thred and thi appear through the prism divid into two parallel thred as is repres in the nineteenth figur where dg denot the thred illumin with violet light from d to e and with red light from f to g and defg are the part of the thred seen by refract if one half of the thred be constantli illumin with red and the other half be illumin with all the colour success which may be done by caus one of the prism to be turn about it axi whilst the other remain unmov thi other half in view the thred through the prism will appear in a continu right line with the first half when illumin with red and begin to be a littl divid from it when illumin with orang and remov farther from it when illumin with yellow and still farther when with green and farther when with blue and go yet farther off when illumin with indigo and farthest when with deep violet which plainli shew that the light of sever colour are more and more refrang one than anoth in thi order of their colour red orang yellow green blue indigo deep violet and so prove as well the first proposit as the second i caus also the colour spectrum pt in fig and mn made in a dark chamber by the refract of two prism to lie in a right line end to end as wa describ abov in the fifth experi and view them through a third prism held parallel to their length they appear no longer in a right line but becam broken from one anoth as they are repres at pt and mn the violet end m of the spectrum mn be by a greater refract translat farther from it former place mt than the red end t of the other spectrum pt i farther caus those two spectrum pt in fig and mn to becom coincid in an invert order of their colour the red end of each fall on the violet end of the other as they are repres in the oblong figur ptmn and then view them through a prism dh held parallel to their length they appear not coincid as when viewd with the nake eye but in the form of two distinct spectrum pt and mn cross one anoth in the middl after the manner of the letter x which shew that the red of the one spectrum and violet of the other which were coincid at pn and mt be part from one anoth by a greater refract of the violet to p and m than of the red to n and t do differ in degre of refrang i illumin also a littl circular piec of white paper all over with the light of both prism intermix and when it wa illumin with the red of one spectrum and deep violet of the other so as by the mixtur of those colour to appear all over purpl i view the paper first at a less distanc and then at a greater through a third prism and as i went from the paper the refract imag thereof becam more and more divid by the unequ refract of the two mix colour and at length part into two distinct imag a red one and a violet one whereof the violet wa farthest from the paper and therefor suffer the greatest refract and when that prism at the window which cast the violet on the paper wa taken away the violet imag disappear but when the other prism wa taken away the red vanish which shew that these two imag were noth els than the light of the two prism which had been intermix on the purpl paper but were part again by their unequ refract made in the third prism through which the paper wa viewd thi also wa observ that if one of the prism at the window suppos that which cast the violet on the paper wa turn about it axi to make all the colour in thi order violet indigo blue green yellow orang red fall success on the paper from that prism the violet imag chang colour accordingli turn success to indigo blue green yellow and red and in chang colour came nearer and nearer to the red imag made by the other prism until when it wa also red both imag becam fulli coincid i place also two paper circl veri near one anoth the one in the red light of one prism and the other in the violet light of the other the circl were each of them an inch in diamet and behind them the wall wa dark that the experi might not be disturb by ani light come from thenc these circl thu illumin i view through a prism so held that the refract might be made toward the red circl and as i went from them they came nearer and nearer togeth and at length becam coincid and afterward when i went still farther off they part again in a contrari order the violet by a greater refract be carri beyond the red exper in summer when the sun light use to be strongest i place a prism at the hole of the windowshut as in the third experi yet so that it axi might be parallel to the axi of the world and at the opposit wall in the sun refract light i place an open book then go six feet and two inch from the book i place there the abovement len by which the light reflect from the book might be made to converg and meet again at the distanc of six feet and two inch behind the len and there paint the speci of the book upon a sheet of white paper much after the manner of the second experi the book and len be made fast i note the place where the paper wa when the letter of the book illumin by the fullest red light of the solar imag fall upon it did cast their speci on that paper most distinctli and then i stayd till by the motion of the sun and consequ motion of hi imag on the book all the colour from that red to the middl of the blue passd over those letter and when those letter were illumin by that blue i note again the place of the paper when they cast their speci most distinctli upon it and i found that thi last place of the paper wa nearer to the len than it former place by about two inch and an half or two and three quarter so much sooner therefor did the light in the violet end of the imag by a greater refract converg and meet than the light in the red end but in tri thi the chamber wa as dark as i could make it for if these colour be dilut and weakn by the mixtur of ani adventiti light the distanc between the place of the paper will not be so great thi distanc in the second experi where the colour of natur bodi were made use of wa but an inch and an half by reason of the imperfect of those colour here in the colour of the prism which are manifestli more full intens and live than those of natur bodi the distanc is two inch and three quarter and were the colour still more full i question not but that the distanc would be consider greater for the colour light of the prism by the interf of the circl describ in the second figur of the fifth experi and also by the light of the veri bright cloud next the sun bodi intermix with these colour and by the light scatter by the inequ in the polish of the prism wa so veri much compound that the speci which those faint and dark colour the indigo and violet cast upon the paper were not distinct enough to be well observ exper a prism whose two angl at it base were equal to one anoth and half right one and the third a right one i place in a beam of the sun light let into a dark chamber through a hole in the windowshut as in the third experi and turn the prism slowli about it axi until all the light which went through one of it angl and wa refract by it began to be reflect by it base at which till then it went out of the glass i observ that those ray which had suffer the greatest refract were sooner reflect than the rest i conceiv therefor that those ray of the reflect light which were most refrang did first of all by a total reflexion becom more copiou in that light than the rest and that afterward the rest also by a total reflexion becam as copiou as these to tri thi i made the reflect light pass through anoth prism and be refract by it to fall afterward upon a sheet of white paper place at some distanc behind it and there by that refract to paint the usual colour of the prism and then caus the first prism to be turn about it axi as abov i observ that when those ray which in thi prism had suffer the greatest refract and appear of a blue and violet colour began to be total reflect the blue and violet light on the paper which wa most refract in the second prism receiv a sensibl increas abov that of the red and yellow which wa least refract and afterward when the rest of the light which wa green yellow and red began to be total reflect in the first prism the light of those colour on the paper receiv as great an increas as the violet and blue had done befor whenc ti manifest that the beam of light reflect by the base of the prism be augment first by the more refrang ray and afterward by the less refrang one is compound of ray differ refrang and that all such reflect light is of the same natur with the sun light befor it incid on the base of the prism no man ever doubt it be gener allow that light by such reflexion suffer no alter in it modif and properti i do not here take notic of ani refract made in the side of the first prism becaus the light enter it perpendicularli at the first side and goe out perpendicularli at the second side and therefor suffer none so then the sun incid light be of the same temper and constitut with hi emerg light
