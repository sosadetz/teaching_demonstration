the booksel m dcc liii the histori of sir charl grandison bart letter i miss harriet byron to miss luci selbi saturday march self my dear luci is a veri wick thing a sanctifi if one would give way to it partial of action which in other we should have no doubt to condemn delicaci too is often a mislead an idol at whose shrine we sometim offer up oar sincer but in that case it should be call indelicaci noth sure can be delic that is not true or that give birth to equivoc yet how wa i pleas with lord and ladi l and miss crandison for endeavor to pass me off to good dr bartlett in the light i had no titl to appear in as if my mind in a certain point remain to be known and would so remain till the gentleman had discov hi and are there some situat in which a woman must conceal her true sentiment in which it would be thought immodesti to speak out whi wa i born with an heart so open and sincer but whi inde as sir charl ha said in hi letter relat to the danbi should women be blame for own modestli a passion for a worthi and suitabl object is it that they will not speak out lest if their wish should not be crown with success by one man they should depriv themselv of a chanc to succeed with anoth do they not propos to make the man they love happi and is it a crime to acknowledg that they are so well dispos to a worthi object a worthi object i repeat for that is what will warrant the open heart what a littl is there in the custom that compel us to be insincer and suppos we do not succeed with a first object shall we cheat a futur lover with the notion that he wa the first hitherto i had act with some selfapprob i told mr grevil mr fenwick mr orm mr fowler that i had not seen the man to whom i could wish to give my hand at the altar but when i found my heart engag i wa desir ladi d should know that it wa but yet misl by thi same notion of delicaci i could think myself oblig to the two sister and my lord that they endeavor to throw a blind over the eye of good dr bartlett when the right measur i now think would have been not to have endeavor to obtain light from him that we all thought he wa not commiss to give or if we had to have relat to him the whole truth and not have put on disguis to him but to have lest him wholli a judg of the fit and the unfit and thi is love is it that put an honest girl upon approv of such trick begon love i banish thee if thou would corrupt the simplic of that heart which wa taught to glori in truth and yet i had like to have been drawn into a greater fault for what do you think miss grandison had by some mean or other she would not tell me how in dr bartlett absenc on a visit to one of the canon of windsor got at a letter brought earli thi morn from her brother to that good man and which he had left open on hi desk

had i been induc by her to read the letter which she got at dishonestli as she own what a poor figur should i have made in my own eye for a month to come but did she not as soon overcom the mortif given her by her brother on the detect of captain anderson affair how unmerci did she railli me within a few hour after yet she ha fine qualiti one can not help love her i do love her but is it not a weak to look without abat of affect on those fault in one person which we should hold utterli inexcus in anoth in miss grandison case howev dont say it is luci o what a partial yet she ha within these few minut own that she thought the step she had taken a faulti one befor she came to me with the letter and hope to induc me to counten her in what she had done i call her a littl satan on thi occas but after all what if the dear charlott curios wa more for my sake than her own no motiv of friendship you will say can justifi a wrong action whi no luci that is veri true but if you knew miss grandison you would love her dearli letter ii sir charl grandison to dr bartlett the letter which miss byron refus to read or hear read friday night mar i hope my lord l and my sister will be abl to

like to be of servic you may believ that i would cheer make it i should go for a fortnight at least to grandisonhal burgess ha let me know that the workmen have gone almost as far as they can go without my further order and the churchwarden have signifi to me that the church is complet beautifi accord to my direct so that it will be readi to be open on the sunday after next at farthest and entreat my presenc both as patron and benefactor i will now hasten my design alter at the hall i had rather not be present at the open yet the proprieti of my be there will probabl prevail upon me to compli with the entreati of the churchwarden who in their letter signifi the expect of sir samuel clark sir william turner and mr barnham of see me and my sister charlott you will be pleas to mention thi to her i wish without put a slight upon good mr dobson that you my dear friend could oblig us with the first sermon all then would be decent and worthi of the occas and the prais would be given properli and not to the agent but as it would be a littl mortifi to mr dobson of whose prais onli i am apprehens so much as to hint such a wish i will write to him that he will oblig me if he say not one word that shall carri the eye of the audienc to my seat the execut of the order i gave that five other pew should be equal distinguish and ornament with mine carri not with it the appear of affect doe it my good dr bartlett especi as so mani consider famili have seat there i would not seem guilti of a fals modesti which break out into singular would give the suspicion of a wrong direct in case where it may be of use to suppos a right one what can i do in relat to my emili she is of the statur of woman she ought accord to the present tast to be introduc into public life i am not fond of that life and what knowledg she will gain by the introduct she had better be without yet i think we should conform someth to the ta e of the time in which we live women mind have gener a lighter turn than those of men they should be innoc indulg and on thi principl it wa that last winter i attend her and my sister veri often to the place of public entertain that she have seen everyth that wa the gener subject of polit convers might judg of such entertain as they deserv and not add expect which run veri high in young mind and is seldom answer to the ideal seen thi indulg answer as i wish emili can now hear talk of the emul of actor and manag and of the other public divers with tranquil and be satisfi as she read with repres over again to herself the part in which the particular actor excel and thu a boundari is set to her imagin and that by her own choic for she think lightli of them when she can be oblig by the compani of my two sister and lord l but new scene will aris in an age so studiou as thi to gratifi the eye and the ear from these a young woman of fortun must not be total exclud i am a young man and as emili is so well grown for her year i think i can not so properli be her introduc to them as i might were i fifteen or twenti year older i live to my own heart and i know i think i do that it is not a bad one but as i can not intend anyth with regard to my emili i must for her sake be more observ of the world opinion than i hope i need to be for my own you have taught me that it is not good manner to despis the world opinion though we should regard it onli in the second place emili ha too larg a fortun i have an high opinion of her discret but she is but a girl women eye are wander and too often bring home guest that are veri troublesom to them and whom onc introduc they can not get out of the hous i wish she had onli ten thousand pound she would then stand a better chanc for happi than she can do i doubt with five time ten and would have five person to one that she ha now to choos out of for how few are there who can make propos to the father or guardian of a girl who ha l inde there are not want in our sex forward spirit who will think that sum not too much for their merit though they may not deserv l nor even one and henc aris the danger of a woman of great fortun from those who will not dare to make propos to a guardian after an introduct and how easi is that now made at public place a woman of the greatest fortun is but a woman and is to be attack and prevail upon by the same method which succeed with a person of the slenderest and perhap is won with equal if not with greater eas sinc if the ladi ha a littl romanc in her head and her lover a great deal of art and flatteri she will call that romant turn generos and think she can lay the man who ha obtain her attent under oblig she will meet him her full halfway emili is desir to be constantli with us my sister is veri oblig i know she will compli with whatev i shall request of her in relat to emili but where the reput of a ladi is concern a man should not depend too much upon hi own charact especi a young man be it ever so unexception her mother ha alreadi given out foolish hint she demand her daughter the unhappi woman ha no regard to truth her own charact lost and so deservedli will she have ani tender for that of emili who will scrupl to believ what a mother though ever so wick will report of her daughter under twenti and her guardian under thirti if they live constantli togeth her guardian at the same time carri hi heart in hi counten and love the girl though with as much innoc as if she were hi sister onc i had thought of crave the assist of the court of chanceri for the protect of her person and fortun but an hint of thi natur distress her for mani day unknown to me had i been acquaint that she took it so heavili i would not have made her unhappi for one day i have look out among the qualiti for a futur husband for her but where can i find one with whom i think she will be happi there are mani who would be glad of her fortun as i said her fortun is too larg it is enough to render everi man address to her suspect and to make a guardian apprehens that her person agreeabl as it is and everi day improv and her mind open to avantag everi hour of her life would be but the second if the second view of a man profess to love her and were she to marri what a damp would the slight of an husband give to the geniu of a young ladi whose nativ modesti would alway make her want encourag i have also cast an eye over the gentri within my knowledg but have not met with one whom i could wish to be the husband of my emili so tender so gentl so ductil as she is a fierc a rash an indel even a careless or indiffer man would either harden her heart or shorten her life and as the latter would be much more easi to be effect than the former what must she suffer befor she could return indiffer for disrespect and reach the quiet end of it see what a man sir walter warkyn is my sister onli could deal with such an one a superior in her so visibl he must fear her yet a generos so great and a digniti so conspicu in her whole behavior as well as counten he must love her everybodi respect to her would oblig love and rever from him but my weakheart diffid emili what would she do with such a man what would she do with a sir hargrav pollexfen what with such a man as mr grevil as sir hargrav describ him i mention these men for are not there mani such i am not apt to run into grave declam against the time and yet by what i have seen abroad and now late sinc my arriv at home and have heard from men of greater observ and who have live longer in the world than i have i can not but think that englishmen are not what they were a wretch effeminaci seem to prevail among them marriag itself is everi day more and more out of fashion and even virtuou women give not the institut so much of their counten as to discourag by their contempt the freeliv a good woman as such ha therefor but few chanc for happi in marriag yet shall i not endeavor the more endeavor to save and serv my emili i have one encourag sinc my happi acquaint with miss byron to think that the age is not entir lost to a sens of virtu and good see we not how everybodi rever her even a sir hargrav pollexfen a grevil a fenwick men of free live ador her and at the same time she meet with the love of all good men and the respect of women whether gay or seriou but i am afraid that the first attract with men is her beauti i am afraid that few see in that admir young ladi what i see in her a mind great and nobl a sincer beyond that of women a good unaffect and which show itself in action and not mere in word and outward appear a wit live and inossens and an understand solid and use all which render her a fit companion either in the social or contempl hour and yet she think herself not abov the knowledg of those duti the perform of which make an essenti of the femal charact but i am not give a charact of miss byron to you my good dr bartlett who admir her as much as i do do you think it imposs for me to procur for my emili such a guardian and companion as miss byron on her return to northamptonshir would make her such worthi relat as she would introduc her to would be a further happi to my ward i am far from undervalu my sister good qualiti but if emili live with her she must live also with me inde the affair in which i am engag for other peopl if i may call those who have a claim upon me for everi instanc of my friendship other peopl will occas me to be often absent but still while grandisonhal and st jamess squar are the visibl place of resid equal of the guardian and ward emili mother will tell the world that we live togeth miss jervoi doe not choos to return to mr lane and inde i dont think she would be safe there in a famili of women though veri worthi one from the attempt of one of the sex who have brought her into the world call herself her mother and especi now that the unhappi woman ha begun to be troublesom there i beg of you therefor my dear dr bartlett who know more of my heart and situat than ani one live my dear beauchamp except to consid what i have written and give me your opinion of that part of it which relat to miss byron and emili i wa insens draw myself in to enumer the engag which at present press most upon me let me add to the subject i must soon go to pari in order final to settl such of the affair of my late worthi friend as can not be so well done by ani other hand the three thousand pound which he ha direct to be dispos of to charit use in franc as well as in england at the discret of hi executor is one of them perhap equiti will allow me to add to thi limit sum from what will remain in my hand after the establish of the nephew and niec as they are young and brought up with a hope that they will make a figur in the world by their dilig i would not by ani mean make them independ on that the whole estat divid among them would not be suffici to answer that purpos happili though it might be enough to abat the edg of their industri the chariti that i am most intent upon promot in franc and in england too is that of give littl fortun to young maiden in marriag with honest men of their own degre who might from such an outset begin the world as it is call with some hope of success by thi time my dear dr bartlett you will guess that i have a design upon you it is that you will assist me in execut the will of my late friend make enquiri after and reccommend to me object worthi of relief you wa veri desir some time ago to retir to the hall but i knew not how to spare you and i hope to attend you thither you shall now set out for that place as soon as you pleas and that neither may be or as littl as possibl loser by the separ everyth that we would say to each other were we togeth that as we use to do we will say by pen and ink we will be joint executor in the first place for thi sum of l make enquiri then as soon as you get down for worthi object the industri poor of all persuas reduc either by age infirm or accid those who labor under incur maladi youth of either sex capabl of begin the world to advantag but destitut of the mean these in particular are the object we both think worthi of assist you shall take l down with you for a begin it is my pride it is my glori that i can say dr bartlett and charl grandison on all benevol occas are actuat by one soul my dear friend adieu letter iii miss byron to miss selbi sat night march i have furnish the ladi and my lord with more letter and so they have all my heart befor them i dont care the man is sir charl grandison and they railli me not so much as befor while they thought i affect reserv to them inde it would be cruel if they did and i should have run away from them i am glad you all think that the two sister use me sever they realli did but i have thi gratif of my pride in reflect upon their treatment of me i would not have done so by them had situat been exchang and i think myself nearer an equal with them than i had thought myself befor but they are good ladi and my sincer friend and wellwish and i forgiv them and so must my dear grandmamma i am sorri mthink that her delicaci ha been offend on the occas and did she weep at the hear read my account of that attack made upon her girl by the overl charlott o the dear the indulg parent how tender wa it of my aunt too to be concern for the poor harriet delicaci so hard put to it as she wa it did inde as she distinguish in her usual charm manner look as if they put a great price upon their intend friendship to me with regard to my interest in their brother heart as if the favor done to the humbl girl if they could jointli procur for her their brother counten might well allow of their railleri dont pray dont my dear grandmamma call it by a sever name they did not i am sure they did not mean to hurt me so much as i realli wa hurt so let it pass humor and railleri are veri difficult thing to rein in they are ever curvet like a pranc hors and they will often throw the rider who depend more upon hi skill in manag them than he ha reason to do my uncl wa charm with the scene and think the two ladi did just as he would have done he mean it a compliment to their delicaci i presum but i am of my aunt selbi opinion that their gener brother would not have given them thank for their railleri to the poor fright harriet i am veri happi howev that my behavior and frank on the occas are not disapprov at selbyhous and shirleymanor and by you my luci and here let that matter rest should i not begin to think of go back to you all my luci i believ i blush ten time a day when alon to find myself wait and wait as if for the graciou motion yet apprehend that it never

endur myself and yet while the love of virtu a littl too person perhap is the foundat of these design these wait these emot i think i am not wholli inexcus i am sure i should not esteem him were he not the good man he is pray let me ask you do you think he could not be put upon say someth affront to me upon do someth unworthi of hi charact o then i am sure i should hate him all the other instanc of hi good would then be as noth i will be captiou i think and studi to be affront whether he intend to affront me or not but what a multitud of foolish notion come into the head of a silli girl who littl as she know know more of anyth or of anybodi than she know of herself i wish my godfath had not put it in my head that emili is cherish perhap unknown to herself a flame that will devour her peac for to be sure thi young creatur can have no hope that yet l is a vast fortun but it can never buy her guardian do you think such a man as sir charl grandison ha a price i am sure he ha not i watch the counten the word the air of the girl when he is spoken of and with piti i see that he can not be name but her eye sparkl her eye is taken off her work or book as she happen to be engag in either and she seem as if she would look the person through who is prais her guardian for the life of her she can not work and hear and then she sigh upon my word luci there is no such thing as proceed with hi prais befor her the girl so sigh so young a creatur yet how can one caution the poor thing but what make me a littl more observ of her than i should otherwis perhap have been addit to
