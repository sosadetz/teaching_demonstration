which he inscrib to the noblest nurseri of human and liberti in the kingdom the inn of court to character a lawschool as the nurseri of sound learn and civil liberti is inde a highlywrought eulogium

as it were the element of the law who profit therein as they grew to ripe so were they admit into the greater inn of the same studi call the inn of court the word inn wa ancient use to denot townhous in which the nobil and gentri resid when they were in attend at court and it is frequent employ by the old poet to denot a spaciou and eleg mansion the inn of court were in old french term hostel in the courtrecord in latin they are call hospitia while diversoria is the name appli to public lodginghous which are now commonli known as inn the build origin purchas for the purpos of these legal

inn ancient belong to the earl of lincoln and gray so the name of the sever inn of chanceri are taken from the name of their origin proprietors—except new inn stapl inn which belong to the merchant of the stapl and lion inn which wa a common tavern with the sign of the lion there can be no doubt that there wa origin provid in these school some system of instruct for the student compet person term reader were appoint to deliv public lectur such men as more coke and holt were chosen as reader they fell into disus howev and befor the time of blackston the student at the inn wa left to hi own discret and wa even call to the bar after a set time without ani examin as to ix hi qualif for the exercis of hi profess accord to the regul at that time and with some modif still exist everi man wa entitl to be call to the bar who had paid the fee accustom and due to the inn at which he had enter and had kept twelv term a term wa kept in a veri easi and pleasant way inde by be present at a certain number of dinner in common—gener five in each term—in presenc of the bencher he must have gone nine time through a certain ceremoni which is call perform an exercis exercis were perform thu the student wa furnish by the steward of the societi with a piec of paper on which wa suppos to be written an argument on some point of law but owe to the neglig of success copyist the write came at last to consist of a piec of legal jargon wholli unintellig when afterdinn grace had been said the student advanc to the barrist tabl and commenc read from thi paper upon which one of the barrist present made him a slight bow took the paper from him and told him that it wa quit suffici throw asid thi piec of antiqu and ridicul mummeri we may say then that practic all that wa requir as a qualif for the english bar wa that the applic had eaten sixti dinner at certain interv we have not been inform under whose advic or by whose direct blackston prosecut hi cours of legal studi in the middl templ he ha himself depict in a veri live manner the danger and difficulti of such a course—w may appeal to the experi of everi sensibl lawyer whether ani thing can be more hazard or discourag than the usual entranc on the studi of the law a raw and inexperienc youth in the most danger season of life is transplant on a sudden into the midst of allur to pleasur without ani restraint or check but what hi own prudenc can suggest with no public direct in what cours to pursu hi inquiri no privat assist to remov the distress and difficulti which will alway embarrass a beginn in thi situat he is expect to sequest himself from the world and by a tediou lone process to extract the theori of law from a mass of undigest learn or els by an assidu attend on the court to pick up theori and practic togeth suffici to qualifi him for the ordinari run of busi we may conjectur that blackston began with finch and then proceed to set upon the rough mine of legal treasur to be found in coke upon littleton as well as to look into bracton glanvil fleta and the report it wa somewhat better than when not quit two centuri befor in sir henri spelman so graphic describ it as linguam peregrinam aïalectum barbarum methodum inconcinnum molem non ingentem solum sed perpetui humeri sustinendam the young student whose career we are to sketch littl thought that in the design of provid he wa the engin select to make a new road through thi wild and almost impass countri and that he would do so with so much skill and judgment and at the same time adorn it side and environ with so green and rich a landscap as to convert the journey from a wearisom toil x to an attract pleasur for almost a centuri the commentari have been the first book of the student of law and whatev critic have been or may be made upon their learn or accuraci the fact is that no lawyer fail to make them a part of hi cours of studi sooner or later at oxford he had been a dilig student befor he wa twenti he had compil a treatis on the element of architectur with plan and draw from hi own pen he devot a larg portion of hi time to eleg literatur and had cultiv to a consider extent the art of poetri even at school he had shown poetic abil by some vers on milton for which he wa reward with a gold medal upon betak himself to the studi of the law he appear to have consid it necessari to abandon thi employ he wrote the lawyer farewel to hi muse which wa afterward print in dodsley miscellanies—a poem exhibit a cultiv tast and a chasten fanci as well as great command of languag afterward in he wrote an elegi on the death of frederick princ of wale which wa publish in the oxford collect judg from these piec it is perhap not a subject of regret that he relinquish poetri nor are we tempt to exclaim as pope did of lord mansfield— how sweet an ovid murray wa our boast how mani martial were in pulteney lost it ha howev been well remark that to hi earli predilect for poetri we may reason attribut the format of that exquisit style and method with which he afterward embellish and illustr the law for noth so well can teach us that proprieti of express that felic of illustr and that symmetri of method by which the most abstrus subject may be render clear and delight as the studi of the work of those who may be style the master of languag it is not uncommon to hear the express the law is a jealou mistress it is true that thi profess like all other demand of those who would succeed in it an earnest and entir devot it must be the main busi of the student he must love it but it is not inconsist with all thi that he should still pursu hi classic reading—that he should maintain a constant acquaint and familiar with those author in everi tongu who by the unanim award of time are the standard of tast and eloqu a man may becom a first rate practition or scriven by devot himself exclus to profession read and if money be hi whole object with great success but if hi aim be—a it ought to be—high then liber studi will be found as necessari to make the truli great and accomplish lawyer as ani other it is not the mere gather of flower in deviou bypath but of rich and nourish fruit which give tone and vigour to the moral and intellectu man the old partit of time which even lord coke ha sanction by hi author for the good spend of the day assign six hour of the twentyfour to the sacr muses— sex hora

is an enthusiast benthamit hi associ have been altogeth with code and system what other arrang he would have made of the common law of england than that follow by blackston and hale can onli be conjectur but the probabl is that it would not have been adapt to the scienc as it practic exist and would have been inconveni becaus artifici the common law is not a strait canal cut by the art of

to deserv it the scienc thu commit to hi charg to be cultiv method and explain in a cours of academ lectur is that of the law and constitut of our own countri a speci of knowledg in which the

soil under the veri emin professor that abound in their sever univers and in the northern part of our own island where also the municip law are frequent connect with the civil it is difficult to meet

hope of thi island to foreign univers in switzerland germani and holland which though infinit inferior to our own in everi other consider have been look upon as better nurseri of the civil or which is nearli the same of their own municip law in the mean time it ha been the peculiar lot of our admir system of law to be neglect and even unknown by all but one practic profess though built upon the

persuad of the gener excel of it rule and the usual equiti of it decis nor is better convinc of it use as well as ornament to the scholar the divin the statesman and even the common lawyer but we must not carri our vener so far as to sacrific our alfr and edward to the mane of theodosiu and justinian we must not prefer the edict of the prætor or the rescript of the roman emperor to our own immemori custom or the sanction of an english parliament unless we can also prefer the despot monarchi of rome and byzantium for whose meridian the former were calcul to the free constitut of britain which the latter are adapt to perpetu without detract therefor from the real merit which abound in the imperi law i hope i may have leav to assert that if an englishman must be ignor of either the one or the

either to the public or themselv without some degre of knowledg in the law to evinc thi the more clearli it may not be amiss to descend to a few particular let us therefor begin with our gentlemen of independ estat and fortun the most use as well as consider bodi of men in the nation whom even to suppos ignor in thi branch of learn is treat by mr lock as a strang absurd it is their land properti with it long and volumin train of descent and convey settlement entail and incumbr that form the most intric and most extens object of legal knowledg the thorough comprehens of these in all their
