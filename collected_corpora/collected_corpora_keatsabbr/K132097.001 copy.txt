ani idea of i have three apart which we will call my draw room dress room and bed chamber more than that number i did not aspir to in my father hous it is true my second is not quit so spaciou as my former one there but for that veri reason is now prefer as it is more suitabl to my circumst the furnitur is all chintz my dear orlando ha suppli me with a few well chosen book i have my harpsichord my materi for draw and as for all sort of eleg work have onli to step down to mr bellmour and there i may at all time see and copi the greatest varieti she is delight with the honor i have done her in make choic of her hous and pay me as much respect as if she were a stranger to my misfortun she ha no other lodger though she ha anoth set of apart as good as mine which she can spare but ha made a

to bless heaven that i still enjoy so mani comfort sure i have you will perhap tell me i am exclud from all societi or at least from such as i have hitherto been accustom to it is veri true and societi is undoubtedli the first satisfact in life but though i had a numer acquaint it by no mean follow that in their compani i found what i call societi it is in my opinion a thing no longer understood it is still like friendship much talk of but where do we find it not at public place not at card parti societi accord to my idea consist in ration convers with sensibl well inform peopl where are they to be met with that there are mani such i make no doubt but what avail it a man or woman of superior understand make no better figur nay i am apt to think a wors figur at a public place or card assembl than one who can onli talk of the weather the fashion the opera or the last new play and where doe one meet ani soul but at place of thi natur not in london so my loss you see is not great in that articl do you harriot in your conscienc think they understand the matter much better in the countri i do not dure the few month peopl of fashion spend there do they not to the utmost of their power live exactli as they do in town where then is societi to be found i say it is wholli abolish and in it stead we have onli an etern round of insipid dissip in which as i said abov the fool
