take care when she search for paper befor she remov ani thing to observ how it lie that she may replac all to a hair salli and polli can occasion help to transcrib slow and sure with such a ladi must be all my movement it is imposs that one so young and so inexperienc can have all her caution from herself the behavior of the women so unexception no revel no compani ever admit into thi innerhous all genteel quiet and easi in it the nymph wellbr and wellread her first disgust to the old one got over it must be miss how therefor who onc wa in danger of be taken in by one of our class by honest sir georg colmar as thou have heard that make my progress difficult thou see belford by the abov precautionari that i forget noth as he song say it is not to be imagin on what slight string depend those thing on which men build their glori so far so good i shall never let my goddess rest till i have first discov where she put her letter and next till i have got her to a play to a concert or to take an air with me of a day or so i gave thee just now some of my contriv dorca who is ever attent to all her ladi motion ha given me some instanc of her mistresss precaut she wafer her letter it seem in two place prick the wafer and then seal upon them no doubt but those brought hither are taken the same care of and she alway examin the seal of the latter befor she open them i must i must come at them thi difficulti augment my curios strang so much as she write and at all hour that not one sleepi or forget moment ha offer in our favor a fair content thou see do not thou therefor reproach me for endeavor to take advantag of her tender year credul she ha none am not i a young fellow myself as to her fortun that is out of the question fortun never had ani other attract for me than to stimul me on and thi as i have elsewher said for motiv not ignobl as to beauti prythe jack do thou to spare my modesti make a comparison between my clarissa for a woman and thi lovelac for a man the onli point that can admit of debat as i conceiv is who ha most wit most circumspect and that is what remain to be tri a sad life howev for the poor ladi to live as well as for me that is to say if she be not natur jealou if she be her uneasi is constitut and she can not help it nor will it in that case hurt her for a suspici temper will make occas for doubt if none were to offer to her hand and so my fair one is oblig to me for save her the troubl of studi for these occas but after all the plain way in everi affair of the human life is the best i believ but it is not given me to choos it nor am i singular in the pursuit of the more intric path sinc there are thousand and ten thousand besid me who had rather fish in troubl water than in smooth letter ii mr lovelac to john beleord esquir tuesday may i am a veri unhappi fellow thi ladi is said to to be one of the sweetest temper creatur in the world and so i thought her but to me she is one of the most pervers i never wa

quarrel so gener happen befor a first is made up that it is hard to guess what event our love will be attend with but shakespear say come what come may patienc and time run through the roughest day and that shall be my comfort no man live bear cross better than myself but then they must be of my own make and even thi is a great merit and a great excel think what thou will sinc most of the troubl which fall to the lot of mortal are brought upon themselv either by their too larg desir or too littl desert but i shall make myself a common man byandbi which is what no one yet ever thought me i
