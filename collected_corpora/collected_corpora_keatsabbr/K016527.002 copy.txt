watch everi look of hi i never saw love and rever so agreeabl mingl in servant face in my life and hi command were deliv to them with so much gentl of voic and aspect that one could not but conclud in favor of both that they were the best of servant to the best of master mr grandison wa veri gallant in hi speech to me but veri uncivil with hi eye lord l said but littl but what he did say deservedli gain attent everybodi reverenc dr bartlett and wa attent when he spoke and would i dare say on hi own account had not the master of the hous by the regard he paid him engag everi one vener for him mani of the question which sir charl put to him as if to inform himself it wa evid he could himself have answer yet he put them with an air of teachabl if i may so express myself and receiv the doctor answer to them with as much satisfact as if he were then newli enlighten by them ah my luci you imagin i dare say that thi admir man lost noth in my eye by thi hi polit condescens reserv and a polit that had digniti in it show that the fine gentleman and the clergyman were not separ in dr bartlett piti they should be in ani of the function sir charl gave lord g an opportun to shine by lead the discours into circumst and detail which lord g could best recount my lord ha been a travel he is a connoisseur in antiqu and in those part of nice knowledg as i a woman call it with which the royal societi here and the learn and polit of other nation entertain themselv lord g appear to advantag as sir charl manag it under the aw eye of miss grandison upon my word luci she make veri free with him i whisper her that she did a veri miss how said i to a veri mr hickman rewhisp she but here is the differ i am not determin to have lord g miss how yield to her mother recommend and intend to marri mr hickman even when she use him worst one time or other archli continu she the whisper hold up her spread hand and with a counten of admir my lord g is to show us hi collect of butterfli and other gaudi insect will you make one of the gaudi insect whisper i fie harriet one of the parti you know i must mean let me tell you i never saw a collect of these variou insect that i did not the more admir the maker of them and of all us insect whatev i thought of the collector of the minut one anoth word with you harriet these littl play studi may do well enough with person who do not want to be more than indiffer to us but do you think a lover ought to take high delight in the paint wing of a butterfli when a fine ladi ha made herself all over butterfli to attract him eye off sir charl for he look though smilingli yet earnestli at us as we whisper behind the countesss chair who heard what wa said and wa pleas with it letter ii miss byron in continu thursday morn mar i should have told you that miss grandison did the honor of the tabl and i will go round it for i know you expect i should but i have not yet done with lord g poor man he is excess in love i see that well he may what man would not with miss grandison yet is she too superior i think what can a woman do who is address by a man of talent inferior to her own must she throw away her talent must she hide her light under a bushel pure to do credit to the man she can not pick and choos as men can she ha onli her neg and if she is desir to oblig her friend not alway that yet it is said women must not encourag fop and fool they must encourag men of sens onli and it is well said but what will they do if their lot be cast onli among fopl if the men of sens do not offer themselv and pray may i not ask if the tast of the age among the men is not dress equipag and fopperi is the cultiv of the mind ani part of their studi the men in short are sunk my dear and the women but bare swim lord g seem a littl too finic in hi dress and yet i am told that sir walter watkyn outdo him in fopperi what can they mean by it when sir charl grandison is befor them he scrupl not to modern a littl but then you see that it is in complianc with the fashion and to avoid singular a sault to which great mind are perhap too often subject though he is so much abov it i want to know methink whether sir charl is veri much in earnest in hi favor to lord g with regard to miss grandison i doubt not if he be but he ha good reason for it were thi vile sir hargrav out of my head i could satisfi myself about twenti and twenti thing that nowandthen i want to know miss jervoi behav veri discreetli with what pleasur did she hang on everi word that fell from the lip of her guardian i thought more than onc of swift cadenu and vanessa poor girl how i should piti her were she insens to suffer her gratitud to lead her to be in love with her benefactor inde i piti everybodi who is hopelesli in love now dont you shake your head my uncl did i not alway piti mr orm and mr fowler you know i did luci miss jervoi had a smile readi for everi one but it wa not an implicit a childish smile it had distinct in it and show intellig upon the whole she said littl and heard all that wa said with attent and henc i pronounc her a veri discreet young ladi but i thought to have done with the men first and here is mr grandison hardli mention who yet in hi own opinion wa not the last of the men at tabl mr grandison is a man of middl statur not handsom in my eye but so near be handsom that he may be excus when one know him for think himself so becaus he is liabl to make greater mistak than that he dress veri gaili too he is at the head of the fashion as it seem he think but howev is one of the first in it be it what it will he is a great frequent of the draw room of all manner of public spectacl a leader of the tast at a new play or opera he danc he sing he laugh and valu himself on all three qualif and yet certainli ha sens but is not like to improv it much sinc he seem to be so much afraid of suffer in the consequ he think himself of that whenev sir charl appli himself to him upon ani of hi leviti though but by the eye hi conscious howev mild the look make him show an uneasi at the instant he redden sit in pain call for favor by hi eye and hi quiver lip and ha notwithstand a smile readi to turn into a laugh in order to lessen hi own sensibilti should he be like to suffer in the opinion of the compani but everi motion show hi conscious of inferior to the man of whose smile or animadvers he is so veri apprehens what a captiou what a supercili husband to a woman who should happen to have a stronger mind than hi would mr grandison make but he valu himself upon hi have preserv hi liberti i believ there are more bachelor now in england by mani thousand than were a few year ago and probabl the number of them and of singl women of cours will everi year increas the luxuri of the age will account a good deal for thi and the turn our sex take in undomest themselv for a good deal more but let not these worthi young women who may think themselv destin to a singl life repin overmuch at their lot sinc possibl if they have had no lover or have had one two or three have not found an husband they have had rather a miss than a loss as men go and let me here add that i think as matter stand in thi age or inde ever did stand that those women who have join with the men in their insol ridicul of old maid ought never to be forgiven no though miss grandison should be one of the ridicul an old maid may be an odiou charact if they will tell us that the bad qualiti of the person not the maiden state are what they mean to expos but then they must allow that there are old maid of twenti and even that there are widow and wive of all age and complexion who in the abus sens of the word are as much old maid as the most particular of that class of femal but a word or two more concern mr grandison he is about thirtytwo he ha had the glori of ruin two or three women sir charl ha restor him to a sens of shame all men i hope are born with it which a sew month ago he had got abov and he doe not now entertain ladi with instanc of the frailti of individu of their sex which mani are too apt encouragingli to smile at when i am veri much mistaken if everi woman would not find her account if she wish herself to be thought well of in discourag everi reflect that may have a tendenc to debas or expos the sex in gener how can a man be suffer to boast of hi vile to one woman in the presenc of anoth without a rebuk that should put it to the proof whether the boaster wa or wa not past blush mr grandison is thought to have hurt hi fortun which wa veri consider by hi free live and an itch of game to cure him of which sir charl encourag him to give him hi compani at all opportun he certainli ha understand enough to know how to valu the favor for he own to miss grandison that he both love and fear him and nowandthen tell her that he would give the world if he had it to be abl to be just what sir charl is good god at other time he ha broke out what an odiou creatur is a rake how i hate myself when i contempl the excel of thi divin brother of your i shall say noth of sir charl in thi place you i know my luci will admir me for my forbear ladi l and miss grandison were the grace of the tabl so live so sensibl so frank so polit so goodhumor what honor do they and their brother reflect back on the memori of their mother ladi grandison it seem wa an excel woman sir thoma wa not i have heard quit unexception how use if so are the women in the greater as well as in the lesser part of domest duti where they perform their duti and what have those who do not to answer for to god to their children and even to their whole sex for the contempt they bring upon it by their useles and perhap extravag sinc if the human mind is not activ good it will gener be activ evil dr bartlett i have alreadi spoken of how did he enliven the convers whenev he bore a part in it so happi an elocut so clear so just so solid hi reason i wish i could rememb everi word he said sir charl observ to us befor we saw him that he wa not forward to speak but as i hint he threw the occas in hi way on purpos to draw him out and at such time what he said wa easi free and unaffect and whenev a subject wa conclud he had done with it hi modesti in short made him alway follow rather than lead a subject as he veri well might do be it what it would i wa charm with the brachman prayer which he occasion gave us on the ancient persian be talk of look up to the rise sun which it wa suppos they worship these were the word of the brachman o thou mean the almighti by whom thou mean the sun art enlighten illumin my mind that my action may be agreeabl to thi will and thi i will think of my luci as often as my earli hour for the futur shall be irradi by that gloriou orb everybodi wa pleas with mr and mr reev their modesti good sens and amiabl temper and the kind yet not ostentati regard which they express to each other a regard so credit to the marri state caus them to be alway treat and spoken of with distinct but i believ as i am in a scribbl vein i must give you the particular of one convers in which farther honor wa done to dr bartlett after dinner the countess draw me on one side by both my hand said

miss grandison as he lean upon my chair how could sir hargrav pollexfen have the heart to endeavor to stop such a mouth as that and now have last night and thi morn written so mani side it is time to break off yet i could give you mani more particular of agreeabl convers that pass were i sure you would not think me insuffer tediou and did not the unkind reserv of my cousin reev as to the busi of that bagenhal rush upon my memori with fresh forc and help to tire my finger i am the more concern as my cousin himself seem not easi but is in expect of hear someth that will either give him relief or add to hi pain whi luci should our friend take upon themselv to keep us in the dark as to those matter which it concern us more to know than perhap anybodi els there is a tender sometim shown on arduou occas in thi respect that give as much pain as we could receiv from the most explicit commun and then all the while there is so much strength of mind and discret suppos in the person that know an event and such weak in her that is to be kept in ignor that but i grow as sauci as impati let me conclud befor i expos my self to reproof for a petul that i hope is not natur to your harriet byron letter iii miss harriet byron to miss luci selbi thursday night mar and what do you think wa the reason of mr reevess reserv a most alarm one i am oblig to him that he kept it from me though the uncertainti did not a littl affect me take the account of it as it come out i told you in my former that the person to whom sir charl wa sent for out wa mr bagenhal and that sir charl had sent in for mr reev who return to the compani with a counten that i did not like so well as i did sir charless i now proceed to give you from minut of mr reev what pass on the occas sir charl took mr reev asid thi unhappi man sir hargrav i mean said he seem to me to want an excus to himself for put up with a treatment which he think disgrac when we have to deal with children humor must be a littl allow for but you will hear what the propos is now let not the ladi howev nor the gentlemen within know ani thing of the matter till all is over thi is a day devot to pleasur but you mr reev know someth of the matter and can answer for your fair cousin he then led mr reev in to mr bagenhal thi sir is mr reev sir hargrav in short mr reev among other demand that i can not compli with but which relat onli to myself and therefor need not be mention insist upon an introduct to miss byron he say she is absolut disengag is she sir i dare say she is answer my cousin thi gentleman ha been name to me mr grevil mr orm and other no one of them ha ever met with the shadow of encourag from my cousin she is abov keep ani man in suspens when she is not in ani herself noth ha given her more uneasi than the number of her admir miss byron said sir charl must be admir by everi one that behold her but still more by those who are admit to the honor of convers with her but sir hargrav is will to build upon her disengag someth in hi own favor is there ani room for sir hargrav who plead hi suffer for her who vow hi honor intent even at the time that he wa hope to gain her by so unmanli a violenc and appeal to her for the puriti as he call it of hi behavior to her all the time she wa in hi hand who make veri larg offer of settlement is there ani room to hope that miss byron no none at all sir charl what not to save a life mr reev said mr bagenhal if you mean mine mr bagenhal repli sir charl i beg that that may not be consid if sir hargrav mean hi own i will pronounc that safe from ani premedit resent of mine do you think miss byron will bear to see sir hargrav mr reev i presum he intend to beg pardon of her will she consent to receiv a visit from him but is not thi wretch trisl mr bagenhal you will rememb sir charl thi is a propos of mine what i hope might be agre to by sir hargrav but that i wa will to consult you befor i mention it to him i beg your pardon mr bagenhal i now rememb it if ever man doat upon a woman said mr bagenhal it is sir hargrav on miss byron the veri method he took to obtain her for a wife show that most convincingli you will promis not to stand in hi way sir i repeat mr bagenhal what i have heretofor told you that miss byron you will excus me mr reev is still under my protect if sir hargrav as he ought is inclin to ask her pardon and if he can obtain it and even upon hi own term i shall think miss byron and he may be happier togeth than at present i can imagin it possibl i am not desir to be anyway consid but as her protector from violenc and insult and that i will be if she claim it in defianc of an hundr such men as sir hargrav but then sir the occas must be sudden no legal relief must be at hand i will not either for an adversari sake or my own be defi into a cool and premedit vengeanc but sir charl sir hargrav ha some hardship in thi case you will not give him the satisfact of a gentleman and accord to the law of honor a man is not entitl to be treat as a gentleman who deni to one of whose make mr bagenhal are the law of honor you mention i own no law but the law of god and my countri but to cut thi matter short tell sir hargrav that littl as is the depend a man of honor can have upon that of a man who ha act by an helpless woman as he ha act by miss byron i will breakfast with him in hi own hous tomorrow morn if he contradict it not i will attribut to the violenc of hi passion for the ladi the unmanli outrag he wa guilti of i will suppos him mistaken enough to imagin that he should make her amend by marriag if he could compel her hand and will trust my person to hi honor one servant onli to walk befor hi door not to enter the hous to attend my command after our convers is over my sword and my sword onli shall be my companion but thi rather that i would not be thought to owe my safeti to the want of it than in expect after such confid place in him to have occas to draw it in my own defens and pray mr bagenhal do you hi friend be present and ani other friend and to what number he pleas when i came to thi place in my cousin minut i wa astonish i wa out of breath upon it mr bagenhal wa surpris and ask sir charl if he were in earnest i would not be thought a rash man mr bagenhal sir hargrav threaten me i never avoid a threaten you seem to hint sir that i am not entitl to fair play if i consent not to meet him with a murder intent with such an intent i never will meet ani man though i have as much reason to reli on the skill of my arm as on the justic of my caus if foul play is hint at i am no more safe from an assassin in my bedchamb than in sir hargrav hous someth must be done by a man who refus a challeng to let a challeng see such is the world such is the custom that he ha better motiv than fear for hi refus i will put sir hargrav honor to the fullest test tell him sir that i will bear a great deal but that i will not be insult were he a princ and you realli would have me i would mr bagenhal sir hargrav i see will not be satisfi unless someth extraordinari be done and if i hear not from you or from him i will attend him by ten tomorrow morn in an amic manner to breakfast at hi own hous in cavendish squar i am in terror luci even in transcrib onli mr reev said sir charl you undo me if one word of thi matter escap you even to your wife mr reev beg that he might attend him to sir hargrav by no mean mr reev then sir charl you apprehend danger i do not someth as i said must be done thi is the shortest and best method to make all parti easi sir hargrav think himself slight he may infer if he pleas in hi own favor that i do not despis a man in whom i can place such a confid do you mr reev return to compani and let no one know the occas of your absenc or of mine from it i have told you my dear what a differ there wa in the counten of both when each separ enter the dine room and could thi great man sure i may call him great could he in such circumst on hi return give joy pleasur
