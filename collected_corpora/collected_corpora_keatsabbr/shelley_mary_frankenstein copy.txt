of languag nor the code of govern nor the polit of variou state possess attract for me it wa the secret of heaven and earth that i desir to learn and whether it wa the outward substanc of thing or the inner spirit of natur and the mysteri soul of man that occupi me still my inquiri were direct to the metaphys or in it highest sens the physic secret of the world meanwhil clerval occupi himself so to speak with the moral relat of thing the busi stage of life the virtu of hero and the action of men were hi theme and hi hope and hi dream wa to becom one among those whose name are record in stori as

led by insens step to my after tale of miseri for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterward rule my destini i find it aris like a mountain river from ignobl and almost forgotten sourc but swell as it proceed it becam the torrent which in it cours ha swept away all my hope and joy natur philosophi is the geniu that ha regul my fate i desir therefor in thi narrat to state those fact which led to my predilect for that scienc when i wa thirteen year of age we all went on a parti of pleasur to the bath near thonon the inclem of the weather oblig us to remain a day confin to the inn in thi hous i chanc to find a volum of the work of corneliu agrippa i open it with apathi the theori which he attempt to demonstr and the wonder fact which he relat soon chang thi feel into enthusiasm a new light seem to dawn upon my mind and bound with joy i commun my discoveri to my father my father look carelessli at the titl page of my book and said ah corneliu agrippa my dear victor do not wast your time upon thi it is sad trash if instead of thi remark my father had taken the pain to explain to me that the principl of agrippa had been entir explod and that a modern system of scienc had been introduc which possess much greater power than the ancient becaus the power of the latter were chimer while those of the former were real and practic under such circumst i should certainli have thrown agrippa asid and have content my imagin warm as it wa by return with greater ardour to my former studi it is even possibl that the train of my idea would never have receiv the fatal impuls that led to my ruin but the cursori glanc my father had taken of my volum by no mean assur me that he wa acquaint with it content and i continu to read with the greatest avid when i return home my first care wa to procur the whole work of thi author and afterward of paracelsu and albertu magnu i read and studi the wild fanci of these writer with delight they appear to me treasur known to few besid myself i have describ myself as alway have been imbu with a fervent long to penetr the secret of natur in spite of the intens labour and wonder discoveri of modern philosoph i alway came from my studi discont and unsatisfi sir isaac newton is said to have avow that he felt like a child pick up shell besid the great and unexplor ocean of truth those of hi successor in each branch of natur philosophi with whom i wa acquaint appear even to my boy apprehens as tyro engag in the same pursuit the untaught peasant beheld the element around him and wa acquaint with their practic use the most learn philosoph knew littl more he had partial unveil the face of natur but her immort lineament were still a wonder and a mysteri he might dissect anatomis and give name but not to speak of a final caus caus in their secondari and tertiari grade were utterli unknown to him i had gaze upon the fortif and impedi that seem to keep human be from enter the citadel of natur and rashli and ignorantli i had repin but here were book and here were men who had penetr deeper and knew more i took their word for all that they aver and i becam their discipl it may appear strang that such should aris in the eighteenth centuri but while i follow the routin of educ in the school of geneva i wa to a great degre selftaught with regard to my favourit studi my father wa not scientif and i wa left to struggl with a child blind ad to a student thirst for knowledg under the guidanc of my new preceptor i enter with the greatest dilig into the search of the philosoph stone and the elixir of life but the latter soon obtain my undivid attent wealth wa an inferior object but what glori would attend the discoveri if i could banish diseas from the human frame and render man invulner to ani but a violent death nor were these my onli vision the rais of ghost or devil wa a promis liber accord by my favourit author the fulfil of which i most eagerli sought and if my incant were alway unsuccess i attribut the failur rather to my own inexperi and mistak than to a want of skill or fidel in my instructor and thu for a time i wa occupi by explod system mingl like an unadept a thousand contradictori theori and flounder desper in a veri slough of multifari knowledg guid by an ardent imagin and childish reason till an accid again chang the current of my idea when i wa about fifteen year old we had retir to our hous near belriv when we wit a most violent and terribl thunderstorm it advanc from behind the mountain of jura and the thunder burst at onc with fright loud from variou quarter of the heaven i remain while the storm last watch it progress with curios and delight as i stood at the door on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issu from an old and beauti oak which stood about twenti yard from our hous and so soon as the dazzl light vanish the oak had disappear and noth remain but a blast stump when we visit it the next morn we found the tree shatter in a singular manner it wa not splinter by the shock but entir reduc to thin ribbon of wood i never beheld anyth so utterli destroy befor thi i wa not unacquaint with the more obviou law of electr on thi occas a man of great research in natur philosophi wa with us and excit by thi catastroph he enter on the explan of a theori which he had form on the subject of electr and galvan which wa at onc new and astonish to me all that he said threw greatli into the shade corneliu agrippa albertu magnu and paracelsu the lord of my imagin but by some fatal the overthrow of these men disinclin me to pursu my accustom studi it seem to me as if noth would or could ever be known all that had so long engag my attent suddenli grew despic by one of those capric of the mind which we are perhap most subject to in earli youth i at onc gave up my former occup set down natur histori and all it progeni as a deform and abort creation and entertain the greatest disdain for a wouldb scienc which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledg in thi mood of mind i betook myself to the mathemat and the branch of studi appertain to that scienc as be built upon secur foundat and so worthi of my consider thu strang are our soul construct and by such slight ligament are we bound to prosper or ruin when i look back it seem to me as if thi almost miracul chang of inclin and will wa the immedi suggest of the guardian angel of my life—th last effort made by the spirit of preserv to avert the storm that wa even then hang in the star and readi to envelop me her victori wa announc by an unusu tranquil and glad of soul which follow the relinquish of my ancient and latterli torment studi it wa thu that i wa to be taught to associ evil with their prosecut happi with their disregard it wa a strong effort of the spirit of good but it wa ineffectu destini wa too potent and her immut law had decre my utter and terribl destruct chapter when i had attain the age of seventeen my parent resolv that i should becom a student at the univers of ingolstadt i had hitherto attend the school of geneva but my father thought it necessari for the complet of my educ that i should be made acquaint with other custom than those of my nativ countri my departur wa therefor fix at an earli date but befor the day resolv upon could arriv the first misfortun of my life occurred—an omen as it were of my futur miseri elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever her ill wa sever and she wa in the greatest danger dure her ill mani argument had been urg to persuad my mother to refrain from attend upon her she had at first yield to our entreati but when she heard that the life of her favourit wa menac she could no longer control her anxieti she attend her sickb her watch attent triumph over the malign of the distemper—elizabeth wa save but the consequ of thi imprud were fatal to her preserv on the third day my mother sicken her fever wa accompani by the most alarm symptom and the look of her medic attend prognost the worst event on her deathb the fortitud and benign of thi best of women did not desert her she join the hand of elizabeth and myself my children she said my firmest hope of futur happi were place on the prospect of your union thi expect will now be the consol of your father elizabeth my love you must suppli my place to my younger children ala i regret that i am taken from you and happi and belov as i have been is it not hard to quit you all but these are not thought befit me i will endeavour to resign myself cheer to death and will indulg a hope of meet you in anoth world she die calmli and her counten express affect even in death i need not describ the feel of those whose dearest tie are rent by that most irrepar evil the void that present itself to the soul and the despair that is exhibit on the counten it is so long befor the mind can persuad itself that she whom we saw everi day and whose veri exist appear a part of our own can have depart for ever—that the bright of a belov eye can have been extinguish and the sound of a voic so familiar and dear to the ear can be hush never more to be heard these are the reflect of the first day but when the laps of time prove the realiti of the evil then the actual bitter of grief commenc yet from whom ha not that rude hand rent away some dear connect and whi should i describ a sorrow which all have felt and must feel the time at length arriv when grief is rather an indulg than a necess and the smile that play upon the lip although it may be deem a sacrileg is not banish my mother wa dead but we had still duti which we ought to perform we must continu our cours with the rest and learn to think ourselv fortun whilst one remain whom the spoiler ha not seiz my departur for ingolstadt which had been defer by these event wa now again determin upon i obtain from my father a respit of some week it appear to me sacrileg so soon to leav the repos akin to death of the hous of mourn and to rush into the thick of life i wa new to sorrow but it did not the less alarm me i wa unwil to quit the sight of those that remain to me and abov all i desir to see my sweet elizabeth in some degre consol she inde veil her grief and strove to act the comfort to us all she look steadili on life and assum it duti with courag and zeal she devot herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncl and cousin never wa she so enchant as at thi time when she recal the sunshin of her smile and spent them upon us she forgot even her own regret in her endeavour to make us forget the day of my departur at length arriv clerval spent the last even with us he had endeavour to persuad hi father to permit him to accompani me and to becom my fellow student but in vain hi father wa a narrowmind trader and saw idl and ruin in the aspir and ambit of hi son henri deepli felt the misfortun of be debar from a liber educ he said littl but when he spoke i read in hi kindl eye and in hi anim glanc a restrain but firm resolv not to be chain to the miser detail of commerc we sat late we could not tear ourselv away from each other nor persuad ourselv to say the word farewel it wa said and we retir under the pretenc of seek repos each fanci that the other wa deceiv but when at morn dawn i descend to the carriag which wa to convey me away they were all there—mi father again to bless me clerval to press my hand onc more my elizabeth to renew her entreati that i would write often and to bestow the last feminin attent on her playmat and friend i threw myself into the chais that wa to convey me away and indulg in the most melancholi reflect i who had ever been surround by amiabl companion continu engag in endeavour to bestow mutual pleasure—i wa now alon in the univers whither i wa go i must form my own friend and be my own protector my life had hitherto been remark seclud and domest and thi had given me invinc repugn to new counten i love my brother elizabeth and clerval these were old familiar face but i believ myself total unfit for the compani of stranger such were my reflect as i commenc my journey but as i proceed my spirit and hope rose i ardent desir the acquisit of knowledg i had often when at home thought it hard to remain dure my youth coop up in one place and had long to enter the world and take my station among other human be now my desir were compli with and it would inde have been folli to repent i had suffici leisur for these and mani other reflect dure my journey to ingolstadt which wa long and fatigu at length the high white steepl of the town met my eye i alight and wa conduct to my solitari apart to spend the even as i pleas the next morn i deliv my letter of introduct and paid a visit to some of the princip professor chance—or rather the evil influenc the angel of destruct which assert omnipot sway over me from the moment i turn my reluct step from my father door—l me first to m kremp professor of natur philosophi he wa an uncouth man but deepli imbu in the secret of hi scienc he ask me sever question concern my progress in the differ branch of scienc appertain to natur philosophi i repli carelessli and partli in contempt mention the name of my alchemist as the princip author i had studi the professor stare have you he said realli spent your time in studi such nonsens i repli in the affirm everi minut continu m kremp with warmth everi instant that you have wast on those book is utterli and entir lost you have burden your memori with explod system and useless name good god in what desert land have you live where no one wa kind enough to inform you that these fanci which you have so greedili imbib are a thousand year old and as musti as they are ancient i littl expect in thi enlighten and scientif age to find a discipl of albertu magnu and paracelsu my dear sir you must begin your studi entir anew so say he step asid and wrote down a list of sever book treat of natur philosophi which he desir me to procur and dismiss me after mention that in the begin of the follow week he intend to commenc a cours of lectur upon natur philosophi in it gener relat and that m waldman a fellow professor would lectur upon chemistri the altern day that he omit i return home not disappoint for i have said that i had long consid those author useless whom the professor reprob but i return not at all the more inclin to recur to these studi in ani shape m kremp wa a littl squat man with a gruff voic and a repuls counten the teacher therefor did not prepossess me in favour of hi pursuit in rather a too philosoph and connect a strain perhap i have given an account of the conclus i had come to concern them in my earli year as a child i had not been content with the result promis by the modern professor of natur scienc with a confus of idea onli to be account for by my extrem youth and my want of a guid on such matter i had retrod the step of knowledg along the path of time and exchang the discoveri of recent inquir for the dream of forgotten alchemist besid i had a contempt for the use of modern natur philosophi it wa veri differ when the master of the scienc sought immort and power such view although futil were grand but now the scene wa chang the ambit of the inquir seem to limit itself to the annihil of those vision on which my interest in scienc wa chiefli found i wa requir to exchang chimera of boundless grandeur for realiti of littl worth such were my reflect dure the first two or three day of my resid at ingolstadt which were chiefli spent in becom acquaint with the local and the princip resid in my new abod but as the ensu week commenc i thought of the inform which m kremp had given me concern the lectur and although i could not consent to go and hear that littl conceit fellow deliv sentenc out of a pulpit i recollect what he had said of m waldman whom i had never seen as he had hitherto been out of town partli from curios and partli from idl i went into the lectur room which m waldman enter shortli after thi professor wa veri unlik hi colleagu he appear about fifti year of age but with an aspect express of the greatest benevol a few grey hair cover hi templ but those at the back of hi head were nearli black hi person wa short but remark erect and hi voic the sweetest i had ever heard he began hi lectur by a recapitul of the histori of chemistri and the variou improv made by differ men of learn pronounc with fervour the name of the most distinguish discover he then took a cursori view of the present state of the scienc and explain mani of it elementari term after have made a few preparatori experi he conclud with a panegyr upon modern chemistri the term of which i shall never forget the ancient teacher of thi scienc said he promis imposs and perform noth the modern master promis veri littl they know that metal can not be transmut and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosoph whose hand seem onli made to dabbl in dirt and their eye to pore over the microscop or crucibl have inde perform miracl they penetr into the recess of natur and show how she work in her hidingplac they ascend into the heaven they have discov how the blood circul and the natur of the air we breath they have acquir new and almost unlimit power they can command the thunder of heaven mimic the earthquak and even mock the invis world with it own shadow such were the professor words—rath let me say such the word of the fate—enounc to destroy me as he went on i felt as if my soul were grappl with a palpabl enemi one by one the variou key were touch which form the mechan of my be chord after chord wa sound and soon my mind wa fill with one thought one concept one purpos so much ha been done exclaim the soul of frankenstein—mor far more will i achiev tread in the step alreadi mark i will pioneer a new way explor unknown power and unfold to the world the deepest mysteri of creation i close not my eye that night my intern be wa in a state of insurrect and turmoil i felt that order would thenc aris but i had no power to produc it by degre after the morn dawn sleep came i awok and my yesternight thought were as a dream there onli remain a resolut to return to my ancient studi and to devot myself to a scienc for which i believ myself to possess a natur talent on the same day i paid m waldman a visit hi manner in privat were even more mild and attract than in public for there wa a certain digniti in hi mien dure hi lectur which in hi own hous wa replac by the greatest affabl and kind i gave him pretti nearli the same account of my former pursuit as i had given to hi fellow professor he heard with attent the littl narrat concern my studi and smile at the name of corneliu agrippa and paracelsu but without the contempt that m kremp had exhibit he said that these were men to whose indefatig zeal modern philosoph were indebt for most of the foundat of their knowledg they had left to us as an easier task to give new name and arrang in connect classif the fact which they in a great degre had been the instrument of bring to light the labour of men of geniu howev erron direct scarc ever fail in ultim turn to the solid advantag of mankind i listen to hi statement which wa deliv without ani presumpt or affect and then ad that hi lectur had remov my prejudic against modern chemist i express myself in measur term with the modesti and defer due from a youth to hi instructor without let escap inexperi in life would have made me asham ani of the enthusiasm which stimul my intend labour i request hi advic concern the book i ought to procur i am happi said m waldman to have gain a discipl and if your applic equal your abil i have no doubt of your success chemistri is that branch of natur philosophi in which the greatest improv have been and may be made it is on that account that i have made it my peculiar studi but at the same time i have not neglect the other branch of scienc a man would make but a veri sorri chemist if he attend to that depart of human knowledg alon if your wish is to becom realli a man of scienc and not mere a petti experimentalist i should advis you to appli to everi branch of natur philosophi includ mathemat he then took me into hi laboratori and explain to me the use of hi variou machin instruct me as to what i ought to procur and promis me the use of hi own when i should have advanc far enough in the scienc not to derang their mechan he also gave me the list of book which i had request and i took my leav thu end a day memor to me it decid my futur destini chapter from thi day natur philosophi and particularli chemistri in the most comprehens sens of the term becam nearli my sole occup i read with ardour those work so full of geniu and discrimin which modern inquir have written on these subject i attend the lectur and cultiv the acquaint of the men of scienc of the univers and i found even in m kremp a great deal of sound sens and real inform combin it is true with a repuls physiognomi and manner but not on that account the less valuabl in m waldman i found a true friend hi gentl wa never ting by dogmat and hi instruct were given with an air of frank and good natur that banish everi idea of pedantri in a thousand way he smooth for me the path of knowledg and made the most abstrus inquiri clear and facil to my apprehens my applic wa at first fluctuat and uncertain it gain strength as i proceed and soon becam so ardent and eager that the star often disappear in the light of morn whilst i wa yet engag in my laboratori as i appli so close it may be easili conceiv that my progress wa rapid my ardour wa inde the astonish of the student and my profici that of the master professor kremp often ask me with a sli smile how corneliu agrippa went on whilst m waldman express the most heartfelt exult in my progress two year pass in thi manner dure which i paid no visit to geneva but wa engag heart and soul in the pursuit of some discoveri which i hope to make none but those who have experienc them can conceiv of the entic of scienc in other studi you go as far as other have gone befor you and there is noth more to know but in a scientif pursuit there is continu food for discoveri and wonder a mind of moder capac which close pursu one studi must infal arriv at great profici in that studi and i who continu sought the attain of one object of pursuit and wa sole wrap up in thi improv so rapidli that at the end of two year i made some discoveri in the improv of some chemic instrument which procur me great esteem and admir at the univers when i had arriv at thi point and had becom as well acquaint with the theori and practic of natur philosophi as depend on the lesson of ani of the professor at ingolstadt my resid there be no longer conduc to my improv i thought of return to my friend and my nativ town when an incid happen that protract my stay one of the phenomena which had peculiarli attract my attent wa the structur of the human frame and inde ani anim endu with life whenc i often ask myself did the principl of life proceed it wa a bold question and one which ha ever been consid as a mysteri yet with how mani thing are we upon the brink of becom acquaint if cowardic or careless did not restrain our inquiri i revolv these circumst in my mind and determin thenceforth to appli myself more particularli to those branch of natur philosophi which relat to physiolog unless i had been anim by an almost supernatur enthusiasm my applic to thi studi would have been irksom and almost intoler to examin the caus of life we must first have recours to death i becam acquaint with the scienc of anatomi but thi wa not suffici i must also observ the natur decay and corrupt of the human bodi in my educ my father had taken the greatest precaut that my mind should be impress with no supernatur horror i do not ever rememb to have trembl at a tale of superstit or to have fear the apparit of a spirit dark had no effect upon my fanci and a churchyard wa to me mere the receptacl of bodi depriv of life which from be the seat of beauti and strength had becom food for the worm now i wa led to examin the caus and progress of thi decay and forc to spend day and night in vault and charnelhous my attent wa fix upon everi object the most insupport to the delicaci of the human feel i saw how the fine form of man wa degrad and wast i beheld the corrupt of death succeed to the bloom cheek of life i saw how the worm inherit the wonder of the eye and brain i paus examin and analys all the minutia of causat as exemplifi in the chang from life to death and death to life until from the midst of thi dark a sudden
