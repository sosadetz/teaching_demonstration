the histori of civil societi part first of the gener characterist of human natur section i of the question relat to the state of natur natur product are gener form by degre veget grow from a tender shoot and anim from an infant state the latter be destin to act extend their oper as their power increas they exhibit a progress in what they perform as well as in the faculti they acquir thi progress in the case of man is continu to a greater extent than in that of ani other anim not onli the individu advanc from infanc to manhood but the speci itself from rude to civil henc the suppos departur of mankind from the state of their natur henc our conjectur and differ opinion of what man must have been in the first age of hi be the poet the historian and the moralist frequent allud to thi ancient time and under the emblem of gold or of iron repres a condit and a manner of life from which mankind have either degener or on which they have greatli improv on either supposit the first state of our natur must have born no resembl to what men have exhibit in ani subsequ period histor monument even of the earliest date are to be consid as novelti and the most common establish of human societi are to be class among the encroach which fraud oppress or a busi invent have made upon the reign of natur by which the chief of our grievanc or bless were equal withheld among the writer who have attempt to distinguish in the human charact it origin qualiti and to point out the limit between natur and art some have repres mankind in their first condit as possess of mere anim sensibl without ani exercis of the faculti that render them superior to the brute without ani polit union without ani mean of explain their sentiment and even without possess ani of the apprehens and passion which the voic and the gestur are so well fit to express other have made the state of natur to consist in perpetu war kindl by competit for dominion and interest where everi individu had a separ quarrel with hi kind and where the presenc of a fellow creatur wa the signal of battl the desir of lay the foundat of a favorit system or a fond expect perhap that we may be abl to penetr the secret of natur to the veri sourc of exist have on thi subject led to mani fruitless inquiri and given rise to mani wild supposit among the variou qualiti which mankind possess we select one or a few particular on which to establish a theori and in frame our account of what man wa in some imaginari state of natur we overlook what he ha alway appear within the reach of our own observ and in the record of histori in everi other instanc howev the natur historian think himself oblig to collect fact not to offer conjectur when he treat of ani particular speci of anim he suppos that their present disposit and instinct are the same they origin had and that their present manner of life is a continu of their first destin he admit that hi knowledg of the materi system of the world consist in a collect of fact or at most in gener tenet deriv from particular observ and experi it is onli in what relat to himself and in matter the most import and the most easili known that he substitut hypothesi instead of realiti and confound the provinc of imagin and reason of poetri and scienc but without enter ani farther on question either in moral or physic subject relat to the manner or the origin of our knowledg without ani disparag to that subtilti which would analyz everi sentiment and trace everi mode of be to it sourc it may be safe affirm that the charact of man as he now exist that the law of thi anim and intellectu system on which hi happi now depend deserv our princip studi and that gener principl relat to thi or ani other subject are use onli so far as they are found on just observ and lead to the knowledg of import consequ or so far as they enabl us to act with success when we would appli either the intellectu or the physic power of natur to the great purpos of human life if both the earliest and the latest account collect from everi quarter of the earth repres mankind as assembl in troop and compani and the individu alway join by affect to one parti while he is possibl oppos to anoth employ in the exercis of recollect and foresight inclin to commun hi own sentiment and to be made acquaint with those of other these fact must be admit as the foundat of all our reason rel to man hi mix disposit to friendship or enmiti hi reason hi use of languag and articul sound like the shape and the erect posit of hi bodi are to be consid as so mani attribut of hi natur they are to be retain in hi descript as the wing and the paw are in that of the eagl and the lion and as differ degre of fierc vigil timid or speed are made to occupi a place in the natur histori of differ anim if the question be put what the mind of man could perform when left to itself and without the aid of ani foreign direct we are to look for our answer in the histori of mankind particular experi which have been found so use in establish the principl of other scienc could probabl on thi subject teach us noth import or new we are to take the histori of everi activ be from hi conduct in the situat to which he is form not from hi appear in ani forc or uncommon condit a wild man therefor caught in the wood where he had alway live apart from hi speci is a singular instanc not a specimen of ani gener charact as the anatomi of an eye which had never receiv the impress of light or that of an ear which had never felt the impuls of sound would probabl exhibit defect in the veri structur of the organ themselv aris from their not be appli to their proper function so ani particular case of thi sort would onli show in what degre the power of apprehens and sentiment could exist where they had not been employ and what would be the defect and imbecil of a heart in which the emot that pertain to societi had never been felt mankind are to be taken in group as they have alway subsist the histori of the individu is but a detail of the sentiment and thought he ha entertain in the view of hi speci and everi experi rel to thi subject should be made with entir societi not with singl men we have everi reason howev to believ that in the case of such an experi made we shall suppos with a coloni of children transplant from the nurseri and left to form a societi apart untaught and undisciplin we should onli have the same thing repeat which in so mani differ part of the earth have been transact alreadi the member of our littl societi would feed and sleep would herd togeth and play would have a languag of their own would quarrel and divid would be to one anoth the most import object of the scene and in the ardour of their friendship and competit would overlook their person danger and suspend the care of their selfpreserv ha not the human race been plant like the coloni in question who ha direct their cours whose instruct have they heard or whose exampl have they follow natur therefor we shall presum have given to everi anim it mode of exist it disposit and manner of life ha dealt equal with those of the human race and the natur historian who would collect the properti of thi speci may fill up everi articl now as well as he could have done in ani former age yet one properti by which man is distinguish ha been sometim overlook in the account of hi natur or ha onli serv to mislead our attent in other class of anim the individu advanc from infanc to age or matur and he attain in the compass of a singl life to all the perfect hi natur can reach but in the human kind the speci ha a progress as well as the individu they build in everi subsequ age on foundat formerli laid and in a success of year tend to a perfect in the applic of their faculti to which the aid of long experi is requir and to which mani gener must have combin their endeavor we observ the progress they have made we distinctli enumer mani of it step we can trace them back to a distant antiqu of which no record remain nor ani monument is preserv to inform us what were the open of thi wonder scene the consequ is that instead of attend to the charact of our speci where the particular are vouch by the surest author we endeavor to trace it through age and scene unknown and instead of suppos that the begin of our stori wa nearli of a piec with the sequel we think ourselv warrant to reject everi circumst of our present condit and frame as adventiti and foreign to our natur the progress of mankind from a suppos state of anim sensibl to the attain of reason to the use of languag and to the habit of societi ha been accordingli paint with a forc of imagin and it step have been mark with a bold of invent that would tempt us to admit among the materi of histori the suggest of fanci and to receiv perhap as the model of our natur in it origin state some of the anim whose shape ha the greatest resembl to our rousseau sur lorigin de linegalit parmi le homm it would be ridicul to affirm as a discoveri that the speci of the hors wa probabl never the same with that of the lion yet in opposit to what ha drop from the pen of emin writer we are oblig to observ that men have alway appear among anim a distinct and a superior race that neither the possess of similar organ nor the approxim of shape nor the use of the hand trait de lesprit nor the continu intercours with thi sovereign artist ha enabl ani other speci to blend their natur or their invent with hi that in hi rudest state he is found to be abov them and in hi greatest degeneraci never descend to their level he is in short a man in everi condit and we can learn noth of hi natur from the analog of other anim if we would know him we must attend to himself to the cours of hi life and the tenor of hi conduct with him the societi appear to be as old as the individu and the use of the tongu as univers as that of the hand or the foot if there wa a time in which he had hi acquaint with hi own speci to make and hi faculti to acquir it is a time of which we have no record and in relat to which our opinion can serv no purpos and are support by no evid we are often tempt into those boundless region of ignor or conjectur by a fanci which delight in creat rather than in mere retain the form which are present befor it we are the dupe of a subtilti which promis to suppli everi defect of our knowledg and by fill up a few blank in the stori of natur pretend to conduct our apprehens nearer to the sourc of exist on the credit of a few observ we are apt to presum that the secret may soon be laid open and that what is term wisdom in natur may be refer to the oper of physic power we forget that physic power employ in success and combin to a salutari purpos constitut those veri proof of design from which we infer the exist of god and that thi truth be onc admit we are no longer to search for the sourc of exist we can onli collect the law which the author of natur ha establish and in our latest as well as our earliest discoveri onli come to perceiv a mode of creation or provid befor unknown we speak of art as distinguish from natur but art itself is natur to man he is in some measur the artific of hi own frame as well as hi fortun and is destin from the first age of hi be to invent and contriv he appli the same talent to a varieti of purpos and act nearli the same part in veri differ scene he would be alway improv on hi subject and he carri thi intent wherev he move through the street of the popul citi or the wild of the forest while he appear equal fit to everi condit he is upon thi account unabl to settl in ani at onc obstin and fickl he complain of innov and is never sate with novelti he is perpetu busi in reform and is continu wed to hi error if he dwell in a cave he would improv it into a cottag if he ha alreadi built he would still build to a greater extent but he doe not propos to make rapid and hasti transit hi step are progress and slow and hi forc like the power of a spring silent press on everi resist an effect is sometim produc befor the caus is perceiv and with all hi talent for project hi work is often accomplish befor the plan is devis it appear perhap equal difficult to retard or to quicken hi pace if the projector complain he is tardi the moralist think him unstabl and whether hi motion be rapid or slow the scene of human affair perpetu chang in hi manag hi emblem is a pass stream not a stagnat pool we may desir to direct hi love of improv to it proper object we may wish for stabil of conduct but we mistak human natur if we wish for a termin of labor or a scene of repos the occup of men in everi condit bespeak their freedom of choic their variou opinion and the multipl of want by which they are urg but they enjoy or endur with a sensibl or a phlegm which are nearli the same in everi situat they possess the shore of the caspian or the atlant by a differ tenur but with equal eas on the one they are fix to the soil and seem to be form for settlement and the accommod of citi the name they bestow on a nation and on it territori are the same on the other they are mere anim of passag prepar to roam on the face of the earth and with their herd in search of new pastur and favor season to follow the sun in hi annual cours man find hi lodgement alik in the cave the cottag and the palac and hi subsist equal in the wood in the dairi or the farm he assum the distinct of titl equipag and dress he devis regular system of govern and a complic bodi of law or nake in the wood ha no badg of superior but the strength of hi limb and the sagac of hi mind no rule of conduct but choic no tie with hi fellowcreatur but affect the love of compani and the desir of safeti capabl of a great varieti of art yet depend on none in particular for the preserv of hi be to whatev length he ha carri hi artific there he seem to enjoy the conveni that suit hi natur and to have found the condit to which he is destin the tree which an american on the bank of the oroonoko lafitau moeur de sauvag ha chosen to climb for the retreat and the lodgement of hi famili is to him a conveni dwell the sopha the vault dome and the colonad do not more effectu content their nativ inhabit if we are ask therefor where the state of natur is to be found we may answer it is here and it matter not whether we are understood to speak in the island of great britain at the cape of good hope or the strait of magellan while thi activ be is in the train of employ hi talent and of oper on the subject around him all situat are equal natur if we are told that vice at least is contrari to natur we may answer it is wors it is folli and wretched but if natur is onli oppos to art in what situat of the human race are the footstep of art unknown in the condit of the savag as well as in that of the citizen are mani proof of human invent and in either is not ani perman station but a mere stage through which thi travel be is destin to pass if the palac be unnatur the cottag is so no less and the highest refin of polit and moral apprehens are not more artifici in their kind than the first oper of sentiment and reason if we admit that man is suscept of improv and ha in himself a principl of progress and a desir of perfect it appear improp to say that he ha quit the state of hi natur when he ha begun to proceed or that he find a station for which he wa not intend while like other anim he onli follow the disposit and employ the power that natur ha given the latest effort of human invent are but a continu of certain devic which were practic in the earliest age of the world and in the rudest state of mankind what the savag project or observ in the forest are the step which led nation more advanc from the architectur of the cottag to that of the palac and conduct the human mind from the percept of sens to the gener conclus of scienc acknowledg defect are to man in everi condit matter of dislik ignor and imbecil are object of contempt penetr and conduct give emin and procur esteem whither should hi feel and apprehens on these subject lead him to a progress no doubt in which the savag as well as the philosoph is engag in which they have made differ advanc but in which their end are the same the admir cicero entertain for literatur eloqu and civil accomplish wa not more real than that of a scythian for such a measur of similar endow as hi own apprehens could reach were i to boast say a tartar princ abulgaz bahadur chan histori of the tartar it would be of that wisdom i have receiv from god for as on the one hand i yield to none in the conduct of war in the disposit of armi whether of hors or of foot and in direct the movement of great or small bodi so on the other i have my talent in write inferior perhap onli to those who inhabit the great citi of persia or india of other nation unknown to me i do not speak man may mistak the object of hi pursuit he may misappli hi industri and misplac hi improv if under a sens of such possibl error he would find a standard by which to judg of hi own proceed and arriv at the best state of hi natur he can not find it perhap in the practic of ani individu or of ani nation whatev not even in the sens of the major or the prevail opinion of hi kind he must look for it in the best concept of hi understand in the best movement of hi heart he must thenc discov what is the perfect and the happi of which he is capabl he will find on the scrutini that the proper state of hi natur taken in thi sens is not a condit from which mankind are for ever remov but one to which they may now attain not prior to the exercis of their faculti but procur by their just applic of all the term that we employ in treat of human affair those of natur and unnatur are the least determin in their mean oppos to affect froward or ani other defect of the temper or charact the natur is an epithet of prais but employ to specifi a conduct which proce from the natur of man can serv to distinguish noth for all the action of men are equal the result of their natur at most thi languag can onli refer to the gener and prevail sens or practic of mankind and the purpos of everi import inquiri on thi subject may be serv by the use of a languag equal familiar and more precis what is just or unjust what is happi or wretch in the manner of men what in their variou situat is favor or advers to their amiabl qualiti are question to which we may expect a satisfactori answer and whatev may have been the origin state of our speci it is of more import to know the condit to which we ourselv should aspir than that which our ancestor may be suppos to have left sect ii of the principl of selfpreserv if in human natur there are qualiti by which it is distinguish from everi other part of the anim creation men are themselv in differ climat and in differ age greatli diversifi so far as we are abl to account for thi divers on principl either moral or physic we perform a task of great curios or signal util it appear necessari howev that we attend to the univers qualiti of our natur befor we regard it varieti or attempt to explain differ consist in the unequ possess or applic of disposit and power that are in some measur common to all mankind man like the other anim ha certain instinct propens which prior to the percept of pleasur or pain and prior to the experi of what is pernici or use lead him to perform mani function of natur rel to himself and to hi fellow creatur he ha one set of disposit which refer to hi anim preserv and to the continu of hi race anoth which lead to societi and by inlist him on the side of one tribe or commun frequent engag him in war and content with the rest of mankind hi power of discern or hi intellectu faculti which under the appel of reason are distinguish from the analog endow of other anim refer to the object around him either as they are subject of mere knowledg or as they are subject of approb or censur he is form not onli to know but likewis to admir and to contemn and these proceed of hi mind have a princip refer to hi own charact and to that of hi fellow creatur as be the subject on which he is chiefli concern to distinguish what is right from what is wrong he enjoy hi felic likewis on certain fix and determin condit and either as an individu apart or as a member of civil societi must take a particular cours in order to reap the advantag of hi natur he is withal in a veri high degre suscept of habit and can by forbear or exercis so far weaken confirm or even diversifi hi talent and hi disposit as to appear in a great measur the arbit of hi own rank in natur and the author of all the variti which are exhibit in the actual histori of hi speci the univers characterist in the mean time to which we have now refer must when we would treat of ani part of thi histori constitut the first subject of our attent and they requir not onli to be enumer but to be distinctli consid the disposit which refer to the preserv of the individu while they continu to oper in the manner of instinct desir are nearli the same in man that they are in the other anim but in him they are sooner or later combin with reflect and foresight they give rise to hi apprehens on the subject of properti and make him acquaint with that object of care which he call hi interest without the instinct which teach the beaver and the squrrel the ant and the be to make up their littl hoard for winter at first improvid and where no immedi object of passion is near addict to sloth he becom in process of time the great storemast among anim he find in a provis of wealth which he is probabl never to employ an object of hi greatest solicitud and the princip idol of hi mind he apprehend a relat between hi person and hi properti which render what he call hi own in a manner a part of himself a constitu of hi rank hi condit and hi charact in which independ of ani real enjoy he may be fortun or unhappi and independ of ani person merit he may be an object of consider or neglect and in which he may be wound and injur while hi person is safe and everi want of hi natur complet suppli in these apprehens while other passion onli oper occasion the interest find the object of their ordinari care their motiv to the practic of mechan and commerci art their temptat to trespass on the law of justic and when extrem corrupt the price of their prostitut and the standard of their opinion on the subject of good and evil under thi influenc they would enter if not restrain by the law of civil societi on a scene of violenc or mean which would exhibit our speci by turn under an aspect more terribl and odiou or more vile and contempt than that of ani anim which inherit the earth although the consider of interest is found on the experi of anim want and desir it object is not to gratifi ani particular appetit but to secur the mean of gratifi all and it impos frequent a restraint on the veri desir from which it aros more power and more sever than those of religion or duti it aris from the principl of selfpreserv in the human frame but is a corrupt or at least a partial result of those principl and is upon mani account veri improperli term selflov love is an affect which carri the attent of the mind beyond itself and ha a qualiti which we call tender that never can accompani the consider of interest thi affect be a complac and a continu satisfact in it object independ of ani extern event it ha in the midst of disappoint and sorrow pleasur and triumph unknown to those who act without ani regard to their fellow creatur and in everi chang of condit it continu entir distinct from the sentiment which we feel on the subject of person success or advers but as the care a man entertain for hi own interest and the attent hi affect make him pay to that of anoth may have similar effect the one on hi own fortun the other on that of hi friend we confound the principl from which he act we suppos that they are the same in kind onli refer to differ object and we not onli misappli the name of love in conjunct with self but in a manner tend to degrad our natur we limit the aim of thi suppos selfish affect to the secur or accumul the constitu of interest or the mean of mere anim life it is somewhat remark that notwithstand men valu themselv so much on qualiti of the mind on part learn and wit on courag generos and honor those men are still suppos to be in the highest degre selfish or attent to themselv who are most care of anim life and who are least mind of render that life an object worthi of care it will be difficult howev to tell whi a good understand a resolut and gener mind should not by everi man in hi sens be reckon as much part of himself as either hi stomach or hi palat and much more than hi estat or hi dress the epicur who consult hi physician how he may restor hi relish for food and by creat an appetit may increas the mean of enjoy might at least with an equal regard to himself consult how he might strengthen hi affect to a parent or a child to hi countri or to mankind and it is probabl that an appetit of thi sort would prove a sourc of enjoy not less than the former by our suppos selfish maxim notwithstand we gener exclud from among the object of our person care mani of the happier and more respect qualiti of human natur we consid affect and courag as mere folli that lead us to neglect or expos ourselv we make wisdom consist in a regard to our interest and without explain what interest mean we would have it understood as the onli reason motiv of action with mankind there is even a system of philosophi found upon tenet of thi sort and such is our opinion of what men are like to do upon selfish principl that we think it must have a tendenc veri danger to virtu but the error of thi system do not consist so much in gener principl as in their particular applic not so much in teach men to regard themselv as in lead them to forget that their happiest affect their candor and their independ of mind are in realiti part of themselv and the adversari of thi suppos selfish philosophi where it make selflov the rule passion with mankind have had reason to find fault not so much with it gener represent of human natur as with the obtrus of a mere innov in languag for a discoveri in scienc when the vulgar speak of their differ motiv they are satisfi with ordinari name which refer to known and obviou distinct of thi kind are the term benevol and selfish by which they express their desir of the welfar of other or the care of their own the specul are not alway satisfi with thi proceed they would analyz as well as enumer the principl of natur and the chanc is that mere to gain the appear of someth new without ani prospect of real advantag they will disturb the order of vulgar apprehens in the case befor us they have actual found that benevol is no more than a speci of selflov and would oblig us if possibl to look out for a new set of word by which we may distinguish the selfish of the parent when he take care of hi child from hi selfish when he onli take care of himself for accord to thi philosophi as in both case he onli mean to gratifi a desir of hi own he is in both case equal selfish the term benevol in the mean time is not employ to characteris person who have no desir of their own but person whose own desir prompt them to procur the welfar of other the fact is that we should need onli a fresh suppli of languag instead of that which by thi seem discoveri we should have lost in order to make the reason of men proceed as they formerli did but it is certainli imposs to live and to act with men without employ differ name to distinguish the human from the cruel and the benevol from the selfish these term have their equival in everi tongu they were invent by men of no refin who onli meant to express what they distinctli perceiv or strongli felt and if a man of specul should prove that we are selfish in a sens of hi own it doe not follow that we are so in the sens of the vulgar or as ordinari men would understand hi conclus that we are condemn in everi instanc to act on motiv of interest covet pusillanim and cowardic for such is conceiv to be the ordinari import of selfish in the charact of man an affect or passion of ani kind is sometim said to give us an interest in it object and human itself give an interest in the welfar of mankind thi term interest which commonli impli littl more than our regard to properti is sometim put for util in gener and thi for happi insomuch that under these ambigu it is not surpris we are still unabl to determin whether interest is the onli motiv of human action and the standard by which to distinguish our good from our ill so much is said in thi place not from ani desir to have a share in ani controversi of thi sort but mere to confin the mean of the term interest to it most common accep ation and to intim our intent of employ it in express those object of care which refer to our extern condit and the preserv of our anim natur when taken in thi sens it will not sure be thought to comprehend at onc all the motiv of human conduct if men be not allow to have disinterest benevol they will not be deni to have disinterest passion of anoth kind hatr indign and rage frequent urg them to act in opposit to their known interest and even to hazard their live without ani hope of compens in ani futur return of prefer or profit sect iii of the principl of union among mankind mankind have alway wander or settl agre or quarrel in troop and compani the caus of their assembl whatev it be is the principl of their allianc or union in collect the materi of histori we are seldom will to put up with our subject mere as we find it we are loath to be embarrass with a multipl of particular and appar inconsist in theori we profess the investig of gener principl and in order to bring the matter of our inquiri within the reach of our comprehens are dispos to adopt ani system thu in treat of human affair we would draw everi consequ from a principl of union or a principl of dissens the state of natur is a state of war or of amiti and men are made to unit from a principl of affect or from a principl of fear as is most suitabl to the system of differ writer the histori of our speci inde abundantli show that they are to one anoth mutual object both of fear and of love and they who would prove them to have been origin either in a state of allianc or of war have argument in store to maintain their assert our attach to one divis or to one sect seem often to deriv much of it forc from an animos conceiv to an opposit one and thi animos in it turn as often aris from a zeal in behalf of the side we espous and from a desir to vindic the right of our parti man is born in societi say montesquieu and there he remain the charm that detain him are known to be manifold we may reckon the parent affect which instead of desert the adult as among the brute embrac more close as it becom mix with esteem and the memori of it earli effect togeth with a propens common to man and other anim to mix with the herd and without reflect to follow the crowd of hi speci what thi propens wa in the first moment of it oper we know not but with men accustom to compani it enjoy and disappoint are reckon among the princip pleasur or pain of human life sad and melancholi are connect with solitud glad and pleasur with the concours of men the track of a lapland on the snowi shore give joy to the lone marin and the mute sign of cordial and kind which are made to him awaken the memori of pleasur which he felt in societi in fine say the writer of a voyag to the north after describ a mute scene of thi sort we were extrem pleas to convers with men sinc in thirteen month we had seen no human creatur collect of dutch voyag but we need no remot observ to confirm thi posit the wail of the infant and the languor of the adult when alon the live joy of the one and the cheer of the other upon the return of compani are a suffici proof of it solid foundat in the frame of our natur in account for action we often forget that we ourselv have act and instead of the sentiment which stimul the mind in the presenc of it object we assign as the motiv of conduct with men those consider which occur in the hour of retir and cold reflect in thi mood frequent we can find noth import besid the deliber prospect of interest and a great work like that of form societi must in our apprehens aris from deep reflect and be carri on with a view to the advantag which mankind deriv from commerc and mutual support but neither a propens to mix with the herd nor the sens of advantag enjoy in that condit comprehend all the principl by which men are unit togeth those band are even of a feebl textur when compar to the resolut ardour with which a man adher to hi friend or to hi tribe after they have for some time run the career of fortun togeth mutual discoveri of generos joint trial of fortitud redoubl the ardour of friendship and kindl a flame in the human breast which the consider of person interest or safeti can not suppress the most live transport of joy are seen and the loudest shriek of despair are heard when the object of a tender affect are beheld in a state of triumph or of suffer an indian recov hi friend unexpectedli on the island of juan fernand he prostrat himself on the ground at hi feet we

friendship and amiti those are their mutual need of one anoth their mutual compass their sens of mutual benefit and the pleasur aris in compani there are other circumst which prompt them to war and dissens the admir and the desir which they entertain for the same subject their opposit pretens and the provoc which they mutual offer in the cours of their competit when we endeavor to appli the

in the midst of their quarrel there is still more to be observ on thi subject mankind not onli find in their condit the sourc of varianc and dissens they appear to have in their mind the seed of

us to the knowledg of almost everi situat in which mankind are place we have found them spread over larg and extens contin where commun are open and where nation confederaci might be easili form we have found them in narrow district circumscrib by mountain great river and arm of the sea they have been found in small and remot island where the inhabit might be easili assembl and deriv an advantag

which they refer would fall into disus and lose their mean we love individu on account of person qualiti but we love our countri as it is a parti in the divis of mankind and our zeal for it interest is a predilect in behalf of the side we maintain in the promiscu concours of men it is suffici that we have an opportun of select our compani we turn away from those who do not engag us and we fix our

affect is foster by a continu direct to it particular object separ and estrang as well as opposit widen a breach which did not owe it begin to ani offens and it would seem that till we have reduc mankind to the state of a famili or found some extern consider to maintain their connect in greater number they will be for ever separ into band and form a plural of nation the sens of a common danger and the assault of an enemi have been frequent use to nation by unit their member more firmli togeth and by prevent the secess and actual separ in which their civil discord might otherwis termin and thi motiv to union which is offer from abroad may be necessari not onli in the case of larg and extens nation where coalit are weaken by distanc and the distinct of provinci name but even in the narrow societi of the smallest state rome itself wa found by a small parti which took it flight from alba her citizen were often in danger of separ and if the villag and canton of the volsci had been

peopl and the gate of janu were frequent open to remind her inhabit of the duti they owe to their countri if societi as well as individu be charg with the care of their own preserv and if in both we apprehend a separ of interest which may give rise to jealousi and competit we can not be surpris to find hostil aris from thi sourc but were there no angri passion of a differ sort the animos which attend an opposit of interest should bear a proport to the suppos valu of the subject the hottentot nation say kolben trespass on one anoth by theft of cattl and of women but such injuri are seldom commit except with a view to exasper their neighbor and bring them to a war such depred then are not the foundat of a war but the effect of a hostil intent alreadi conceiv the nation of north america who have no herd to preserv nor settlement to defend are yet engag in almost perpetu war for which they can assign no reason but the point of honor and a desir to continu the struggl their father maintain they do not regard the spoil of an enemi and the warrior who ha seiz ani booti easili part with it to the first person who come in hi way see charlevoix histori of canada but we need not cross the atlant to find proof of animos and to observ in the collis of separ societi the influenc of angri passion that do not aris from an opposit of interest human natur ha no part of it charact of

jealousi and caution but the peopl have dislik and antipathi for which they can not account their mutual reproach of perfidi and injustic like the hottentot depred are but symptom of an animos and the

mankind might have trade without ani formal convent but they can not be safe without a nation concert the necess of a public defens ha given rise to mani depart of state and the intellectu talent of

applaud as proceed from a nation or parti spirit what we could not endur as the effect of a privat dislik and amidst the competit of rival state think we have found for the patriot and the warrior in the practic of violenc and stratagem the most illustri career of human virtu even person opposit here doe not divid our judgment on the merit of men the rival name of agesilau and epaminonda of scipio

which the author of natur ha appoint our exit from human life these reflect may open our view into the state of mankind but they tend to reconcil us to the conduct of provid rather than to make us chang our own where from a regard to the welfar of our fellow creatur we endeavor to pacifi their animos and unit them by the tie of affect in the pursuit of thi amiabl intent we may hope in some instanc to disarm the angri passion of jealousi and envi we may hope to instil into the breast of privat men sentiment of candor toward their fellowcreatur and a disposit to human and justic but it is vain to expect that we can give to the multitud of a peopl a sens of union among themselv without admit hostil to those who oppos them could we at onc in the case of ani nation extinguish the emul

in human affair in which it is difficult to distinguish the promptitud of the head from the ardour and sensibl of the heart where both are unit they constitut that superior of mind the frequenc of

the histori of everi age when past is an access of knowledg to those who succeed the roman were more know than the greek and everi scholar of modern europ is in thi sens more learn than the most

in adapt materi to the sever purpos of life from their vigor and conduct in pursu the object of polici and in find the expedi of war and nation defens even in literatur they are to be estim from the

mind notwithstand collect it greatest abil and receiv it best inform in the midst of sweat and of dust it is peculiar to modern europ to rest so much of the human charact on what may be learn in retir and from the inform of book a just admir of ancient literatur an opinion that human sentiment and human reason without thi aid were to have vanish from the societi of men have led us into the shade where we endeavor to deriv from imagin and thought what is in realiti matter of experi and sentiment and we endeavor through the grammar of dead languag and the channel of comment to arriv at the beauti of thought and elocut which sprang from the anim spirit of societi and were taken from the live impress of an activ life our seiz are frequent limit to the element of everi scienc and seldom reach to that enlarg of abil and power which use knowledg should give like mathematician who studi the element of euclid but never think of mensur we read of societi but do not propos to act with men we repeat the languag of polit but feel not the spirit of nation we attend to the formal of a militari disciplin but know not how to employ number of men to obtain ani purpos by stratagem or forc but for what end it may be said is it to point out a misfortun that can not be remedi if nation affair call for exert the geniu of men would awak but in the recess of better employ the time which is bestow on studi if even attend with no other advantag serv to occupi with innoc the hour of leisur and set bound to the pursuit of ruinou and frivol amus from no better reason than thi we employ so mani of our earli year under the rod to acquir what it is not expect we should retain beyond the threshold of the school and whilst we carri the same frivol charact in our studi that we do in our amus the human mind could not suffer more from a contempt of letter than it doe from the fals import which is given to literatur as a busi for life not as a help to our conduct and the mean of form a
