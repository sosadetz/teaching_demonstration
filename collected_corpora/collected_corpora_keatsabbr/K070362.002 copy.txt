church in the neighbor town where we dine at euphranor and after even servic return to the two philosoph whom we found in the librari they told us that if there wa a god he wa present everi where as well as at church and that if we had been serv him one way they did not neglect to do as much anoth inasmuch as a free exercis of reason must be allow the most accept servic and worship that a ration creatur can offer to it creator howev said alciphron if you gentlemen can but solv the difficulti which i shall propos tomorrow morn i promis to go to church next sunday after some gener convers of thi kind we sat down to a light supper and the next morn assembl at the same place as the day befor where be all seat i observ that the forego week our confer had been carri on for a longer time and with less interrupt than i had ever known or well could be in town where men hour are so broken by visit busi and amus that whoever is content to form hi notion from convers onli must need have them veri shatter and imperfect and what have we got repli alciphron by all these continu confer for my part i think my self just where i wa with respect to the main point that divid us the truth of the christian religion i answer that so mani point had been examin discuss and agre between him and hi adversari that i hope to see them come to an entir agreement in the end for in the first place said i the principl and opinion of those who are call freethink or minut philosoph have been pretti clearli explain it ha been also agre that vice is not of that benefit to the nation which some men imagin that virtu is highli use to mankind but that the beauti of virtu is not alon suffici to engag them in the practic of it that therefor the belief of a god and provid ought to be encourag in the state and toler in good compani as a use notion further it ha been prove that there is a god that it is reason to worship him and that the worship faith and principl prescrib by the christian religion have a use tendenc admit repli alciphron address himself to crito all that dion say to be true yet thi doe not hinder my be just where i wa with respect to the main point sinc there is noth in all thi that prove the truth of the christian religion though each of those particular enumer may perhap prejudic in it favor i am therefor to suspect my self at present for a prejud person prejud i say in favor of christian thi as i am a lover of truth put me upon my guard against decept i must therefor look sharp and well consid everi step i take ii cri you may rememb alciphron you propos for the subject of our present confer the consider of certain difficulti and object which you had to offer against the christian religion we are now readi to hear and consid whatev you shall think fit to produc of that kind atheism and a wrong notion of christian as of someth hurt to mankind are great prejudic the remov of which may dispos a man to argu with candor and submit to reason proof but the remov prejudic against an opinion is not to be reckon prejud in it favor it may be hope therefor that you will be abl to do justic to your caus without be fond of it alc o crito that man may thank hi star to whom natur ha given a sublim soul who can rais himself abov popular opinion and look down on the herd of mankind behold them scatter over the surfac of the whole earth divid and subdivid into numberless nation and tribe differ in notion and tenet as in languag manner and dress the man who take a gener view of the world and it inhabit from thi lofti stand abov the reach of prejudic seem to breath a purer air and to see by a clearer light but how to impart thi clear and extens view to those who are wander beneath in the narrow dark path of error thi inde is a hard task but hard as it is i shall tri if by ani mean clara tuae possim praepander lumina menti lucret know then that all the variou cast or sect of the son of men have each their faith and their religi system germin and sprout forth from that common grain of enthusiasm which is an origin ingredi in the composit of human natur they shall each tell of intercours with the invis world revel from heaven divin oracl and the like all which pretens when i regard with an imparti eye it is imposs i should assent to all and i find within my self someth that withhold me from assent to ani of them for although i may be will to follow so far as common sens and the light of natur lead yet the same reason that bid me yield to ration proof forbid me to admit opinion without proof thi hold in gener against all revel whatsoev and be thi my first object against the christian in particular cri as thi object suppos there is no proof or reason for believ the christian if good reason can be assign for such belief it come to noth now i presum you will grant the author of the report is a true and proper reason for believ report and the better thi author the juster claim it ha to our assent but the author of god is on all account the best whatev therefor come from god it is most reason to believ iii alc thi i grant but then it must be prove to come from god cri and are not miracl and the accomplish of propheci join with the excel of it doctrin a suffici proof that the christian religion came from god alc miracl inde would prove someth but what proof have we of these miracl cri proof of the same kind that we have or can have of ani fact done a great way off and a long time ago we have authent account transmit down to us from eyewit whom we can not conceiv tempt to impos upon us by ani human motiv whatsoev inasmuch as they act therein contrari to their interest their prejudic and the veri principl in which they had been nurs and educ these account were confirm by the unparal subvers of the citi of jerusalem and the dispers of the jewish nation which is a stand testimoni to the truth of the gospel particularli of the predict of our bless savior these account within less than a centuri were spread throughout the world and believ by great number of peopl these same account were commit to write translat into sever languag and hand down with the same respect and consent of christian in the most distant church do you not see said alciphron stare full at crito that all thi hang by tradit and tradit take my word for it give but a weak hold it is a chain whereof the first link may be stronger than steel and yet the last weak as wax and brittl as glass imagin a pictur copi success by an hundr painter one from anoth how like must the last copi be to the origin how live and distinct will an imag be after an hundr reflect between two parallel mirrour thu like and thu live do i think a faint vanish tradit at the end of sixteen or seventeen hundr year some men have a fals heart other a wrong head and where both are true the memori may be treacher henc there is still someth ad someth omit and someth vari from the truth and the sum of mani such addit deduct and alter accumul for sever age do at the foot of the account make quit anoth thing cri ancient fact we may know by tradit oral or written and thi latter we may divid into two kind privat and public as write are kept in the hand of particular men or record in public archiv now all these three sort of tradit for ought i can see concur to attest the genuin antiqu of the gospel and they are strengthen by collater evid from rite institut festiv observ and monument erect by ancient christian such as church baptisteri and sepulch now allow your object hold against oral tradit singli taken yet i can think it no such difficult thing to transcrib faith and thing onc commit to write are secur from slip of memori and may with common care be preserv entir so long as the manuscript last and thi experi show may be abov a thousand year the alexandrin manuscript is allow to be abov twelv hundr year old and it is highli probabl there were then extant copi four hundr year old a tradit therefor of abov sixteen hundr year need have onli two or three link in it chain and these link notwithstand that great length of time may be veri sound and entir sinc no reason man will deni that an ancient manuscript may be of much the same credit now as when it wa first written we have it on good author and it seem probabl that the primit christian were care to transcrib copi of the gospel and epistl for their privat use and that other copi were preserv as public record in the sever church throughout the world and that portion thereof were constantli read in their assembl can more be said to prove the write of classic author or ancient record of ani kind authent alciphron address hi discours to euphranor said it is one thing to silenc an adversari and anoth to convinc him what do you think euphranor euph doubtless it is alc but what i want is to be convinc euph that point is not so clear alc but if a man had ever so much mind he can not be convinc by probabl argument against demonstr euph i grant he can not iv alc now it is as evid as demonstr can make it that no divin faith can possibl be built upon tradit suppos an honest credul countryman catech and lectur everi sunday by hi parish priest it is plain he believ in the parson and not in god he know noth of revel and doctrin and miracl but what the priest tell him thi he believ and thi faith is pure human if you say he ha the liturgi and the bibl for the foundat of hi faith the difficulti still recur for as to the liturgi he pin hi faith upon the civil magistr as well as the ecclesiast neither of which can pretend divin inspir then for the bibl he take both that and hi prayer book on trust from the printer who he believ made true edit from true copi you see then faith but what faith faith in the priest in the magistr in the printer editor transcrib none of which can with ani pretens be call divin i had the hint from cratylu it is a shaft out of hi quiver and believ me a keen one euph let me take and make trial of thi same shaft in my hand suppos then your countryman hear a magistr declar the law from the bench or suppos he read it in a statut book what think you is the printer or the justic the true and proper object of hi faith and submiss or do you acknowledg a higher author whereon to found those loyal act and in which they do realli termin again suppos you read a passag in tacitu that you believ true would you say you assent to it on the author of the printer or transcrib rather than the historian alc perhap i would and perhap i would not i do not think my self oblig to answer these point what is thi but transfer the question from one subject to anoth that which we consid wa neither law nor profan histori but religi tradit and divin faith i see plainli what you aim at but shall never take fro an answer to one difficulti the start of anoth cri o alciphron there is no take hold of you who expect that other should as you were pleas to express it hold fair and stand firm while you pluck out their prejudic how shall he argu with you but from your concess and how can he know what you grant except you will be pleas to tell him euph but to save you the troubl for onc i will suppos an answer my question admit but of two answer take your choic from the one it will follow that by a pariti of reason we can easili conceiv how a man may have divin faith though he never felt inspir or saw a miracl inasmuch as it is equal possibl for the mind through whatev conduit oral or scriptur divin revel be deriv to carri it thought and submiss up to the sourc and termin it faith not in human but divin author not in the instrument or vessel of convey but in the great origin it self as it proper and true object from the other answer itwil follow that you introduc a gener skeptic into human knowledg and break down the hing on which civil govern and all the affair of the world turn and depend in a word that you would destroy human faith to get rid of divin and how thi agre with your profess that you want to be convinc i leav you to consid v alc i should in earnest be glad to be convinc one way or other and come to some concluclus but i have so mani object in store you are not to count much upon get over one depend on it you shall find me behav like a gentleman and lover of truth i will propos my object briefli and plainli and accept of reason answer as fast as you can give them come euphranor make the most of your tradit you can never make that a constant and univers one which is acknowledg to have been unknown or at best disput in the church for sever age and thi is the case of the canon of the new testament for though we have now a canon as they call it settl yet everi one must see and own that tradit can not grow stronger by age and that what wa uncertain in the primit time can not be undoubt in the subsequ what say you to thi euphranor euph i should be glad to conceiv your mean clearli befor i return an answer it seem to me thi object of your suppos that where a tradit ha been constant and undisput such tradit may be admit as a proof but that where the tradit is defect the proof must be so too is thi your mean alc it is euph consequ the gospel and epistl of st paul which were univers receiv in the begin and never sinc doubt of by the church must notwithstand thi object be in reason admit for genuin and if these book contain as they realli do all those point that come into controversi between you and me what need i disput with you about the author of some other book of the new testament which came later to be gener known and receiv in the church if a man assent to the undisput book he is no longer an infidel though he should not hold the revel or the epistl of s jame or jude or the latter of s peter or the two last of s john to be canon the addit author of these portion of holi scriptur may have it weight in particular controversi between christian but can add noth to argument against an infidel as such wherefor though i believ good reason may be assign for receiv these book yet these reason seem now besid our purpos when you are a christian it will be then time enough to argu thi point and you will be the nearer be so if the way be shorten by omit it for the present alc not so near neither as you perhap imagin for notwithstand all the fair and plausibl thing you may say about tradit when i consid the spirit of forgeri which reign in the primit time and reflect on the sever gospel act and epistl attribut to the apostl which yet are acknowledg to be spuriou i confess i can not help suspect the whole euph tell me alciphron do you suspect all plato write for spuriou becaus the dialogu upon death for instanc is allow to be so or will you admit none of tulli write to be genuin becaus sigoniu impos a book of hi own write for tulli treatis de consolation and the impostur pass for some time on the world alc suppos i admit for the work of tulli and plato those that commonli pass for such what then euph whi then i would fain know whether it be equal and imparti in a freethink to measur the credibl of profan and sacr book by a differ rule let us know upon what foot we christian are to argu with minut philosoph whether we may be allow the benefit of common maxim in logic and critic if we may be pleas to assign a reason whi supposititi write which in the style and manner and matter bear visibl mark of impostur and have accordingli been reject by the church can be made an argument against those which have been univers receiv and hand down by an unanim constant tradit there have been in all age and in all great societi of men mani caprici vain or wick impostor who for differ end have abus the world by spuriou write and creat work for critic both in profan and sacr learn and it would seem as silli to reject the true write of profan author for the sake of the spuriou as it would seem unreason to suppos that among the heret and sever sect of christian there should be none capabl of the like impostur vi alc but be the tradit ever so well attest and the book ever so genuin yet i can not suppos them wrote by person divin inspir so long as i see in them certain charact inconsist with such a supposit sure the purest languag the most perfect style the exactest method and in a word all the excel of good write might be expect in a piec compos or dictat by the spirit of god but book wherein we find the revers of all thi it were impiou not to reject but to attribut to the divin euph say alciphron are the lake the river or the ocean bound by straight line are the hill and mountain exact cone or pyramid or the star cast into regular figur alc they are not euph but in the work of insect we may observ figur as exact as if they were drawn by the rule and compass alc we may euph should it not seem therefor that a regular exact or scrupul attent to what men call the rule of art is not observ in the great product of the author of natur alc it should euph and when a great princ declar hi will in law and edict to hi subject is he care about a pure style or eleg composit doe he not leav hi secretari and clerk to express hi sens in their own word is not the phrase on such occas thought proper if it convey as much as wa intend and would not the divin strain of certain modern critic be judg affect and improp for such use alc it must be own law and edict and grant for soloec and tautolog are veri offens to the harmoni ear of a fine writer euph whi then should we expect in the oracl of god an exact that would be misbecom and beneath the digniti of an earthli monarch and which bear no proport or resembl to the magnific work of the creation alc but grant that a nice regard to particl and critic rule is a thing too littl and mean to be expect in divin revel and that there is more forc and spirit and true great in a neglig unequ style than in the wellturn period of a polit writer yet what is all thi to the bald and flat composit of those you call the divin penmen i can never be persuad the suprem be would pick out the poorest and meanest of scribler for hi secretari euph o alciphron if i durst follow my own judgment i should be apt to think there are nobl beauti in the style of the holi scriptur in the narr part a strain so simpl and unaffect in the devot and prophet so anim and sublim and in the doctrin part such an air of digniti and author as seem to speak their origin divin but i shall not enter into a disput about tast much less set up my judgment on so nice a point against that of the wit and men of geniu with which your sect abound and i have no temptat to it inasmuch as it seem to me the oracl of god are not the less so for be deliv in a plain dress rather than in the entic word of man wisdom alc thi may perhap be an apolog for some simplic and neglig in write vii but what apolog can be made for nonsens crude nonsens of which i could easili assign mani instanc have onc in my life read the scriptur through with that veri view look here said he open a bibl in the forti ninth psalm the author begin veri magnific call upon all the inhabit of the earth to give ear and assur them hi mouth shall speak of wisdom and the medit of hi heart shall be of understand quid dignum tanto seret hic promissor hiatu he ha no sooner done with hi prefac but he put thi senleless question wherefor should i fear in the day of evil when the wicked of my heel shall compass me about the iniqu of my heel what nonsens after such a solemn introduct euph for my own part i have natur weak eye and know there are mani thing that i can not see which are nevertheless distinctli seen by other i do not therefor conclud a thing to be absolut invis becaus it is so to me and sinc it is possibl it may be with my understand as it is with my eye i dare not pronounc a thing to be nonsens becaus i do not understand it of thi passag mani interpret are given the word render heel may signifi fraud or supplant by some it is translat past wicked the heel be the hinder part of the foot by other iniqu in the end of my day the heel be one extrem of the bodi by some the iniqu of my enemi that may supplant me by other my own fault or iniqu which i have pass over as light matter and trampl under my feet some render it the iniqu of my way other my transgress which are like slip and slide of the heel and after all might not thi express so harsh and odd to english ear have been veri natur and obviou in the hebrew tongu which as everi other languag had it idiom the forc and proprieti whereof may as easili be conceiv lost in a long tract of time as the signif of some hebrew word which are not now intellig though no bodi doubt but they had onc a mean as well as the other word of that languag grant therefor that certain passag in the holi scriptur may not be understood it will not thenc follow that it penmen wrote nonsens for i conceiv nonsens to be one thing and unintellig anoth cri an english gentleman of my acquaint one day entertain some foreign at hi hous sent a servant to know the occas of a sudden tumult in the yard who brought him word the hors were fallen togeth by the ear hi guest inquir what the matter wa he translat it liter le chevaux sont tombez ensembl par le oreil which made them stare what express a veri plain sens in the origin english be incomprehens when render word for word into french and i rememb to have heard a man excus the bull of hi countrymen by suppos them so mani liter translat euph but not to grow tediou i refer to the critic and and comment where you will find the use of thi remark which clear up sever obscur passag you took for nonsens may possibl inclin you to suspect your own judgment of the rest in thi veri psalm you have pitch on the good sens and moral contain in what follow should methink make a candid reader judg favor of the origin sens of the author in that part which he could not understand say alciphron in read the classic do you forthwith conclud everi passag to be nonsens that you can not make sens of alc by no mean difficulti must be suppos to rise from differ idiom old custom hint and allus clear in one time or place and obscur in anoth euph and whi will you not judg of scriptur by the same rule those sourc of obscur you mention are all common both to sacr and profan write and there is no doubt but an exact knowledg in languag and circumst would in both caus difficulti to vanish like shade befor the light of the sun jeremiah to describ a furiou invad say behold he shall come up as a lion from the swell of jordan against the habit of the strong one would be apt to think thi passag odd and improp and that it had been more reason to have said a lion from the mountain or the desert but travel as an ingeni man observ who have seen the river jordan bound by low land with mani reed or thicket afford shelter to wild beast which be suddenli dislodg by a rapid overflow of the river rush into the upland countri perceiv the forc and proprieti of the comparison and that the difficulti proce not from nonsens in the writer but from ignor in the reader it is needless to amass togeth instanc which may be found in everi comment i onli beg leav to observ that sometim men look higher or deeper than they need for a profound or remot sens overlook the natur obviou sens lie if i may so say at their feet and so make difficulti instead of find them thi seem to be the case of that celebr passag which ha creat so much work in st paul first epistl to the corinthian what shall they do which are baptiz for the dead if the dead rise not at all whi are they then baptiz for the dead i rememb to have heard thi text explain by lach the vicar of our parish to my neighbor lycon who wa much perplex about it mean if it had been translat as it might veri justli baptiz for the sake of the dead i do not see said lach whi peopl should be puzzl about the sens of thi passag for tell me i beseech you for whose sake do you think those christian were baptiz for whose sake answer lycon but their own how do you mean for their own sake in thi life or the next doubtless in the next for it wa plain they could get noth by it in thi they were then repli lach baptiz not for the sake of themselv while live but for the sake of themselv when dead not for the live but the dead i grant it baptism therefor must have been to them a fruitless thing if the dead rise not at all it must whenc lach infer that st paul argument wa clear and pertin for the resurrect and lycon allow it to be argumentum ad hominem to those who had sought baptism there is then conclud lach no necess for suppos that live men were in those day baptiz instead of those who die without baptism or of run into ani other odd supposit or strain and farfetch interpret to make sens of thi passag alc here and there a difficult passag may be clear but there are mani which no art or wit of man can account for what say you to those discoveri made by some of our learn writer of fals citat from the old testament found in the gospel euph that some few passag are cite by the writer of the new testament out of the old and by the father out of the new which are not in so mani word to be found in them is no new discoveri of minut philosoph but known and observ long befor by christian writer who have made no scrupl to grant that some thing might have been insert by careless or mistaken transcrib into the text from the margin other left out and other alter whenc so mani variou read but these are thing of small moment and that all other ancient author have been subject to and upon which no point of doctrin depend which may not be prove without them nay further if it be ani advantag to your caus it ha been observ that the eighteenth psalm as recit in the twenti second chapter of the second book of samuel vari in abov forti place if you regard everi littl verbal or liter differ and that a critic may now and then discov small variat is what no bodi can deni but to make the most of these concess what can you infer from them more than that the design of the holi scriptur wa not to make us exactli know in circumstanti and that the spirit did not dictat everi particl and syllabl or preserv them from everi minut alter by miracl which to believ would look like rabin superstit alc but what mark of divin can possibl be in write which do not reach the exact even of human art euph i never thought nor expect that the holi scriptur should show it self divin by a circumstanti accuraci of narrat by exact of method by strictli observ the rule of rhetor grammar and critic in harmoni period in eleg and choic express or in technic definit and partit these thing would look too like a human composit methink there is in that simpl unaffect artless unequ bold figur style of the holi scriptur a charact singularli great and majest and that look more like divin inspir than ani other composit that i know but as i said befor i shall not disput a point of critic with the gentlemen of your sect who it seem are the modern standard for wit and tast alc well i shall not insist on small slip or the inaccuraci of cite or transcrib and i freeli own that repetit want of method or want of exact in circumst are not the thing that chiefli stick with me no more than the plain patriarch manner or the peculiar usag and custom of the jew and first christian so differ from our and that to reject the scriptur on such account would be to act like those french wit who censur homer becaus they do not find in him the style notion and manner of their own age and countri wa there noth els to divid us i should make no great difficulti of own that a popular uncorrect style might answer the gener end of revel as well perhap as a more critic and exact one but the obscur still stick with me methink if the suprem be had spoke to man he would have spoke clearli to him and that the word of god should not need a comment viii euph you seem alciphron to think obscur a defect but if it should prove to be no defect there would then be no forc in thi object alc i grant there would not euph pray tell me are not speech and style instrument to convey thought and notion to beget knowledg opinion and assent alc thi is true euph and is not the perfect of an instrument to be measur by the use to which it is subservi alc it is euph what therefor is a defect in one instrument may be none in anoth for instanc edg tool are in gener design to cut but the use of an ax and a razor be differ it is no defect in an ax that it ha not the keen edg of a razor nor in a razor that it ha not the weight or strength of an ax alc i acknowledg thi to be true euph and may we not say in gener that everi instrument is perfect which answer the purpos or intent of him who use it alc we may euph henc it seem to follow that no man speech is defect in point of clear though it should not be intellig to all men if it be suffici so to those who he intend should understand it or though it should not in all part be equal clear or convey a perfect knowledg where he intend onli an imperfect hint alc it seem so euph ought we not therefor to know the intent of the speaker to be abl to know whether hi style be obscur through defect or design alc we ought euph but is it possibl for man to know all the end and purpos of god revel alc it is not euph how then can you tell but the obscur of some part of scriptur may well consist with the purpos which you know not and consequ be no argument against it come from god the book of holi scriptur were written in ancient languag at distant time on sundri occas and veri differ subject is it not therefor reason to imagin that some part or passag might have been clearli enough understood by those for whose proper use they were princip design and yet seem obscur to us who speak anoth languag and live in other time is it at all absurd or unsuit to the notion we have of god or man to suppos that god may reveal and yet reveal with a reserv upon certain remot and sublim subject content to give us hint and glimps rather than view may we not also suppos from the reason of thing and the analog of natur that some point which might otherwis have been more clearli explain were left obscur mere to encourag our dilig and modesti two virtu which if it might not seem disrespect to such great men i would recommend to the minut philosoph lysicl repli thi inde is excel you expect that men of sens and spirit should in great humil put out their eye and blindli swallow all the absurd and nonsens that shall be offer to them for divin revel euph on the contrari i would have them open their eye look sharpli and tri the spirit whether it is of god and not supin and ignorantli condemn in the gross all religion togeth pieti with superstit truth for the sake of error matter of fact for the sake of fiction a conduct which at first sight would seem absurd in histori physic or ani other branch of human inquiri but to compar the christian system or holi scriptur with other pretens to divin revel to consid

mani age have been abl to influenc and persuad so mani wise learn and inquisit men perhap they might find in it certain peculiar charact which suffici distinguish it from all other religion and pretend revel whereon to ground a reason faith in which case i leav them to consid whether it would be right to reject with peremptori scorn a revel so distinguish and attest upon account of obscur in some part of it and whether it would seem beneath men of their sens and spirit to acknowledg that for ought they know a light inadaequ to thing may yet be adaequ to the purpos of provid and whether it might be unbecom their sagac and critic skill to own that liter translat from book in an ancient orient tongu wherein there are so mani peculiar as to the manner of write the figur of speech and structur of the phrase so remot from all our modern idiom and in which we have no other coaeval write extant might well be obscur in mani place especi such as treat of subject sublim and difficult in their own natur or allud to thing custom or event veri distant from our knowledg and lastli whether it might not becom their charact as imparti and unprejud men to consid the bibl in the same light they would profan author they are apt to make great allow for transposit omiss and liter error of transcrib in other ancient book and veri great for the differ of style and manner especi in eastern write such as the remain of zoroast and confuciu and whi not in the prophet in read horac or persiu to make out the sens they will be at the pain to discov a hidden drama and whi not in solomon or st paul i hear there are certain ingeni men who despis king david poetri and yet profess to admir homer and pindar if there be no prejudic or affect in thi let them but make a liter version from those author into english prose and they will then be better abl to judg of the psalm alc you may discours and exspati but notwithstand all you have said or shall say it is a clear point that a revel which doe not reveal can be no better than a contradict in term euph tell me alciphron do you not acknowledg the light of the sun to be the most gloriou product of provid in thi natur world alc suppos i do euph thi light nevertheless which you can not deni to be of god make shine onli on the surfac of thing shine not at all in the night shine imperfectli in the twilight is often interrupt refract and obscur repres distant thing and small thing dubious imperfectli or not at all is thi true or no alc it is euph should it not follow therefor that to expect in thi world a light from god without ani mixtur of shade or mysteri would be depart from the rule and analog of the creation and that consequ it is no argument the light of revel is not divin becaus it may not be so clear and full as you expect alc as i profess my self candid and indiffer throughout thi debat i must need own you say some plausibl thing as a man of argument will never fail to do in vindic of hi prejudic ix but to deal plainli i must tell you onc for all that you may question and answer illustr and enlarg for ever without be abl to convinc me that the christian religion is of divin revel i have said sever thing and have mani more to say which believ me have weight not onli with my self but with mani great men my veri good friend and will have weight whatev euphranor can say to the contrari euph o alciphron i envi you the happi of such acquaint but as my lot fallen in thi remot corner depriv me of that advantag i am oblig to make the most of thi opportun which you and lysicl have put into my hand i consid you as two abl surgeon and you were pleas to consid me as a patient whose cure you have gener undertaken now a patient must have full liberti to explain hi case and tell all hi symptom the conceal or palliat of which might prevent a perfect cure you will be pleas therefor to understand me not as object to or argu against either your skill or medicin but onli as set forth my own case and the effect they have upon me say alciphron did you not give me to understand that you would extirp my prejudic alc it is true a good physician erad everi fiber of the diseas come you shall have a patient hear euph pray wa it not the opinion of plato that god inspir particular men as organ or trumpet to proclaim and sound forth hi oracl to the world plato in ion and wa not the same opinion also embrac by other the greatest writer of antiqu cri socrat seem to have thought that all true poet spoke by inspir and tulli that there wa no extraordinari geniu without it thi ha made some of our affect freethink attempt to pass themselv upon the world for enthusiast alc what would you infer from all thi euph i would infer that inspir should seem noth imposs or absurd but rather agreeabl to the light of reason and the notion of mankind and thi i suppos you will acknowledg have made it an object against a particular revel that there are so mani pretens to it throughout the world alc o euphranor he who look into the bottom of thing and resolv them into their first principl is not easili amus with word the word inspir sound inde big but let us if you pleas take an origin view of the thing signifi by it to inspir is a word borrow from the latin and strictli taken mean no more than to breath or blow in noth therefor can be inspir but what can be blown or breath and noth can be so but wind or vapor which inde may fill or puff up men with fanat and hypochondriac rave thi sort of inspir i veri readili admit euph what you say is subtl and i know not what effect it might have upon me if your profound discours did not hinder it own oper alc how so euph tell me alciphron do you discours or do you not to me it seem that you discours admir alc be that as it will it is certain i discours euph but when i endeavor to look into the bottom of thing behold a scrupl rise in my mind how thi can be for to discours is a word of latin deriv which origin signifi to run about and a man can not run about but he must chang place and move hi leg so long therefor as you sit on thi bench you can not be said to discours solv me thi difficulti and then perhap i may be abl to solv your alc you are to know that discours is a word borrow from sensibl thing to express an invis action of the mind reason or infer one thing from anoth and in thi translat sens we may be said to discours though we sit still euph and may we not as well conceiv that the term inspir might be borrow from sensibl thing to denot an action of god in an extraordinari manner influenc excit and enlighten the mind of a prophet or an apostl who in thi secondari figur and translat sens may truli be said to be inspir though there should be noth in the case of that wind or vapor impli in the origin sens of the word it seem to me that we may by look into our own mind plainli perceiv certain instinct impuls and tendenc which at proper period and occas spring up unaccount in the soul of man we observ veri visibl sign of the same in all other anim and these thing be ordinari and natur what hinder but we may conceiv it possibl for the human mind upon an extraordinari account to be move in an extraordinari manner and it faculti stir up and actuat by a supernatur power that there are and have been and are like to be wild vision and hypochondriac rave no bodi can deni but to infer from thenc that there are no true inspir would be too like conclud that some men are not in their sens becaus other men are fool and though i am no prophet and consequ can not pretend to a clear notion of thi matter yet i shall not therefor take upon me to deni but a true prophet or inspir person might have had as certain mean of discern between divin inspir and hypochondriac fanci as you can between sleep and wake till you have prove the contrari you may meet in the book of jeremiah with thi passag the prophet that ha a dream let him tell a dream and he that ha my word let him speak my word faith what is the chaff to the wheat say the lord is not my word like as a fire say the lord and like a hammer that break the rock in piec you see here a distinct made between wheat and chaff true and spuriou with the mighti forc and power of the former but i beg pardon for quot scriptur to you i make my appeal to the gener sens of mankind and the opinion of the wisest heathen which seem suffici to conclud divin inspir possibl if not probabl at least till you prove the contrari x alc the possibl of inspir and revel i do not think it necessari to deni make the best you can of thi concess euph jerem c xxiii now what is allow possibl we may suppos in fact alc we may euph let us then suppos that god had been pleas to make a revel to men and that he inspir some as a mean to instruct other have suppos thi can you deni that their inspir discours and revel might have been commit to write or that be written after a long tract of time they might becom in sever place obscur that some of them might even origin have been less clear than other or that they might suffer some alter by frequent transcrib as other write are known to have done is it not even veri probabl that all these thing would happen alc i grant it euph and grant thi with what pretens can you reject the holi scriptur as not be divin upon the account of such sign or mark as you acknowledg would probabl attend a divin revel transmit down to us through so mani age alc but allow all that in reason you can desir and grant that thi may account for some obscur may reconcil some small differ or satisfi us how some difficulti might aris by insert omit or chang here and there a letter a word or perhap a sentenc yet these are but small matter in respect of the much more consider and weighti object i could produc against the confess doctrin or subject matter of those write let us see what is contain in these sacr book and then judg whether it is probabl or possibl such revel should ever have been made by god now i defi the wit of man to contriv ani thing more extrayag than the account we there find of apparit devil miracl god manifest in the flesh regener grace selfdeni resurrect of the dead and such like aegri somnia thing so odd unaccount and remot from the apprehens of mankind you may as soon wash a blackamor white as clear them of absurd no critic skill can justifi them no tradit recommend them i will not say for divin revel but even for the invent of men of sens euph i had alway a great opinion of your sagac but now alciphron i consid you as someth more than man els how should it be possibl for you to know what or how far it may be proper for god to reveal methink it may consist with all due defer to the greatest of human understand to suppos them ignor of mani thing which are not suit to their faculti or lie out of their reach even the counsel of princ lie often beyond the ken of their subject who can onli know so much as is reveal by those at the helm and are often unqualifi to judg of the use and tendenc even of that till in due time the scheme unfold and is account for by succeed event that mani point contain in holi scriptur are remot from the common apprehens of mankind can not be deni but i do not see that it follow from thenc they are not of divin revel on the contrari should it not seem reason to suppos that a revel from god should contain someth differ in kind or more excel in degre than what lay open to the common sens of men or could even be discov by the most sagaci philosoph account of separ spirit good or bad prophesi miracl and such thing are undoubtedli strang but i would fain see how you can prove them imposs or absurd alc some thing there are so evid absurd that it would be almost as silli to disprov them as to believ them and i take these to be of that class xi euph but is it not possibl some men may show as much prejudic and narrow in reject all such account as other might easi and credul in admit them i never durst make my own observ or experi the rule and measur of thing spiritu supernatur or relat to anoth world becaus i should think it a veri bad one even for the visibl and natur thing of thi it would be judg like the siames who wa posit it did not freez in holland becaus he had never known such a thing as hard water or ice in hi own countri i can not comprehend whi ani one who admit the union of the soul and bodi should pronounc it imposs for the human natur to be unit to the divin in a manner ineff and incomprehens by reason neither can i see ani absurd in admit that sin man may becom regener or a new creatur by the grace of god reclaim him from a carnal life to a spiritu life of virtu and holi and sinc the be govern by sens and appetit is contrari to the happi and perfect of a ration creatur i do not at all wonder that we are prescrib selfdeni as for the resurrect of the dead i do not conceiv it so veri contrari to the analog of natur when i behold veget left to rot in the earth rise up again with new life and vigor or a worm to all appear dead chang it natur and that which in it first be crawl on the earth becom a new speci and fli abroad with wing and inde when i consid that the soul and bodi are thing so veri differ and heterogen i can see no reason to be posit that the one must necessarili be extinguish upon the dissolut of the other especi sinc i find in my self a strong natur desir of immort and i have not observ that natur appetit are wont to be given in vain or mere to be frustrat upon the whole those point which you account extravag and absurd i dare not pronounc to be so till i see good reason for it xii cri no alciphron your posit air must not pass for proof nor will it suffic to say thing are contrari to common sens to make us think they are so by common sens i suppos should be meant either the gener sens of mankind or the improv reason of think men now i believ that all those articl you have with so much capac and fire at onc sum up and explod may be shown to be not disagre much less contrari to common sens in one or other of these accept that the god might appear and convers among men and that the divin might inhabit human natur were point allow by the heathen and for thi i appeal to their poet and philosoph whose testimoni are so numer and clear that it would be an affront to repeat them to a man of ani educ and though the notion of a devil may not be so obviou or so fulli describ yet there appear plain trace of it either from reason or tradit the latter platonist as porphyri and iamblichu are veri clear in the point allow that evil demon delud and tempt hurt and possess mankind that the ancient greek chaldaean and egyptian believ both good and bad angel may be plainli collect from plato plutarch and the chaldaean oracl origin observ that almost all the gentil who held the be of demon allow there were bad one origin l contra celsum there is even someth as earli as homer that is thought by the learn cardin bessarion in calumniat platoni l c to allud to the fall of satan in the acount of ate whom the poet repres as cast down from heaven by jove and then wander about the earth do mischief to mankind thi same ate is said by hesiod to be the daughter of discord and by euripid in hi hippolitu is mention as a tempter to evil and it is veri remark that plutarch in hi book de vitando aer alieno speak after empedocl of certain demon that fell from heaven and were banish by god nor is that less remark which is observ by ficinu from pherecyd syru that there had been a downfal of demon who revolt from god and that ophioneu the old serpent wa head of that rebelli crew vid argum in phaedrum platoni then as to other articl let ani one consid what the pythagorean taught of the purgat and or deliver of the soul what most philosoph but especi the stoic of subdu our passion what plato and hierocl have said of forgiv injuri what the acut and sagaci aristotl write in hi ethic to nicomachu of the spiritu and divin life that life which accord to him is too excel to be thought human insomuch as man so far forth as man can not attain to it but onli so far forth as he ha someth divin in him and particularli let him reflect on what socrat taught to wit that virtu is not to be learn from men that it is the gift of god and that good men are not good by virtu of human care or dilig vid plat in protag and alibi passim let ani man who realli think but consid what other think men have thought who can not be suppos prejud in favor of reveal religion and he will see caus if not to think with rever of the christian doctrin of grace selfdeni regener sanctif and the rest even the most mysteri at least to judg more modestli and warili than those who shall with a confid air pronounc them absurd and repugn to the reason of mankind and in regard to a futur state the common sens of the gentil world modern or ancient and the opinion of the wisest men of antiqu are thing so well known that i need say noth about them to me it seem the minut philosoph when they appeal to reason and common sens mean onli the sens of their own parti a coin how current soever among themselv that other men will bring to the touchston and pass for no more than it is worth ly be those notion agreeabl to what or whose sens they may they are not agreeabl to mine and if i am thought ignor for thi i piti those who think me so xiii i enjoy my self and follow my own cours without remors or fear which i should not do if my head were fill with enthusiasm whether gentil or christian philosoph or reveal it is all one to me let other know or believ what they can and make the best on it i for my part am happi and safe in my ignor cri perhap not so safe neither ly whi sure you will not pretend that ignor is crimin cri ignor alon is not a crime but that wil ignor affect ignor ignor from sloth or conceit ignor is a fault might easili be prove by the testimoni of heathen writer and it need no proof to show that if ignor be our fault we can not be secur in it as an excus ly honest crito seem to hint that a man should take care to inform himself while aliv lest hi neglect be punish when he is dead noth is so pusillanim and unbecom a gentleman as fear nor could you take a likeli cours to fix and rivet a man of honor in guilt than by attempt to frighten him out of it thi is the stale absurd stratagem of priest and that which make them and their religion more odiou and contempt to me than all the other articl put togeth cri i would fain know whi it may not be reason for a man of honor or ani man who ha done amiss to fear guilt is the natur parent of fear and natur is not use to make men fear where there is no occas that impiou and profan men should expect divin punish doe not seem so absurd to conceiv and that under thi expect they should be uneasi and even afraid how consist soever it may or may not be with honor i am sure consist with reason ly that thing of hell and etern punish is the most absurd as well as the most disagre thought that ever enter into the head of mortal man cri but you must own that it is not an absurd peculiar to christian sinc socrat that great freethink of athen thought it probabl there may be such a thing as impiou men for ever punish in hell vid platon in gorgia it is record of thi same socrat that he ha been often known to think for four and twenti hour togeth fix in the same postur and wrap up in medit ly our modern freethink are a more live sort of men those old philosoph were most of them whimsic they had in my judgment a dri narrow timor way of think which by no mean came up to the frank humor of our time cri but i appeal to your own judgment if a man who know not the natur of the soul can be assur by the light of reason whether it is mortal or immort an simul intereat nobiscum mort perempta an tenebra orci visat vastasqu lacuna ly but what if i know the natur of the soul what if i have been taught that whole secret by a modern freethink a man of scienc who discov it not by a tiresom introvers of hi faculti not by amus himself in a labyrinth of notion or stupidli think for whole day and night togeth but by look into thing and observ the analog of natur xiv thi great man is a philosoph by fire who ha made mani process upon veget it is hi opinion that men and veget are realli of the same speci that anim are move veget and veget fix anim that the mouth of the one and the root of the other serv to the same use differ onli in posit that blossom and flower answer to the most indec and conceal part in the human bodi that veget and anim bodi are both alik organ and that in both there is life or a certain motion and circul of juic through proper tube or vessel i shall never forget thi abl man unfold the natur of the soul in the follow manner the soul said he is that specif form or principl from whenc proceed the distinct qualiti or properti of thing now as veget are a more simpl and less perfect compound and consequ more easili analyz than anim we will begin with the contempl of the soul of veget know then that the soul of ani plant rosemari for instanc is neither more nor less than it essenti oil upon thi depend it peculiar fragranc tast and medicin virtu or in other word it life and oper separ or extract thi essenti oil by chymic art and you get the soul of the plant what remain be a dead carcass without ani one properti or virtu of the plant which is preserv entir in the oil a dram whereof goe further than sever pound of the plant now thi same essenti oil is it self a composit of sulphur and salt or of a gross unctuou substanc and a fine subtl principl or volatil salt imprison therein thi volatil salt is properli the essenc of the soul of the plant contain all it virtu and the oil is the vehicl of thi most subtl part of the soul or that which fix and individu it and as upon separ of thi oil from the plant the plant die so a second death or death of the soul ensu upon the resolut of thi essenti oil into it principl as appear by leav it expos for some time to the open air so that the volatil salt or spirit may fli off after which the oil remain dead and insipid but without ani sensibl diminut of it weight by the loss of that volatil essenc of the soul that ether aura that spark of entiti which return and mix with the solar light the univers soul of the world and onli sourc of life whether veget anim or intellectu which differ onli accord to the gross or fine of the vehicl and the differ textur of the natur alemb or in other word the organ bodi where the abovement volatil essenc inhabit and is elabor where it act and is act upon thi chemic system let you at onc into the natur of the soul and account for all it is phenomenon in that compound which is call man the soul or essenti oil is what commonli goe by the name of anim spirit for you must know it is a point agre by chemist that spirit are noth but the more subtl oil now in proport as the essenti oil of man is more subtl than that of other creatur the volatil salt that impregn it is more at liberti to act which account for those specif properti and action of human kind which distinguish them abov other creatur henc you may learn whi among the wise ancient salt wa anoth name for wit and in our time a dull man is said to be insipid or insuls aromat oil matur by great length of time turn to salt thi show whi human kind grow wiser by age and what i have said of the twofold death or dissolut first of the compound by separ the soul from the organ bodi and secondli of the soul it self by divid the volatil salt from the oil illustr and explain that notion of certain ancient philosoph that as the man wa a compound of soul and bodi so the soul wa compound of the mind or intellect and it ether vehicl and that the separ of soul and bodi or death of the man is after a long tract of time succeed by a second death of the soul it self to wit the separ or deliver of the intellect from it vehicl and reunion with the sun euph o lysicl your ingeni friend ha open a new scene and explain the most obscur and difficult point in the clearest and easiest manner ly i must own thi account of thing struck my fanci i am no great lover of creed or system but when a notion is reason and ground on experi i know how to valu it cri in good earnest lysicl do you believ thi account to be true ly whi then in good earnest i dont know whether i do or no but i can assur you the ingeni artist himself ha not the least doubt about it and to believ an artist in hi art is a just maxim and short way to scienc cri but what relat ha the soul of man to chymic art the same reason that bid me trust a skil artist in hi art inclin me to suspect him out of hi art men are too apt to reduc unknown thing to the standard of what they know and bring a prejudic or tinctur from thing they have been convers in to judg therebi of thing in which they have not been convers i have known a fiddler grave teach that the soul wa harmoni a geometrician veri posit that the soul must be extend and a physician who have pickl half a doozen embryo and dissect as mani rat and frog grew conceit and affirm there wa no soul at all and that it wa a vulgar error ly my notion sit easi i shall not engag in pedant disput about them they who dont like them may leav them euph thi i suppos is said much like a gentelman xv but pray lysicl tell me whether the clergi come within that gener rule of your that an artist may be trust in hi art ly by no mean euph whi so ly becaus i take my self to know as much of those matter as they do euph but you allow that in ani other profess one who ha spent much time and pain may attain more knowledg than a man of equal or better part who never made it hi particular busi ly i do euph and nevertheless in thing religi and divin you think all men equal know ly i do not say all men but i think all men of sens compet judg euph what are the divin attribut and dispens to mankind the true end and happi of ration creatur with the mean of improv and perfect their be more easi and obviou point than those which make the subject of everi common profess ly perhap not but one thing i know some thing are so manifestli absurd that no author shall make me give into them for instanc if all mankind should pretend to persuad me that the son of god wa born upon earth in a poor famili wa spit upon buffet and crucifi live like a beggar and die like a thief i should never believ one syllabl of it common sens show everi one what figur it would be decent for an earthli princ or ambassador to make and the son of god upon an ambassi from heaven must need have made an appear beyond all other of great eclat and in all respect the veri revers of that which jesu christ is report to have made even by hi own historian euph o lysicl though i had ever so much mind to approv and applaud your ingeni reason yet i dare not assent to thi for fear of crito ly whi so euph becaus he observ just now that men judg of thing they do not know by prejudic from thing they do know and i fear he would object that you who have been convers in the grand mond have your head fill with a notion of attend and equipag and liveri the familiar badg of human grandeur are less abl to judg of that which is truli divin and that one who had seen less and thought more would be apt to imagin a pompou parad of worldli great not the most becom the author of a spiritu religion that wa design to wean men from the world and rais them abov it cri do you think lysicl if a man should make hi entranc into london in a rich suit of cloth with a hundr gilt coach and a thousand lace footmen that thi would be a more divin appear and have more of true grandeur in it than if he had power with a word to heal all manner of diseas to rais the dead to life and still the rage of the wind and sea ly without all doubt it must be veri agreeabl to common sens to suppos that he could restor other to life who could not save hi own you tell us inde that he rose again from the dead but what occas wa there for him to die the just for the unjust the son of god for wick men and whi in that individu place whi at that veri time abov all other whi did he not make hi appear earlier and preach in all part of the world that the benefit might have been more extens account for all these point and reconcil them if you can to the common notion and plain sens of mankind cri and what if those as well as mani other point should lie out of the road that we are acquaint with must we therefor explod them and make it a rule to condemn everi proceed as senseless that doe not squar with the vulgar sens of man if the precept and certain primari tenet of religion appear in the eye of reason good and use and if they are also found to be so by their effect we may for the sake of them admit certain other point or doctrin recommend with them to have a good tendenc to be right and true although we can not discern their good or truth by the mere light of human reason which may well be suppos an insuffici judg of the proceed counsel and design of provid and thi suffic to make our convict reason xvi it is an allow point that no man can judg of thi or that part of a machin taken by it self without know the whole the mutual relat or depend of it part and the end for which it wa made and as thi is a point acknowledg in corpor and natur thing ought we not by a pariti of reason to suspend our judgment of a singl unaccount part of the divin economi till we are more fulli acquaint with the moral system or world of spirit and are let into the design of god provid and have an extens view of hi dispens past present and futur ala lysicl what do you know even of your self whenc you come what you are or whither you are go to me it seem that a minut philosoph is like a conceit spectat who never look behind the scene and yet would judg of the machineri who from a transient glimps of a part onli of some one scene would take upon him to censur the plot of a play ly as to the plot i will not say but in half a scene a man may judg of an absurd actor with what color or pretext can you justifi the vindict froward whimsic behavior of some inspir teacher or prophet particular that serv neither for
