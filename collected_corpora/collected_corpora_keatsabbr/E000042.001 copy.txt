is here exemplifi and that such passion as remain after a certain age are not properli the incent of natur but of exampl long habitud or ill humour page life progress through the passion introduct i have often heard it observ by the reader of biographi that the charact are gener too high paint and that the good or bad qualiti of the person pretend to be faith repres are display in stronger colour than are to be found in natur to thi the lover of hyperbol repli that virtu can not be drawn too beauti nor vice too deform in order to excit in us an ambit of imit the one and a horror at the thought of becom ani way like the otherth argument at first inde seem to have some weight as there is noth not even precept itself which so greatli contribut whether to rectifi or improv the mind as the preval of exampl but then it ought to be consid that if the pattern laid down befor us is so altogeth angel as to render it imposs to be copi emul will be in danger of be swallow up in an unprofit admir and on the other hand if it appear so monstrous hideou as to take away all apprehens of ever resembl it we might be too apt to indulg ourselv in error which would seem small in comparison with those present to usther never yet wa ani one man in whom all the virtu or all the vice were sum up for though reason and educ may go a great way toward curb the passion yet i believ experi will inform even the best of men that they will sometim launch out beyond their due bound in spite of all the care can be taken to restrain them nor do i think the veri worst and most wick doe not feel in himself at some moment a propens to good though it may be possibl he never bring it into practic at least thi wa the opinion of the antient as wit the poet word all men are born with seed of good and ill and each shoot forth in more or less degre one you may cultiv with care and skill but from the other neer be wholli free the human mind may i think be compar to a chequerwork where light and shade appear by turn and in proport as either of these is most conspicu the man is alon worthi of prais or censur for none there are can boast of be wholli bright i believ by thi the reader will be convinc he must not expect to see a faultless figur in the hero of the follow page but to remov all possibl of a disappoint on that score i shall farther declar that i am an enemi to all romanc novel and whatev carri the air of them tho disguis under differ appel and as it is a real not fictiti charact i am about to present i think myself oblig for the reason i have alreadi given as well as to gratifi my own inclin to draw him such as he wa not such as some sanguin imagin might with him to have been i flatter myself howev that truth will appear not altogeth void of charm and the adventur i take upon me to relat not be less pleas for be within the reach of probabl and such as might have happen to ani other as well as the person they didfew there are i am pretti certain who will not find some resembl of himself in one part or other of hi life among the mani variou and surpriz turn of fortun which the subject of thi littl histori experienc as also be remind in what manner the passion oper in everi stage of life and how far the constitut of the outward frame is concern in the emot of the intern faculti these are thing sure veri necessari to be consid and when they are so will in a great measur abat that unbecom vehem with which peopl are apt to testifi their admir or abhorr of action which it veri often happen would lose much of their eclat either way were the secret spring that give them motion seen into with the eye of philosophi and reflect but thi will be more clearli understood by a perus of the fact herein contain from which i will no longer detain in the attent of my reader book the first chap i shew in the exampl of natura how from our veri birth the passion to which the human soul is incid are discover in us and how far the organ of sens or what is call the constitut ha an effect over us the origin of natura would perhap requir more time to trace than the benefit of the discoveri would atton for it shall therefor suffic to say that hi ancestor were neither of the highest rankthat if no extraordinari action had signal the name of ani of them so none of them had been guilti of crime to entail infami on their poster and that a moder estat in the famili had descend from father to son for mani gener without be either remark improv or embezzledhi immedi parent were in veri easi circumst and he be their first son wa welcom into the world with a joy usual on such occasionsi never heard that ani prodigi preced or accompani hi nativ or that the planet or hi mother crave dure her pregnanc had seal him with ani particular mark or badg of distinct but have been well assur he wa a fine boy suck heartili of hi mother milk and what they call a thrive child hi wean i am told wa attend by some littl ailment occas by hi pine after the food to which he had been accustom but proper mean be found to make him lose the memori of the breast he soon recov hi flesh increas in strength and could go about the room at a year and some few month old without the help of a leadingstr hitherto the passion those power abettor i had almost said sole author of all human action oper but faintli and could shew themselv onli in proport to the vigour of the anim frame yet latent as they are an observ eye may easili discov them in each of their differ propens even from the most earli infanc the eye of natura on ani new and pleas object would denot by their sparkl a sensat of joyfear wa visibl in him by cling to hi nurs and endeavour to buri himself as it were in her bosom at the sound of menac he wa not capabl of understandingthat sorrow ha a place among the first emot of the soul wa demonstr by the sigh which frequent would heav hi littl heart long befor it wa possibl for him either to know or to imagin ani motiv for themthat the seed of avaric are born with us by the eager with which he catch at money when present to him hi clinch it fast in hi hand and the reluct he express on be depriv of itthat anger and impati of controul are inher to our natur might be seen in hi throw down with vehem ani favourit toy rather than yield to resign it and that spite and reveng are also but too much so by hi put in practic all such trick as hi young invent could furnish to vex ani of the famili who had happen to cross himeven those tender inclin which afterward bear the name of amor begin to peep out long befor the differ of sex is thought on as natura prove by the prefer he gave the girl over the boy who came to play with him and hi readi to part with ani thing to them in a word there is not one of all the variou emot which agit the breast in matur that may not be discern almost from the birth hope jealousi and despair except which tho they bear the name in common with those other more natur disposit of the mind i look upon rather as consequenti of the passion and aris from them than properli passion themselv but howev that be it is certain that they are altogeth depend on a fixat of idea reflect and comparison and therefor can have no entranc in the soul or at least can not be awaken in it till some degre of knowledg is attain thu do the disposit of the infant indic the futur man and though we see in the behaviour of person when grown up so vast a differ yet as all children at first act alik i think it may be reason suppos that were it not for some chang in the constitut an equal similitud of will desir and sentiment would continu among us through matur and old age at least i am perfectli perswad it would do so among all those who are born in the same climat and educ in the same principl for whatev may be said of a great geniu and natur endow there is certainli no real distinct between the soul of the man of wit and the ideot and that disproport which we are apt to behold with so much wonder is onli in fact occas by some or other of those innumer and hidden accid which from our first come into the world in a more or less degre have an effect upon the organ of sens and they be the sole canal through which the spirit shew itself accord as they happen to be extend contract or obstruct the man must infal appear chap ii contain some proof by what swift degre the passion gain an ascend over the mind and grow up in proport with our reason natura had no sooner quit the nurseri than he wa put under the direct of the school to which at first he wa everi day conduct either by a man or maidserv but when thought big enough to be trust alon would frequent play the truant for which he gener receiv the disciplin necessari on such occasionsh took hi learn notwithstand as well as could be expectedh had read the testament through at five year old about seven wa put into latin and began the rudiment of greek befor he had attain the age of nine as hi understand increas the passion becam stronger in proport and here is to be observ the wonder wisdom of natur or rather of the great author of natur in the format of the human system that the passion given to us especi those of the worst sort are for the most part such opposit that the one is a suffici check upon the otherth pride of treat those beneath us with contempt is restrain by the fear of meet the same usag from those abov usa sordid covet is control by ostentationsloth is rous by ambit and so of the resti have been told that when natura by the entic of hi companion and hi own eager to pursu the sport suitabl to hi year had been drawn in to neglect hi studi he had often ran home on a sudden and deni himself both food and sleep till he had not onli finish the task assign him by hi schoolmast but also exceed what wa expect from him instig by the ambit of prais and hope of be remov to a higher formbut at other time again hi love of play ha render him total forget of everi thing besid and all emul in him absorb in pleasurethu hurri as the differ propens prevail from one extrem to the othernev in a medium but alway do either more or less than wa requir of him in like manner wa hi avaric moder by hi pityan instanc of which wa thison morn have won at chuckfarth or some such game all the money a poor boy wa master of and which he said had been given him to buy hi breakfast natura wa so much melt at hi tear and complaint that he gener return to him the whole of what he had lostgreatli is it to be wish the same sentiment of compass would influenc some of riper year and make them scorn to take the advantag chanc sometim afford of ruin their fellowcreatur but the misfortun is that when we arriv at the state of perfect manhood the worst passion are apt to get the better of the more nobl as the prospect they present is more allur to the eye of sens all men as i said befor be born with the same propens it is virtu alon or in other word a strict moral which prevent them from actuat alik in allbut to return to the young natura he wa scarc ten year old when hi mother die but wa not sensibl of the misfortun he sustain by the loss of her though as it afterward prove wa the greatest could have happen to him the remembr of the tender with which she had use him join to the sight of all the famili in tear made him at first inde utter some bitter lament but the thought of a new suit of mourn a dress he had never yet been in soon dissip hi grief and the sight of himself befor the great glass in a habit so altogeth strang and therefor pleas to him took off all anguish for the sad occasionso earli do we begin to be sensibl of a satisfact in ani thing that we imagin is an advantag to our person or will make us be taken notic ofhow it grow up with us and how difficult it is to be erad i appeal even to those of the most sour and cynic disposit mr dryden admir describ thi propens in human natur in these line men are but children of a larger growth our appetit as prone to chang as their and full as crave too and full as vain a fond for trifl is certainli no less conspicu in age than youth and we daili see it among person of the best understand who wholli neglect everi essenti to real happi in the pursuit of those veri toy which children cri to be indulg in even such as a bit of ribband or the sound of a monosyl tack to the name without consid that those badg of distinct like bell about an ideot neck frequent serv onli to render their folli more remark and expos them to the contempt of the looker on who perhap too as natur is the same in all want but the same opportun to catch no less eagerli at the tawdri gewgaw natura felt not the loss of hi dear mother till he beheld anoth in her place hi father enter into a second marriag befor much more than half hi year of widowhood wa expir with a ladi who though pretti near hi equal in year had yet remain enough of beauti to render her extrem vain and affect and fortun enough to make her no less proudthes two qualiti occas natura mani rebuff to which he had not been acoustom and he felt them the more sever as the name of mother had made him expect the same proof of tender from thi who had the titl as he had rememb to have receiv from her who had been realli so he endeavour at first to insinu himself into her favour by all those littl flatter artific which are so becom in person of hi tender year and which never fail to make an impress on a gentl and affabl disposit but find hi servic not onli reject but also reject with scorn and moros hi spirit wa too great to continu them for ani long time and all the assidu he had shewn to gain her goodwil wa on a sudden convert into a behaviour altogeth the revers he wa sure to turn the deaf ear to all the command she laid upon him and so far from do ani thing to pleas her he seem to take a delight in vex her thi occas mani complaint to hi father drew on him veri sever chastis both at home and abroad but though while the smart remain he made mani promis of amend in thi point the hatr he had now conceiv against her would not suffer him to keep them hi sister who wa five year older than himself and a girl of great prudenc took a good deal of pain to convinc him how much it wa both hi interest and hi duti to pay all manner of respect to a ladi whom their father had thought fit to set over them but all she could say on that head wa thrown away and he still repli that sinc he could not make her love him he should alway hate her thi young ladi had perhap no less reason than her brother to be dissatisfi with the humour of their stepmoth and it wa onli the tender affect she had for him which made her feign a content at the treatment both of them receiv in order to keep him within ani manner of bound it may be reckon among the misfortun of natura that he so soon lost the benefit of these kind remonstr hi fair advis have a consider fortun independ on her father left her by a grandmoth who had also answer for her at the font wa court by a gentleman to whom neither herself nor famili have ani thing to object she becam a bride in a veri few month and went with her husband to a seat he had at a consider distanc in the countri thi poor youth wa now without ani one either to prevent him from do a fault or to conceal it when commit on the contrari hi motherinlaw have newmodel all the famili and retain onli such servant as thought it their duti to studi noth but to humour her everi littl error in him wa exagger and he wa repres to hi father as incorrig pervers and all that is disagre in natur i will not take upon me to determin whether or not the old gentleman had altogeth so ill an opinion of hi son as they endeavour to inspir him with but it is certain that whatev hi thought were on the matter he found himself oblig for a quiet life to use him with a good deal of sever which either becaus he believ it unjust or that it wa disagre to hi own disposit he grew veri weari of in a short time and to put an end to it resolv to send the child to a boardingschool tho he had alway declar against that sort of educ and frequent said that though these great school might improv the learn they were apt to corrupt the moral of youth find himself howev under a kind of necess for so do noth remain but the choic of a conveni place the wife propos some part of yorkshir not onli as the cheapest but also that by reason of the distanc she should not have the troubl of him at home in the holiday but to thi it wa not in her power to prevail on hi father to consent and after mani disput between them on it eton wa at length pitch upon natura heard of hi intend remov with a perfect indifferenceif the thought of part from hi father gave him ani pain it wa balanc by those of be eas of the persecut of hi stepmoth but when all thing were prepar for hi journey in which he wa to be accompani by an old relat who wa to give the necessari charg with him to those into whose care he should be commit he wa taken suddenli ill on the veri day he had been to take leav of hi kindr and other friend in town hi distemp prove to be the smallpox but be of a veri favour sort he recov in a short time and lost noth of hi handsom by that somuchdread enemi to the

umbrag at the sight dure the time of hi indisposit he had been attend by an old nurs who had serv in the same qualiti to hi mother and sever other of her familyth tender thi good creatur shew to him and the care she took to humour him in everi thing not onli while he continu in a condit in which it might have been danger to have put hi spirit into the least agit but after he wa grown well enough to walk abroad had made him becom extrem pettish and selfwil which shew that an overindulg to youth is no less prejudici than too much austerityhappi is it for those who are brought up in a due proport between these two extrem for as natur will be apt to fall into a deject if press down with a constant and uninterrupt sever so it will infal becom arrog and assum if suffer alway to pursu it own dictatesnoth is more evid than that most of the irregular we see practis in the world are owe origin to a want of the medium i have been speak of in form the mind while it is pliabl to impress thi wa not howev the case of natura and though he would doubtless have been what we call a spoil child had he been for ani length of time permit to do just what he pleas yet the nurs be discharg he fell again under the jurisdict of hi motherinlaw who had now more excus than ever for treat him with sever hi father did not want understand but wa a good deal more indol than befit a parenth had alway been accustom to live at eas and hi natur avers to all kind of troubl made him not inspect into the manner or tempera of hi son with that care he ought to have done whenev ani complaint were made concern hi behaviour he would chide and sometim beat him but seldom examin how far he realli merit those effect rather of other resent than hi own sometim he would ask him question on hi progress in learn and prais or disprais as he found occas but he never discours with him on ani other topic nor took ani pleasur in instruct him in such thing as are not to be taught in school but which much more contribut to enlarg the mind so that had not natura own curios led him to examin into the sourc first caus and motiv of what he wa oblig to read he would have reap no other benefit from hi greek and latin author than meerli the knowledg of their languag here i can not help take notic that whatev inconveni it may occas curios is one of the greatest advantag we receiv from natur it is that inde from which all our knowledg is derivedwer it not for thi propens in ourselv the sun the moon and all the darl constel which adorn the hemispher would roll abov our head in vain content to behold their shine and feel their warmth but ignor of their motion and influenc on all beneath half that admir due to the divin architect would lye dormant in usdid not curios excit us to examin into the natur of veget their amaz rise their progress their death and resurrect in the season allot for these altern we should enjoy the fruit of the earth inde but enjoy them onli in common with the anim that feed upon it or perhap with less relish than they do as it is agre their organ of sensat have a greater share of poignanc than ourswhat is it but curios which render studi either pleas or profit to usth fact we read of would soon slip through the memori or if they retain ani place in it could be of littl advantag without be acquaint with the motiv which occas them by curios we examin by examin we compar and by compar we are alon enabl to form a right judgment whether of thing or person we are told inde of mani jealousi discont and quarrel which have been occas by thi passion among those who might otherwis have live in perfect harmoni and a man or woman who ha the charact of be too inquisit is shun as danger to societybut what commend qualiti is there that may not be pervert or what virtu whose extrem doe not border on a viceeven devot itself should have it bound or it will launch into bigotri and enthusiasmlov the most gener and gentl of all the passion when illplac or unprescrib degener into the veri worstjustic may be pursu till it becom crueltyemul indulg till it grow up to envyfrug to the most sordid avaric and courag to a brutal rashnessand so i am readi to allow that curios from whenc all the good in us origin aris may also be product of the greatest mischief when not like everi other emot of the soul kept within it due limit and suffer to exert itself onli on warrant object it should therefor be the first care of everi one to regul thi propens in himself as well as of those under whose tuition he may happen to be whether parent or governorsnatur and the write of learn men who from time to time have comment on all that ha happen in natur certainli afford suffici matter to gratifi the most enquir mind without descend to such mean trifl inquisit as can no way improv itself and may be of prejudic to other i have dwelt the longer on thi head becaus it seem to me that on the well or ill direct of that curios which is inher to us all depend in a great measur the peac and happi of societi natura like all children uncircumscrib by precept had not onli a desir of pri into those thing which it wa hi advantag to know but also into those which he had much better have been total ignor of and which the discoveri of hi be too well skill in frequent occas him much ill will especi when he wa found to have too far dive into those littl secret which will ever be among servant in larg famili but reason wa not ripe enough in him to enabl him to distinguish between what were proper subject for the exercis of thi passion and what were not so that impedi howev which had hitherto retard hi departur be remov he now set out for eton under the conduct of the abovement kinsman who place him in a boardinghous veri near the school and took hi leav after have given him such admonit as he thought necessari for a person of hi year when more intrust to himself than he befor had been but natura wa not yet arriv at an age wherein it could be expect he should reap much benefit from advic a settl resolut and the power of judg what is our real interest to do are the perfect of matur and happi is it for the few who even then attain themprecept must be constantli and art instil to make ani impress on the mind and is rare fix there till experi confirm it therefor as both these were want to form hi behaviour what could be hope from it but such a one as wa conform to the variou passion which agit human natur and which everi day grow stronger in us at least till they have attain a certain crisi after which they decay in proport as they increas as wrath is one of the most violent emot of the soul so i think it is one of the first that break out into effect it owe it birth inde to pride for we are never angri unless touch by a real or imaginari insult but by the offspr chiefli is the parent seen pride seldom i believ it may be said never wholli die in us tho it may be conceal wherea wrath diminish as our reason increas and seem intir evapor after the heat of youth is over when a man therefor ha divest himself of the one no token are left to distinguish the othersometim inde we shall see an extrem impetuos even to old age but then it is out of the ordinari cours of natur and besid the person possess of it must be endu with a small share of sound understand to give ani mark of such a propens remain in him it is with the utmost justic that by the system of the christian religion pride is intitl the origin sin not onli as it wa that of the fallen angel but also as it is certainli the fountainhead from which all our other vice are derivedit is by the dictat of thi pernici passion we are inflam with wrath and wild ambitioninstig to covetousnessto envyto reveng and in fine to stop at noth which tend to selfgratif be our desir of what kind soever dure the school hour natura as well as the other young gentlemen wa under too much awe of the master to give ani loos to hi temper but when these were over and they went togeth into the field or ani other place to divert themselv frequent quarrel among them ensu but abov all between those who board in the same hous littl jealousi concern some imaginari prefer given to the one

to be the jest of all the rest natura wa equal guilti of thi fault with hi companion but when the sarcasm becam too sever and the object of them appear ani way deject hi generos often got the better of hi arrog and he would take part with the weakest side even till he drew on himself part of those reflect he avert from the other but thi never happen without hi resent it with the utmost violenc

men of the ripest and sometim most advanc year are not to be warn from the gratif of their passion by the worst and most frequent repeat ill he notwithstand made a veri good progress in those thing in which he wa instruct which as yet were onli latin and greek and when the time of break up arriv and he return to hi father hous none who examin him concern hi learn could suspect there wa either ani

belowbut in throw hi eye around on everi dazzl bell he found none so agreeabl to him as a young ladi who wa place in the next divis of the boxher age did not seem to exceed hi own and tho less splendid in garb and jewel than sever who sat near her had someth in her eye and air that in hi opinion at least infinit exceed them all when the curtain dropt and everi one wa crowd out as fast they could he lost not sight of her and find when they came out to the door that she and a companion she had with her somewhat older than herself seem distress for chair which by reason of the great concours seem difficult to be got he took the opportun in a veri polit manner to offer himself for their protector as he perceiv they had neither friend nor servant with them they accept it with a great deal of seem modesti and he conduct them through a passag belong to the hous which he knew wa less throng and thenc put them into a hackney coach have first obtain their permiss to attend them to their lodg or wherev els they pleas to be set down when they arriv at the place to which they gave the coachman a direct he would have taken leav of them at the door but they join in entreat him that sinc he had been at the pain of bring them safe home he would come in and refresh himself with such as their apart could suppli there requir littl invit to a thing hi heart so sincer wish tho hi fear of be thought too presum would not suffer him to ask it he went up stair and found room decent furnish and a maidserv immedi spread the tabl with a genteel cold collat but what he look upon as the most eleg part of the entertain wa the agreeabl chitchat dure the time of supper and a song the ladi who had so much attract him gave him at her friend request after the cloth wa taken away it grow late hi fear of offend where he alreadi had such an inclin to oblig made him about to take hi leav but could not do it without intreat permiss to wait on them the next day to receiv pardon as he said for have by hi long stay broke in upon the hour should have been devot to repos tho thi compliment and inde all the other he had made were direct to both the regard hi eye paid to the youngest

briskli i should have anticip the request you make but as i am onli a guest and take part of my friend bed tonight on account of the hour will take upon me to say she ought not to refus greater favour to so accomplish a gentleman and from whom we have receiv so much civil natura did not fail to answer thi gallantri in a proper manner and depart highli satisfi with hi adventur tho probabl could find less reason for be so than those with whom he thought it the greatest happi of hi life to have becom acquaint wonder are the work of love on a young heart pleasur ha the same effect as pain and permit as littl rest it wa not in the power of natura to close hi eye for a long time after he went to bedh recollect everi thing the dear creatur had saidin what manner she look when speak such or such a thinghow inchant she sang and what a genteel accompani all she didwhen he fell into a slumber it wa onli to bring her more perfectli into hi mind whatev had past in the few hour he had been with her return with addit grace on her part and her idea had in sleep all the effect her real presenc could have had in wake with what care did he dress himself the next daywhat fear wa he not possess of lest all about him should not be exactnev yet had he consult the great glass with such assiduitynev till now examin how far he had been indebt to natur for person endow hi impati would have carri him to pay a morn visit but he fear that would be too great a freedom and therefor restrain himself till after dinner though what he eat could scarc be call so the food hi mind languish for be want the bodi wa too complais to indulg itselfaft rise from tabl not a minut pass without look on hi watch and at the same time curs the tediou second which seem to him increas from sixti to six hundredth hour of five at length put an end to hi suspenc and he took hi way to the dear wellrememb mansion of hi ador he found her at home and in a careless but most becom dishabille the other ladi wa still with her and told him she had tarri thu long with miss harriot for so she call her meerli to particip of the pleasur of hi good compani harriot in a gay manner accus her of envi and both have a good share of wit the convers might have been pleas enough to a man less prepossess than natura the tea equipag wa set and the ceremoni of that be over card were propos as they were three ombr wa the game at which they play some hour and natura wa ask to supaft what i have said i believ the reader ha no occas to be told that he compli with a pleasur which wa but too visibl in hi eyesth time pass insens on or at least seem to do so to the friend of harriot till the watchman remind her it wa past eleven she start up and pretend a surpriz that the night wa so far advanc told natura that she must exact a second proof of that gallantri he had shewn the night befor for she had not courag to go either in a chair or a coach alon at that late hourthi doubtless wa what he would have offer had she been silent on the occas and a coach be order to the door he took leav of miss harriot though not till he had obtain leav to testifi hi respect in some futur visit had natura appear to have more experi of the town the ladi he gallant home would certainli not have entertain him with the discours she did but hi extrem youth and the modest manner of hi behaviour on the first sight of him convinc them he wa a person such as they wish to have in their power and to that end had concert measur between themselv to perfect the conquest which it wa easi to perceiv one of them had begun to make over him harriot be the person with whom they found he wa enamour it wa the busi of the other to do for her what it may be suppos she would have done for her on the like occasionnatura wa no sooner in the coach with her than she began to magnifi the charm of her fair friend but abov all extol her virtu her prudenc and good humourthen as if onli to give a proof of her patienc and fortitud that her parent die when she wa an infant had left her with a vast fortun in the hand of a guardian who attempt to defraud her of the greatest part she wa now at law with him and is oblig to live till the affair is decid said thi art woman in the narrow manner you seewithout a coachwithout ani equipag and yet she bear it all with chearfulnesssh ha a multipl of admir ad she but she assur all of them that she will never marri till she know what present she shall be abl to give with herself to the man she shall make choic of till now natura had never ask himself the question how far hi passion for harriot extend or with what view he should address her but when he heard she wa a woman of condit and would have a fortun answer to her birth he began to think it would be happi for him if he could obtain her love on the most honour term it would be too tediou to relat all the particular of hi courtship so i shall onli say that humbl and timid as the first emot of a sincer passion are he wa embolden by the extraordinari complais of harriot to declar it to her in a few daysth art with which she manag on thi occas might have deceiv the most know in the sex it is not therefor surpriz that he should be caught in a snare which though ruinou as it had like to have been had in it allur scarc possibl to be withstood at hi time of life it wa by such degre as the most modest virgin need not blush to own that she confess herself sensibl of an equal tender for him and noth is more strang than that in the transport he wa in at the condescens she made him that he did not immedi press for the consumm of hi happi by marriag but tho he wish for noth so much yet he wa withheld by the fear of hi father who he thought would not approv of such a step as the fortun he imagin she had a right to wa yet undetermin and himself tho an elder son and the undoubt heir of a veri good estat at present wholli depend on himh commun hi sentiment to harriot on thi head with the utmost sincer protest at the same time that he should never enjoy a moment tranquil till he could call her hi own she seem to approv of the caution he testifiedsaid it wa such as she had alway resolv religi to observ herself tho i know not cri she look on him with the most passion air how far i might have been tempt to break thro all for your sake but it is well one of us is wise enough to forese and trembl at the consequ of a marriag between two person whose fortun are unestablishedthen find he made her no other answer than some kiss accompani with a strenuou embrac she went on there is a way resum she to secur us to each other without danger of disoblig ani bodi and that is by a contract i never can be easi while i think there is a possibl of your transfer your affect to some other and if you love me with half that degre of tender you pretend you can not but feel the same anxieti natura wa charm with thi proposit and it wa agre between them that her lawyer should draw up doubl contract in form which should be sign and deliv interchang by both parti accordingli the veri next day the fatal paper were prepar and he subscrib hi name to that which wa to remain in her custodi as she did her to that given to him each be wit by the woman with whom he first becam acquaint with her and anoth person call into the room for that purpos natura now consid her as hi wife thought himself intitl to take greater liberti than he had ever presum to do befor and she had also a kind of a pretenc for permit them till at last there remain noth more for him to ask or her to grant enjoy made no abat in hi passion hi fond wa rather increas by it and he never thought himself happi but when with her he went to her almost everi night and sometim pass all night with her have made an interest with one of the servant who let him in at whatev hour he cameso total did she engross hi mind that he seem to have not the least attent for ani thing besid nor wa the time he wast with her all the prejudic she did himal the allow made him by hi father for cloath and other expenc he dissip in treat and present to her run in debt for everi thing he had occas for but thi wa insuffici for her expect she want a sum of money and pretend that her lawsuit requir a hundr guinea immedi and that some remitt she wa to have from the countri would come too late told him he must rais it for her some way or other thi demand wa a kind of thunderstrok to natura not but he doat on her enough to have sacrif infinit more to her desir if in hi power but what she ask seem so wholli out of reach that he knew not ani way by which there wa the least probabl of attain it the embarrass that appear in hi counten made her see it wa not so easi for him to grant as it wa for her to ask i should have want courag said she to have made you thi request had i not consid that what is mine must one day be your and it will be your own unhappi as well as mine should my caus miscarri for want of mean to carri it onsever necess ad she let fall some tear that reduc me to intreat favour where i could wish onli to bestow them these word destroy all the remain of prudenc hi love had left in him he embrac her kiss away her tear and assur her that though as he wa under age and had but a small allow from hi father it wa not at thi time veri easi for him to compli with her demand yet she might depend upon him for the money the next day let it cost what it would or whatev should be the consequ he left her that night much sooner than wa hi custom in order to consult within himself on the mean of fulfil hi promis to her which to have fail in would have been more terribl to him than death chap v that to indulg ani one fault bring with it the temptat of commit other is demonstr by the behaviour of natura and the misfortun and disgrac which an illjudg shame had like to have involv him in never had natura experienc so cruel a night a thousand stratagem came into hi head but for some reason or other all seem alik impractic and the morn found him in no more easi a situationh put on hi cloath hastili and resolv to go to all the acquaint he had in the world and tri the friendship of each by borrow what sum he thought they might be abl to spare but first go into hi father closet as wa hi custom everi morn to pay hi duti to him he found a person with him who wa pay him a larg sum of money the sight of what he so much want fill him with inexpress agitationsh would have given almost a limb to have had in hi possess so much of that shine ore as harriot expect from him and wish that some sudden accid even to the fall of the hous would happen that in the confus he might seiz on some part of the treasur he saw befor him the person after the affair which brought him there wa over took leav of the father of natura who have thrown the money into hi bureau to a larg heap wa there befor wait on him down stair without stay to lock the drawer often had natura been present when hi father receiv larger sum than thi and doubtless had the same opportun as now to make himself master of some part or all of it but never till thi unhappi exig had the least temptat to do soit came into hi head that the accid wa perfectli providenti and that he ought not to neglect the onli mean by which he could perform hi promisethat hi father could veri well spare the sum he want and that it wa onli take befor the time what by inherit must be hi own hereafterin thi imagin he open the drawer and wa about to pursu hi intent when he recollect that the money would certainli be miss and either the fault be laid upon some innoc person who might suffer for hi crime or he himself would be suspect of a thing which in thi second thought he found so mean and wick that he wa shock almost to death for have been capabl of even a wish to be guilti of ith shut the drawer againturn himself away and wa in the utmost confus of mind when hi father return into the room which shew that there is a nativ honesti in the human natur which noth but a long practic of base action can wholli erad and i dare believ that even those we see most harden in vice have felt sever struggl within themselv at first and have often look back upon the path of virtu wish tho fruitlesli to return natura howev did not give over hi pursuit of the mean of perform hi promis on the contrari he thought himself oblig by all the tie of love honour and even selfinterest to do it but difficult as he believ the task would be he found it much more so than he could even have imagin hi intimaci be onli with such as be much of hi own age and like him were at an allow from their parent or guardian it wa not in the power of ani of them to contribut a larg sum toward make up that he want the most he got from ani one be no more than five guinea and all he rais among the whole amount to no more than twenti and some odd pound distract with hi ill fortun he ventur to go to an uncl he had by the mother side and after mani complaint of hi father parsimoni told him that have been drawn into some expenc which though not extravag were more than hi littl purs could suppli he had broke into some money given him to pay hi taylor whom he fear would demand it of hi father and he knew not how far the illwil of hi motherinlaw might exagger the matter conclud with an humbl petit for twenti guinea which he told him he would faith return by degre as natura had the charact of a sober youth the good old gentleman wa move by the distress he saw him in and readili grant hi request tho not without some admonit to confin for the futur hi expenc to hi allow be it ever so small thu natura have with all hi dilig not been abl to rais quit half of the sum in question wa quit distract what to do and as he afterward own more than onc repent him of those scrupl which had prevent him from serv himself at onc out of hi father purs tho had the same opportun again present itself it is scarc possibl to believ by the rest of hi behaviour that he would have made use of it or if he had that he could have surviv the shame and remors it would have caus in him in hi desper he ran at last to the hous of a note moneyscriven a great acquaint of the famili and in hi whose hand hi father frequent repos hi readi cash to thi man he commun hi distress and easili prevail with him to let him have fifti pound on give him a note to pay him an hundr for it when he should come of age hi father have said he would then make a settlement on him thi howev wa still somewhat short of what harriot had demand but he left hi watch at a pawnbrok for the rest and have compleat the sum went transport with joy and threw it into the lap of that idol of hi soul after which he wa for some day perfectli at eas indulg himself with all he at present wish for and lose no time
