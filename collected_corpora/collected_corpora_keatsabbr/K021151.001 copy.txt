the introduct to the work or bill of fare to the feast an author ought to consid himself not as a gentleman who give a privat or eleemosynari treat but rather as one who keep a public ordinari at which all person are welcom for their money in the former case it is well known that the entertain provid what fare he pleas and though thi should be veri indiffer and utterli disagre to the tast of hi compani they must not find ani fault nay on the contrari goodbreed forc them outwardli to approv and to commend whatev is set befor them now the contrari of thi happen to the master of an ordinari men who pay for what they eat will insist on gratifi their palat howev nice and even whimsic these may prove and if everi thing is not agreeabl to their tast will challeng a right to censur to abus and to d m their dinner without control to prevent therefor give offens to their custom by ani such disappoint it ha been usual with the honest and wellmean host to provid a bill of fare which all person may perus at their first entranc into the hous and have thenc acquaint themselv with the entertain which they may expect may either stay and regal with what is provid for them or may depart to some other ordinari better accommod to their tast as we do not disdain to borrow wit or wisdom from ani man who is capabl of lend us either we have condescend to take a hint from these honest victual and shall prefix not onli a gener bill of fare to our whole entertain but shall likewis give the reader particular bill to everi cours which is to be serv up in thi and the ensu volum the provis then which we have here made is no other than human natur nor do i fear that my sensibl reader though most luxuri in hi tast will start cavil or be offend becaus i have name but one articl the tortois as the alderman of bristol well learn in eat know by much experi besid the delici calibash and calipe contain mani differ kind of food nor can the learn reader be ignor that in human natur though here collect under one gener name is such prodigi varieti that a cook will have sooner gone through all the sever speci of anim and veget food in the world than an author will be abl to exhaust so extens a subject an object may perhap be apprehend from the more delic that thi dish is too common and vulgar for what els is the subject of all romanc novel play and poem with which the stall abound mani exquisit viand might be reject by the epicur if it wa a suffici caus for hi contemn of them as common and vulgar that someth wa to be found in the most paultri alley under the same name in realiti true natur is as difficult to be met with in author as the bayonn ham or bologna sausag is to be found in the shop but the whole to continu the same metaphor consist in the cookeri of the author for as mr pope tell us true wit is natur to advantag dress what often wa thought but never so well express the same anim which ha the honor to have some part of hi flesh eaten at the tabl of a duke may perhap be degrad in anoth part and some of hi limb gibbet as it were in the vilest stall in town where then lie the differ between the food of the nobleman and the porter if both were at dinner on the same ox or calf but in the season the dress the garnish and the set forth henc the one provok and incit the most languid appetit and the other turn and pall that which is the sharpest and keenest in like manner the excel of the mental entertain consist less in the subject than in the author skill in dress it up how pleas therefor will the reader be to find that we have in the follow work adher close to one of the highest principl of the best cook which the present age or perhap that of heliogabalu ha produc thi great man as is well known to all polit lover of eat begin at first by set plain thing befor hi hungri guest rise afterward by degre as their stomach may be suppos to decreas to the veri quintess of sauc and spice in like manner we shall repres human natur at first to the keen appetit of our reader in that more plain and simpl manner in which it is found in the countri and shall hereaft hash and ragoo it with all the high french and italian season of affect and vice which court and citi afford by these mean we doubt not but our reader may be render desir to read on for ever as the great person just abovement is suppos to have made some person eat have premis thu much we will now detain those who like our bill of fare no longer from our diet and shall proceed directli to serv up the first cours of our histori for their entertain chap ii a short descript of squir allworthi and a fuller account of miss bridget allworthi hi sister in that part of the western divis of thi kingdom which is commonli call somersetshir ther late live and perhap live still a gentleman whose name wa allworthi and who might well be call the favorit of both natur and fortun for both of these seem to have contend which should bless and enrich him most in thi content natur may seem to some to have come off victori as she bestow on him mani gift while fortun had onli one gift in her power but in pour forth thi she wa so veri profus that other perhap may think thi singl endow to have been more than equival to all the variou bless which he enjoy from natur from the former of these he deriv an agreeabl person a sound constitut a solid understand and a benevol heart by the latter he wa decre to the inherit of one of the largest estat in the counti thi gentleman had in hi youth marri a veri worthi and beauti woman of whom he had been extrem fond by her he had three children all of whom die in their infanc he had likewis had the misfortun of buri thi belov wife herself about five year befor the time in which thi histori choos to set out thi loss howev great he bore like a man of sens and constanc though it must be confess he would often talk a littl whimsic on thi head for he sometim said he look on himself still as marri and consid hi wife as onli gone a littl befor him a journey which he should most certainli sooner or later take after her and that he had not the least doubt of meet her again in a place where he should never part with her more sentiment for which hi sens wa arraign by one part of hi neighbor hi religion by a second and hi sincer by a third he now live for the most part retir in the countri with one sister for whom he had a veri tender affect thi ladi wa now somewhat past the age of an era at which in the opinion of the malici the titl of old maid may with no improprieti be assum she wa of that speci of women whom you rather commend for good qualiti than beauti and who are gener call by their own sex veri good sort of women as good a sort of woman madam as you would wish to know inde she wa so far from regret want of beauti that she never mention that perfect if it can be call one without contempt and would often thank god she wa not as handsom as miss such a one whom perhap beauti had led into error which she might have otherwis avoid miss bridget allworthi for that wa the name of thi ladi veri rightli conceiv the charm of person in a woman to be no better than snare for herself as well as for other and yet so discreet wa she in her conduct that her prudenc wa as much on the guard as if she had had all the snare to apprehend which were ever laid for her whole sex inde i have observ though it may seem unaccount to the reader that thi guard of prudenc like the train band is alway readiest to go on duti where there is the least danger it often base and cowardli desert those paragon for whom the men are all wish sigh die and spread everi net in their power and constantli attend at the heel of that higher order of women for whom the other sex have a more distant and aw respect and whom from despair i suppos of success they never ventur to attack reader i think proper befor we proceed ani farther togeth to acquaint thee that i intend to digress through thi whole histori as often as i see occas of which i am myself a better judg than ani piti critic whatev and here i must desir all those critic to mind their own busi and not to intermeddl with affair or work which no way concern them for till they produc the author by which they are constitut judg i shall plead to their jurisdict chap iii an odd accid which befel mr allworthi at hi return home the decent behavior of mr deborah wilkin with some proper animadvers on bastard i have told my reader in the preced chapter that mr allworthi inherit a larg fortun that he had a good heart and no famili henc doubtless it will be conclud by mani that he live like an honest man owe no one a shill took noth but what wa hi own kept a good hous entertain hi neighbor with a hearti welcom at hi tabl and wa charit to the poor i e to those who had rather beg than work by give them the offal from it that he die immens rich and built an hospit and true it is that he did mani of these thing but had he done noth more i should have left him to have record hi own merit on some fair freeston over the door of that hospit matter of a much more extraordinari kind are to be the subject of thi histori or i should grossli mispend my time in write so volumin a work and you my sagaci friend might with equal profit and pleasur travel through some page which certain droll author have been faceti pleas to call the histori of england mr allworthi had been absent a full quarter of a year in london on some veri particular busi though i know not what it wa but judg of it import by it have detain him so long from home whenc he had not been absent a month at a time dure the space of mani year he came to hi hous veri late in the even and after a short supper with hi sister retir much fatigu to hi chamber here have spent some minut on hi knee a custom which he never broke through on ani account he wa prepar to step into bed when upon open the cloth to hi great surpris he beheld an infant wrap up in some coars linen in a sweet and profound sleep between hi sheet he stood some time lost in astonish at thi sight but as goodnatur wa alway the ascend in hi mind he soon began to be touch with sentiment of compass for the littl wretch befor him he then rang hi bell and order an elderli woman servant to rise immedi and come to him and in the mean time wa so eager in contempl the beauti of innoc appear in those live color with which infanc and sleep alway display it that hi thought were too much engag to reflect that he wa in hi shirt when the matron came in she had inde given her master suffici time to dress himself for out of respect to him and regard to decenc she had spent mani minut in adjust her hair at the lookingglass notwithstand all the hurri in which she had been summon by the servant and though her master for ought she knew lay expir in an apoplexi or in some other fit it will not be wonder at that a creatur who had so strict a regard to decenc in her own person should be shock at the least deviat from it in anoth she therefor no sooner open the door and saw her master stand by the bedsid in hi shirt with a candl in hi hand than she start back in a most terribl fright and might perhap have swoon away had he not now recollect hi be undrest and put an end to her terror by desir her to stay without the door till he had thrown some cloth over hi back and wa becom incap of shock the pure eye of mr deborah wilkin who though in the d year of her age vow she had never beheld a man without hi coat sneerer and profan wit may perhap laugh at her first fright yet my graver reader when he consid the time of night the summon from her bed and the situat in which she found her master will highli justifi and applaud her conduct unless the prudenc which must be suppos to attend maiden at that period of life at which mr deborah had arriv should a littl lessen hi admir when mr deborah return into the room and wa acquaint by her master with the find the littl infant her constern wa rather greater than hi had been nor could she refrain from cri out with great horror of accent as well as look my good sir what is to be done mr allworthi answer she must take care of the child that even and in the morn he would give order to provid it a nurs ye sir say she and i hope your worship will send out your warrant to take up the hussi it mother for she must be one of the neighborhood and i should be glad to see her commit to bridewel and whip at the cart tail inde such wick slut can not be two sever punish i will warrant it is not her first by her impud in lay it to your worship in lay it to me deborah answer allworthi i can not think she ha ani such design i suppos she ha onli taken thi method to provid for her child and truli i am glad she ha not done wors i dont know what is wors cri deborah than for such wick strumpet to lay their sin at honest men door and though your worship know your own innoc yet the world is censori and it ha been mani an honest man hap to pass for the father of children he never begot and if your worship should provid for the child it may make the peopl the apter to believ besid whi should your worship provid for what the parish is oblig to maintain for my own part if it wa an honest man child inde but for my own part it goe against me to touch those misbegotton wretch whom i dont look upon as my fellow creatur faugh how it stink it doe not smell like a christian if i might be so bold to give my advic i would have it put in a basket and sent out and laid at the churchwarden door it is a good night onli a littl raini and windi and if it wa well wrap up and put in a warm basket it is two to one but it live till it is found in the morn but if it should not we have discharg our duti in take proper care of it and it is perhap better for such creatur to die in a state of innoc than to grow up and imit their mother for noth better can be expect of them there were some stroke in thi speech which perhap would have offend mr allworthi had he strictli attend to it but he had now got one of hi finger into the infant hand which by it gentl pressur seem to implor hi assist had certainli outplead the eloqu of mr deborah had it been ten time greater than it wa he now gave mr deborah posit order to take the child to her own bed and to call up a maidserv to provid it pap and other thing against it wake he likewis order that proper cloth should be procur for it earli in the morn and that it should be brought to himself as soon as he wa stir such wa the discern of mr wilkin and such the respect she bore her master under whom she enjoy a most excel place that her scrupl gave way to hi peremptori command and she took the child under her arm without ani appar disgust at the illeg of it birth and declar it wa a sweet littl infant walk off with it to her own chamber allworthi here betook himself to those pleas slumber which a heart that hunger after good is apt to enjoy when thoroughli satisfi as these are possibl sweeter than what are occas by ani other hearti meal i should take more pain to display them to the reader if i knew ani air to recommend him to for the procur such an appetit chap iv the reader neck brought into danger by a descript hi escap and the great condescens of miss bridget allworthi the gothic style of build could produc noth nobler than mr allworthi hous there wa an air of grandeur in it that struck you with awe and rival the beauti of the best grecian architectur and it wa as commodi within as vener without it stood on the southeast side of a hill but nearer the bottom than the top of it so as to be shelter from the northeast by a grove of old oak which rose abov it in a gradual ascent of near half a mile and yet high enough to enjoy a most charm prospect of the valley beneath in the midst of the grove wa a fine lawn slope down toward the hous near the summit of which rose a plenti spring gush out of a rock cover with fir and form a constant cascad of about thirti foot not carri down a regular flight of step but tumbl in a natur fall over the broken and mossi stone till it came to the bottom of the rock then run off in a pebli channel that with mani lesser fall wind along till it fell into a lake at the foot of the hill about a quarter of a mile below the hous on the south side and which wa seen from everi room in the front out of thi lake which fill the center of a beauti plain embellish with group of beech and elm and fed with sheep issu a river that for sever mile wa seen to meander through an amaz varieti of meadow and wood till it empti itself into the sea with a larg arm of which and an island beyond it the prospect wa close on the right of thi valley open anoth of less extent adorn with sever villag and termin by one of the tower of an old ruin abbey grown over with ivi and part of the front which remain still entir the left hand scene present the view of a fine park compos of veri unequ ground and agreeabl vari with all the divers that hill lawn wood and water laid out with admir tast but owe less to art than to natur could give beyond thi the countri gradual rose into a ridg of wild mountain the top of which were abov the cloud it wa now the middl of may and the morn wa remark seren when mr allworthi walk forth on the terrac where the dawn open everi minut that love prospect we have befor describ to hi eye and now have sent forth stream of light which ascend the blue firmament befor him as harbing preced hi pomp in the full blaze of hi majesti rose the sun than which one object alon in thi lower creation could be more gloriou and that mr allworthi himself present a human be replet with benevol medit in what manner he might render himself most accept to hi creator by do most good to hi creatur reader take care i have unadvisedli led thee to the top of as high a hill as mr allworthi and how to get thee down without break thi neck i do not well know howev let us even ventur to slide down togeth for miss bridget ring her bell and mr allworthi is summon to breakfast where i must attend and if you pleas shall be glad of your compani the usual compliment have past between mr allworthi and miss bridget and the tea be pour out he summon mr wilkin and told hi sister he had a present for her for which she thank him imagin i suppos it had been a gown or some ornament for her person inde he veri often made her such present and she in complais to him spent much time in adorn herself i say in complais to him becaus she alway express the greatest contempt for dress and for those ladi who made it their studi but if such wa her expect how wa she disappoint when mr wilkin accord to the order she had receiv from her master produc the littl infant great surpris as ha been observ are apt to be silent and so wa miss bridget till her brother began and told her the whole stori which as the reader know alreadi we shall not repeat miss bridget had alway express so great a regard for what the ladi are pleas to call virtu and had herself maintain such a

truth she wa alway readi to oblig her brother and veri seldom if ever contradict hi sentiment she would inde sometim make a few observ as that men were headstrong and must have their own way and would

the child appoint a veri good room in the hous for hi nurseri her order were inde so liber that had it been a child of her own she could not have exceed them but lest the virtuou reader may condemn her for show too great regard to a baseborn infant to which all chariti is condemn by law as irreligi we think proper to observ that she conclud the whole with say sinc it wa her brother whim to adopt the littl brat she suppos littl master must be treat with great tender for her part she could not help think it wa an encourag to vice but that she knew too much of the obstinaci of mankind to oppos

of the design with which mr wilkin wa now come toward them but as the great beauti of the simil may possibl sleep these hundr year till some futur comment shall take thi work in hand i think proper to lend the reader a littl assist in thi place it is my intent therefor to signifi that as it is the natur of a kite to devour littl bird so is it the natur of such person as mr wilkin to insult and tyrann over littl peopl thi be inde the mean which they use to recompens to themselv their extrem servil and condescens to their superior for noth can be more reason than that slave and flatter should exact the same tax on all below them which they themselv pay to all abov them whenev mr deborah had had occas to exert ani extraordinari condescens to mr bridget and by that mean had a littl sower her natur disposit it wa usual with her to walk forth among these peopl in order to refin her temper by vent and as it were purg off all ill humor on which account she wa by no mean a welcom visit to say the truth she wa univers hate and dread by them all on her arriv in thi place she went immedi to the habit of an elderli matron to whom as thi matron had the good fortun to resembl herself in the comeli of her person as well as in her age she had gener been more favor than to ani of the rest to thi woman she impart what had happen and the design upon which she wa come thither that morn these two began present to scrutin the charact of the sever young girl who live in ani of those hous and at last fix their strongest suspicion on one jenni jone who they both agre wa the likeliest person to have commit thi fact thi jenni jone wa no veri come girl either in her face or person but natur had somewhat compens the want of beauti with what is gener more esteem by those ladi whose judgment is arriv at year of perfect matur for she had given her a veri uncommon share of understand thi gift jenni had a good deal improv by erudit she had live sever year a servant with a schoolmast who discov a great quick of part in the girl and an extraordinari desir of learn for everi leisur hour she wa alway found read in the book of the scholar had the goodnatur or folli which the reader pleas to call it to instruct her so far that she obtain a veri compet skill in the latin languag and wa perhap as good a scholar as most of the young men of qualiti of the age thi advantag howev like most other of an extraordinari kind wa attend with some small inconveni for as it is not to be wonder at that a young woman so well accomplish should have littl relish for the societi of those whom fortun had made her equal but whom educ had render so much her inferior so is it matter of no greater astonish that thi superior in jenni togeth with that behavior which is it certain consequ should produc among the other some littl envi and ill will toward her and these had perhap secretli burnt in the bosom of her neighbor ever sinc her return from her servic their envi did not howev display itself openli till poor jenni to the surpris of everi bodi and to the vexat of all the young women in these part had publicli shone forth on a sunday in a new silk gown with a lace cap and other proper appendag to these the flame which had befor lain in embrio now burst forth jenni had by her learn increas her own pride which none of her neighbor were kind enough to feed with the honor she seem to demand and now instead of respect and ador she gain noth but hatr and abus by her fineri the whole parish declar she could not come honestli by such thing and parent instead of wish their daughter the same felicit themselv that their children had them not henc perhap it wa that the good woman first mention the name of thi poor girl to mr wilkin but there wa anoth circumst that confirm the latter in her suspicion for jenni had late been often at mr allworthi hous she had offici as nurs to miss bridget in a violent fit of ill and had sat up mani night with that ladi besid which she had been seen there the veri day befor mr allworthi return by mr wilkin herself though that sagaci person had not at first conceiv ani suspicion of her on that account for as she herself said she had alway esteem jenni as a veri sober girl though inde she knew veri littl of her and had rather suspect some of those wanton trollop who gave themselv air becaus forsooth they thought themselv handsom jenni wa now summon to appear in person befor mr deborah which she immedi did when mr deborah put on the graviti of a judg with somewhat more than hi auster began an orat with the word you audaci strumpet in which she proceed rather to pass sentenc on the prisouer than to accus her though mr deborah wa fulli satisfi of the guilt of jenni for the reason abov shown it is possibl mr allworthi might have requir some stronger evid to have convict her but she save her accus ani such troubl by freeli confess the whole fact with which she wa charg thi confess though deliv rather in term of contrit as it appear did not at all mollifi mr deborah who now pronounc a second judgment against her in more opprobri languag than befor nor had it ani better success with the bystand who were now grown veri numer mani of them cri out they thought what madam silk gown would end in other speak sarcast of her learn not a singl femal wa present but found some mean of express her abhorr of poor jenni who bore all veri patient except the malic of one woman who reflect upon her person and toss upon her nose said the man must have a good stomach who would give silk gown for such sort of trumperi jenni repli to thi with a bitter which might have surpris a judici person who had observ the tranquil with which she bore all the affront to her chastiti but her patienc wa tire out for thi is a virtu which is veri apt to be fatigu by exercis mr deborah have succeed beyond her hope in her enquiri return with much triumph and at the appoint hour made a faith report to mr allworthi who wa much surpris at the relat for he had heard of the extraordinari part and improv of thi girl whom he intend to have given in marriag togeth with a small live to a neighbor curat hi concern therefor upon thi occas wa at least equal to the satisfact which appear in mr deborah and to mani reader may seem much more reason mr bridget bless herself and said for her part she should never hereaft entertain a good opinion of ani woman for jenni had likewis had the happi of be much in her good grace the prudent housekeep wa again dispatch to bring the unhappi culprit befor mr allworthi in order not as it wa hope by some and expect by all to be sent to the hous of correct but to receiv wholesom admonit and reproof which those who relish that kind of instruct write may perus in the next chapter chap vii contain such grave matter that the reader can not laugh onc through the whole chapter unless peradventur he should laugh at the author when jenni appear mr allworthi took her into hi studi and spoke to her as follow you know child it is in my power as a magistr to punish you veri rigor for what you have done and you will perhap be the more apt to fear i should execut that power becaus you have in a manner laid your sin at my door but perhap thi is one reason which ha determin me to act in a milder manner with you for as no privat resent should ever influenc a magistr i will be so far from consid your have deposit the infant in my hous as an aggav of your offens that i will suppos in your favor thi to have proceed from a natur affect to your child sinc you might have some hope to see it thu better provid for than wa in the power of yourself or it wick father to provid for it i should inde have been highli offend with you had you expos the littl wretch in the manner of some inhuman mother who seem no less to have abandon their human than to have part with their chastiti it is the other part of your offens therefor upon which i intend to admonish you i mean the violat of your chastiti a crime howev lightli treat it may be by debauch person veri heinou in itself and veri dread in it consequ the heinou natur of thi offens must be appar to everi christian inasmuch as it is commit in the defianc of the law of our religion and of the express command of him who found that religion and here it consequ may well be argu to be dread for what can be more so than to incur the divin displeasur by the breach of the divin command and that in an instanc against which the highest vengeanc is specif denounc but these thing though too littl i am afraid regard are so plain that mankind howev they may want to be remind can never need inform on thi head a hint therefor to awaken your sens of thi matter shall suffic for i would inspir you with repent and not drive you to desper there are other consequ not inde so dread or replet with horror as thi and yet such as if attent consid must one would think deter all of your sex at least from the commiss of thi crime for by it you are render infam and driven like leper of old out of societi at least from the societi of all but wick and reprob person for no other will associ with you if you have fortun you are herebi render incap of enjoy them if you have none you are disabl from acquir ani nay almost of procur your susten for no person of charact will receiv you into their hous thu you are often driven by necess itself into a state of shame and miseri which unavoid end in the destruct of both bodi and soul can ani pleasur compens these evil can ani temptat have sophistri and delus strong enough to persuad you to so simpl a bargain or can ani carnal appetit so overpow your reason or so total lay it asleep as to prevent your fli with affright and terror from a crime which carri such punish alway with it how base and mean must that woman be how void of that digniti of mind and decent pride without which we are not worthi the name of human creatur who can bear to level herself with the lowest anim and to sacrific all that is great and nobl in her all her heavenli part to an appetit which she ha in common with the vilest branch of the creation for no woman sure will plead the passion of love for an excus thi would be to own herself the mere tool and bubbl of the man love howev barbar we may corrupt and pervert it mean as it is a laudabl is a ration passion and can never be violent but when reciproc for though the scriptur bid us love our enemi it mean not with that servent love which we natur bear toward our friend much less that we should sacrific to them our live and what ought to be dearer to us our innoc now in what light but in that of an enemi can a reason woman regard the man who solicit her to entail on herself all the miseri i have abov describ and who would purchas to himself a short trivial contempt pleasur so greatli at her expens for by the law of custom the whole shame with all it dread consequ fall entir upon her can love which alway seek the good of it object attempt to betray a woman into a bargain where she is so greatli to be the loser if such corrupt therefor should have the impud to pretend to real affect for her ought not the woman to regard him not onli as an enemi but as the worst of all enemi a fals design treacher pretend friend who intend not onli to debauch her bodi but her understand at the same time here jenni express great concern allworthi paus a moment and then proceed i have talk thu to you child not to insult you for what is past and irrevoc but to caution and strengthen you for the futur nor should i have taken thi troubl but from some opinion of your good sens notwithstand the dread slip you have made and from some hope of your hearti repent which are found on the open and sincer of your confess if these do not deceiv me i will take care to convey you from thi scene of your shame where you shall by be unknown avoid the punish which as i have said is allot to your crime in thi world and i hope by repent you will avoid the much heavier sentenc denounc against it in the other be a good girl the rest of your day and want shall be no motiv to your go astray and believ me there is more pleasur even in thi world in an innoc and virtuou life than in one debauch and viciou as to your child let no thought concern it molest you i will provid for it in a better manner than you can ever hope and now noth remain but that you inform me who wa the wick man that seduc you for my anger against him will be much greater than you have experienc upon thi occas jenni now lift her eye from the ground and with a modest look and decent voic thu began to know you sir and not love your good would be an argument of total want of sens or good in ani one in me it would amount to the highest ingratitud not to feel in the most sensibl manner the great degre of good you have been pleas to exert on thi occas as to my concern for what is past i know you will spare my blush the repetit my futur conduct will much better declar my sentiment than ani profess i can now make i beg leav to assur you sir that i take your advic much kinder than your gener offer with which you conclud it for as you are pleas to say sir it is an instanc of your opinion of my u understand here her tear flow apac she stop a few moment and then proceed thu inde sir your kind overcom me but i will endeavor to deserv thi good opinion for if i have the understand you are so kindli pleas to allow me such advic can not be thrown away upon me i thank you sir heartili for your intend kind to my poor helpless child he is innoc and i hope will live to be grate for all the favor you shall show him but now sir i must on my knee entreat you not to persist in ask me to declar the father of my infant i promis you faith you shall one day know but i am under the most solemn tie and engag of honor as well as the most religi vow and protest to conceal hi name at thi time and i know you too well to think you would desir i should sacrific either my honor or my religion mr allworthi whom the least mention of these sacr word wa suffici to stagger hesit a moment befor he repli and then told her she had done wrong to enter into such engag to a villain but sinc she had he could not insist on her break them he said it wa not from a motiv of vain curios he had enquir but in order to punish the fellow at least that he might not ignorantli confer favor on the undeserv as to these point jenni satisfi him by the most solemn assur that the man wa entir out of hi reach and wa neither subject to hi power nor in ani probabl of becom an object of hi good the ingenu of thi behavior had gain jenni so much credit with thi worthi man that he easili believ what she told him for as she had disdain to excus herself by a lie and had azard hi farther displeasur in her present situat rather than she would forfeit her honor or integr by betray anoth he had but littl apprehens that she would be guilti of falsehood toward himself he therefor dismiss her with assur that he would veri soon remov her out of the reach of that obloquy she had incur conclud with some addit document in which he recommend repent say consid child there is one still to reconcil yourself to whose favor is of much greater import to you than mine chap viii a dialogu between mesdam bridget and deborah contain more amus but less instruct than the former when mr allworthi had retir to hi studi with jenni jone as ha been seen mr bridget with the good housekeep had betaken themselv to a post next adjoin to the said studi whenc through the convey of a keyhol they suck in at their ear the instruct lectur deliv by mr allworthi togeth with the answer of jenni and inde everi other particular which pass in the last chapter thi hole in her brother studi door wa inde as well known to mr bridget and had been as frequent appli to by her as the famou hole in the wall wa by thisb of old thi serv to mani good purpos for by such mean mr bridget becam often acquaint with her brother inclin without give him the troubl of repeat them to her it is true some inconveni attend thi intercours and she had sometim reason to cri out with thisb in shakespear o wick wick wall for as mr allworthi wa a justic of peac certain thing occur in examin concern the bastard and such like which are apt to give great offens to the chast ear of virgin especi when they approach the age of forti as wa the case of mr bridget howev she had on such occas the advantag of conceal her blush from the eye of men and de non apparentibu et non existentibu eadem est ratio in english when a woman is not seen to blush she doe not blush at all both the good women kept strict silenc dur the whole scene between mr allworthi and the girl but as soon as it wa end and that gentleman wa out of hear mr deborah could not help exclaim against the clemenc of her master and especi against hi suffer her to conceal the father of the child which she swore she would have out of her befor the sun set at these word mr bridget discompos her featur with a smile a thing veri unusu to her not that i would have my reader imagin that thi wa one of those wanton smile which homer would have you conceiv came from venu when he call her the laughterlov goddess nor wa it one of those smile which ladi seraphina shoot from the stagebox and which venu would quit her immort to be abl to equal no thi wa rather one of those smile which might be suppos to have come from the dimpl cheeck of the august tysiphon or from one of the miss her sister with such a smile then and with a voic sweet as the even breez of borea in the pleasant month of novemb mr bridget gentli reprov the curios of mr deborah a vice with which it seem the latter wa too much taint and which the former inveigh against with great bitter ad that among all her fault she thank heaven her enemi could not accus her of pri into the affair of other peopl she then proceed to commend the honor and spirit with which jenni had act she said she could not help agre with her brother that there wa some merit in the sincer of her confess and in her integr to her lover that she had alway thought her a veri good girl and doubt not but she had been seduc by some rascal who had been infinit more to blame than herself and veri probabl had prevail with her by a promis of marriag or some other treacher proceed thi behavior of mr bridget greatli surpris mr deborah for thi wellbr woman seldom open her lip either to her master or hi sister till she had first sound their inclin with which her sentiment were alway strictli conson here howev she thought she might have launch forth with safeti and the sagaci reader will not perhap accus her of want of suffici forecast in so do but will rather admir with what wonder celer she tack about when she found herself steer a wrong cours nay madam said thi abl woman and truli great politician i must own i can not help admir the girl spirit as well as your ladyship and as your ladyship say if she wa deceiv by some wick man the poor wretch is to be piti and to be sure as your ladyship say the girl ha alway appear like a good honest plain girl and not vain of her face forsooth as some wanton hussey in the neighborhood are you say true deborah said mr bridget if the girl had been one of those vain trollop of which we have too mani in the parish i should have condemn my brother for hi leniti toward her i saw two farmer daughter at church the other day with bare neck i protest they shock me if wench will hang out lure for fellow it is no matter what they suffer i detest such creatur and it would be much better for them that their face had been seam with the smallpox but i must confess i never saw ani of thi wanton behavior in poor jenni some art villain i am convinc ha betray nay perhap forc her and i piti the poor wretch with all my heart mr deborah approv all these sentiment and the dialogu conclud with a gener and bitter invect against beauti and with mani compassion consider for all honest plain girl who are delud by the wick art of deceit men chap ix contain matter which will surpris the reader jenni return home well pleas with the recept she had met with from mr allworthi whose indulg to her she industr made public partli perhap as a sacrific to her own pride and partli from the more prudent motiv of reconcil her neighbor to her and silenc their clamour but though thi latter view if she inde had it may appear reason enough yet the event did not answer her expect for when she wa conven befor the justic and it wa univers apprehend that the hous of correct would have been her fate though some of the young women cri out it wa good enough for her and divert themselv with the thought of her beat hemp in a silk gown yet there were mani other who began to piti her condit but when it wa known in what manner mr allworthi had behav the tide turn against her one said ill assur you madam ha had good luck a second cri see what it is to be a favorit a third ay thi come of her learn everi person made some malici comment or other on the occas and reflect on the partial of the justic the behavior of these peopl may appear impolit and ungrat to the reader who consid the power and the benevol of mr allworthi but as to hi power he never use it and as to hi benevol he exert so much that he had therebi disoblig all hi neighbor for it is a secret well known to great men that by confer an oblig they do not alway procur a friend but are certain of creat mani enemi jenni wa howev by the care and good of mr allworthi soon remov out of the reach of reproach when malic be no longer abl to vent it rage on her began to seek anoth object of it bitter and thi wa no less than mr allworthi himself for a whisper soon went abroad that he himself wa the father of the foundl child thi supposit so well reconcil hi conduct to the gener opinion that it met with univers assent and the outeri against hi leniti soon began to take anoth turn and wa chang into an invect against hi cruelti to the poor girl veri grave and good women exclaim against men who begot children and then disown them nor were there want some who after the departur of jenni insinu that she wa spirit away with a design too black to be mention and who gave frequent hint that a legal inquiri ought to be made into the whole matter and that some peopl should be forc to produc the girl these calumni might have probabl produc ill consequ at the least might have occas some troubl to a person of a more doubt and suspici charact than mr allworthi wa bless with but in hi case they had no such effect and be heartili despis by him they serv onli to afford an innoc amus to the good gossip of the neighborhood but as we can not possibl divin what complexion our reader may be of and as it will be some time befor he will hear ani more of jenni we think proper to give him a veri earli intim that mr allworthi wa and will hereaft appear to be absolut innoc of ani crimin intent whatev he had inde commit no other than an error in polit by temper justic with merci and by refus to gratifi the good natur disposit of the mob whenev thi word occur in our write it intend person without virtu or sens in all station and mani of the highest rank are often meant by it with an object for their compass to work on in the person of poor jenni whom in order to piti they desir to have seen sacrif to ruin and infami by a shame correct in bridewel so far from compli with thi their inclin by which all hope of reform would have been abolish and even the gate shut against her if her own inclin should ever hereaft lead her to choos the road of virtu mr allworhti rather chose to encourag the girl to return thither by the onli possibl mean for too true i am afraid it is that mani women have becom abandon and have sunk to the last degre of vice by be unabl to retriev the first slip thi will be i am afraid alway the case while they remain among their former acquaint it wa therefor wise done by mr allworthi to remov jenni to a place where she might enjoy the pleasur of reput after have tast the ill consequ of lose it to thi place therefor wherev it wa we will wish her a good journey and for the present take leav of her and of the littl foundl her child have matter of much higher import to commun to the reader chap x the hospit of allworthi with a short sketch of the charact of two brother a doctor and a captain who were entertain by that gentleman neither mr allworthi hous nor hi heart were shut against ani part of mankind but they were both more particularli open to men of merit to say the truth thi wa the onli hous in the kingdom
