their natur and of the manag of such of them as are import enough to requir a particular discuss befor final dismiss thi subject i think it incumb on me to make some observ concern the proper use of figur languag in gener these inde i have in part alreadi anticip but as great error are often commit in thi part of style especi by young writer it may be of use that i bring togeth under one view the most materi direct on thi head i begin with repeat an observ formerli made that neither all the beauti nor even the chief beauti of composit depend upon trope and figur some of the most sublim and most pathet passag of the most admir author both in prose and poetri are express in the most simpl style without ani figur at all instanc of which i have befor given on the other hand a composit may abound with these studi ornament the languag may be art splendid and highli figur and yet the composit be on the whole frigid and unaffect not to speak of sentiment and thought which constitut the real and last merit of ani work if the style be stiff and affect if it be defici in perspicu or precis or in eas and neat all the figur that can be employ will never render it agreeabl they may dazzl a vulgar but will never pleas a judici eye in the second place figur in order to be beauti must alway rise natur from the subject i have shown that all of them are the languag either of imagin or of passion some of them suggest by imagin when it is awaken and sprightli such as metaphor and comparison other by passion or more heat emot such as personif and apostroph of cours they are beauti then onli when they are prompt by fanci or by passion they must rise of their own accord they must flow from a mind warm by the object which it seek to describ we should never interrupt the cours of thought to cast about for figur if they be fought after coolli and fasten on as design ornament they will have a miser effect it is a veri erron idea which mani have of the ornament of style as if they were thing detach from the subject and that could be stuck to it like lace upon a coat thi is inde purpureu late qui splendeat unu aut alter assuitur pannu shred of purpl with broad luster shine sew on your poem franci ar poet and it is thi fals idea which ha often brought attent to the beauti of write into disreput wherea the real and proper ornament of style are wrought into the substanc of it they flow in the same stream with the current of thought a writer of geniu conceiv hi subject strongli hi imagin is fill and impress with it and pour itself forth in that figur languag which imagin natur speak he put on no emot which hi subject doe not rais in him he speak as he feel but hi style will be beauti becaus hi feel are live on occas when fanci is languid or find noth to rous it we should never attempt to hunt for figur we then work as it is said invita minerva suppos figur invent they will have the appear of be forc and in thi case they had much better be want in the third place even when imagin prompt and the subject natur give rise to figur they must howev not be employ too frequent in all beauti simplex munditii is a capit qualiti noth derog more from the weight and digniti of ani composit than too great attent to ornament when the ornament cost labor that labor alway appear though they should cost us none still the reader or hearer may be surfeit with them and when they come too thick they give the impress of a light and frothi geniu that evapor in show rather than bring forth what is solid the direct of the ancient critic on thi head are full of good sens and deserv care attent voluptatibu maximi say cicero de orat l iii fastidium finitimum est in rebu omnibu quo hoc minu in oration miremur in qua vel ex poeti vel oratoribu possumu judicar concinnam

nolo in all human thing disgust border so nearli on the most live pleasur that we need not be surpris to find thi hold in eloqu from read either poet or orat we may easili satisfi ourselv that neither a poem nor an orat which without intermiss is showi and sparkl can pleas us long wherefor though we may wish for the frequent prais of have express ourselv well and properli we should not covet repeat applaus for be bright and splendid to the same purpos are the excel direct with which quinctilian conclud hi discours concern figur l ix c ego illud de ii figuri quae vere fiunt adjiciam brevit sicut ornant orationem opportuna posita ita ineptissima ess cum immodic petuntur sunt qui neglecto rerum ponder et viribu sententiarum si vel inania verba in ho modo depravarunt summo se judic artific

that as they beautifi a composit when they are season introduc so they deform it greatli if too frequent sought after there are some who neglect strength of sentiment and weight of matter if they can onli forc their empti word into a figur style imagin themselv great writer and therefor continu string togeth such ornament which is just as ridicul where there is no sentiment to support them as to contriv gestur and dress for what want a bodi even those figur which a subject admit must not come too thick we must begin with consid what the occas the time and the person who speak render proper for the object aim at by the greater part of these figur is entertain but when the subject becom deepli seriou and strong passion are to be move who can bear the orat who in affect languag and balanc phrase endeavor to express wrath commiser or earnest entreati on all such occas a solicit attent to word weaken passion and when so much art is shown there is suspect to be littl sincer after these judici and use observ i have no more to add on thi subject except thi admonit in the fourth place that without a geniu for figur languag none should attempt it imagin is a power not to be acquir it must be deriv from natur it redund we may prune it deviat we may correct it sphere we may enlarg but the faculti itself we can not creat and all effort toward a metaphor ornament style if we are destitut of the proper geniu for it will prove awkward and disgust let us satisfi ourselv howev by consid that without thi talent or at least with a veri small measur of it we may both write and speak to advantag good sens clear idea perspicu of languag and proper arrang of word and thought will alway command attent these are inde the foundat of all solid merit both in speak and write mani subject requir noth more and those which admit of ornament admit it onli as a secondari requisit to studi and to know our own geniu well to follow natur to seek to improv but not to forc it are direct which can not be too often given to those who desir to excel in the liber art when i enter on the consider of style i observ that word be the copi of our idea there must alway be a veri intim connect between the manner in which everi writer employ word and hi manner of think and that from the peculiar of thought and express which belong to him there is a certain charact imprint on hi style which may be denomin hi manner commonli express by such gener term as strong weak dri simpl affect or the like these distinct carri in gener some refer to an author manner of think but refer chiefli to hi mode of express they aris from the whole tenor of hi languag and comprehend the effect produc by all those part of style which we have alreadi consid the choic which he make of singl word hi arrang of these in sentenc the degre of hi precis and hi embellish by mean of music cadenc figur or other art of speech of such gener charact of style therefor it remain now to speak as the result of those underpart of which i have hitherto treat that differ subject requir to be treat of in differ sort of style is a posit so obviou that i shall not stay to illustr it everi one see that treatis of philosophi for instanc ought not to be compos in the same style with orat everi one see also that differ part of the same composit requir a variat in the style and manner in a sermon for instanc or ani harangu the applic or peror admit more ornament and requir more warmth than the didact part but what i mean at present to remark is that amidst thi varieti we still expect to find in the composit of ani one man some degre of uniform or consist with himself in manner we expect to find some predomin charact of style impress on all hi write which shall be suit to and shall mark hi particular geniu and turn of mind the orat in livi differ much in style as they ought to do from the rest of hi histori the same is the case with those in tacitu yet both in livi orat and in those of tacitu we are abl clearli to trace the distinguish manner of each historian the magnific full of the one and the sententi concis of the other the lettr persan and lesprit de loix are the work of the same author they requir veri differ composit sure and accordingli they differ wide yet still we see the same hand wherev there is real and nativ geniu it give a determin to one kind of style rather than anoth where noth of thi appear where there is no mark nor peculiar charact in the composit of ani author we are apt to infer not without reason that he is a vulgar and trivial author who write from imit and not from the impuls of origin geniu as the most celebr painter are known by their hand so the best and most origin writer are known and distinguish throughout all their work by their style and peculiar manner thi will be found to hold almost without except the ancient critic attend to these gener charact of style which we are now to consid dionysiu of halicarnassu divid them into three kind and call them the auster the florid and the middl by the auster he mean a style distinguish for strength and firm with a neglect of smooth and ornament for exampl of which he give pindar and aeschylu among the poet and thucydid among the prose writer by the florid he mean as the name indic a style ornament flow and sweet rest more upon number and grace than strength he instanc hesiod sappho anacreon euripid and princip isocr the middl kind is the just mean between these and comprehend the beauti of both in which class he place homer and sophocl among the poet in prose herodotu demosthen plato and what seem strang aristotl thi must be a veri wide class inde which comprehend plato and aristotl under one articl as to style de composition verborum cap cicero and quinctilian make also a threefold divis of style though with respect to differ qualiti of it in which they are follow by most of the modern writer on rhetor the simplex tenu or subtl the grave or vehemen and the medium or temperatum genu dicendi but these divis and the illustr they give of them are so loos and gener that they can not advanc us much in our idea of style i shall endeavor to be a littl more particular in what i have to say on thi subject one of the first and most obviou distinct of the differ kind of style is what aris from an author spread out hi thought more or less thi distinct form what are call the diffus and the concis style a concis writer compress hi thought into the fewest possibl word he seek to employ none but such as are most express he lop off as redund everi express which doe not add someth materi to the sens ornament he doe not reject he may be live and figur but hi ornament is intend for the sake of forc rather than grace he never give you the same thought twice he place it in the light which appear to him the most strike but if you do not apprehend it well in that light you need not expect to find it in ani other hi sentenc are arrang with compact and strength rather than with cadenc and harmoni the utmost precis is studi in them and they are commonli design to suggest more to the reader imagin than they directli express a diffus writer unfold hi thought fulli he place it in a varieti of light and give the reader everi possibl assist for understand it complet he is not veri care to express it at first in it full strength becaus he is to repeat the impress and what he want in strength he propos to suppli by copious writer of thi charact gener love magnific and amplif their period natur run out into some length and have room for ornament of everi kind they admit it freeli each of these manner ha it peculiar advantag and each becom faulti when carri to the extrem the extrem of concis becom abrupt and obscur it is apt also to lead into a style too point and border on the epigrammat the extrem diffus becom weak and languid and tire the reader howev to one or other of these two manner a writer may lean accord as hi geniu prompt him and under the gener charact of a concis or of a more open and diffus style may possess much beauti in hi composit for illustr of these gener charact i can onli refer to the writer who are exampl of them it is not so much from detach passag such as i wa wont formerli to quot for instanc as from the current of an author style that we are to collect the idea of a form manner of write the two most remark exampl that i know of concis carri as far as proprieti will allow perhap in some case farther are tacitu the historian and the presid montesquieu in lesprit de loix aristotl too hold an emin rank among didact writer for hi breviti perhap no writer in the world wa ever so frugal of hi word as aristotl but thi frugal of express frequent darken hi mean of a beauti and magnific diffus cicero is beyond doubt the most illustri instanc that can be given addison also and sir william templ come in some degre under thi class in judg when it is proper to lean to the concis and when to the diffus manner we must be direct by the natur of the composit discours that are to be spoken requir a more copiou style than book that are to be read when the whole mean must be catch from the mouth of the speaker without the advantag which book afford of paus at pleasur and review what appear obscur great concis is alway to be avoid we should never presum too much on the quick of our hearer understand but our style ought to be such that the bulk of men can go along with us easili and without effort a flow copiou style therefor is requir in all public speaker guard at the same time against such a degre of diffus as render them languid and tiresom which will alway prove the case when they inculc too much and present the same thought under too mani differ view in written composit a certain degre of concis possess great advantag it is more live keep up attent make a brisker and stronger impress and gratifi the mind by suppli more exercis to a reader own thought a sentiment which express diffus will bare be admit to be just express concis will be admir as spirit descript when we want to have it vivid and anim should be in a concis strain thi is differ from the common opinion most person be readi to suppos that upon descript a writer may dwell more safe than upon other thing and that by a full and extend style it is render more rich and express i apprehend on the contrari that a diffus manner gener weaken it ani redund word or circumst encumb the fanci and make the object we present to it appear confus and indistinct accordingli the most masterli describ homer tacitu milton are almost alway concis in their descript they show us more of an object at one glanc than a feebl diffus writer can show by turn it round and round in a varieti of light the strength and vivac of descript whether in prose or poetri depend much more upon the happi choic of one or two strike circumst than upon the multipl of them address to the passion likewis ought to be in the concis rather than the diffus manner in these it is danger to be diffus becaus it is veri difficult to support proper warmth for ani length of time when we becom prolix we are alway in hazard of cool the reader the heart too and the fanci run fast and if onc we can put them in motion they suppli mani particular to greater advantag than an author can display them the case is differ when we address ourselv to the understand as in all matter of reason explic and instruct there i would prefer a more free and diffus manner when you are to strike the fanci or to move the heart be concis when you are to inform the understand which move more slowli and requir the assist of a guid it is better to be full histor narrat may be beauti either in a concis or diffus manner accord to the writer geniu livi and herodotu are diffus thucydid and sallust are succinct yet all of them agreeabl i observ that a diffus style inclin most to long period and a concis writer it is certain will often employ short sentenc it is not howev to be infer from thi that long or short sentenc are fulli characterist of the one or the other manner it is veri possibl for one to compos alway in short sentenc and to be withal extrem diffus if a small measur of sentiment be spread through mani of these sentenc seneca is a remark exampl by the short and quaint of hi sentenc he may appear at first view veri concis yet he is far from be so he transfigur the same thought into mani differ form he make it pass for a new one onli by give it a new turn so also most of the french writer compos in short sentenc though their style in gener is not concis commonli less so than the bulk of english writer whose sentenc are much longer a french author break down into two or three sentenc that portion of thought which an english author crowd into one the direct effect of short sentenc is to render the style brisk and live but not alway concis by the quick success impuls which they make on the mind they keep it awak and give to composit more of a spirit charact long period like lord clarendon are grave and state but like all grave thing they are in hazard of becom dull an intermixtur of both long and short one is requisit when we would support solemn togeth with vivac lean more to the one or the other accord as proprieti requir that the solemn or the sprightli should be predomin in our composit but of long and short sentenc i had occas formerli to treat under the head of the construct of period the nervou and the feebl are gener held to be charact of style of the same import with the concis and the diffus they do inde veri often coincid diffus writer have for the most part some degre of feebl and nervou writer will gener be inclin to a concis express thi howev doe not alway hold and there are instanc of writer who in the midst of a full and ampl style have maintain a great degre of strength livi is an exampl and in the english languag dr barrow barrow style ha mani fault it is unequ incorrect and redund but withal for forc and express uncommonli distinguish on everi subject he multipli word with an overflow copious but it is alway a torrent of strong idea and signific express which he pour forth inde the foundat of a nervou or a weak style are laid in an author manner of think if he conceiv an object strongli he will express it with energi but if he ha onli an indistinct view of hi subject if hi idea be loos and waver if hi geniu be such or at the time of hi write so carelessli exert that he ha no firm hold of the concept which he would commun to us the mark of thi will clearli appear in hi style sever unmean word and loos epithet will be found hi express will be vagu and gener hi arrang indistinct and feebl we shall conceiv somewhat of hi mean but our concept will be faint wherea a nervou writer whether he employ an extend or a concis style give us alway a strong impress of hi mean hi mind is full of hi subject and hi word are all express everi phrase and everi figur which he use tend to render the pictur which he would set befor us more live and complet i observ under the head of diffus and concis style that an author might lean either to the one or to the other and yet be beauti thi is not the case with respect to the nervou and the feebl everi author in everi composit ought to studi to express himself with some strength and in proport as he approach to the feebl he becom a bad writer in all kind of write howev the same degre of strength is not demand but the more grave and weighti ani composit is the more should a charact of strength predomin in the style henc in histori philosophi and solemn discours it is expect most one of the most complet model of a nervou style is demosthen in hi orat as everi good qualiti in style ha an extrem when pursu to which it becom faulti thi hold of the nervou style as well as other too great a studi of strength to the neglect of the other qualiti of style is found to betray writer into a harsh manner harsh aris from unusu word from forc invers in the construct of a sentenc and too much neglect of smooth and eas thi is reckon the fault of some of our earliest classic in the english languag such as sir walter raleigh sir franci bacon hooker chillingworth milton in hi prose work harrington cudworth and other writer of consider note in the day of queen elizabeth jame i and charl i these writer had nerv and strength in a high degre and are to thi day emin for that qualiti in style but the languag in their hand wa exceedingli differ from what it is now and wa inde entir form upon the idiom and construct of the latin in the arrang of sentenc hooker for instanc begin the prefac to hi celebr work of ecclesiast politi with the follow sentenc though for no other caus yet for thi that poster may know we have not loos through silenc permit thing to pass away as in dream there shall be for men inform extant thi much concern the present state of the church of god establish amongst us and their care endeavor which would have upheld the same such a sentenc now sound harsh in our ear yet some advantag certainli attend thi sort of style and whether we have gain or lost upon the whole by depart from it may bear a question by the freedom of arrang which it permit it render the languag suscept of more strength of more varieti of colloc and more harmoni of period but howev thi be such a style is now obsolet and no modern writer could adopt it without the censur of harsh and affect the present form which the languag ha assum ha in some measur sacrif the studi of strength to that of perspicutiy and eas our arrang of word ha becom less forcibl perhap but more plain and natur and thi is now understood to be the geniu of our languag the restor of king charl ii seem to be the era of the format of our present style lord clarendon wa one of the first who laid asid those frequent invers which prevail among writer of the former age after him sir william templ polish the languag still more but the author who by the number and reput of hi work form it more than ani one into it present state is dryden dryden began to write at the restor and continu long an author both in poetri and prose he had made the languag hi studi and though he wrote hastili and often incorrectli and hi style is not free from fault yet there is a rich in hi diction a copious eas and varieti in hi express which ha not been surpass by ani who have come after him dr johnson in hi life of dryden give the follow charact of hi prose style hi prefac have not the formal of a settl style in which the first half of the sentenc betray the other the claus are never balanc nor the period model everi word seem to drop by chanc though it fall into it proper place noth is cold or languid the whole is airi anim and vigor what is littl is gay what is great is splendid though all is easi noth is feebl though all seem careless there is noth harsh and though sinc hi earlier work more than a centuri ha pass they have noth yet uncouth or obsolet sinc hi time consider attent ha been paid to puriti and eleg of style but it is eleg rather than strength that form the distinguish qualiti of most of the good english writer some of them compos in a more manli and nervou manner than other but whether it be from the geniu of our languag or from whatev other caus it appear to me that we are far from the strength of sever of the greek and roman author hitherto we have consid style under those charact that respect it express of an author mean let us now proceed to consid it in anoth view with respect to the degre of ornament employ to beautifi it here the style of differ author seem to rais in the follow gradat a dri a plain a neat an eleg a floweri manner of each of these in their order first a dri manner thi exclud all ornament of everi kind content with be understood it ha not the least aim to pleas either the fanci or the ear thi is toler onli in pure didact write and even there to make us bear it great weight and solid of matter is requisit and entir perspicu of languag aristotl is the thorough exampl of a dri style never perhap wa there ani author who adher so rigidli to the strict of a didact manner throughout all hi write and convey so much instruct without the least approach to ornament with the most profound geniu and extens view he write like a pure intellig who address himself sole to the understand without make ani use of the channel of the imagin but thi is a manner which deserv not to be imit for although the good of the matter may compens the dryness or harsh of the style yet is that dryness a consider defect as it fatigu attent and convey our sentiment with disadvantag to the reader or hearer a plain style rise one degre abov a dri one a writer of thi charact employ veri littl ornament of ani kind and rest almost entir upon hi sens but if he is at no pain to engag us by the employ of figur music arrang or ani other art of write he studi howev to avoid disgust us like a dri and a harsh writer besid perspicu he pursu proprieti puriti and precis in hi languag which form one degre and no inconsider one of beauti liveli too and forc may be consist with a veri plain style and therefor such an author if hi sentiment be good may be abundantli agreeabl the differ between a dri and plain writer is that the former is incap of ornament and seem not to know what it is the latter seek not after it he give us hi mean in good languag distinct and pure ani further ornament he give himself no troubl about either becaus he think it unnecessari to hi subject or becaus hi geniu doe not lead him to delight in it or becaus it lead him to despis it on thi head of the gener charact of style particularli the plain and the simpl and the charact of those english author who are class under them in thi and the follow lectur sever idea have been taken from a manuscript treatis on rhetor part of which wa shown to me mani year ago by the learn and ingeni author dr adam smith and which it is hope will be given by him to the public thi last wa the case with dean swift who may be place at the head of those that have employ the plain style few writer have discov more capac he treat everi subject which he handl whether seriou or ludicr in a masterli manner he knew almost beyond ani man the puriti the extent the precis of the english languag and therefor to such as wish to attain a pure and correct style he is one of the most use model but we must not look for much ornament and grace in hi languag hi haughti and moros geniu made him despis ani embellish of thi kind as beneath hi digniti he deliv hi sentiment in a plain downright posit manner like one who is sure he is in the right and is veri indiffer whether you be pleas or not hi sentenc are commonli neglig arrang distinctli enough as to the sens but without ani regard to smooth of sound often without much regard to compact or eleg if a metaphor or ani other figur chanc to render hi satir more poignant he would perhap vouchsaf to adopt it when it came in hi way but if it tend onli to embellish and illustr he would rather throw it asid henc in hi seriou piec hi style often border upon the dri and unpleas in hi humour one the plain of hi manner give hi wit a singular edg and set it off to the highest advantag there is no froth nor affect in it it flow without ani studi prepar and while he hardli appear to smile himself he make hi reader laugh heartili to a writer of such a geniu as dean swift the plain style wa most admir fit among our philosoph writer mr lock come under thi class perspicu and pure but almost without ani ornament whatev in work which admit or requir ever so much ornament there are part where the plain manner ought to predomin but we must rememb that when thi is the charact which a writer affect throughout hi whole composit great weight of matter and great forc of sentiment are requir in order to keep up the reader attent and prevent him from tire of the author what is call a neat style come next in order and here we are got into the region of ornament but that ornament not of the highest or most sparkl kind a writer of thi charact show that he doe not despis the beauti of languag it is an object of hi attent but hi attent is shown in the choic of hi word and in a grace colloc of them rather than in ani high effort of imagin or eloqu hi sentenc are alway clean and free from the encumbr of superflu word of a moder length rather inclin to breviti than a swell structur close with proprieti without ani tail or adject drag after the proper close hi cadenc is vari but not of the studi music kind hi figur if he use ani are short and correct rather than bold and glow such a style as thi may be attain by a writer who ha no great power of fanci or geniu by industri mere and care attent to the rule of write and it is a style alway agreeabl it imprint a charact of moder elev on our composit and carri a decent degre of ornament which is not unsuit to ani subject whatev a familiar letter or a law paper on the driest subject may be written with neat and a sermon or a philosoph treatis in a neat style will be read with pleasur an eleg style is a charact express a higher degre of ornament than a neat one and inde is the term usual appli to style when possess all the virtu of ornament without ani of it excess or defect from what ha been formerli deliv it will easili be understood that complet eleg impli great perspicu and proprieti puriti in the choic of word and care and dexter in their harmoni and happi arrang it impli farther the grace and beauti of imagin spread over style as far as the subject admit it and all the illustr which figur languag add when properli employ in a word an eleg writer is one who pleas the fanci and the ear while he inform the understand and who give us hi idea cloth with all the beauti of express but not overcharg with ani of it misplac fineri in thi class therefor we place onli the first rate writer in the languag such as addison dryden pope templ bolingbrok atterburi and a few more writer who differ wide from one anoth in mani of the attribut of style but whom we now class togeth under the denomin of eleg as in the scale of ornament possess nearli the same place when the ornament appli to style are too rich and gaudi in proport to the subject when they return upon us too fast and strike us either with a dazzl luster or a fals brillianc thi form what is call a florid style a term commonli use to signifi the excess of ornament in a young compos thi is veri pardon perhap it is even a promis symptom in young peopl that their style should inclin to the florid and luxuri volo se efferat in adolescent faecundita say quinctilian multum ind decoqu anni multum ratio limabit aliquid velut usu ipso deteretur sit modo und excidi poffit quid et exculpi audeat haec aeta plura et inveniat et inventi gaudeat sint licet illa non sati interim sicca et severa facil remedium est ubertati sterilia nullo labor vincuntur in youth i wish to see luxuri of fanci appear much of it will be diminish by year much will be correct by ripen judgment some of it by the mere practic of composit will be worn away let there be onli suffici matter at first that can hear some prune and lop off at thi time of life let geniu be bold and invent and pride itself in it effort though these should not as yet be correct luxuri can easili be cure but for barren there is no remedi but although the florid style may be allow to youth in their first essay it must not receiv the same indulg from writer of matur year it is to be expect that judgment as it ripen should chasten imagin and reject as juvenil all such ornament as are redund unsuit to the subject or not conduc to illustr it noth can be more contempt than that tinsel splendour of languag which some writer perpetu affect it were well if thi could be ascrib to the real overflow of a rich imagin we should then have someth to amus us at least if we found littl to instruct us but the worst is that with those frothi writer it is a luxuri of word not of fanci we see a labor attempt to rise to a splendor of composit of which they have form to themselv some loos idea but have no strength of geniu for attain it they endeavor to suppli the defect by poetic word by cold exclam by common place figur and everi thing that ha the appear of pomp and magnific it ha escap these writer that sobrieti in ornament is one great secret for render it pleas and that without a foundat of good sens and solid thought the most florid style is but a childish imposit on the public the public howev are but too apt to be so impos on at least the mob of reader who are veri readi to be caught at first with whatev is dazzl and gaudi i can not help think that it reflect more honor on the religi turn and good disposit of the present age than on the public tast that mr harvey medit have had so great a currenc the piou and benevol heart which is alway display in them and the live fanci which on some occas appear justli merit applaus but the perpetu glitter of express the swollen imageri and strain descript which abound in them are ornament of a fals kind i would therefor advis student of oratori to imit mr harvey pieti rather than hi style and in all composit of a seriou kind to turn their attent as mr pope say from sound to thing from fanci to the heart admonit of thi kind i have alreadi had occas to give and may hereaft repeat them as i conceiv noth more incumb on me in thi cours of lectur than to take everi opportun of caution my reader against the affect and frivol use of ornament and instead of that slight and superfici tast in write which i apprehend to be at present too fashion to introduc as far as my endeavor can avail a tast for more solid thought and more manli simplic in style lectur xix gener charact of style simpl affect vehement direct for form a proper style have enter in the last lectur on the consider of the gener charact of style i treat of the concis and diffus the nervou and feebl manner i consid style also with relat to the differ degre of ornament employ to beautifi it in which view the manner of differ author rise accord to the follow gradat dri plain neat eleg floweri i am next to treat of style under anoth charact one of great import in write and which requir to be accur examin that of simplic or a natur style as distinguish from affect simplic appli to write is a term veri frequent use but like mani other critic term often use loos and without precis thi ha been owe chiefli to the differ mean given to the word simplic which therefor it will be necessari here to distinguish and to show in what sens it is a proper attribut of style we may remark four differ accept in which it is taken the first is simplic of composit as oppos to too great a varieti of part horac precept refer to thi deniqu sit quod vi simplex duntaxat et unum then learn the wander humor to control and keep one equal renor through the whole franci thi is the simplic of plan in a tragedi as distinguish from doubl plot and crowd incid the simplic of the iliad or aeneid in opposit to the digress of lucan and the scatter tale of ariosto the simplic of grecian architectur in opposit to the irregular varieti of the gothic in thi sens simplic is the same with uniti the second sens is simplic of thought as oppos to refin simpl thought are what aris natur what the occas or the subject suggest unsought and what when onc suggest are easili apprehend by all refin in write express a less natur and obviou train of thought and which it requir a peculiar turn of geniu to pursu within certain bound veri beauti but when carri too far approach to intricaci and hurt us by the appear of be recherch or far sought thu we would natur say that mr parnel is a poet of far greater simplic in hi turn of thought than mr cowley cicero thought on moral subject are natur seneca too refin and labor in these two sens of simplic when it is oppos either to varieti of part or to refin of thought it ha no proper relat to style there is a third sens of simplic in which it ha respect to style and stand oppos to too much ornament or pomp of languag as when we say mr lock is a simpl mr harvey a florid writer and it is in thi sens that the simplex the tenu or subtl genu dicendi is understood by cicero and quinctilian the simpl style in thi sens coincid with the plain or the neat style which i befor mention and therefor requir no farther illustr but there is a fourth sens of simplic also respect style but not respect the degre of ornament employ so much as the easi and natur manner in which our languag express our thought thi is quit differ from the former sens of the word just now mention in which simplic wa equival to plain wherea in thi sens it is compat with the highest ornament homer for instanc possess thi simplic in the greatest perfect and yet no writer ha more ornament and beauti thi simplic which is what we are now to consid stand oppos not to ornament but to affect of ornament or appear of labor about our style and it is a distinguish excel in write a writer of simplic express himself in such a manner that everi one think he could have written in the same way horac describ it ut sibi quivi speret idem sudet multum frustraqu laboret ausu idem from wellknown tale such fiction would i rais as all might hope to imit with eas yet while they strive the same success to gain should find their labor and their hope in vain franci there are no mark of art in hi express it seem the veri languag of natur you see in the style not the writer and hi labor but the man in hi own natur charact he may be rich in hi express he may be full of figur and of fanci but these flow from him without effort and he appear to write in thi manner not becaus he ha studi it but becaus it is the manner of express most natur to him a certain degre of neglig also is not inconsist with thi charact of style and even not ungrac in it for too minut an attent to word is foreign to it habeat ill say cicero orat no moll quiddam et quod indicet non ingratam negligentiam homini de re magi quam de verbo laboranti let thi style have a certain soft and eas which shall characteris a neglig not unpleas in an author who appear to be more solicit about the thought than the express thi is the great advantag of simplic of style that like simplic of manner it show us a man sentiment and turn of mind laid open without disguis more studi and artifici manner of write howev beauti have alway thi disadvantag that they exhibit an author in form like a man at court where the splendor of dress and the ceremoni of behavior conceal those peculiar which distinguish one man from anoth but read an author of simplic is like convers with a person of distinct at home and with eas where we find natur manner and a mark charact the highest degre of thi simplic is express by a french term to which we have none that fulli answer in our languag naivet it is not easi to give a precis idea of the import of thi word it alway express a discoveri of charact i believ the best account of it is given by a french critic m marmontel who explain it thu that sort of amiabl ingenu or undisguis open which seem to give us some degre of superior over the person who show it a certain infantin simplic which we love in our heart but which display some featur of the charact that we think we could have art enough to hide and which therefor alway lead us to smile at the person who discov thi charact la fontain in hi fabl is given as the great exampl of such naivet thi howev is to be understood as descript of a particucular speci onli of simplic with respect to simplic in gener we may remark that the ancient origin writer are alway the most emin for it thi happen from a plain reason that they wrote from the dictat of natur geniu and were not form upon the labor and write of other which is alway in hazard of produc affect henc among the greek writer we have more model of a beauti simplic than among the roman homer hesiod anacreon theocritu herodotu and xenophon are all distinguish for it among the roman also we have some writer of thi charact particularli terenc lucretiu phoedru and juliu caesar the follow passag of terenc andria is a beauti instanc of simplic of manner in descript funu interim procedit sequimur ad sepulchrum venimu in ignem imposita est fletur interea haec soror quam dixi ad flammam accessit imprudentiu sati cum periculo ibi tum exanimatu pamphilu been dissimulatum amorem

might easili perceiv their long long love threw herself back into hi arm and wept oh how familiarli colman act i sc all the word here are remark happi and eleg and convey a most live pictur of the scene describ while at the same time the style appear wholli artless and unlabour let us next consid some english writer who come under thi class simplic is the great beauti of archbishop tillotson manner tillotson ha long been admir as an eloqu writer and a model for preach but hi eloqu if we can call it such ha been often misunderstood for if we includ in the idea of eloqu vehem and strength picturesqu descript glow figur or correct arrang of sentenc in all these part of oratori the archbishop is exceedingli defici hi style is alway pure inde and perspicu but careless and remiss too often feebl and languid littl beauti in the construct of hi sentenc which are frequent suffer to drag unharmoniousi seldom ani attempt toward strength or sublim but notwithstand these defect such a constant vein of good sens and pieti run through hi work such an earnest and seriou manner and so much use instruct convey in a style so pure natur and unaffect as will justli recommend him to high regard as long as the english languag remain not inde as a model of the highest eloqu but as a simpl and amiabl writer whose manner is strongli express of great good and worth i observ befor that simplic of manner may be consist with some degre of neglig in style and it is onli the beauti of that simplic which make the neglig of such writer seem grace but as appear in the archbishop neglig may sometim be carri so far as to impair the beauti of simplic and make it border on a flat and languid manner sir william templ is anoth remark writer in the style of simplic in point of ornament and correct he rise a degre abov tillotson though for correct he is not in the highest rank all is easi and flow in him he is exceedingli harmoni smooth and what may be call amaen are the distinguish charact of hi manner relax sometim as such a manner will natur do into a prolix and remiss style no writer whatev ha stamp upon hi style a more live impress of hi own charact in read hi work we seem engag in convers with him we becom thoroughli acquaint with him not mere as an author but as a man and contract a friendship for him he may be class as stand in the middl between a neglig simplic and the highest degre of ornament which thi charact of style admit of the latter of these the highest most correct and ornament degre of the simpl manner mr addison is beyond doubt in the english languag the most perfect exampl and therefor though not without some fault he is on the whole the safest model for imit and the freest from consider defect which the languag afford perspicu and pure he is in the highest degre hi precis inde not veri great yet nearli as great as the subject which he treat of requir the construct of hi sentenc easi agreeabl and commonli veri music carri a charact of smooth more than of strength in figur languag he is rich particularli in simili and metaphor which are so employ as to render hi style splendid without be gaudi there is not the least affect in hi manner we see no mark of labor noth forc or constrain but great eleg join with great eas and simplic he is in particular distinguish by a charact of modesti and of polit which appear in all hi write no author ha a more popular and insinu manner and the great regard which he everi where show for virtu and religion recommend him highli if he fail in ani thing it is in want of strength and precis which render hi manner though perfectli suit to such essay as he write in the spectat not altogeth a proper model for ani of the higher and more elabor kind of composit though the public have ever done much justic to hi merit yet the natur of hi merit ha not alway been seen in it true light for though hi poetri be eleg he certainli bear a higher rank among the prose writer than he is entitl to among the poet and in prose hi humor is of a much higher and more origin strain than hi philosophi the charact of sir roger de coverley discov more geniu than the critiqu on milton such author as those whose charact i have been give one never tire of read there is noth in their manner that strain or fatigu our thought we are pleas without be dazzl by their luster so power is the charm of simplic in an author of real geniu that it atton for mani defect and reconcil us to mani a careless express henc in all the most excel author both in prose and vers the simpl and natur manner may be alway remark although other beauti be predomin thi form not their peculiar and distinguish charact thu milton is simpl in the midst of all hi grandeur and demosthen in the midst of all hi vehem to grave and solemn write simplic of manner add the more vener air accordingli thi ha often been remark as the prevail charact throughout all the sacr scriptur and inde no other charact of style wa so much suit to the digniti of inspir of author who notwithstand mani excel have render their style much less beauti by want of simplic i can not give a more remark exampl than lord shaftsburi thi is an author on whom i have made observ sever time befor and shall now take leav of him with give hi gener charact under thi head consider merit doubtless he ha hi work might be read with profit for the moral philosophi which they contain had he not fill them with so mani obliqu and invidi insinu against the christian religion thrown out too with so much spleen and satir as do no honor to hi memori either as an author or a man hi languag ha mani beauti it is firm and support in an uncommon degre it is rich and music no english author as i formerli show ha attend so much to the regular construct of hi sentenc both with respect to proprieti and with respect to cadenc all thi give so much eleg and pomp to hi languag that there is no wonder it should have been sometim highli admir it is greatli hurt howev by perpetu stiff and affect thi is it capit fault hi lordship can express noth with simplic he seem to have consid it as vulgar and beneath the digniti of a man of qualiti to speak like other men henc he is ever in buskin full of circumlocut and artifici eleg in everi sentenc we see the mark of labor and art noth of that eas which express a sentiment come natur and warm from the heart of figur and ornament of everi kind he is exceedingli fond sometim happi in them but hi fond for them is too visibl and have onc laid hold of some metaphor or allus that pleas him he know not how to part with it what is most wonder he wa a profess admir of simplic is alway extol it in the ancient and censur the modern for the want of it though he depart from it himself as far as ani one modern whatev lord shaftsburi possess delicaci and refin of tast to a degre that we may call excess and sickli but he had littl warmth of passion few strong or vigor feel and the cold of hi charact led him to that artifici and state manner which appear in hi write he wa fonder of noth than of wit and railleri but he is far from be happi in it he attempt it often but alway aukwardli he is stiff even in hi pleasantri and laugh in form like an author and not like a man it may perhap be not unworthi of be mention that the first edit of hi enquiri into virtu wa publish surreptiti i believ in a separ form in the year and is sometim to be met with by compar which with the correct edit of the same treatis as it now stand among hi work we see one of the most curiou and use exampl that i know of what is call lima labor the art of polish languag break long sentenc and work up an imperfect draught into a highli finish perform from the account which i have given of lord shaftsburi manner it may easili be imagin that he would mislead mani who blindli admir him noth is more danger to the tribe of imit than an author who with mani impos beauti ha also some veri consider blemish thi is fulli exemplifi in mr blackwal of aberdeen the author of the life of homer the letter on mytholog and the court of augustu a writer of consider learn and of ingenu also but infect with an extravag love of an artifici style and of that parad of languag which distinguish the shaftsburean manner have now said so much to recommend simplic or the easi and natur manner of write and have point out the defect of an opposit manner in order to prevent mistak on thi subject it is necessari for me to observ that it is veri possibl for an author to write simpli and yet not beauti one may be free from affect and not have merit the beauti simplic suppos an author to possess real geniu to write with solid puriti and liveli of imagin in thi case the simplic or unaffected of hi manner is the crown ornament it heighten everi other beauti it is the dress of natur without which all beauti are imperfect but if mere unaffected were suffici to constitut the beauti of style weak trifl and dull writer might often lay claim to thi beauti and accordingli we frequent meet with pretend critic who extol the dullest writer on account of what they call the chast simplic of their manner which in truth is no other than the absenc of everi ornament through the mere want of geniu and imagin we must distinguish therefor between that simplic which accompani true geniu and which is perfectli compat with everi proper ornament of style and that which is no other than a careless and slovenli manner inde the distinct is easili made from the effect produc the one never fail to interest the reader the other is insipid and tiresom i proceed to mention one other manner or charact of style differ from ani that i have yet spoken of which may be distinguish by the name of the vehement thi alway impli strength and is not by ani mean inconsist with simplic but in it predomin charact is distinguish from either the strong or the simpl manner it ha a peculiar ardour it is a glow style the languag of a man whose imagin and passion are heat and strongli affect by what he write who is therefor neglig of lesser grace but pour himself forth with the rapid and full of a torrent it belong to the higher kind of oratori and inde is rather expect from a man who is speak than from one who is write in hi closet the orat of demosthen furnish the full and perfect exampl of thi speci of style among english writer the one who ha most of thi charact though mix inde with sever defect is lord bolingbrok bolingbrok wa form by natur to be a factiou leader the demagogu of a popular assembl accordingli the style that run through all hi polit write is that of one declaim with heat rather than write with deliber he abound in rhetor figur and pour himself forth with great impetuos he is copiou to a fault place the same thought befor us in mani differ view but gener with life and ardour he is bold rather than correct a torrent that flow strong but often muddi hi sentenc are vari as to length and short inclin howev most to long period sometim includ parenthes and frequent crowd and heap a multitud of thing upon one anoth as natur happen in the warmth of speak in the choic of hi word there is great felic and precis in exact construct of sentenc he is much inferior to lord shaftsburi but greatli superior to him in life and eas upon the whole hi merit as a writer would have been veri consider if hi matter had equal hi style but whilst we find mani thing to commend in the latter in the former as i befor remark we can hardli find ani thing to commend in hi reason for most part he is flimsi and fals in hi polit write faction in what he call hi philosoph one irreligi and sophist in the highest degre i shall insist no longer on the differ manner of writer or the gener charact of style some other besid those which i have mention might be point out but i am sensibl that it is veri difficult to separ such gener consider of the style of author from their peculiar turn of sentiment which it is not my busi at present to critic conceit writer for instanc discov their spirit so much in their composit that it imprint on their style a charact of pert though i confess it is difficult to say whether thi can be class among the attribut of style or rather is to be ascrib entir to the thought in whatev class we rank it all appear of it ought to be avoid with care as a most disgust blemish in write under those gener head which i have consid i have taken an opportun of give the charact of mani of the emin classic in the english languag from what i have said on thi subject it may be infer that to determin among all those differ manner of write what is precis the best is neither easi nor necessari style is a field that admit of great latitud it qualiti in differ author may be veri differ and yet in them all beauti room must be left here for geniu for that particular determin which everi one receiv from natur to one manner of express more than anoth some gener qualiti inde there are of such import as should alway in everi kind of composit be kept in view and some defect we should alway studi to avoid an ostentati a feebl a harsh or an obscur style for instanc are alway fault and perspicu strength neat and simplic are beauti to be alway aim at but as to the mixtur of all or the degre of predomin of ani one of these good qualiti for form our peculiar distinguish manner no precis rule can be given nor will i ventur to point out ani one model as absolut perfect it will be more to the purpos that i conclud these dissert upon style with a few direct concern the proper method of attain a good style in gener leav the particular charact of that style to be either form by the subject on which we write or prompt by the bent of geniu the first direct which i give for thi purpos is to studi clear idea on the subject concern which we are to write or speak thi is a direct which may at first appear to have small relat to style it relat to it howev is extrem close the foundat of all good style is good sens accompani with a live imagin the style and thought of a writer are so intim connect that as i have sever time hint it is frequent hard to distinguish them wherev the impress of thing upon our mind are faint and indistinct or perplex and confus our style in treat of such thing will infal be so too wherea what we conceiv clearli and feel strongli we will natur express with clear and with strength thi then we may be assur is a capit rule as to style to think close of the subject till we have attain a full and distinct view of the matter which we are to cloth in word till we becom warm and interest in it then and not till then shall we find express begin to flow gener speak the best and most proper express are those which a clear view of the subject suggest without much labor or enquiri after them thi is quinctilian observ lib viii c plerumqu optima verba rebu cohaer et cernuntur suo lumin at no quaerimu illa tanquam lateant scque subduc ita nunquam putamu verba essa circa id de quo dicendum est fed ex alii loci petimu et inventi vim afferimu the most proper word for the most part adher to the thought which are to be express by them and may be discov as by their own light but we hunt after them as if they were hidden and onli to be found in a corner henc instead of conceiv the word to lie near the subject we go in quest of them to some other quarter and endeavor to give forc to the express we have found out in the second place in order to form a good style the frequent practic of compos is indispens necessari mani rule concern style i have deliv but no rule will answer the end without exercis and habit at the same time it is not everi sort of compos that will improv style thi is so far from be the case that by frequent careless and hasti composit we shall acquir certainli a veri bad style we shall have more troubl afterward in unlearn fault and correct neglig than if we had not been accustom to composit at all in the begin therefor we ought to write slowli and with much care let the facil and speed of write be the fruit of longer practic moram et solicitudinem say quinctilian with the greatest reason l x c initii impero nam primum hoc constituendum ac obtinendum est ut quam optim scribamu celeritatem dabit consuetudo paulatim re faciliu se ostend verba respondebunt compositio prosequetur cuncta deniqu ut in famili been instituta in officio erunt summa haec est rei cito scribendo non sit ut been scribatur been scribendo sit ut cito i enjoin that such as are begin the practic of composit write slowli and with anxiou deliber their great object at first should be to write as well as possibl practic will enabl them to write speedili by degre matter will offer itself more readili word will be at hand composit will flow everi thing as in the arrang of a wellord famili will present itself in it proper place the sum of the whole is thi by hasti composit we shall never acquir the art of compos well by write well we shall come to write speedili we must observ howev that there may be an extrem in too great and anxiou a care about word we must not retard the cours of thought nor cool the heat of imagin by paus too long on everi word we employ there is on certain occas a glow of composit which should be kept up if we hope to express ourselv happili though at the expens of allow some inadvert to pass a more sever examin of these must be left to be the work of correct for if the practic of composit be use the labori work of correct is no less so is inde absolut necessari to our reap ani benefit from the habit of composit what we have written should be laid by for some littl time till the ardour of composit be past till the fond for the express we have use be worn off and the express themselv be forgotten and then review our work with a cool and critic eye as if it were the perform of anoth we shall discern mani imperfect which at first escap us then is the season for prune redund for weigh the arrang of sentenc for attend to the junctur and connect particl and bring style into a regular correct and support form thi lima labor must be submit to by all who would commun their thought with proper advantag to other and some practic in it will soon sharpen their eye to the most necessari object of attent and render it a much more easi and practic work than might atfirst be imagin in the third place with respect to the assist that is to be gain from the write of other it is obviou that we ought to render ourselv well acquaint with the style of the best author thi is requisit both in order to form a just tast in style and to suppli us with a full stock of word on everi subject in read author with a view to style attent should be given to the peculiar of their differ manner and in thi and former lectur i have endeavor to suggest sever thing that may be use in thi view i know no exercis that will be found more use for acquir a proper style than to translat some passag from an emin english author into our own word what i mean is to take for instanc some page of one of mr addison spectat and read it care over two or three time till we have got a firm hold of the thought contain in it then to lay asid the book to attempt to write out the passag from memori in the best way we can and have done so next to open the book and compar what we have written with the style of the author such an exercis will by comparison show us where the defect of our style lie will lead us to the proper attent for rectifi them and among the differ way in which the same thought may be express will make us perceiv that which is the most beauti but in the fourth place i must caution at the same time against a servil imit of ani one author whatev thi is alway danger it hamper geniu it is like to produc a stiff manner and those who are given to close imit gener imit an author fault as well as hi beauti no man will ever becom a good writer or speaker who ha not some degre of confid to follow hi own geniu we ought to bewar in particular of adopt ani author note phrase or transcrib passag from him such a habit will prove fatal to all genuin composit infinit better it is to have someth that is our own though of moder beauti than to affect to shine in borrow ornament which will at last betray the utter poverti of our geniu on these head of compos correct read and imit i advis everi student of oratori to consult what quinctilian ha deliv in the xth book of hi institut where he will find a varieti of excel observ and direct that well deserv attent in the fifth place it is an obviou but materi rule with respect to style that we alway studi to adapt it to the subject and also to the capac of our hearer if we are to speak in public noth merit the name of eloqu or beauti which is not suit to the occas and to the person to whom it is address it is to the last degre awkward and absurd to attempt a poetic florid style on occas when it should be our busi onli to argu and reason or to speak with elabor pomp of express befor person who comprehend noth of it and who can onli stare at our unseason magnific these are defect not so much in point of style as what is much wors in point of common sens when we begin to write or speak we ought previous to fix in our mind a clear concept of the end to be aim at to keep thi steadili in our view and to suit our style to it if we do not sacrific to thi great object everi illtim ornament that may occur to our fanci we are unpardon and though children and fool may admir men of sens will laugh at us and our style in the last place i can not conclud the subject without thi admonit that in ani case and on ani occas attent to style must not engross us so much as to detract from a higher degre of attent to the thought curam verborum say the great roman critic rerum volo ess solicitudinem to your express be attent but about your matter be solicit a direct the more necessari that the present tast of the age in write seem to lean more to style than to thought it is much easier to dress up trivial and common sentiment with some beauti of express than to afford a fund of vigor ingeni and use thought the latter requir true geniu the former may be attain by industri with the help of veri superfici part henc we find so mani writer frivol rich in style but wretchedli poor in sentiment the public ear is now so much accustom to a correct and ornament style that no writer can with safeti neglect the studi of it but he is a contempt one who doe not look to someth beyond it who doe not lay the chief stress upon hi matter and employ such ornament of style to recommend it as are manli not foppish major animo say the writer whom i have so often quot aggredienda est eloquentia quae si toto corpor valet ungu polir et capillum componer non existimabit ad curam suam pertiner ornatu et virili et forti et sanctu sit nec effeminatam levitatem et fuco ementitum titum colorem amet sanguin et viribu niteat a higher spirit ought to anim those who studi eloqu they ought to consult the health and sound of the whole bodi rather than bend their attent to such trifl object as pare the nail and dress the hair let ornament be manli and chast without effemin gaieti or artifici color let it shine with the glow of health and strength lectur xx critic examin of the style of mr addison in no of the spectat i have insist fulli on the subject of
