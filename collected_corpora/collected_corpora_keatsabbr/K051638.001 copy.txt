from it situat call the grove wa gener known by the name of the dairyhous her grandfath particularli wa fond of have it so call busi in the account relat to the estat which my grandfath had the good to bequeath me and which onc a year are left to my inspect although i have given the whole into my papa power my sister made me a visit there the day after mr lovelac had been introduc and seem highli pleas with the gentleman hi birth hi fortun in possess a clear l per annum as lord m had assur my uncl presumpt heir to that nobleman larg estat hi great expect from ladi sarah sadleir and ladi betti lawranc who with hi uncl interest themselv veri warmli he be the last of hi line to see him marri so handsom a man o her belov clari for then she wa readi to love me dearli from the overflow of her good humor on hi account he wa but too handsom a man for her were she but as amiabl as somebodi there would be a probabl of hold hi affect for he wa wild she heard veri wild veri gay love intrigu but he wa young a man of sens would see hi error could she but have patienc with hi fault if hi fault were not cure by marriag thu she ran on and then want me to see the charm man as she call him again concern that she wa not handsom enough for him with a sad thing that the man should have the advantag of the woman in that particular but then step to the glass she compliment herself that she wa veri well that there were mani women deem passabl who were inferior to herself that she wa alway thought come and let her tell me that comeli have not so much to lose as beauti had would hold when that would evapor and fli off nay for that matter and again she turn to the glass her featur were not irregular her eye not at all amiss and i rememb they were more than usual brilliant at that time noth in short to be sound fault with though noth veri engag she doubt wa there clari excus me my dear i never wa thu particular befor no not to you nor would i now have written thu freeli of a sister but that she make a merit to my brother of disown that she ever like him as i shall mention hereaft and then you will alway have me give you minut descript nor suffer me to pass by the air and manner in which thing are spoken that are to be taken notic of rightli observ that air and manner often express more than the accompani word i congratul her upon her prospect she receiv my compliment with a great deal of selfcomplac she like the gentleman still more at hi next visit and yet he made no particular address to her although an opportun wa given him for it thi wa wonder at as my uncl had introduc him into our famili declaredli as a visitor to my sister but as we are ever readi to make excus when in good humor with ourselv for the suppos slight of those whose approb we wish to engag so my sister found out a reason much to mr lovelac advantag for hi not improv the opportun that wa given him it wa bash truli in him bash in mr lovelac my dear inde gay and live as he is he ha not the look of an impud man but i fanci it is mani mani year ago sinc he wa bash thu howev could my sister make it out upon her word she believ mr lovelac deserv not the bad charact he had as to women he wa realli to her think a modest man he would have spoken out she believ but onc or twice as he seem to intend to do so he wa under so agreeabl a confus such a profound respect he seem to show her a perfect rever she thought she love dearli that a gentleman in courtship should show a rever to hi mistress so inde we all do i believ and with reason sinc if i may judg from what i have seen in mani famili there is littl enough of it shown afterward and she told my aunt hervey that she would be a littl less upon the reserv next time he came she wa not one of those flirt not she who would give pain to a person that deserv to be welltreat and the more for the great of hi valu for her i wish she had not somebodi whom i love in her eye yet is not her censur unjust i believ is it my dear except in one undu and harsh word in hi third visit bella govern herself by thi kind and consider principl so that accord to her own account of the matter the man might have spoken out but he wa still bash he wa not abl to overcom thi unseason rever so thi visit went off as the former but now she began to be dissatisfi with him she compar hi gener charact with thi hi particular behavior to her and have never been court befor own herself puzzl how to deal with so odd a lover what did the man mean had not her uncl brought him declaredli as a suitor to her it could not be bash now she thought of it sinc he might have open hi mind to her uncl if he want courag to speak directli to her not that she care much for the man neither but it wa right sure that a woman should be put out of doubt earli as to a man intent in such a case as thi from hi own mouth but truli she had begun to think that he wa more solicit to cultiv her mamma good opinion than her everybodi she own admir her mamma convers but he wa mistaken if he thought that would do with her and then for hi own sake sure he should put it into her power to be complais to him if he gave her caus of approb thi distant behavior she must take upon her to say wa the more extraordinari as he continu hi visit and declar himself extrem desir to cultiv a friendship with the whole famili and as he could have no doubt about her sens if she might take upon her to join her own with the gener opinion he have taken great notic of and admir mani of her good thing as they fell from her lip reserv were pain she must need say to open and free spirit like her and yet she must tell my aunt to whom all thi wa direct that she should never forget what she owe to her sex and to herself were mr lovelac as unexception in hi moral as in hi figur and were he to urg hi suit ever so warmli i wa not of her council i wa still absent and it wa agre between my aunt hervey and her that she wa to be quit solemn and shi in hi next visit if there were not a peculiar in hi address to her but my sister it seem had not consid the matter well thi wa not the way as it prove to be taken with a man of mr lovelac penetr for matter of mere omiss nor with ani man sinc if love ha not taken root deep enough to caus it to shoot out into declar if an opportun be fairli given for it there is littl room to expect that the blight wind of anger or resent will bring it forward then my poor sister is not natur goodhumourd thi is too well known a truth for me to endeavor to conceal it especi from you she must therefor i doubt have appear to great disadvantag when she aim to be worsetemperd than ordinari how they manag it in thi convers i know not one would be tempt to think by the issu that mr lovelac wa ungener enough to seek the occas given see mr lovelac letter no xxxi in which he briefli account for hi conduct in thi affair and to improv it yet he thought fit to put the question too but she say it wa not till by some mean or other she knew not how he had wrought her up to such a pitch of displeasur with him that it wa imposs for her to recov herself at the instant nevertheless he reurg hi question as expect a definit answer without wait for the return of her temper or endeavor to mollifi her so that she wa under a necess of persist in her denial yet gave him reason to think that she did not dislik hi address onli the manner of it hi court be rather made to her mamma than to herself as if he were sure of her consent at ani time a good encourag denial i must own as wa the rest of her plea to wit a disinclin to chang her state exceedingli happi as she wa she never could be happier and suchlik consent neg as i may call them and yet not intend a reflect upon my sister for what can ani young creatur in the like circumst say when she is not sure

will soon resum it letter iii miss clarissa harlow to miss how jan and thu as mr lovelac thought fit to take it had he hi answer from my sister it wa with veri great regret as he pretend i doubt the man is an hypocrit my dear that be acquiesc in it so much determined such a nobl firm in my sister that there wa no hope of prevail upon her to alter sentiment she had adopt on full consider he sigh as bella told us when he took hi leav of her profoundli sigh grasp her hand and kiss it with such an ardor withdrew with such an air of solemn respect she had him then befor her she could almost find in her heart although he had vex her to piti him a good intent prepar thi piti sinc at the time she littl thought that he would not renew hi offer he wait on my mamma after he had taken leav of bella and report hi ill success in so respect a manner both with regard to my sister and to the whole famili and with so much concern that he wa not accept as a relat to it that it left upon them all my brother be then as i have said in scotland impress in hi favor and a belief that thi matter would certainli be brought on again but mr lovelac go up directli to town where he stay a whole fortnight and meet there with my uncl antoni to whom he regret hi niec unhappi resolut not to chang her state it wa seen that there wa a total end put to the affair my sister wa not want to herself on thi occas but made a virtu of necess and the man wa quit anoth man with her a vain creatur too well know hi advantag yet those not what she had conceiv them to be cool and warm by fit and start an aguelik lover a steadi man a man of virtu a man of moral wa worth a thousand of such gay flutter her sister clari might think it worth her while perhap to tri to engag such a man she had patienc she wa mistress of persuas and inde to do the girl justic had someth of a person but as for her she would not have a man of whose heart she could not be sure for one moment no not for the world and most sincer glad wa she that she had reject him but when mr lovelac return into the countri he thought fit to visit my papa and mamma hope as he told them that howev unhappi he had been in the reject of the wish for allianc he might be allow to keep up an acquaint and friendship with a famili which he should alway respect and then unhappili as i may say wa i at home and present it wa immedi observ that hi attent

could my uncl antoni gave hi approb in high term but refer as my aunt had done to my sister she repeat her contempt of him and declar that were there not anoth man in england she would not have him she wa readi on the contrari she could assur them to resign her pretens under hand and seal if miss clari were taken with hi tinsel and if everi one els approv of hi address to the girl my papa inde after a long silenc be urg to speak hi mind by my uncl antoni said that he had a letter from hi son jame on hi hear of mr lovelac visit to hi daughter arabella which he had not shown to anybodi but my mamma that treati be at an end when he receiv it that in thi letter he express great dislik to an allianc with mr lovelac on the score of hi immor that he knew inde there wa an old grudg between them that be desir to prevent all occas of disunion and animos in hi famili he would suspend the declar of hi own mind till hi son arriv and till he had heard hi further object that he wa the more inclin to make hi son thi compliment as mr lovelac gener charact gave but too much ground for hi son dislik of him ad that he had heard so he suppos had everyon that he wa a veri extravag man that he had contract debt in hi travel and inde he wa pleas to say he had the air of a spendthrift these particular i had partli from my aunt hervey and partli from my sister for i wa call out as soon as the subject wa enter upon and when i return my uncl antoni ask me how i should like mr lovelac everybodi saw he wa pleas to say that i had made a conquest i immedi answer not at all he seem to have too good an opinion both of hi person and part to have ani great regard to hi wife let him marri whom he would my sister particularli wa pleas with thi answer and confirm it to be just with a compliment to my judgment for it wa her but the veri next day lord m came to harloweplac i wa then absent and in hi nephew name made a propos in form declar that it wa the ambit of all hi famili to be relat to our and he hope hi kinsman would not have such an answer on the part of the younger sister as he had had on that of the elder in short mr lovelac visit were admit as those of a man who had not deserv disrespect from our famili but as to hi address to me with a reserv as abov on my papa part that he would determin noth without hi son my discret as to the rest wa confid in for still i had the same object as to the man nor would i when we were better acquaint hear anyth but gener talk from him give him no opportun of convers with me in privat he bore thi with a resign littl expect from hi natur temper which is gener report to be quick and hasti unus it seem from childhood to check or control a case too common in consider famili where there is an onli son and hi mother never had ani other child but as i have heretofor told you i could perceiv notwithstand thi resign that he had so good an opinion of himself as not to doubt that hi person and accomplish would insens engag me and could that be onc done he told my aunt hervey he should hope from so steadi a temper that hi hold in my affect would be durabl while my sister account for hi patienc in anoth manner which would perhap have had more forc if it had come from a person less prejud that the man wa not fond of marri at all that he might perhap have halfascor mistress and that delay might be as conveni for hi rove as for my wellact indiffer that wa her kind express whatev were hi motiv for a patienc so gener believ to be out of hi usual charact and where the object of hi address wa suppos to be of fortun consider enough to engag hi warmest attent he certainli escap mani mortif by it for while my papa suspend hi approb till my brother arriv he receiv from everyon those civil which were due to hi birth and although we heard from time to time report to hi disadvantag with regard to moral yet could we not question him upon them without give him greater advantag than the situat he wa in with us would justifi to prudenc sinc it wa much more like that hi address would not be allow of than that it would and thu wa he admit to convers with our famili almost upon hi own term for while my friend saw noth in hi behavior but what wa extrem respect and observ in him no violent importun they seem to have taken a great like to hi convers while i consid him onli as a a common guest when he came and thought myself no more concern in hi visit nor at hi entranc or departur than ani other of the famili but thi indiffer of my side wa the mean of procur him one veri great advantag for upon it wa ground that correspond by letter which succeed and which had it been to be begun when the familyanimos broke out would never have been enter into on my part the occas wa thi my uncl hervey ha a young gentleman entrust to hi care whom he ha thought of send abroad a year or two henc to make the grand tour as it is call and find mr lovelac could give a good account of everyth necessari for a young travel to observ upon such an occas he desir him to write down a descript of the court and countri he had visit and what wa most worthi of curios in them he consent on condit that i would direct hi subject as he call it and as everyon had heard hi manner of write commend and thought hi relat might be agreeabl amus in winter even and that he could have no opportun particularli to address me in them sinc they were to be read in full assembl befor they were to be given to the young gentleman i made the less scrupl to write and to make observ and put question for our further inform still the less perhap as i love write and those who do are fond you know of occas to use the pen and then have everi one consent and my uncl hervey desir that i would i thought that if i had been the onli scrupul person it would have shown a particular that a vain man would constru to hi advantag and which my sister would not fail to animadvert upon you have seen some of these letter and have been pleas with hi account of person place and thing and we have both agre that he wa no common observ upon what he had seen my sister herself allow that the man had a toler knack of write and describ and my papa who had been abroad in hi youth said that hi remark were curiou and show him to be a person of read judgment and tast thu wa a kind of correspond begun between him and me with gener approb while everyon wonder at and wa pleas with hi patient vener of me for so they call it howev it wa not doubt that he would soon be more importun sinc hi visit were more frequent and he acknowleg to my aunt hervey a passion for me accompani with an awe that he had never known befor to which he attribut what he call hi but seem acquiesc with my papa pleasur and the distanc i kept him at and yet my dear thi may be hi usual manner of behavior to our sex for had not my sister at first all hi rever mean time my father expect thi importun kept in readi the report he had heard in hi disfavour to charg them upon him then as so mani object to hi address and it wa highli agreeabl to me that he did so it would have been strang if it were not sinc the person who could reject mr wyerley address for the sake of hi free opinion must have been inexcus had she not reject anoth for hi freer practic but i should own that in the letter he sent me upon the gener subject he more than onc enclos a particular one declar hi passion regard for me and complain with fervor enough of my reserv but of these i took not the least notic for as i had not written to him at all but upon a subject so gener i thought it wa but right to let what he wrote upon one so particular pass off as if i never had seen it and the rather as i wa not then at liberti from the approb hi letter met with to break off the correspond without assign the true reason for do so besid with all hi respect assidu it wa easi to observ if it had not been hi gener charact that hi temper is natur haughti and violent and i had seen enough of that untract spirit in my brother to like it in one who hope to be still nearer relat to me i had a littl specimen of thi temper of hi upon the veri occas i have mention for after he had sent me a third particular letter with the gener one he ask me the next time he came to harloweplac if i had not receiv such a one from him i told him i should never answer one so sent and that i had wait for such an occas as he had now given me to tell him so i desir him therefor not to write again on the subject assur him that if he did i would return both and never write anoth line to him you can not imagin how saucili the man look as if in short he wa disappoint that he had not made a more sensibl impress upon me and when he recollect himself as he did immedi what a visibl struggl it cost him to chang hi haughti air for more placid one but i took no notic of either for i thought it best to convinc him by the cool and indiffer with which i repuls hi forward hope at the same time intend to avoid the affect of pride or vaniti that he wa not consider enough in my eye to make me take overreadi offens at what he said or how he look in other word that i had not valu enough for him to treat him with peculiar either by smile or frown inde he had cun enough to give me undesignedli a piec of instruct which taught me thi caution for he had said in convers onc that if a man could not make a ladi in courtship own herself pleas with him it wa as much and oftentim more to hi purpos to make her angri with him i must break off here but will continu the subject the veri first opportun mean time i am your most affection friend and servant cl harlow letter iv miss clarissa harlow to miss how jan thi my dear wa the situat mr lovelac and i were in when my brother arriv from scotland the moment mr lovelac visit were mention to him he without either hesit or apolog express hi disapprob of them he found great flaw in hi charact and took the liberti to say in so mani word that he wonder how it came into the heart of hi uncl to encourag such a man for either of hi sister at the same time return hi thank to my father for declin hi consent till he arriv in such a manner i thought as a superior would do when he commend an inferior for have well perform hi duti in hi absenc he justifi hi avow inveteraci by common fame and by what he had known of him at colleg declar that he had ever hate him ever should hate him and would never own him for a brother or me for a sister if i marri him that collegebegun antipathi i have heard account for in thi manner mr lovelac wa alway note for hi vivac and courag and no less it seem for the swift and surpris progress he made in all part of literatur for dilig in hi studi in the hour of studi he had hardli hi equal thi it seem wa hi gener charact at the univers and it gain him mani friend among the more learn youth while those who did not love him fear him by reason of the offens hi vivac made him too readi to give and of the courag he show in support the offens when given which procur him as mani follow as he pleas among the mischiev sort no veri amiabl charact you will say upon the whole but my brother temper wa not happier hi nativ haughti could not bear a superior so visibl and whom we fear more than love we are not far from hate and have less command of hi passion than the other wa evermor the subject of hi perhap indec ridicul so that they never me without quarrel and everybodi either from love or fear side with hi antagonist he had a most uneasi time of it while both continu in the same colleg it wa the less wonder the efor that a young man who is not note for the gentl of hi temper should resum an antipathi earli begun and so deeplyroot he found my sister who wait but for the occas readi to join him in hi resent against the man he hate she utterli disclaim all manner of regard for him never like him at all hi estat wa certainli much encumb it wa imposs it should be otherwis so entir devot as he wa to hi pleasur he kept no hous had no equipag nobodi pretend that he want pride the reason therefor wa easi to be guess at and then did she boast of and my brother prais her for refus him and both join on all occas to depreci him and not seldom made the occas their displeasur against him caus everi subject to run into thi if it began not with it i wa not solicit to vindic him when i wa not join in their reflect i told them i did not valu him enough to make a differ in the famili on hi account and as he wa suppos to have given too much caus for their ill opinion of him i thought he ought to take the consequ of hi own fault nowandthen inde when i observ that their vehem carri them beyond all bound of probabl i thought it but justic to put in a word for him but thi onli subject me to reproach as have a prepossess in hi favor that i would not own so that when i could not chang the subject i use to retir either to my music or to my closet their behavior to him when they could not help see him wa veri cold and disoblig but as yet not directli affront for they were in hope of prevail upon my papa to forbid hi visit but as there wa noth in hi behavior that might warrant such a treatment of a man of hi birth and fortun they succeed not and then they were veri earnest with me to forbid them i ask what author i had to take such a step in my father hous and when my behavior to him wa so distant that he seem to be as much the guest of ani other person of the famili themselv except as mine in reveng they told me that it wa cun manag between us and that we both understood one anoth better than we pretend to do and at last they gave such a loos to their passion all of a sudden the reason of thi their moreopenli shown animosti is given in letter xiii as i may say that instead of withdraw as they use to do when he came they threw themselv in hi way purpos to affront him mr lovelac you may believ veri ill brook thi but nevertheless content himself to complai of it to me in high term howev tell me that but for my sake my brother treatment of him wa not to be born i wa sorri for the merit thi gave him in hi own opinion with me and the more as some of the affront he receiv were too flagrant to be excus but i told him that i wa determin not to fall out with my brother if i could help it whatev were hi fault and sinc they could not see one anoth with temper should be glad that he would not throw himself in my brother way and i wa sure my brother would not seek him he wa veri much nettl at thi answer but said he must bear hi affront if i would have it so he had been accus himself of violenc in hi temper but he hope to show on thi occas that he had a command of hi passion which few young men so provok would be abl to show and doubt not but it would be attribut to a proper motiv by a person of my generos and penetr my brother had just befor with the approb of my uncl employ a person relat to a discharg bailiff or steward of lord m who had had the manag of some part of mr lovelac affair from which he wa also dismiss by him to inquir into hi debt after hi companion into hi amor and the like my aunt hervey in confid gave me the follow particular of what the man said of him that he wa a gener landlord that he spare noth for solid and last improv upon hi estat and that he look into hi own affair and understood them that he had when abroad been veri expens and contract a larg debt for he made no secret of hi affair yet chose to limit himself to an annual sum and to declin equipag in order to avoid be oblig to hi uncl and aunt from whom he might have what money he pleas but that he wa veri jealou of their control had often quarrel with them and treat them so freeli that they were all afraid of him howev that hi estat wa never mortgag as my brother had heard it wa hi credit wa alway high and he believ he wa by thi time near upon if not quit clear of the world he wa a sad gentleman he said as to women if hi tenant had pretti daughter they chose to keep them out of hi sight he believ he kept no particular mistress for he had heard newelti that wa the man word wa everyth with him but for hi uncl and aunt teaz fansyd he would not think of marriag wa never known to be disguis with liquor but wa a great plotter and a great writer that he live a wild life in town by what he had heard had six or seven companion as bad as himself whom nowandthen he brought down with him and the countri wa alway glad when they went up again he would have it that although passion he wa goodhumor love as well to take a jest as to give one and would railli himself upon occas the freest of ani man he ever knew thi wa hi charact from an enemi for as my aunt observ everi thing the man said commend of him came grudgingli with a must need say to do him justic etc while the contrari wa deliv with a free good will and thi charact as a wors wa expect though thi wa bad enough not answer the end of inquir after it my brother and sister were more apprehens than befor that hi address would be encourag sinc the worst part of it wa known or suppos when he wa first introduc to my sister but with regard to myself i must observ in hi disfavour that notwithstand the merit he want to make with me for hi patienc upon my brother illtreat of him i owe him no compliment for tri to concili with him not that i believ it would have signifi ani thing if he had made ever such court either to him or to my sister yet one might have expect from a man of hi polit and from hi pretens you know that he would have been will to tri instead of which such a hearti contempt he show of them both of my brother especi that i ever heard of it with aggrav and for me to have hint at an alter in hi behavior to my brother wa an advantag i knew he would have been proud of and which therefor i had no mind to give him but i doubt not that have so veri littl encourag from anybodi hi pride would soon take fire and he would of himself discontinu hi visit or go to town where till he came acquaint with our famili he use chiefli to resid and in thi latter case he had no reason to expect that i would receiv much less answer hi letter the occas which had led me to receiv ani of hi be by thi time over but my brother antipathi would not permit him to wait for such an event and after sever excess which mr lovelac still return with contempt and a haughti too much like that of the aggressor my brother took upon himself to fill up the doorway onc when he came as if to oppos hi entranc and upon hi ask for me demand what hi busi were with hi sister the other with a challeng air as my brother say told him he would answer a gentleman ani question but he wish that mr jame harlow who had of late given himself high air would rememb that he wa not now at colleg just then the good dr lewin who frequent honor me with a visit of convers as he is pleas to call it and had part with me in my own parlour came to the door and hear the word interpos both have their hand upon their sword and tell mr lovelac where i wa he burst by my brother to come to me leav him chafe he said like a hunt boar at bay thi alarm us all my father wa pleas to hint to mr lovelac and i by hi command spoke a great deal plainer that he wish he would discontinu hi visit for the peacesak of the famili but mr lovelac is not a man to be easili brought to give up hi purpos in a point especi wherein he pretend hi heart is so much engag and an absolut prohibit not have been given thing went on for a littl while as befor for i saw plainli that to have deni myself to hi visit which howev i declin receiv as often as i could wa to bring forward some desper issu between the two sinc the offens so readili given on one side wa onli brook by the other out of consider to me and thu did my brother rash lay me under an oblig where i would least have owe it the intermedi propos of mr symm and mr mullin both in turn encourag by my brother were induc for him to be more patient for a while he be in hope as nobodi thought me overforward in mr lovelac favor that he should engag my father and uncl to espous the one or the other in opposit to him but when he found that i had interest enough to disengag myself from their address as i had befor he went to scotland and befor mr lovelac visit here of mr wyerley he then kept no measur and first set himself to upbraid me for a suppos prepossess which he treat as if it were crimin and then to insult mr lovelac in person and it be at mr edward symmess the brother of the other symm two mile off and no good dr lewin again to interpos the unhappi rencount
