should not forget that govern is an evil an usurp upon the privat judgment and individu conscienc of mankind and that howev we may be oblig to admit it as a necessari evil for the present it behov us as the friend of reason and the human speci to admit as littl of it as possibl and care to observ whether in consequ of the gradual illumin of the human mind that littl may not hereaft be diminish subject of the present book and first we are to consid the differ provis that may be made for gener administr includ under the phrase gener administr all that shall be found necessari of what book v

confid we book v chap method of examin to be adopt can not do better than adopt the ordinari distribut of form of govern into monarchi aristocraci and democraci under each of these head we may enquir into the merit of their respect principl first absolut and upon the hypothesi of their stand singli for the whole administr and secondli in a limit view upon the supposit of their constitut one branch onli of the system of govern it is usual alik incid to them all to confid the minut branch of execut detail to inferior agent one thing more it is necessari to premis the merit of each of the three head i have enumer are to be consid neg the corpor duti of mankind are the result of their irregular and folli in their individu capac if they had no imperfect or if men were so constitut as to be suffici and suffici earli correct by persuas alon societi would ceas from it function of consequ of the three form of govern and their composit that is the best which shall least imped the activ and applic of our intellectu power it wa in the recollect of thi truth that i have prefer the term polit institut to that of govern the former appear to be suffici express of that rel form whatev it be into which individu would fall when there wa no need of forc to direct them into their proper channel and were no refractori member to correct chap ii of educ the educ of a princ natur of monarchi delineated—school of adversity—tend of superflu to inspir effeminacy—to depriv us of the benefit of experience—illustr in the case of princes—mann in which they are addressed—inefficaci of the instruct bestow upon them first then of monarchi and we will first suppos the book v chap ii success to the monarchi to be hereditari in thi case we have the addit advantag of consid thi distinguish mortal who is thu set over the head of the rest of hi speci from the period of hi birth the abstract idea of a king is of an extrem moment natur of monarchi delin and extraordinari natur and though the idea ha by the accid of educ been render familiar to us from our infanc yet perhap the major of reader can recollect the period when it struck them with astonish and confound their power of apprehens it be suffici evid that some speci of govern wa necessari and that individu book v chap ii must conced a part of that sacr and import privileg by which each man is constitut judg of hi own word and action for the sake of gener good it wa next requisit to consid what expedi might be substitut in the room of thi origin claim one of these expedi ha been monarchi it wa the interest of each individu that hi individu should be invad as rare as possibl that no invas should be permit to flow from wanton capric from sinist and disingenu view or from the instig of anger partial and passion and that thi bank sever levi upon the peculium of each member of the societi should be administ with frugal and discret it wa therefor without doubt a veri bold adventur to commit thi preciou deposit to the custodi of a singl man if we contempl the human power whether of bodi or mind we shall find them much better suit to the superintend of our privat concern and to the administ occasion assist to other than to the accept the formal trust of superintend the affair and watch for the happi of million if we recollect the physic and moral equal of mankind it will appear a veri violent usurp upon thi principl to place one individu at so vast an interv from the rest of hi speci let us then consid how such person are usual educ or may be expect to be educ and how well they are prepar for thi illustri offic school of advers it is a common opinion that advers is the school in which all extraordinari virtu must be form henri the fourth of book v chap ii franc and elizabeth of england experienc a long seri of calam befor they were elev to a throne alfr of whom the obscur chronicl of a barbar age record such superior virtu pass through the vicissitud of a vagabond and a fugit even the mix and upon the whole the viciou yet accomplish charact of freder and alexand were not form without the interfer of injustic and persecut thi hypothesi howev seem to have been push too far it is no more reason to suppos that virtu can not be matur without injustic than to believ which ha been anoth prevail opinion that human happi can not be secur without impostur and deceit both these error have a common sourc a distrust of the omnipot of truth if their advoc had reflect more deepli upon the natur of the human mind they would have perceiv that all our voluntari action are judgment of the understand and that action of the most judici and use natur must infal flow from a real and genuin convict of truth but though the exagger opinion here state of the use tendenc of superflu to inspir effeminaci of advers be erron it is like mani other of our error alli to import truth if advers be not necessari it must be allow that prosper is pernici not a genuin and philosoph prosper which requir no more than sound book v chap ii health with a sound intellect the capac of procur for ourselv by a moder and well regul industri the mean of subsist virtu and wisdom but prosper as it is usual understood that is a compet provid for us by the capric of human institut invit our bodi to indol and our mind to lethargi and still more prosper as it is understood in the case of noblemen and princ that is a superflu of wealth which depriv us of all intercours with our fellow men upon equal term and make us prison of state gratifi inde with baubl and splendour but shut out from the real benefit of societi and the percept of truth if truth be so intrins power as to make advers unnecessari to excit our attent to it it is nevertheless certain that luxuri and wealth have the most fatal effect in distort it if it requir no foreign aid to assist it energi we ought howev to be upon our guard against principl and situat the tendenc of which may be perpetu to counteract it nor is thi all one of the most essenti ingredi of virtu is fortitud it wa the plan of mani of the grecian philosoph and most of all of diogen to show to mankind how veri limit wa the suppli that our necess requir and how littl depend our real welfar and prosper were upon the capric of other among innumer incid upon record that illustr thi principl a singl one may suffic to suggest to our mind it gener spirit diogen had a slave whose name wa mena and mena thought proper upon some book v chap ii occas to elop ha said the philosoph can mena live without diogen and can not diogen live without mena there can be no lesson more import than that which is thu convey the man that doe not know himself not to be at the merci of other men that doe not feel that he is invulner to all the vicissitud of fortun is incap of a constant and inflex virtu he to whom the rest of hi speci can reason look up with confid must be firm becaus hi mind is fill with the excel of the object he pursu and chear becaus he know that it is out of the power of event to injur him if ani one should choos to imagin that thi idea of virtu is strain too high yet all must allow that no man can be entitl to our confid who trembl at everi wind who can endur no advers and whose veri exist is link to the artifici charact he sustain noth can more reason excit our contempt than a man who if he were onc reduc to the genuin and simpl condit of man would be reduc to despair and find himself incap of consult and provid for hi own subsist fortitud is a habit of mind that grow out of a sens of our own independ if there be a man who dare not even trust hi own imagin with the fanci chang of hi circumst he must necessarili be effemin irresolut and temporis he that love sensual or ostent better than virtu may be entitl to our piti but a madman onli would entrust to hi dispos ani thing that wa dear to him book v chap ii to depriv us of the benefit of experi again the onli mean by which truth howev immut in it own natur can be commun to the human mind is through the inlet of the sens it is perhap imposs that a man shut up in a cabinet can ever be wise if we would acquir knowledg we must open our eye and contempl the univers till we are acquaint with the mean of term and the natur of the object around us we can not understand the proposit that may be form concern them till we are acquaint with the natur of the object around us we can not compar them with the principl we have form and understand the mode of employ them there are other way of attain wisdom and abil besid the school of advers but there is no way of attain them but through the medium of experi that is experi bring in the materi with which intellect work for it must be grant that a man of limit experi will often be more capabl than he who ha gone through the greatest varieti of scene or rather perhap that one man may collect more experi in a sphere of a few mile squar than anoth who ha sail round the world to conceiv truli the valu of experi we must recollect the infinit improv the human mind ha receiv in a long seri of age and how an enlighten european differ from a solitari savag howev multifari are these improv there are but two way in which they can be appropri by ani individu either at second hand by book and convers or at first hand by our own observ of men and book v chap ii thing the improv we receiv in the first of these mode is unlimit but it will not do alon we can not understand book till we have seen the subject of which they treat he that know the mind of man must have observ it for himself he that know it most intim must have observ it in it greatest varieti of situat he must have seen it without disguis when no exterior situat put a curb upon it passion and induc the individu to exhibit a studi not a spontan charact he must have seen men in their unguard moment when the eager of temporari resent tip their tongu with fire when they are anim and dilat by hope when they are tortur and anatomis by despair when the soul pour out it inmost self into the bosom of an equal and a friend lastli he must himself have been an actor in the scene have had hi own passion brought into play have known the anxieti of expect and the transport of success or he will feel and understand about as much of what he see as mankind in gener would of the transact of the vitriolis inhabit of the planet mercuri or the salamand that live in the sun—such is the educ of the true philosoph the genuin politician the friend and benefactor of human kind what is the educ of a princ it first qualiti is extrem illustr in the case of princ book v chap ii tender the wind of heaven are not permit to blow upon him he is dress and undress by hi lacquey and valet hi want are care anticip hi desir without ani effort of hi profus suppli hi health is of too much import to the commun to permit him to exert ani consider effort either of bodi or mind he must not hear the voic of reprimand or blame in all thing it is first of all to be rememb that he is a princ that is some rare and preciou creatur but not of human kind manner in which they are address as he is the heir to a throne it is never forgotten by those about him that consider import is to be annex to hi favour or hi displeasur accordingli they never express themselv in hi presenc frankli and natur either respect him or themselv they are support a part they play under a mask their own fortun and emolu is alway uppermost in their mind at the same time that they are anxiou to appear gener disinterest and sincer all hi capric are to be compli with all hi gratif are to be studi they find him a deprav and sordid mortal they judg of hi appetit and capac by their own and the gratif they recommend serv to sink him deeper in folli and vice what is the result of such an educ have never experienc contradict the young princ is arrog and presumptu have alway been accustom to the slave of necess or the slave of choic he doe not understand even the book v chap ii mean of the word freedom hi temper is insol and impati of parley and expostul know noth he believ himself sovereignli inform and run headlong into danger not from firm and courag but from the most egregi wil and vaniti like pyrrho among the ancient philosoph if hi attend were at a distanc and he trust himself alon in the open air he would perhap be run over by the next coach or fall down the first precipic hi violenc and presumpt are strikingli contrast with the extrem timid of hi disposit the first opposit terrifi him the first difficulti seen and understood appear insuper he trembl at a shadow and at the veri semblanc of advers is dissolv into tear it ha accordingli been observ that princ are commonli superstiti beyond the rate of common mortal abov all simpl unqualifi truth is a stranger to hi ear it either never approach or is so unexpect a guest should onc appear it meet with so cold a recept as to afford littl encourag to a second visit the longer he ha been accustom to falshood and flatteri the more grate will it sound the longer he ha been accustom to falshood and flatteri the more terribl will the task appear to him to chang hi tast and discard hi favourit he will either place a blind confid in all men or have detect the insincer of those who were most agreeabl to him will conclud that all men are book v chap ii knavish and design as a consequ of thi last opinion he will becom indiffer to mankind callou to their suffer and will believ that even the virtuou are knave under a craftier mask such is the educ of an individu who is destin to superintend the

been introduc in real life it will be various modifi but the major of the featur unless in veri rare instanc will remain the same in no case can the educ of a friend and benefactor of human kind as sketch in a preced page by ani specul contriv be commun inefficaci of the instruct bestow upon them nor is there ani difficulti in account for thi univers miscarriag the wisest preceptor thu

you assur him of the contrari you can expect onli an imperfect and temporari credit for fact which in thi case depos against you speak a languag more emphat and intellig than word if it were book v chap ii not as he suppos whi should everi one that approach be eager to serv him the sordid and selfish motiv by which they are realli anim he is veri late in detect it may even be doubt whether the individu who wa never led to put the profess of other to the test by hi real want ha in ani instanc been complet awar of the littl credit that is often due to them a princ find himself court and ador long befor he can have acquir a merit entitl him to such distinct by what argument can you persuad him labori to pursu what appear so complet superflu how can you induc him to be dissatisfi with hi

that other men are be of the same order with himself is extirp it would be unreason to expect from him ani thing gener and human unfortun as he is hi situat is continu propel him to vice and destroy the germ of integr and virtu befor they are unfold if sensibl begin book v chap ii to discov itself it is immedi poison by the blight wind of flatteri amus and sensual call with an imperi voic and will not allow him time to feel artifici as is the charact he fill even should he aspir to fame it will be by the artifici method of fals refin or the barbar invent of usurp and conquest not by the plain and unorna road of benevol some idea of the method usual pursu and the effect produc in the educ of a princ may be collect from a late public of the celebr madam de genli in which she give an

infect with a consider number of error correct these defect in the young princ but few princ have the good fortun to be educ by a mind so power and wise as that of madam de genli and we may safe take our standard for the averag calcul rather from her predecessor than herself she form the except they the rule even were it otherwis we have alreadi seen what it is that a preceptor can do in the educ of a princ nor should it be forgotten that these were not of the class of princ destin to a throne chap iii privat life of a princ principl by which he is influenced—irresponsibility—impati of

which the institut book v chap vi monarchi found in impostur of monarch govern is calcul to produc upon the inhabit of the countri in which it flourish and here it must be laid down as a first principl that monarchi is found in impostur it is fals that king are entitl to king not entitl to superior the emin they obtain they possess no intrins superior over their subject the line of distinct
