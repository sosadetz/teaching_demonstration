extraordinari endow or hi variou work ha been equal by few in ani age is an arduou and may be reckon in me a presumptu task had dr johnson written hi own life in conform with the opinion which he ha given idler no that everi man life may be best written by himself had he employ in the preserv of hi own histori that clear of narrat and eleg of languag in which he ha embalm so mani emin person the world would probabl have had the most perfect exampl of biographi that wa ever exhibit but although he at differ time in a desultori manner commit to write mani particular of the progress of hi mind and fortun he never had persev dilig enough to form them into a regular composit of these memori a few have been preserv but the greater part wa consign by him to the flame a few day befor hi death as i had the honor and happi of enjoy hi friendship for upward of twenti year as i had the scheme of write hi life constantli in view as he wa well appris of thi circumst and from time to time obligingli satisfi my inquiri by commun to me the incid of hi earli year as i acquir a facil in recollect and wa veri assidu in record hi convers of which the extraordinari vigor and vivac constitut one of the first featur of hi charact and as i have spare no pain in obtain materi concern him from everi quarter where i could discov that they were to be found and have been favor with the most liber commun by hi friend i flatter myself that few biograph have enter upon such a work as thi with more advantag independ of literari abil in which i am not vain enough to compar myself with some great name who have gone befor me in thi kind of write sinc my work wa announc sever live and memoir of dr johnson have been publish the most volumin of which is one compil for the booksel of london by sir john hawkin knight the greatest part of thi book wa written while sir john hawkin wa aliv and i avow that one object of my strictur wa to make him feel some compunct for hi illiber treatment of dr johnson sinc hi deceas i have suppress sever of my remark upon hi work but though i would not war with the dead offens i think it necessari to be strenuou in defens of my illustri friend which i can not be without strong animadvers upon a writer who ha greatli injur him let me add that though i doubt i should not have been veri prompt to gratifi sir john hawkin with ani compliment in hi lifetim i do now frankli acknowledg that in my opinion hi volum howev inadequ and improp as a life of dr johnson and howev discredit by unpardon inaccuraci in other respect contain a collect of curiou anecdot and observ which few men but it author could have brought togeth a man whom dure my long intimaci with dr johnson i never saw in hi compani i think but onc and i am sure not abov twice johnson might have esteem him for hi decent religi demeanor and hi knowledg of book and literari histori but from the rigid formal of hi manner it is evid that they never could have live togeth with companion eas and familiar nor had sir john hawkin that nice percept which wa necessari to mark the finer and less obviou part of johnson charact hi be appoint one of hi executor gave him an opportun of take possess of such fragment of a diari and other paper as were left of which befor deliv them up to the residuari legate whose properti they were he endeavor to extract the substanc in thi he ha not been veri success as i have found upon a perus of those paper which have been sinc transfer to me sir john hawkinss ponder labor i must acknowledg exhibit a farrago of which a consider portion is not devoid of entertain to the lover of literari gossip but besid it be swell out with long unnecessari extract from variou work even one of sever leav from osborn harleian catalogu and those not compil by johnson but by oldi a veri small part of it relat to the person who is the subject of the book and in that there is such an inaccuraci in the statement of fact as in so solemn an author is hardli excus and certainli make hi narr veri unsatisfactori but what is still wors there is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharit cast by which the most unfavour construct is put upon almost everi circumst in the charact and conduct of my illustri friend who i trust will by a true and fair delin be vindic both from the injuri misrepresent of thi author and from the slighter aspers of a ladi who onc live in great intimaci with him there is in the british museum a letter from bishop warburton to dr birch on the subject of biographi which though i am awar it may expos me to a charg of art rais the valu of my own work by contrast it with that of which i have spoken is so well conceiv and express that i can not refrain from here insert it i shall endeavor say dr warburton to give you what satisfact i can in ani thing you want to be satisfi in ani subject of milton and am extrem glad you intend to write hi life almost all the lifewrit we have had befor toland and desmaiseaux are inde strang insipid creatur and yet i had rather read the worst of them than be oblig to go through with thi of milton or the other life of boileau where there is such a dull heavi success of long quotat of disinterest passag that it make their method quit nauseou but the verbos tasteless frenchman seem to lay it down as a principl that everi life must be a book and what is wors it prove a book without a life for what do we know of boileau after all hi tediou stuff you are the onli one and i speak it without a compliment that by the vigor of your style and sentiment and the real import of your materi have the art which one would imagin no one could have miss of ad agreement to the most agreeabl subject in the world which is literari histori brit mu ascough catal sloan mss nov instead of melt down my materi into one mass and constantli speak in my own person by which i might have appear to have more merit in the execut of the work i have resolv to adopt and enlarg upon the excel plan of mr mason in hi memoir of gray wherev narr is necessari to explain connect and suppli i furnish it to the best of my abil but in the chronolog seri of johnson life which i trace as distinctli as i can year by year i produc wherev it is in my power hi own minut letter or convers be convinc that thi mode is more live and will make my reader better acquaint with him than even most of those were who actual knew him but could know him onli partial wherea there is here an accumul of intellig from variou point by which hi charact is ore fulli understood and illustr inde i can not conceiv a more perfect mode of write ani man life than not onli relat all the most import event of it in their order but interweav what he privat wrote and said and thought by which mankind are enabl as it were to see him live and to live over each scene with him as he actual advanc through the sever stage of hi life had hi other friend been as dilig and ardent as i wa he might have been almost entir preserv as it is i will ventur to say that he will be seen in thi work more complet than ani man who ha ever yet live and he will be seen as he realli wa for i profess to write not hi panegyr which must be all prais but hi life which great and good as he wa must not be suppos to be entir perfect to be as he wa is inde subject of panegyr enough to ani man in thi state of be but in everi pictur there should be shade as well as light and when i delin him without reserv i do what he himself recommend both by hi precept and hi exampl if the biograph write from person knowledg and make hast to gratifi the public curios there is danger lest hi interest hi fear hi gratitud or hi tender overpow hi fidel and tempt him to conceal if not to invent there are mani who think it an act of pieti to hide the fault or fail of their friend even when they can no longer suffer by their detect we therefor see whole rank of charact adorn with uniform panegyr and not to be known from one anoth but by extrinsick and casual circumst let me rememb say hale when i find myself inclin to piti a crimin that there is likewis a piti due to the countri if we owe regard to the memori of the dead there is yet more respect to be paid to knowledg to virtu and to truth rambler no what i consid as the peculiar valu of the follow work is the quantiti that it contain of johnson convers which is univers acknowledg to have been emin instruct and entertain and of which the specimen that i have given upon a former occas have been receiv with so much approb that i have good ground for suppos that the world will not be indiffer to more ampl commun of a similar natur that the convers of a celebr man if hi talent have been exert in convers will best display hi charact is i trust too well establish in the judgment of mankind to be at all shaken by a sneer observ of mr mason in hi memoir of mr william whitehead in which there is liter no life but a mere dri narr of fact i do not think it wa quit necessari to attempt a depreci of what is univers esteem becaus it wa not to be found in the immedi object of the ingeni writer pen for in truth from a man so still and so tame as to be content to pass mani year as the domest companion of a superannu lord and ladi convers worth record could no more be expect than from a chines mandarin on a chimneypiec or the fantast figur on a gilt leather skreen if author be requir let us appeal to plutarch the princ of ancient biograph nor is it alway in the most distinguish achiev that men virtu or vice may be best discern but veri often an action of small note a short say or a jest shall distinguish a person real charact more than the greatest sieg or the most import battl plutarch life of alexand langhorn translat to thi may be ad the sentiment of the veri man whose life i am am about to exhibit the busi of the biograph is often to pass slightli over those perform and incid which produc vulgar great to lead the thought into domest privaci and display the minut detail of daili life where exterior appendag are cast asid and men excel each other onli by prudenc and by virtu the account of thuanu is with great proprieti said by it author to have been written that it might lay open to poster the privat and familiar charact of that man cuju ingenium et candorem ex ipsiu scripti sunt olim semper miraturi whose candor and geniu will to the end of time be by hi write preserv in admir there are mani invis circumst which whether we read as enquir after natur or moral knowledg whether we intend to enlarg our scienc or increas our virtu are more import than public occurr thu sallust the great master of natur ha not forgot in hi account of catilin to remark that hi walk wa now quick and again slow as an indic of a mind revolv with violent commot thu the stori of melancthon afford a strike lectur on the valu of time by inform us that when he had made an appoint he expect not onli the hour but the minut to be fix that the day might not run out in the idl of suspens and all the plan and enterpris of de wit are now of less import to the world than that part of hi person charact which repres him as care of hi health and neglig of hi life but biographi ha often been allot to writer who seem veri littl acquaint with the natur of their task or veri neglig about the perform they rare afford ani other account than might be collect from public paper but imagin themselv write a life when they exhibit a chronolog seri of action or prefer and have so littl regard to the manner or behavior of their hero that more knowledg may be gain of a man real charact by a short convers with one of hi servant than from a formal and studi narr begun with hi pedigre and end with hi funer there are inde some natur reason whi these narr are often written by such as were not like to give much instruct or delight and whi most account of particular person are barren and useless if a life be delay till interest and envi are at an end we may hope for imparti but must expect littl intellig for the incid which give excel to biographi are of a volatil and evanesc kind such as soon escap the memori and are transmit by tradit we know how few can pourtray a live acquaint except by hi most promin and observ particular and the grosser featur of hi mind and it may be easili imagin how much of thi littl knowledg may be lost in impart it and how soon a success of copi will lose all resembl of the origin rambler no i am fulli awar of the object which may be made to the minut on some occas of my detail of johnson convers and how happili it is adapt for the petti exercis of ridicul by men of superfici understand and ludicr fanci but i remain firm and confid in my opinion that minut particular are frequent characteristick and alway amus when they relat to a distinguish man i am therefor exceedingli unwil that almost ani thing which my illustri friend thought it worth hi while to express with ani degre of point should perish for thi almost

have of the tabletalk and other anecdot of our celebr writer is valu and how earnestli it is regret that we have not more i am justifi in preserv rather too mani of johnson say than too few especi as from the divers of disposit it can not be known with certainti beforehand whether what may seem trifl to some and perhap to the collector himself may not be most agreeabl to mani and the greater

characteristick that i shall not withold it it wa commun to me in a letter from miss mari ady of lichfield when dr sacheverel wa at lichfield johnson wa not quit three year old my grandfath hammond observ him at the cathedr perch upon hi father shoulder listen and gape at the much celebr preacher mr hammond ask mr johnson how he could possibl think of bring such an infant to church and in the

church satisfi with behold him nor can i omit a littl instanc of that jealou independ of spirit and impetuos of temper which never forsook him the fact wa acknowledg to me by himself upon the author of hi mother one day when the servant who use to be sent to school to conduct him home had not come in time he set out by himself though he wa then so nearsight that he wa oblig to stoop down on hi hand and knee to take a view of the kennel befor he ventur to step over it hi schoolmistress afraid that he might miss hi way or fall into the kennel or be run over by a cart follow him at some

for which he wa all hi life emin to a degre almost incred the follow earli instanc wa told me in hi presenc at lichfield in by hi stepdaught mr luci porter as relat to her by hi mother when he wa a
