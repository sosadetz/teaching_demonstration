a multipl of disagre rumor continu reach my ear to the disadvantag of those of whom from the surer evid of my sens i had the most amiabl opinion could not fail to shock and torment me and if you can suppos a state in which you could just so far credit an aspers as to allow it to teiz and perplex you without permit it to influenc your judgment paradox as that state may seem it is exactli the situat under which my mind ha for some time past labor far from be surpris return mr howard with hi usual candor i think i should onli have been so had you continu immov and determin in your first prepossess when such infinit troubl and attent have been bestow to warp your judgment and mislead your sentiment but my mother you say wa in the secret pray how came she to be inform while i and the rest of the famili remain wholli ignor and unsuspici that my fair cousin had ever dreamt of quit the seclud spot where they receiv their educ that ani individu of lord belmont famili should continu uninform of ani step taken by the ladi sinc their father death wa by no mean either their intent or mine to their relat no secreci wa requisit and in regard to other a temporari conceal wa mere thought necessari becaus it offer an easi method for escap the impertin of curios and investig and they natur defer relinquish the name by which they had alway hitherto been known till the sanction and counten of lord belmont should enabl them to support the cruel retrospect which they knew their father memori must sustain on their introduct into the world an utter and absolut reject from hi lordship to their applic for acknowledg soon point out the fortun proprieti and delicaci of thi precaut as they afterward disdain all thought of assum or proclaim their titl to a name of which their famili howev unjustli deem them unworthi you open a transact so entir new wonder and inconceiv cri mr roatsley who had been attend with an express of amaz in hi counten to thi speech of mr howard that i can no otherwis hope to reduc it to my comprehens than by entreat you to favor me with a minut and regular detail of everi circumst mr howard then begin at the unhappi epoch of my dear father misfortun relat briefli yet with precis everi particular respect him and hi children till the period of our arriv in england in regard to mani of these event said mr howard while he repeat to us thi interest convers i could not suppos mr roatsley complet ignor it may be natur infer that those who could traduc the innoc offspr would not fail to load the parent memori with addit reproach and i doubt not but mr roatsley mind ha been earli tinctur with the most contumaci prejudic against hi ill fate uncl to know hi error independ of the penit and remors which so power extenu and even obliter hi guilt could not but mislead the nephew candor and must have induc him to regard with unab horror a conduct that wa follow by consequ so unhappi as to banish him for ever from hi friend and countri i therefor dwelt with particular energi on the dismal laps of year spent in sorrow seclus that had succeed to your father ruptur with hi famili and continu invari till hi death hi contrit hi suffer hi rectitud and benevol and the assidu care with which he incessantli labor and in which he so well succeed to instil into the mind of hi children everi virtuou and amiabl sentiment as a barrier against the temptat and vicissitud of a world that from a too fatal experi he believ strew with danger and replet with miseri and in order to enforc thi relat i promis to procur him a perus of the manuscript written by your father own hand which as he seek not in it either to palliat or conceal hi fault but breath in everi line that horror which ever attend the sens of hi offens offer a defens the forc of which candor must admit and justic itself acknowledg as mr roatsley did not attempt to interrupt mr howard he proceed to acquaint him with our arriv in town our disappoint in regard to mr benseley deceas our applic in thi uncomfort and friendless situat to lord belmont through the medium of ladi linros and with everi particular of the interview on that subject with her ladyship he next recapitul the substanc of my letter to my grandfath implor hi favor and protect and in answer to thi said he take out of hi pocket book the epistl written him on that occas pray take the troubl of read hi lordship final determin from the pen of ladi linros dure the latter part of thi relat mr roatsley counten betray an agit and astonish that gave defianc mr howard said to all power of express hi perplex after read the letter seem but littl abat he wa for some moment lost in thought but at length break silenc all that i can possibl conceiv cri he all that it is in my power to conjectur or comprehend in thi affair is that my mother have been herself deceiv by the injuri aspers fabric by the infam woman brumpton which have been circul in town with a credit that astonish me dread the impetuos of my temper which might induc me to disoblig lord belmont and even to act in open defianc of a prohibit so unjust so inhuman so wholli contrari to hi natur charact and benevol in consequ of her apprehens of creat that discord dissens which ever lead to alien of affect and often to a total breach of famili unanim ha determin on conceal care from my knowledg everi circumst of the applic yet i must acknowledg myself extrem displeas at a step which ha been the mean of retain me so long in uneasi and uncertainti and the more i consid the circumst of the whole transact the more i am astonish and bewild to imagin that lord belmont if properli appriz of the situat of hi granddaught would allow an obstin and harden prejudic to arrest hi justic to influenc hi human and even to banish natur affect from hi bosom is a supposit to which i can not for an instant give credit it is to believ him scarc human and devoid of the first and most power principl of our moral construct my mother inde labor under a cruel misrepresent to which she ha unfortun given implicit faith and which it ha never been in my power to confut for more than onc have the miss seymour though their name and some vagu report concern them were all i conclud she knew been the subject of discuss and even of alterc between us violent prepossess against them previou to their applic her account may have perhap influenc lord belmont determin even without her intend or dread the injustic which her represent of their charact may have occas thi inde in some measur account for her ladyship conduct and even greatli exculp her from the charg of selfish and interest view while she regard us in the light of relat who were like to reflect dishonor upon our famili and who could bring no consol to the desol bosom of our grandfath it can not be suppos that her mediat in our favor would prove fervent nor that her anxieti for our success could be as sincer as if our conduct had support our claim her cold recept of mr howard and her distant reserv to myself are here fulli explain and while the motiv of her ladyship conduct are clear up a distant hope open to view that her prejudic be remov those of our onli surviv parent may yet listen to truth and yield to the voic of natur is it not surpris howev that the infam design of thi wretch brumpton in aspers our reput should have so extens spread the slander as to reach the ear of a person who move in a sphere so superior so distinct from that wick woman line of life and that these calumni should have flown with such rapid for ladi linros must have learnt that we were unworthi of her notic almost as soon as she wa inform that we solicit it mr howard letter inde she receiv befor her departur from her countri seat had afford her an opportun of be made acquaint with ani particular but dure the short interv between her arriv in town and her confer with mr howard our busi enemi must have contriv to sow the seed of that contag distrust and disgust which then proceed to infect and influenc lord belmont thi convers have detain the two gentlemen till extrem late they then separ and went to rest though not befor roatsley had remind mr howard of hi promis to interced with my sister and myself to procur him a perus of the manuscript to which in hi narrat he had so often allud so pleas so affect wa i with thi relat that it wa with difficulti i could restrain my too visibl emot and i willingli gave into mr howard hand the dismal packet the mere sight of which as it lie in my bureau often sadden my gayest moment mr roatsley ha been up some time said mr howard and anxiou to present himself to you as a near and tender relat ha wait the hour of your rise with all the impati of a dear and long absent friend mr howard and my

suffici prove how true wa the confess but as i have never befor enjoy the happi of know but one male relat it is no wonder that the acknowledg presenc of anoth should bring the first so forcibl to my memori as wholli to overcom my feel in shelter my weak under thi littl artific i wa hardli guilti of deceit for though my tear did not at that instant owe their sourc to thi caus the veri idea had dure the night drawn shower from my eye and i could not help believ that if our belov father lock down upon hi children he must wit with pleasur even in hi angel state thi reunion with hi famili mr roatsley onli repli by press my hand tenderli in silenc and perceiv the subject as yet too affect for my spirit he forbor dwell on it and shift the convers to topic less interest my heart wa inde so

said he that the two ladi had been unfortun were involv in consequ difficulti and that an applic to lord belmont i conclud for hi interest toward obtain a pension had prove unsuccess my anxieti could not fail to be strongli excit yet as the opportun in a larg compani wa unfavour for enter more fulli on the subject i intend for farther inform to appli next day to mr hindon when i hope to find her disengag and at liberti to satisfi me and in the mean while i determin to enquir of my mother what she knew of the affair as i understood from some word drop by mr hindon that she had interest herself in the applic i seiz the earliest moment i could lay hold of to mention the matter to her and next morn at breakfast ask her if she had ever been told that two young ladi of the name of seymour ladi whose name she had often heard me repeat with everi express of admir had besought my grandfath interest toward procur them an annuiti from govern my mother answer i perfectli recollect she told me she believ such a demand had been made by the ladi in question but that disadvantag report circul against them had arrest hi lordship intend exert in their behalf nor could he think of appli publicli in favor of girl whose conduct by all account would reflect but discredit upon those who interest themselv in their affair it wa in vain continu mr roatsley that i combat these unjust imput with all the argument in my power and appeal to your charact as their guardian so fulli establish in the eye of all favor with your acquaint my mother coolli answer that men even of the strictest probiti were not like to withdraw their protect on account even of the most flagrant improprieti of conduct in young girl commit to their charg and that it wa more than probabl they had even impos on you with a borrow appear of that merit which art could easili assum and beauti suffici enforc thi she said upon second thought seem indisput the case sinc a singl even spent accident in their compani had render me so

been receiv and wa at length unwillingli inform that the woman with whom you lodg when in town had acknowledg to my mother maid that the connect between the ladi and their guardian wa much too intim for the distanc requir between a gentleman of charact and hi ward shock and confound though perfectli satisfi of the infam falsehood of thi scandal aspers i wa determin to have the matter fulli explain and instantli went to the woman hous where have enter into convers with her i enquir particularli about her late guest her answer were ambigu and evas and i soon perceiv the charact of the landladi wa such as must render all inform from that quarter fals and injuri i therefor soon quit her first reprimand her for the infam aspers she had express and assur her that the ladi possess friend who would loudli confut and rigor punish those who might utter them i return home furnish as i imagin with proof and argument more than suffici to overthrow the most determin prejudic but my mother would hardli allow me to enter on the subject and tell me neither herself nor i had ani interest in the behavior of two girl who were unknown to her even by sight and she wa afraid fulli as unknown to me by charact although the acquaint of a few hour had enabl me to judg so perfectli of their disposit posit declar she should on no account be prevail with to interced with lord belmont in

prepossess which might lead me to act contrari to the command of lord belmont whose will in matter of the most trifl moment ha ever been regard as a law in our famili and who it seem ha posit forbidden the protect or counten of my mother to be extend to these amiabl relat inde she might well dread the impetuos of my temper on such an occas would but ill brook the constraint of a prohibit so unnatur and well might she know that no lord belmont on earth would have prevail with me to join in a measur which reason and human must condemn and the most inflex prejudic onli could adopt i
