well distinguish sinc everi one who behold her admir her your ladyship confin your enquiri to her person you tell me and you own that women are much more solicit about the beauti of that than of the mind perhap it may be so and that their envi is much sooner excit by the one than by the other but who madam can describ the person of miss harriet byron and her person onli anim as everi featur is by a mind that bespeak all human excel and dignifi her in everi air in everi look in everi motion no man live ha a greater passion for beauti than i have till i knew miss byron i wa one of those who regard noth els in the sex inde i consid all intellectu seiz as either useless or impertin in women your ladyship know what were my free notion on thi head and ha rebuk me for them a wise and learn ladi i consid as a veri unnatur charact i want women to be all love and noth els a veri littl prudenc allow i to enter into their composit just enough to distinguish the man of sens from the fool and that for my own sake you know i have vaniti madam but love as miss byron person is i defi the greatest sensualist on earth not to admir her mind more than her person what a triumph would the devil have as i have often thought when i have stood contempl her perfect especi at church were he abl to rais up a man that could lower thi angel into woman pardon me your ladyship know my mad way of say everi thing that rise to my thought sweet of temper must make plain featuresglow what an effect must it then have upon fine one never wa there a sweetertemperd woman inde from sixteen to twenti all the sex kept in humor by their hope and by their attract are said to be goodtemperd but she is remark so she is just turn of twenti but look not more than seventeen her beauti hardli yet in it full blow will last longer i imagin than in an earlier blossom yet the prudenc visibl in her whole aspect gave her a distinct even at twelv that promis what she would be at a riper age yet with all thi reign goodnatur visibl in her face and manner there is such a nativ digniti in all she say in all she doe though mingl with a frank that show her mind superior to the mind of almost all other women that it damp and suppress in the most audaci all imagin of bold familiar i know not by my soul how she doe thi neither but so it is she jest she ralli but i can not ralli her again love it is said dignifi the ador object perhap it is that which awe me and now will your ladyship doubt of an affirm answer to your second question whether love ha list me in the number of her particular admir he ha and the devil take me if i can help myself and yet i have no encourag nor ani bodi els that is my consol fenwick is deeper in if possibl than i we had at our first acquaint as you have heard a tiltingbout on the occas but are sworn friend now each have agre to tri hi fortun by patienc and persever and be assur that the one ha no more of her favor to boast of than the other the passag in thi letter thu mark are those which in the preced one are said to be scratch out and yet were legibl by hold up the letter to the light we have inde bluster away between us half a scorc more of her admir poor whine orm howev persever but of him we make no account he ha a wateri head and though he find a way by hi sister who visit at mr selbi and is much esteem there to let miss byron know hi passion for her notwithstand the neg he ha receiv yet doubt we not that she is safe from a flame that he will quench with hi tear befor it can rise to an head to disturb us you ladi love men should whine after you but never yet did i find that where a bluster fellow wa a competitor the ladi marri the milksop but let me in thi particular do miss byron justic how she manag it i can not tell but she is courteou to all nor could ever ani man charg her either with pride or cruelti all i fear is that she ha such an equal in her temper that she can hardli find room in her heart for a particular love nor will till she meet with one whose mind is near as faultless as her own and the gener tenor of whose life and action call upon her discret to give her leav to love thi apprehens i owe to a convers i had with her grandmoth shirley a ladi that is an ornament to old age and who hint to me that her granddaught had except both to fenwick and me on the score of a few indulg that perhap have been too public but which all men of fashion and spirit give themselv and all women but thi allow of or hate not men the wors for but then what is her object to orm he is a sober dog she wa but eight year old when her mother die she also wa an excel woman her death wa brought on by grief for that of her husband which happen but six month befor a rare instanc the grandmoth and aunt to whom the girl is duti to a proverb will not interfer with her choic if they are appli to for their interest the answer is constantli thi the approb of their harriet must first be gain and then their consent is readi there is a mr dean a man of an excel charact for a lawyer but inde he left off practic on come into possess of an handsom estat he wa the girl godfath he is allow to have great influenc over them all harriet call him papa to him i have appli but hi answer is the veri same hi daughter harriet must choos for herself all motion of thi kind must come first from her and ought i to despair of succeed with the girl herself i her grevil not contempt in person in air free and easi at least have a good estat in possess fine expect besid dress well sing well danc well and bless with a moder share of confid which make other women think me a clever fellow she a girl of twenti her fortun between ten and fifteen thousand pound onli for her father consider estat on hi demis for want of male heir went with the name her grandmoth jointur not more than l a year and what though her uncl selbi ha no children and love her yet ha he nephew and niec of hi own whom he also love for thi harriet is hi wife niec i will not despair if resolut if persever will do and if she be a woman she shall be mine and so i have told her aunt selbi and her uncl too and so i have told miss luci selbi her cousin as she call her who is highli and deservedli in her favor and so inde have i more than onc told the girl herself but now to the descript of her person let me die if i know where to begin she is all over loveli doe not everi bodi els who ha seen her tell you so her statur shall i begin with her statur she can not be said to be tall but yet is someth abov the middl her shape but what care i for her shape i who hope to love her still more though possess may make me admir her less when she ha not that to boast of we young fellow who have been abroad are abov regard english shape and prefer to them the french neglig by the way i think the foreign ladi in the right that they aim not at what they can not attain whether we are so much in the right to come into their tast is anoth thing but be thi as it will there is so much eas and digniti in the person in the dress and in everi air and motion of miss harriet byron that fine shape will ever be in fashion where she is be either nativ or foreign the judg her complexion is admir fair and clear i have sat admir her complexion till i have imagin i have seen the lifeblood slow with equal cours through her transluc vein her forehead so nobli free and open show digniti and modesti and strike into one a kind of awe singli contempl that from the delight which accompani the awe i know not how to describ everi singl featur in short will bear the nicest examin and her whole face and her neck so admir set on her finelyproport shoulder let me perish if take all togeth i do not hold her to be the most unexception beauti i ever beheld but what still is her particular excel and distinguish her from all other english women for it must be acknowleg to be a characterist of the french women of qualiti is the grace which that peopl call physiognomi and we may call express had not her seatur and her complexion been so fine as they are that grace alon that soul shine out in her love aspect join with the eas and grace of her motion would have made her as mani admir as behold after thi shall i descend to a more particular descript i will her cheek i never saw a cheek so beauti turn illustr as it is by a charm carmin flush which denot sound health a most bewitch dimpl take place in each when she smile and she ha so much reason to be pleas with herself and with all about her for she is the idol of her relat that i believ from infanc she never frown nor can a frown it is my opinion sit upon her face for a minut would to heaven i were consider enough with her to prove the contrari her mouth there never wa so love a mouth but no wonder sinc such rosi lip and such ivori and even teeth must give beauti to a mouth less charm than her her nose add digniti to her other featur her chin is sweetli turn and almost impercept dimpl her eye ay madam her eye good heaven what a luster yet not a fierc but a mild luster how have i despis the romanc poet for their unnatur descript of the eye of their heroin but i have thought those descript though absurd enough in conscienc less absurd allow someth for poetic licens ever sinc i beheld those of miss harriet byron her hair is a real and unlabour ornament to her all natur it curl art ha no share in the luster it give to her other beauti i mention her neck here i dare not trust myself inimit creatur allattract loveli her arm your ladyship know my passion for a delic arm by my

the foundat of all femal good are to be laid sinc so soon after fourteen they leap into women the dead languag he aim not to teach her lest he should overload her young mind but in the italian and french he made her an adept nor were the advantag common one which she receiv from hi ladi her grandmoth and from her aunt selbi her father sister a woman of equal worthi her grandmoth particularli is one of the most piou yet most cheer of women she will not permit her daughter byron she say to live with her for both their sake for the girl sake becaus there is a greater resort of compani at mr selbi than at shirleymanor and she is afraid as her grandchild ha a seriou turn that her own contempl life may make her more grave than she wish so young a woman to be youth she say is the season for cheer for her own sake becaus she look upon her harriet compani as a cordial too rich to be alway at hand and when she ha a mind to regal she will either send for her fetch her or visit her at mr

usual way and yet perhap the joy of see her newlyarriv friend might have open her lip if so your pardon sweet miss bramber miss salli her younger sister is veri amiabl and veri modest a littl kept down as it seem by the vivac of her elder sister between whose age there are about six or seven year so that miss bramber seem to regard her sister as one whom she is will to rememb as the girl she wa two or three year ago for miss salli is not abov seventeen what confirm me in thi wa that the younger ladi wa a good deal more free when her sister wa withdrawn than when she wa present and again pursedup her realli pretti mouth when she return and her sister address her alway by the word child with an air of eldership while the other call her sister with a look of observ these were the ladi the two gentlemen who came with them were mr barnet a nephew of ladi allestre and mr somner mr somner is a young gentleman late marri veri affect and veri opinion i told mr reev after he wa gone that i believ he wa a dear lover of hi person and she own he wa yet had he no great reason for it it is far from extraordinari though he wa veri gaili dress hi wife it seem wa a young widow of great fortun and till she gave him consequ by fall in love with him he wa thought to be a modest good sort of young man one that had not discov ani more perfect in himself than other peopl beheld in him and thi gave her an excus for like him but now he is loquaci forward bold think meanli of the sex and what is wors not the higher of the ladi for the prefer she ha given him thi gentleman took great notic of me and yet in such a way as to have me think that the approb of so excel a judg as himself did me no small honor mr barnet is a young man that i imagin will be alway young at first i thought him onli a fop he affect to say some thing that though trite were sententi and carri with them the air of observ there is some degre of merit in have such a memori as will help a person to repeat and appli other men wit with some toler proprieti but when he attempt to walk alon he said thing that it wa imposs a man of common sens could say i pronounc therefor boldli about him yet by hi outward appear he may pass for one of your pretti fellow for he dress veri gaili inde if he ha ani tast it is in dress and thi he ha found out for he talk of littl els when he led the talk and boast of sever part of hi what finish him with me wa that as often as the convers seem to take a seriou turn he aros from hi seat and hum an italian air of which howev he knew noth but the sound of hi own voic seem to pleas him thi fine gentleman recollect some highflown compliment and appli them to me look as if he expect i should valu myself upon them no wonder that men in gener think meanli of us women if they believ we have ear to hear and folli to be pleas with the frothi thing that pass under the name of compliment from such randomshoot as these miss steven paid us a visit thi afternoon she is daughter of colonel steven a veri worthi man she appear sensibl and unaffect ha read my cousin say a good deal and yet take no pride in show it miss darlington came with her they are relat thi young ladi ha i find a pretti tast in poetri mr reev prevail on her to show us three of her perform and now as it wa with some reluct that she show them is it fair to say ani thing about them i say it onli to you my friend one wa on the part of two lover veri sensibl and so tender that it show the fair writer knew how to describ the pang that may be innoc allow to aris on such an occas one on the morningdawn and sunris a subject that gave credit to herself for she is it seem a veri earli riser i petit for a copi of thi for the sake of two or three of my dear cousin as well as to confirm my own practic but i wa modestli refus the third wa on the death of a favorit linnet a littl too pathet for the occas sinc were miss darlington to have lost her best and dearest friend i imagin that she had in thi piec which is pretti long exhaust the subject and must borrow from it some of the imag which she introduc to heighten her distress for the loss of the littl songster it is a veri difficult matter i believ for young person of geniu to reinin their imagin a great flow of spirit and great store of imag croud in upon them carri them too frequent abov their subject and they are apt rather to say all that may be said on their favorit topic than what is proper to be said but it is a pretti piec howev thursday morn ladi betti william sup with us the same even she is an agreeabl woman the widow of a veri worthi man a near relat of mr reev she ha a great and just regard for my cousin and consult him in all affair of import she seem to be turn of forti ha a son and a daughter but they are both abroad for educ it hurt me to hear her declar that she care not for the troubl of educ and that she had thi pleasur which girl brought up at home seldom give their mother that she and miss william alway saw each other and alway part as lover sure there must be some fault either in the temper of the mother or in the behavior of the daughter and if so i doubt it will not be amend by see each other but seldom do not lover thu cheat and impos upon one anoth the young gentleman is about seventeen hi sister about fifteen and as i understand she is a veri live and it is fear a forward girl shall we wonder if in a few year time she should make such a choic for her husband as ladi betti would least of all choos for a soninlaw what influenc can a mother expect to have over a daughter from whom she so voluntarili estrang herself and from whose exampl the daughter can receiv onli hearsay benefit but after all methink i hear my correct uncl ask may not ladi betti have better reason for her conduct in thi particular than she gave you she may my uncl and i hope she ha but i wish she had condescend to give those better reason sinc she gave ani and then you had not been troubl with the impertin remark of your sauci kinswoman ladi betti wa so kind as to take great notic of me she desir to be one in everi parti of pleasur that i am to be engag in person who were often at public place she observ took as much delight in accompani stranger to them as if they were their own the apt comparison she said the new remark the pretti wonder the agreeabl passion excit in such on the occas alway gave her high entertain and she wa sure from the observ of such a young ladi civilli bow to me she should be equal delight and improv i bow in silenc i love not to make disqualifi speech by such we seem to intim that we believ the compliment to be in earnest or perhap that we think the compliment our due and want to hear it either repeat or confirm and yet possibl we have not that pretti confus and those transient blush readi which mr grevil archli say are alway to be at hand when we affect to disclaim the prais given us ladi betti wa so good as to stop there though the muscl of her agreeabl face show a polit promptitud had i by disclaim her compliment provok them to perform their offic am i not a sauci creatur i know i am but i dislik not ladi betti for all that i am to be carri by her to a masquerad to a ridotto when the season come to ranelagh and vauxhal in the mean time to ball rout drum and soforth and to qualifi me for these latter i am to be taught all the fashion game did my dear grandmamma twenti or thirti year ago think she should live to be told that to the danc master the sing or musicmast the high mode would requir the gamingmast to be ad for the complet of the femal educ ladi betti will kindli take the lead in all these divers and now luci will you not repeat your wish that i return to you with a sound heart and are you not afraid that i shall becom a modern fine ladi as to the latter fear i will tell you when you shall suspect me if you find that i prefer the highest of these entertain or the opera itself well as i love music to a good play of our favorit shakespear then my luci let your heart ach for your harriet then be apprehens that she is laid hold on by leviti that she is captiv by the eye and the ear that her heart is infect by the modern tast and that she will carri down with her an appetit to pernici game and in order to support her extravag will think of punish some honest man in marriag jame ha signifi to salli hi wish to be allow to return to selbyhous i have not therefor bought him the new liveri i design for him on come to town i can not bear an unchear brow in a servant and he own to me on my talk with him hi desir to return i have promis that he shall as soon as mr reev ha provid me with anoth servant silli fellow but i hope my aunt will not dismiss him upon it the servant i may hire may not care to go into the countri perhap or may not so behav as that i should choos to take him down with me and jame is honest and hi mother would break her heart if he should be dismiss our servic sever servant have alreadi offer themselv but as i think peopl are answer for the charact of such as they choos for their domest i find no small difficulti in fix i am not of the mind of that great man whose goodnatur reason for sometim prefer men noway deserv wa that he love to be a friend to those whom no other person would befriend thi wa carri hi good veri far if he made it not an excus for himself for have promot a man who prove bad afterward rather than as suppos him to be so at the time sinc els he seem not to consid that everi bad man he promot ran away with the reward due to a better mr and mr reev are so kind to me and their servant are so readi to oblig me that i shall not be veri uneasi if i can not soon get one to my mind onli if i could fix on such a one and if my grandmamma oliv should leav her as she suppos he will now he ha marri ellen as soon as a good inn offer jame may suppli oliv place and the new servant may continu mine instead of jame and now that i have gone so low dont you wish me to put an end to thi letter i believ you do well then with duti and love ever rememb where so justli due believ me to be my dear luci your truli affection harriet byron i will write separ to what you say of mr grevil mr fenwick and miss orm yet hope to be time enough for the post letter vi miss byron to miss selbi sat jan as to what you say of mr grevil concern on my absenc and i think with a littl too much feel for him and of hi declar himself unabl to live without see me i have but one fear about it which is that he is form a pretens from hi violent love to come up after me and if he doe i will not see him if i can help it and do you inde believ him to be so much in love by your serious on the occas you seem to think he is o my luci what a good heart you have and did he not weep when he told you so did he not turn hi head away and pull out hi handkerchief o these dissembl the hyaena my dear wa a male devour the men in malic and to extenu their own guilt made the creatur a femal and yet there may be male and femal of thi speci of monster but as women have more to lose with regard to reput than men the male hyaena must be infinit the more danger creatur of the two sinc he will come to us even into our veri hous fawn cring weep lick our hand while the den of the femal is by the highwaysid and wretch youth must enter into it to put it in her power to devour them let me tell you my dear that if there be an art man in england with regard to us women art equal in hi free speak and in hi sycoph mr grevil is the man and he intend to be so too and valu himself upon hi art doe he not as boldli as constantli insinu that flatteri is dearer to a woman than her food yet who so gross a flatter as himself when the humor is upon him and yet at time he want to build up a merit for sincer or plaindeal by say free thing it is not difficult my dear to find out these men were we earnest to detect them their chief strength lie in our weak but howev weak we are i think we should not add to the triumph of those who make our weak the gener subject of their satir we should not prove the justic of their ridicul by our own indiscret but the traitor is within us if we guard against ourselv we may bid defianc to all the art of man you know that my great object to mr grevil is for hi immor a man of free principl shown by practic as free can hardli make a tender husband were a woman abl to get over consider that she ought not to get over who shall trust for the perform of hi second duti the man who avowedli despis hi first mr grevil had a good educ he must have taken pain to render vain the piou precept of hi worthi father and still more to make a jest of them three of hi women we have heard of besid her whom he brought with him from wale you know he ha onli affect to appear decent sinc he ha cast hi eye upon me the man my dear must be an abandon man and must have a veri hard heart who can pass from woman to woman without ani remors for a former whom as may be suppos he ha by the most solemn vow seduc and whose leav is it my dear that a virtuou woman take who marri a proflig is it not report that hi welshwoman to whom at part he gave not suffici for a twelvemonth scanti subsist is now upon the town vile man he think it to hi credit i have heard to own it a seduct and that she wa not a viciou creatur till he made her so one onli merit ha mr grevil to plead in thi black transact it is that he ha by hi whole conduct in it ad a warn to our sex and shall i despis the warn marri a man who speciou as he is in hi temper and live in hi convers ha shown so bad a natur hi fortun as you say is great the more inexcus therefor is he for hi niggardli to hi welshwoman on hi fortun he presum it will procur him a too easi forgiv from other of our sex but fortun without merit will never do with me were the man a princ you say that if a woman resolv not to marri till she find herself address to by a man of strict virtu she must be for ever singl if thi be true what wick creatur are men what a dread abus of passion given them for the noblest purpos are they guilti of i have a veri high notion of the marriagest i rememb what my uncl onc aver that a woman out of wedlock is half useless to the end of her be how inde do the duti of a good wife of a good mother and a worthi matron well perform dignifi a woman let my aunt selbi exampl in her enlarg sphere set against that of ani singl woman of like year move in her narrow circl testifi the truth of the observ my grandfath use to say that famili are littl commun that there are but few solid friendship out of them and that they help to make up worthili and to secur the great commun of which they are so mani miniatur but yet it is my opinion and i hope that i never by my practic shall discredit it that a woman who with her eye open marri a proflig man had gener much better remain singl all her life sinc it is veri like that by such a step she defeat as to herself all the good end of societi what a dread what a presumptu risqu run she who marri a wick man even hope to reclaim him when she can not be sure of keep her own principl be not deceiv evil commun corrupt good manner is a caution truli apostol the text you mention of the unbeliev husband be convert by the believ wife respect as i take it the first age of christian and is an instruct to the convert wife to let her unconvert husband see in her behavior to him while he beheld her chast convers coupl with fear the efficaci upon her own heart of the excel doctrin she had embrac it could not have in view the woman who be singl chose a pagan husband in hope of convert him nor can it give encourg for a woman of virtu and religion to marri a proflig in hope of reclaim him who can touch pitch and not be defil as to mr fenwick i am far from have a better opinion of him than i have of mr grevil you know what is whisper of him he ha more decenc howev he avow not free principl as the other doe but you must have observ how much he seem to enjoy the mad talk and free sentiment of the other and that other alway brighten up and rise in hi freedom and impieti on mr fenwick sti applaus and encourag counten in a word mr fenwick not have the same live thing to say nor so live an air to carri them off as mr grevil ha though he would be thought not to want sens take pain to show that he ha as corrupt an heart if i thought anger would not give him consequ i should hardli forbear to show myself displeas when he point by a leer eye and by a broad smile the free jest of the other to the person present whom he think most apt to blush as if for fear it should be lost and still more when on the mantl cheek show the sensibl of the person so insult he break out into a loud laugh that she may not be abl to recov herself sure these men must think us women egregi hypocrit they must believ that we onli affect modesti and in our heart approv of their freedom for can it be suppos that such as call themselv gentlemen and who have had the educ and opportun that these two have had would give themselv liberti of speech on purpos to affront us i hope i shall find the london gentlemen more polit than these our neighbor of the foxchac and yet hitherto i have seen no great caus to prefer them to the other but about the court and at the fashion public place i expect wonder pray heaven i may not be disappoint thank miss orm in my name for the kind wish she send me tell her that her doubt of my affect for her are not just and that i do realli and inde love her nor should she want the most explicit declar of my love were i not more afraid of her in the charact of a sister to a truli respect man than doubt of her in that of a friend to me in which latter light i even joy to consid her but she is a littl naughti tell her becaus she is alway lead to one subject and yet how can i be angri with her for it if her good opinion of me induc her to think it in my power to make the brother happi whom she so dearli and deservedli love i can not but esteem her for the part she take and thi it is that make me afraid of the artleslyart miss orm it would look as if i thought my duti and love and respect were question if
