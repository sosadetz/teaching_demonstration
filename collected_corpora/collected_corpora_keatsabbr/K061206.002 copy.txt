look as if the man wa asham of what he ha done do you choos to see him miss oh no repli henrietta it would be strang inde if i wa will to see a man whom you suspect of have such shock design and who i

is a great misfortun to meet with person who abus our confid and the good opinion we have of them that misfortun said mr willi will in time becom so common that you will feel it less sensibl than you do now the onli way to avoid be deceiv is to be alway upon your guard against deceit that is to say i must be alway suspici said henrietta that may be a veri prudent maxim but my heart disavow it ala my dear repli mr willi we all enter upon the world with high notion of disinterested friendship sincer and candor but experi show us that these qualiti exist not or among so veri few that it doe not fall to the lot of one mortal in a thousand to meet with them in those we contract friendship with the frequent disappoint we suffer in the search of them make suspicion grow into a habit of think which if it lessen our enjoy lessen our inconveni likewis then i said miss courteney shall be alway expos to inconveni for i am sure i can never bring myself to suspect person who appear deserv of my

meritori the fault of the world can onli be learn by a long acquaint with it and by suffer from that acquaint those who deriv thi kind of knowledg from the heart rather than the head are inde safe themselv but danger to all other but i will keep you no longer in suspens with regard to mr bale he ha gloss over hi behavior so as to make me appear satisfi with it which inde it is necessari i should if i would not wish to make an enemi of him and a veri power one he might be to my husband he ask for you as soon as he saw me and did not seem surpris at the veri slight excus i made for your not see him he express great concern for the treatment you had receiv from hi wife for in her frantic rage it seem she told him all that had pass between you you find said he i did not exagger my wife fail it is a great misfortun repli i but sir i think if you had not made a secret of your connect with miss courteney mr bale jealousi would not have had so plausibl an excus nor would the young ladi have had ani reason to complain of you i should have found it absolut imposs said he to have concern myself in miss courteney affair or been of the least use to her had my wife known ani thing of the matter the veri fight of miss courteney would have rous her suspicion and have put it out of my power to act either as a friend or guardian by her and in her unhappi situat she had great need of my care and attent howev sir repli i it wa certainli ill judg to conceal from miss courteney that you wa marri what must she think of such a strang conduct whi mr willi resum he i have alreadi told you

some foreign merchant come to resid in my hous and that she wa to be remov for that reason i surpris her greatli by say i had heard noth of it and inde i am a good deal surpris myself at it whi to be
