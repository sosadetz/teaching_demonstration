day chap i a comparison between the world and the stage the world ha been often compar to the theater and mani grave writer as well as the poet have consid human life as a great drama resembl in almost everi particular those scenic represent which thespi is first report to have invent and which have been sinc receiv with so much approb and delight in all polit countri thi thought ha been carri so far and becom so gener that some word proper to the theater and which were at first metaphor appli to the world are now indiscrimin and liter spoken of both thu stage and scene are by common use grown as familiar to us when we speak of life in gener as when we confin ourselv to dramat perform and when we mention transact behind the curtain st jamess is more like to occur to our thought than druri lane it may seem easi enough to account for all thi by reflect that the theatric stage is noth more than a represent or as aristotl call it an imit of what realli exist and henc perhap we might fairli pay a veri high compliment to those who by their write or action have been so capabl of imit life as to have their pictur in a manner confound with or mistaken for the origin but in realiti we are not so fond of pay compliment to these peopl whom we use as children frequent do the instrument of their amus and have much more pleasur in hiss and buffet them than in admir their excel there are mani other reason which have induc us to see thi analog between the world and the stage some have consid the larger part of mankind in the light of actor as person charact no more their own and to which in fact they have no better titl than the player ha to be in earnest thought the king or emperor whom he repres thu the hypocrit may be said to be a player and inde the greek call them both by one and the same name the breviti of life ha likewis given occas to thi comparison so the immort shakespear life a poor player that storm and strut hi hour upon the stage and then is heard no more for which hackney quotat i will make the reader amend by a veri nobl one which few i believ have read it is taken from a poem call the deiti publish about nine year ago and long sinc buri in oblivion a proof that good book no more than good men do alway surviv the bad from thee the deiti all human action take their spring the rise of empir and the fall of king see the vast theater of time display while over the scene succeed hera tread with pomp the shine imag succeed what leader triumph and what monarch bleed perform the part thi provid assign their pride their passion to thi end inclin a while they glitter in the face of day then at thi nod the phantom pass away no trace left of all the busi scene but that remembr say the thing have been in all these howev and in everi other similitud of life to the theater the resembl ha been alway taken from the stage onli none as i rememb have at all consid the audienc at thi great drama but as natur often exhibit some of her best perform to a veri full hous so will the behavior of our spectat no less admit the abov mention comparison than that of her actor in thi vast theater of time are seat the friend and the critic here are clap and shout hiss and groan in short everi thing which wa ever seen or heard at the theater royal let us examin thi in one exampl for instanc in the behavior of the great audienc on that scene which natur wa pleas to exhibit in the th chapter of the preced book where she introduc black georg run away with the l from hi friend and benefactor those who sat in the world upper galleri treat that incid i am well convinc with their usual vocifer and everi term of scurril reproach wa most probabl vent on that occas if we had descend to the next order of spectat we should have found an equal degre of abhorr though less of nois and scurril yet here the good women gave black georg to the devil and mani of them expect everi minut that the clovenfoot gentleman would fetch hi own the pit as usual wa no doubt divid those who delight in heroic virtu and perfect charact object to the produc such instanc of villaini without punish them veri sever for the sake of exampl some of the author friend cri look gentlemen the man is a villain but it is natur for all that and all the young critic of the age the clerk apprentic etc call it low and fell a groan as for the box they behav with their accustom polit most of them were attend to someth els some of those few who regard the scene at all declar he wa a bad kind of man while other refus to give their opinion till they had heard the best judg now we who are admit behind the scene of thi great theater of natur and no author ought to write ani thing besid dictionari and spellingbook who ha not thi privileg can censur the action without conceiv ani absolut detest of the person whom perhap natur may not have design to act an ill part in all her drama for in thi instanc life most exactli resembl the stage sinc it is often the same person who repres the villain and the hero and he who engag your admir today will probabl attract your contempt tomorrow as garrick whom i regard in tragedi to be the greatest geniu the world ha ever produc sometim condescend to play the fool so did scipio the great and laeliu the wise accord to horac mani year ago nay cicero report them to have been incred childish these it is true play the fool like my friend garrick in jest onli but sever emin charact have in numberless instanc of their live play the fool egregi in earnest so far as to render it a matter of some doubt whether their wisdom or folli wa predomin or whether they were better entitl to the applaus or censur the admir or contempt the love or hatr of mankind those person inde who have pass ani time behind the scene of thi great theater and are thoroughli acquaint not onli with the sever disguis which are there put on but also with the fantast and caprici behavior of the passion who are the manag and director of thi theater for as to reason the patente he is known to be a veri idl fellow and seldom to exert himself may most probabl have learn to constru the famou nil admirari of horac or in the english phrase to stare at noth a singl bad act no more constitut a villain in life than a singl bad part on the stage the passion like the manag of a playhous often forc men upon part without consult their judgment and sometim without ani regard to their talent thu the man as well as the player may condemn what he himself act nay it is common to see vice sit as awkwardli on some men as the charact of iago would on the honest face of mr william mill upon the whole then the man of candor and of true understand is never hasti to condemn he can censur an imperfect or even a vice without rage against the guilti parti in a word they are the same folli the same childish the same illbreed and the same ill natur which rais all the clamour and uproar both in life and on the stage the worst of men gener have the word rogu and villain most in their mouth as the lowest of all wretch are the aptest to cri out low in the pit chap ii contain a convers which mr jone had with himself jone receiv hi effect from mr

nor did her brother or her niec think proper either to stop or to follow her for the one wa so much possess by concern and the other by anger that they were render almost motionless the squir howev sent after hi sister the same holla which attend the departur of a hare when she is first start befor the hound he wa inde a great master of thi kind of vocifer and had a holla proper for most occas in life women who like mr western know the world and have appli themselv to philosophi and polit would have immedi avail themselv of the present disposit of mr western mind by throw in a few art compliment to hi understand at the expens of hi absent adversari but poor sophia wa all simplic by which word we do not intend to insinu to the reader that she wa silli which is gener understood as a

but after give her a dodg here is anoth b follow me upon the foil but curs my jacket if i will be run down in thi manner by ani oum sophia never had a singl disput with her father till thi unlucki affair of blifil on ani account except in defens of her mother whom she had love most tenderli though she lost her in the eleventh year of her age the squir to whom that poor woman had been a faith upper servant all the time of their marriag had return that behavior by make what the world call a good husband he veri seldom swore at her perhap not abov onc a week and never beat her she had not the least occas for jealousi and wa perfect mistress of her time for she wa never interrupt by her husband who wa engag all the morn in hi field exercis and all the even with bottlecompanion she scarc inde ever saw him but at meal where she had the pleasur of carv those dish which she had befor attend at the dress from these meal she retir about five minut after the other servant have onli stay to drink the king over the water such were it seem mr western order for it wa a maxim with him that women should come in with the first dish and go out after the first glass obedi to these order wa perhap no difficult task for the convers if it may be call so wa seldom such as could entertain a ladi it consist chiefli of hollow sing relat of sport adventur b d y and abus of women and of the govern these howev were the onli season when mr western saw hi wife for when he repair to her bed he wa gener so drunk that he could not see and in the sport season he alway rose from her befor it wa light thu wa she perfect mistress of her time and had besid a coach and four usual at her command though unhappili inde the bad of the neighborhood and of the road made thi of littl use for none who had set much valu on their neck would have pass through the one or who had set ani valu on their hour would have visit the other now to deal honestli with the reader she did not make all the return expect to so much indulg for she had been marri against her will by a fond father the match have been rather advantag on her side for the squir estat wa upward of l a year and her fortun no more than a bare l henc perhap she had contract a littl gloomi of temper for she wa rather a good servant than a good wife nor had she alway the gratitud to return the extraordinari degre of roar mirth with which the squir receiv her even with a good humour smile she would moreov sometim interfer with matter which did not concern her as the violent drink of her husband which in the gentlest term she would take some of the few opportun he gave her of remonstr against and onc in her life she veri earnestli entreat him to carri her for two month to london which he peremptorili deni nay wa angri with hi wife for the request ever after be well assur that all the husband in london are cuckold for thi last and mani other good reason western at length heartili hate hi wife and thi hatr as he never conceal befor her death so he never forgot it afterward but when ani thing in the least sour him as a bad scent day or a distemp among hi hound or ani other such misfortun he constantli vent hi spleen by invect against the deceas say if my wife wa aliv now she would be glad of thi these invect he wa especi desir of throw forth befor sophia for as he love her more than he did ani other so he wa realli jealou that she had love her mother better than him and thi jealousi sophia seldom fail of heighten on these occas for he wa not content with violat her ear with the abus of her mother but endeavor to forc an explicit approb of all thi abus with which desir he never could prevail upon her by ani promis or threat to compli henc some of my reader will perhap wonder that the squir had not hate sophia as much as he had hate her mother but i must inform them that hatr is not the effect of love even through the medium of jealousi it is inde veri possibl for jealou person to kill the object of their jealousi but not to hate them which sentiment be a pretti hard morsel and bear someth of the air of a paradox we shall leav the reader to chew the cud upon it to the end of the chapter chap v the gener behavior of sophia toward her aunt sophia kept silenc dure the forego speech of her father nor did she onc answer otherwis than with a sigh but as he understood none of the languag or as he call it lingo of the eye so he wa not satisfi without some further approb of hi sentiment which he now demand in the usual way of hi daughter tell her he expect she wa readi to take the part of

express the greatest affect for you and i am convinc so far from her be the worst sister in the world there are veri few who love a brother better the english of all which is answer the squir that i am in the wrong ay certainli ay to be sure the woman is in the right and the man in the wrong alway pardon me sir cri sophia i do not say so what dont you say answer the father you have the impud to

express against hi daughter he depart as fast as he could to recov hi sister befor her equipag could be gotten readi sophia then retir to her chamber of mourn where she indulg herself if the phrase may be allow me in all the luxuri of tender grief she read over the letter which she had receiv from jone more than onc her muff too wa use on thi occas and she bath both these as well as herself with her tear in thi situat the friendli mr honor exert her utmost abil to comfort her afflict mistress she ran over the name of mani young gentlemen and have greatli commend their part and person assur sophia that she might take her choic of ani these method must have certainli been use with some success in disord of the like kind or so skil a practition as mr honor would never have ventur to appli them nay i have heard that the colleg of chambermaid hold them to be as sovereign remedi as ani in the femal dispensari but whether it wa that sophia diseas differ inwardli from those case with which it agre in extern symptom i will not assert but in fact the good wait woman did more harm than good and at last so incens her mistress which wa no easi matter that with an angri voic she dismiss her from her presenc chap vi contain great varieti of matter the squir overtook hi sister just as she wa step into the coach and partli by forc and partli by solicit prevail upon her to order her hors back into their quarter he succeed in thi attempt without much difficulti for the ladi wa as we have alreadi hint of a most placabl disposit and greatli love her brother though she despis hi part or rather hi littl knowledg of the world poor sophia who had first set on foot thi reconcili wa now made the sacrific to it they both concur in their censur on her conduct jointli declar war against her and directli proceed to council how to carri it on in the most vigor manner for thi purpos mr western propos not onli an immedi conclus of the treati with allworthi but as immedi to carri it into execut say that there wa no other way to succeed with her niec but by violent method which she wa convinc sophia had not suffici resolut to resist by violent say she i mean rather hasti measur for as to confin or absolut forc no such thing must or can be attempt our plan must be concert for a surpris and not for a storm these matter were resolv on when mr blifil came to pay a visit to hi mistress the squir no sooner heard of hi arriv than he step asid by hi sister advic to give hi daughter order for the proper recept of her lover which he did with the most bitter execr and denunci of of judgment on her refus the impetuos of the squir bore down all befor him and sophia as her aunt veri wise foresaw wa not abl to resist him she agre therefor to see blifil though she had scarc spirit or strength suffici to utter her assent inde to give a peremtori denial to a father whom she so tenderli love wa no easi task had thi circumst been out of the case much less resolut than what she wa realli mistress of would perhap have serv her but it is no unusu thing to ascrib those action entir to fear which are in a great measur produc by love in pursuanc therefor of her father peremptori command sophia now admit mr blifil visit scene like thi when paint at larg afford as we have observ veri littl entertain to the reader here therefor we shall strictli adher to a rule of horac by which writer are direct to pass over all those matter which they despair of place in a shine light a rule we conceiv of excel use as well to the historian as to the poet and which if follow must at least have thi good effect that mani a great evil for so all great book are call would thu be reduc to a small one it is possibl the great art use by blifil at thi interview would have prevail on sophia to have made anoth man in hi circumst her confid and to have reveal the whole secret of her heart to him but she had contract so ill an opinion of thi young gentleman that she wa resolv to place no confid in him for simplic when set on it is guard is often a match for cun her behavior to him therefor wa entir forc and inde such as is gener prescrib to virgin upon the second formal visit from one who is appoint for their husband but though blifil declar himself perfectli satisfi with hi recept to the squir yet that gentleman who in compani with hi sister had overheard all wa not so well pleas he resolv in pursuanc of the advic of the sage ladi to push matter as forward as possibl and address himself to hi intend soninlaw in the hunt phrase he cri after a loud holla follow her boy follow her run in run in that is it honey dead dead dead never be bash nor stand shall i shall i allworthi and i can finish all matter between us thi afternoon and let us have the wed tomorrow blifil have convey the utmost satisfact into hi counten answer as there is noth sir in thi world which i so eagerli desir as an allianc with your famili except my union with the most amiabl and deserv sophia you may easili imagin how impati i must be to see myself in possess of my two highest wish if i have not therefor importun you on thi head you will imput it onli to my fear of offend the ladi by endeavor to hurri on so bless an event faster than a strict complianc with all the rule of decenc and decorum will permit but if by your interest sir she might be induc to dispens with ani formal formal with a pox answer the squir pooh all stuff and nonsens i tell thee she shall have thee tomorrow you will know the world better hereaft when you come to my age women never gi their consent man if they can help it it is not the fashion if i had staid for her momoth consent i might have been a bachelor to thi day to her to her to her that is it you jolli dog i tell thee shat have her tomorrow morn blifil suffer himself to be overpow by the forcibl rhetor of the squir and it be agre that western should close with allworthi that veri afternoon the lover depart home have first earnestli beg that no violenc might be offer to the ladi by thi hast in the same manner as a popish inquisitor beg the lay power to do no violenc to the heret deliv over to it and against whom the church ha pass sentenc and to say the truth blifil had pass sentenc against sophia for howev pleas he had declar himself to western with hi recept he wa by no mean satisfi unless it wa that he wa satisfi of the hatr and scorn of hi mistress and thi had produc no less reciproc hatr and scorn in him it may perhap be ask whi then did he not put an immedi end to all further courtship i answer for that veri reason as well as for sever other equal good which we shall now proceed to open to the reader though mr blifil wa not of the complexion of jone nor readi to eat everi woman he saw yet he wa far from be destitut of that appetit which is said to be the common properti of anim with thi he had the distinguish tast which serv to direct men in their choic of the object or food of their sever appetit and thi taught him to consid sophia as a most delici morsel inde to regard her with the same desir which an ortolan inspir into the soul on epicur now the agoni which affect the mind of sophia rather augment than impair her beauti for her tear ad bright to her eye and her breast rose higher with her sigh inde no one ha seen beauti in it highest luster who ha never seen it in distress blifil therefor look on thi human ortolan with greater desir than when he had view her last nor wa hi desir at all lessen by the avers which he discov in her to himself on the contrari thi serv rather to heighten the pleasur he propos in rifl her charm as it ad triumph to lust nay he had some further view from obtain the absolut possess of her person which we detest too much even to mention and reveng itself wa not without it share in the gratif which he promis himself the rival poor jone and supplant him in her affect ad anoth spur to hi pursuit and promis anoth addit raptur to hi enjoy besid all these view which to some scrupul person may seem to savor too much of malevol he had one prospect which few reader will regard with ani great abhorr and thi wa the estat of mr western which wa all to be settl on hi daughter and her issu for so extravag wa the affect of that fond parent that provid hi child would but consent to be miser with the husband he chose he care not at what price he purchas him for these reason mr blifil wa so desir of the match that he intend to deceiv sophia by pretend love to her and to deceiv her father and hi own uncl by pretend he wa belov by her in do thi he avail himself of the pieti of thwackum who held that if the end propos wa religi as sure matrimoni is it matter not how wick were the mean as to other occas he use to appli the philosophi of squar which taught that the end wa immateri so that the mean were fair and consist with moral rectitud to say truth there were few occurr in life on which he could not draw advantantag from the precept of one or other of those great master littl deceit wa inde necessari to be practic on mr western who thought the inclin of hi daughter of as littl consequ as blifil himself conceiv them to be but as the sentiment of mr allworthi were of a veri differ kind so it wa absolut necessari to impos on him in thi howev blifil wa so well assist by western that he succeed without difficulti for as mr allworthi had been assur by her father that sophia had a proper affect for blifil and that all which he had suspect concern jone wa entir fals blifil had noth more to do than to confirm these assert which he did with such equivoc that he preserv a salvo for hi conscienc and had the satisfact of convey a lie to hi uncl without the guilt of tell one when he wa examin touch the inclin of sophia by allworthi who said he would on no account be accessori to the forc a young ladi into a marriag contrari to her own will he answer that the real sentiment of young ladi were veri difficult to be understood that her behavior to him wa full as forward as he wish it and that if he could believ her father she had all the affect for him which ani lover could desir as for jone said he whom i am loath to call villain though hi behavior to you sir suffici justifi the appel hi own vaniti or perhap some wick view might make him boast of a falsehood for if there had been ani realiti in miss western love to him the great of her fortun would never have suffer him to desert her as you are well inform he ha lastli sir i promis you i would not myself for ani consider no not for the whole world consent to marri thi young ladi if i wa not persuad she had all the passion for me which i desir she should have thi excel method of convey a falsehood with the heart onli without make the tongu guilti of an untruth by the mean of equivoc and impostur ha quiet the conscienc of mani a notabl deceiv and yet when we consid that it is omnisci on which these endeavor to impos it may possibl seem capabl onli of afford a veri superfici comfort and that thi art and refin distinct between commun a lie and tell one is hardli worth the pain it cost them allworthi wa pretti well satisfi with what mr western and mr blifil told him and the treati wa now at the end of two day conclud noth then remain previou to the offic of the priest but the offic of the lawyer which threaten to take up so much time that western offer to bind himself by all manner of coven rather than to defer the happi of the young coupl inde he wa so veri earnest and press that an indiffer person might have conclud he wa more a princip in thi match than he realli wa but thi eager wa natur to him on all occas and he conduct everi scheme he undertook in such a manner as if the success of that alon wa suffici to constitut the whole happi of hi life the joint importun of both father and soninlaw would probabl have prevail on mr allworthi who brook but ill ani delay of give happi to other had not sophia herself prevent it and taken measur to put a final end to the whole treati and to rob both church and law of those tax which these wise bodi have thought proper to receiv from the propag of the human speci in a law manner of which in the next chapter chap vii a strang resolut of sophia and a more strang stratagem of mr honor though mr honor wa princip attach to her interest she wa not without some littl attach to sophia to say truth it wa veri difficult for ani one to know that young ladi without love her she no sooner therefor heard a piec of news which she imagin to be of great import to her mistress than quit forget the anger which she had conceiv two day befor at her unpleas dismiss from sophia presenc she ran hastili to inform her of thi news the begin of her discours wa as abrupt as her entranc into the room o dear maam say

on way and mean of execut their project here a veri stubborn difficulti occur and thi wa the remov of their effect which wa much more easili got over by the mistress than by the maid for when a ladi ha onc taken a resolut to run to a lover or to run from him all obstacl are consid as trifl but honor wa inspir by no such motiv she had no raptur to expect nor ani terror to shun and besid the real valu of her cloth i which consist great part of her fortun she had a caprici fond for sever gown and other thing either becaus they becam her or becaus they were given her by such a particular person becaus she had brought them late or becaus she had had them long or for some other reason equal good so that she could not endur the thought of leav the poor thing behind her expos to the merci of western who she doubt not would make them suffer martyrdom in hi rage the ingeni mr honor have appli all her oratori to dissuad her mistress from her purpos when the found her posit determin at last start the follow expedi to remov her cloth viz to get herself turn out of door that veri even sophia highli approv thi method but doubt how it might be brought about oh maam cri honor your laship may trust that to me we servant veri well know how to obtain thi favor of our master and mistress though sometim inde where they owe us more wage than they can readili pay they will put up with all our affront and will hardli take ani warn we can give them but the squir is none of those and sinc your laship is resolv upon set out to night i warrant i get discharg thi afternoon it wa then resolv that she should pack up some linen and a nightgown for sophia with her own thing and as for all her other cloth the young ladi abandon them with no more remors than the sailor feel when he throw over the good of other in order to save hi own life chap viii contain scene of alterc of no veri uncommon kind mr honor had scarc sooner part from her young ladi than someth for i would not like the old woman in quivedo injur the devil by ani fals accus and possibl he might have no hand in it but someth i say suggest to her that by sacrif sophia and all her secret to mr western she might probabl make her fortun mani consider urg thi discoveri the fair prospect of a handsom reward for so great and accept a servic to the squir tempt her avaric and again the danger of the enterpris she had undertaken the incertainti of it success night cold robber ravish all alarm her fear so forcibl did all these oper upon her that she wa almost determin to go directli to the squir and to lay open the whole affair she wa howev too upright a judg to decre on one side befor she had heard the other and here first a journey to london appear veri strongli in support of sophia she eagerli long to see a place in which she fanci charm short onli of those which a raptur saint imagin in heaven in the next place as she knew sophia to have much more generos than her master so her fidel promis her a greater reward than she could gain by treacheri she then crossexamin all the articl which had rais her fear on the other side and found on fairli sift the matter that there wa veri littl in them and now both scale be reduc to a pretti even balanc her love to her mistress be thrown into the scale of her integr made that rather preponder when a circumst struck upon her imagin which might have had a danger effect had it whole weight been fairli put into the other scale thi wa the length of time which must interven befor sophia would be abl to fulfil her promis for though she wa entitl to her mother fortun at the death of her father and to the sum of l left her by an uncl when she came of age yet these were distant day and mani accid might prevent the intend generos of the young ladi wherea the reward she might expect from mr western were immedi but while she wa pursu thi thought the good geniu of sophia or that which presid over the integr of mr honor or perhap mere chanc sent an accid in her way which at onc preserv her fidel and even facilit their intend busi mr western maid claim great superior over mr honor on sever account first her birth wa higher for her great grandmoth by the mother side wa a cousin not far remov to an irish peer secondli her wage were greater and lastli she had been at london and had of consequ seen more of the world she had alway behav therefor to mr honor with that reserv and had alway exact of her those mark of distinct which everi order of femal preserv and requir in convers with those of an inferior order now as honor did not at all time agre with thi doctrin but would frequent break in upon the respect which the other demand mr western maid wa not at all pleas with her compani inde she earnestli long to return home to the hous of her mistress where she domin at will over all the other servant she had been greatli therefor disappoint in the morn when mr western had chang her mind on the veri point of departur and had been in what is vulgarli call a glout humor ever sinc in thi humor which wa none of the sweetest she came into the room where honor wa debat with herself in the manner we have abov relat honor no sooner saw her than she address her in the follow oblig phrase soh madam i find we are to have the pleasur of your compani longer which i wa afraid the quarrel between my master and your ladi would have rob us of i dont
