  THIS POEM IS INSCRIBED,
  BY
  ROBERT SOUTHEY.


PREFACE.

IN the religion of the Hindoos, which of all false religions is the
most monstrous in its fables, and the most fatal in its effects, there
is one remarkable peculiarity. Prayers, penances, and sacrifices, are
supposed to possess an inherent and actual value, in no degree
depending upon the disposition or motive of the person who performs
them. They are drafts upon Heaven, for which the Gods cannot refuse
payment. The worst men, bent upon the worst designs, have in this
manner obtained power which has made them formidable to the Supreme
Deities themselves, and rendered an _Avatar_, or Incarnation of
Veeshnoo the Preserver, necessary. This belief is the foundation of
the following Poem. The story is original; but, in all its parts,
consistent with the superstition upon which it is built; and however
startling the fictions may appear, they might almost be called
credible when compared with the genuine tales of Hindoo mythology.

No figures can be imagined more anti-picturesque, and less poetical,
than the mythological personages of the Bramins. This deformity was
easily kept out of sight:--their hundred hands are but a clumsy
personification of power; their numerous heads only a gross image of
divinity, "whose countenance," as the Bhagvat-Geeta expresses it, "is
turned on every side." To the other obvious objection, that the religion
of Hindostan is not generally known enough to supply fit machinery for
an English poem, I can only answer, that, if every allusion to it
throughout the work is not sufficiently self-explained to render the
passage intelligible, there is a want of skill in the poet. Even those
readers who should be wholly unacquainted with the writings of our
learned Orientalists, will find all the preliminary knowledge that can
be needful, in the brief explanation of mythological names prefixed to
the Poem.

MYTHOLOGICAL NAMES.

BRAMA, the Creator.

VEESHNOO, the Preserver.

SEEVA, the Destroyer.

These form the Trimourtee, or Trinity, as it has been called, of the
Bramins. The allegory is obvious, but it has been made for the
Trimourtee, not the Trimourtee for the allegory; and these Deities are
regarded by the people as three distinct and personal Gods. The two
latter have at this day their hostile sects of worshippers; that of
Seeva is the most numerous; and in this Poem, Seeva is represented as
Supreme among the Gods. This is the same God whose name is variously
written Seeb, Sieven and Siva, Chiven by the French, Xiven by the
Portugueze, and whom European writers sometimes denominate Eswara,
Iswaren, Mahadeo, Mahadeva, Rutren,--according to which of his
thousand and eight names prevailed in the country where they obtained
their Information.

INDRA, God of the Elements.

The SWERGA, his Paradise,--one of the Hindoo heavens.

YAMEN, Lord of Hell, and Judge of the Dead.

PADALON, Hell,--under the Earth, and, like the Earth, of an octagon
shape; its eight gates are guarded by as many Gods.

MARRIATALY, the Goddess who is chiefly worshipped by the lower casts.

POLLEAR, or Ganesa,--the Protector of Travellers. His statues are
placed in the highways, and sometimes in a small lonely sanctuary, in
the streets and in the fields.

CASYAPA, the Father of the Immortals.

DEVETAS, The Inferior Deities.

SURAS, Good Spirits.

ASURAS, Evil Spirits, or Devils.

GLENDOVEERS, the most beautiful of the Good Spirits, the Grindouvers
of Sonnerat.



THE CURSE OF KEHAMA.

 {1}

 I.
 THE FUNERAL.

 1.
 Midnight, and yet no eye
 Through all the Imperial City clos'd in sleep!
 Behold her streets a-blaze
 With light that seems to kindle the red sky,
 Her myriads swarming through the crowded ways!
 Master and slave, old age and infancy,
 All, all abroad to gaze;
 House-top and balcony
 Clustered with women, who throw back their veils,
 With unimpeded and insatiate sight
 To view the funeral pomp which passes by,
 {2}
 As if the mournful rite
 Were but to them a scene of joyance and delight.

 2.
 Vainly, ye blessed twinklers of the night,
 Your feeble beams ye shed,
 Quench'd in the unnatural light which might out-stare
 Even the broad eye of day;
 And thou from thy celestial way
 Pourest, O Moon, an ineffectual ray!
 For lo! ten thousand torches flame and flare
 Upon the midnight air,
 Blotting the lights of heaven
 With one portentous glare.
 Behold the fragrant smoke in many a fold,
 Ascending floats along the fiery sky,
 And hangeth visible on high,
 A dark and waving canopy.

 3.
 Hark! 'tis the funeral trumpet's breath!
 'Tis the dirge of death!
 At once ten thousand drums begin,
 With one long thunder-peal the ear assailing;
 {3}
 Ten thousand voices then join in,
 And with one deep and general din
 Pour their wild wailing.
 The song of praise is drown'd
 Amid that deafening sound;
 You hear no more the trumpet's tone,
 You hear no more the mourner's moan,
 Though the trumpet's breath, and the dirge of death,
 Mingle and swell the funeral yell.
 But rising over all in one acclaim
 Is heard the echoed and re-echoed name,
 From all that countless rout:
 Arvalan! Arvalan!
 Arvalan! Arvalan!
 Ten times ten thousand voices in one shout
 Call Arvalan! The overpowering sound
 From house to house repeated rings about,
 From tower to tower rolls round.

 4.
 The death-procession moves along;
 Their bald heads shining to the torches' ray,
 The Bramins lead the way,
 Chaunting the funeral song.
 {4}
 And now at once they shout
 Arvalan! Arvalan!
 With quick rebound of sound,
 All in accordant cry,
 Arvalan! Arvalan!
 The universal multitude reply.
 In vain ye thunder on his ear the name!
 Would ye awake the dead?
 Borne upright in his palankeen,
 There Arvalan is seen!
 A glow is on his face, . . . a lively red;
 'Tis but the crimson canopy
 Which o'er his cheek the reddening shade hath shed.
 He moves, . . . he nods his head; . . .
 But the motion comes from the bearers' tread,
 As the body, borne aloft in state,
 Sways with the impulse of its own dead weight.

 5.
 Close following his dead son, Kehama came,
 Nor joining in the ritual song,
 Nor calling the dear name;
 With head deprest and funeral vest,
 And arms enfolded on his breast,
 {5}
 Silent and lost in thought he moves along.
 King of the world, his slaves unenvying now
 Behold their wretched Lord; rejoiced they see
 The mighty Rajah's misery;
 For nature in his pride hath dealt the blow,
 And taught the master of mankind to know
 Even he himself is man, and not exempt from woe.

 6.
 O sight of grief! the wives of Arvalan,
 Young Azla, young Nealliny, are seen!
 Their widow-robes of white,
 With gold and jewels bright,
 Each like an Eastern queen.
 Woe! woe! around their palankeen,
 As on a bridal day,
 With symphony, and dance, and song,
 Their kindred and their friends come on, . . .
 The dance of sacrifice! the funeral song!
 And next the victim slaves in long array,
 Richly bedight to grace the fatal day,
 Move onward to their death;
 The clarions' stirring breath
 Lifts their thin robes in every flowing fold,
 {6}
 And swells the woven gold,
 That on the agitated air
 Trembles, and glitters to the torches' glare.

 7.
 A man and maid of aspect wan and wild,
 Then, side by side, by bowmen guarded, came.
 O wretched father! O unhappy child!
 Them were all eyes of all the throng exploring; . . .
 Is this the daring man
 Who raised his fatal hand at Arvalan?
 Is this the wretch condemned to feel
 Kehama's dreadful wrath?
 Them were all hearts of all the throng deploring,
 For not in that innumerable throng
 Was one who lov'd the dead; for who could know
 What aggravated wrong
 Provok'd the desperate blow!
 Far, far behind, beyond all reach of sight,
 In ordered files the torches flow along,
 One ever-lengthening line of gliding light:
 Far . . . far behind,
 Rolls on the undistinguishable clamour,
 Of horn, and trump, and tambour;
 {7}
 Incessant at the roar
 Of streams which down the wintry mountain pour,
 And louder than the dread commotion
 Of stormy billows on a rocky shore,
 When the winds rage over the wares,
 And Ocean to the Tempest raves.

 8.
 And now toward the bank they go,
 Where, winding on their way below,
 Deep and strong the waters flow.
 Here doth the funeral pile appear
 With myrrh and ambergris bestrew'd,
 And built of precious sandal wood.
 They cease their music and their outcry here;
 Gently they rest the bier:
 They wet the face of Arvalan,
 No sign of life the sprinkled drops excite.
 They feel his breast, . . . no motion there;
 They feel his lips, . . . no breath;
 For not with feeble, nor with erring hand,
 The stern avenger dealt the blow of death.
 Then with a doubling peal and deeper blast,
 The tambours and the trumpets sound on high,
 {8}
 And with a last and loudest cry
 They call on Arvalan.

 9.
 Woe! woe! for Azla takes her seat
 Upon the funeral pile!
 Calmly she took her seat,
 Calmly the whole terrific pomp survey'd;
 As on her lap the while
 The lifeless head of Arvalan was laid.
 Woe! woe! Nealliny,
 The young Nealliny!
 They strip her ornaments away,
 Bracelet and anklet, ring, and chain, and zone;
 Around her neck they leave
 The marriage knot alone, . . .
 That marriage band, which when
 Yon waning moon was young,
 Around her virgin neck
 With bridal joy was hung.
 Then with white flowers, the coronal of death,
 Her jetty locks they crown.
 O sight of misery!
 Yon cannot hear her cries, . . . all other sound
 {9}
 In that wild dissonance is drown'd; . . .
 But in her face you see
 The supplication and the agony, . . .
 See in her swelling throat the desperate strength
 That with vain effort struggles yet for life;
 Her arms contracted now in fruitless strife,
 Now wildly at full length
 Towards the crowd in vain for pity spread, . . .
 They force her on, they bind her to the dead.

 10.
 Then all around retire;
 Circling the pile, the ministring Bramins stand,
 Each lifting in his hand a torch on fire.
 Alone the Father of the dead advanced
 And lit the funeral pyre.

 11.
 At once on every side
 The circling torches drop;
 At once on every side
 The fragrant oil is pour'd;
 At once on every side
 The rapid flames rush up.
 {10}
 Then hand in hand the victim band
 Roll in the dance around the funeral pyre;
 Their garments' flying folds
 Float inward to the fire.
 In drunken whirl they wheel around;
 One drops, . . . another plunges in;
 And still with overwhelming din
 The tambours and the trumpets sound;
 And clap of hand, and shouts, and cries,
 From all the multitude arise:
 While round and round, in giddy wheel,
 Intoxicate they roll and reel,
 Till one by one whirl'd in they fall,
 And the devouring flames have swallowed all.

 12.
 Then all was still; the drums and clarions ceas'd;
 The multitude were hush'd in silent awe;
 Only the roaring of the flames was heard.



 II.
 THE CURSE.

 {11}

 1.
 Alone towards the Table of the dead,
 Kehama mov'd; there on the altar-stone
 Honey and rice he spread,
 There with collected voice and painful tone
 He call'd upon his son.
 Lo! Arvalan appears.
 Only Kehama's powerful eye beheld
 The thin etherial spirit hovering nigh;
 Only the Rajah's ear
 Receiv'd his feeble breath.
 And is this all? the mournful spirit said,
 This all that thou canst give me after death?
 {12}
 This unavailing pomp,
 These empty pageantries that mock the dead!

 2.
 In bitterness the Rajah heard,
 And groan'd, and smote his breast, and o'er his face
 Cowl'd the white mourning vest.

 ARVALAN.
 Art thou not powerful, . . . even like a God?
 And must I, through my years of wandering,
 Shivering and naked to the elements,
 In wretchedness await
 The hour of Yamen's wrath?
 I thought thou wouldst embody me anew.
 Undying as I am, . . .
 Yea, re-create me! . . . Father, is this all!
 This all! and thou Almighty!

 3.
 But in that wrongful and upbraiding tone,
 Kehama found relief,
 For rising anger half supprest his grief.
 Reproach not me! he cried;
 {13}
 Had I not spell-secur'd thee from disease,
 Fire, sword, . . . all common accidents of man, . . .
 And thou! . . . fool, fool, . . . to perish by a stake!
 And by a peasant's arm! . . .
 Even now, when from reluctant Heaven
 Forcing new gifts and mightier attributes,
 So soon I should have quell'd the Death-God's power.

 4.
 Waste not thy wrath on me, quoth Arvalan,
 It was my hour of folly! Fate prevail'd,
 Nor boots it to reproach me that I fell.
 I am in misery, Father! Other souls
 Predoom'd to Indra's Heaven, enjoy the dawn
 Of bliss: . . . to them the tempered elements
 Minister joy, genial delight the sun
 Sheds on their happy being, and the stars
 Effuse on them benignant influencies;
 And thus o'er earth and air they roam at will,
 And when the number of their days is full,
 Go fearlessly before the awful throne.
 But I, . . . all naked feeling and raw life, . . .
 What worse than this hath Yamen's hell in store?
 If ever thou didst love me, mercy, Father!
 {14}
 Save me, for thou canst save: . . . the Elements
 Know and obey thy voice.

 KEHAMA.
 The Elements
 Shall torture thee no more; even while I speak
 Already dost then feel their power is gone.
 Fear not! I cannot call again the past,
 Fate hath made that its own; but Fate shall yield
 To me the future; and thy doom be fix'd
 By mine, not Yamen's will. Meantime, all power
 Whereof thy feeble spirit can be made
 Participant, I give. Is there aught else
 To mitigate thy lot?

 ARVALAN.
 Only the sight of vengeance. Give me that!
 Vengeance, full, worthy vengeance! . . . not the stroke
 Of sodden punishment, . . . no agony
 That spends itself and leaves the wretch at rest,
 But lasting long revenge.

 KEHAMA.
 What, boy? is that cup sweet? then take thy fill!

 {15}

 5.
 So as he spake, a glow of dreadful pride
 Inflam'd his cheek: with quick and angry stride
 He mov'd toward the pile,
 And rais'd his hand to hush the crowd, and cried
 Bring forth the murderer! At the Rajah's voice,
 Calmly, and like a man whom fear had stunn'd,
 Ladurlad came, obedient to the call.
 But Kailyal started at the sound,
 And gave a womanly shriek, and back she drew,
 And eagerly she roll'd her eyes around,
 As if to seek for aid, albeit she knew
 No aid could there be found.

 6.
 It chanced that near her, on the river-brink,
 The sculptur'd form of Marriataly stood;
 It was an idol roughly hewn of wood,
 Artless, and poor, and rude.
 The Goddess of the poor was she;
 None else regarded her with piety.
 But when that holy image Kailyal view'd,
 To that she sprung, to that she clung,
 On her own goddess with close-clasping arms,
 {16}
 For life the maiden hung.
 They seiz'd the maid; with unrelenting grasp
 They bruis'd her tender limbs;
 She, nothing yielding, to this only hope
 Clings with the strength of frenzy and despair.
 She screams not now, she breathes not now,
 She sends not up one vow,
 She forms not in her soul one secret prayer,
 All thought, all feeling, and all powers' of life
 In the one effort centering. Wrathful they
 With tug and strain would force the maid away. . . .
 Didst thou, O Marriataly, see their strife?
 In pity didst thou see the suffering maid?
 Or was thine anger kindled, that rude hands
 Assail'd thy holy image? . . . for behold
 The holy image shakes!
 Irreverently bold, they deem the maid
 Relax'd her stubborn hold,
 And now with force redoubled drag their prey;
 And now the rooted idol to their sway
 Bends, . . . yields, . . . and now it falls. But then they scream,
 For lo! they feel the crumbling bank give way,
 And all are plunged into the stream.

 {17}

 7.
 She hath escap'd my will, Kehama cried,
 She hath escap'd, . . . but thou art here,
 I have thee still,
 The worser criminal!
 And on Ladurlad, while he spake, severe
 He fix'd his dreadful frown.
 The strong reflection of the pile
 Lit his dark lineaments,
 Lit the protruded brow, the gathered front,
 The steady eye of wrath.

 8.
 But while the fearful silence yet endur'd,
 Ladurlad rous'd his soul;
 Ere yet the voice of destiny
 Which trembled on the Rajah's lips was loos'd,
 Eager he interpos'd,
 As if despair had waken'd him to hope;
 Mercy! oh mercy! only in defence . . .
 Only instinctively, . . .
 Only to save my child, I smote the Prince.
 King of the world, be merciful!
 Crush me, . . . but torture not!

 {18}

 9.
 The Man-Almighty deign'd him no reply,
 Still he stood silent; in no human mood
 Of mercy, in no hesitating thought
 Of right and justice. At the length he rais'd
 His brow yet unrelax'd, . . . his lips unclos'd,
 And utter'd from the heart,
 With the whole feeling of his soul enforced,
 The gather'd vengeance came.

 10.
 I charm thy life
 From the weapons of strife,
 From stone and from wood,
 From fire and from flood,
 From the serpent's tooth,
 And the beasts of blood:
 From Sickness I charm thee,
 And Time shall not harm thee;
 But Earth, which is mine,
 Its fruits shall deny thee;
 And Water shall hear me,
 And know thee and fly thee;
 And the Winds shall not touch thee
 {19}
 When they pass by thee,
 And the Dews shall not wet thee,
 When they fall nigh thee:
 And thou shalt seek Death
 To release thee, in vain;
 Thou shalt live in thy pain,
 While Kehama shall reign,
 With a fire in thy heart,
 And a fire in thy brain;
 And sleep shall obey me,
 And visit thee never,
 And the Curse shall be on thee
 For ever and ever.

 11.
 There where the Curse had stricken him,
 There stood the miserable man,
 There stood Ladurlad, with loose-hanging arms,
 And eyes of idiot wandering.
 Was it a dream? alas,
 He heard the river flow,
 He heard the crumbling of the pile,
 He heard the wind which shower'd
 The thin white ashes round.
 {20}
 There motionless he stood,
 As if he hop'd it were a dream,
 And fear'd to move, lest he should prove
 The actual misery;
 And still at times he met Kehama's eye,
 Kehama's eye that fasten'd on him still.



 III.
 THE RECOVERY.

 {21}

 1.
 The Rajah turn'd toward the pile again,
 Loud rose the song of death from all the crowd;
 Their din the instruments begin,
 And once again join in
 With overwhelming sound.
 Ladurlad starts, . . . he looks around.
 What hast thou here in view,
 O wretched man, in this disastrous scene?
 The soldier train, the Bramins who renew
 Their ministry around the funeral pyre,
 The empty palankeens,
 The dimly-fading fire.
 {22}
 Where too is she whom most his heart held dear,
 His best-beloved Kailyal, where is she,
 The solace and the joy of many a year
 Of widowhood! is she then gone,
 And is he left all-utterly alone,
 To bear his blasting curse, and none
 To succour or deplore him?
 He staggers from the dreadful spot; the throng
 Give way in fear before him;
 Like one who carries pestilence about,
 Shuddering they shun him, where he moves along.
 And now he wanders on
 Beyond the noisy rout;
 He cannot fly and leave his curse behind,
 Yet doth he seem to find
 A comfort in the change of circumstance.
 Adown the shore he strays,
 Unknowing where his wretched feet may rest,
 But farthest from the fatal place is best.

 2.
 By this in the orient sky appears the gleam
 Of day. Lo! what is yonder in the stream,
 Down the slow river floating slow,
 In distance indistinct and dimly seen?
 {23}
 The childless one with idle eye
 Followed its motion thoughtlessly;
 Idly he gaz'd, unknowing why,
 And half unconscious that he watch'd its way.
 Belike it is a tree
 Which some rude tempest, in its sudden sway,
 Tore from the rock, or from the hollow shore
 The undermining stream hath swept away.

 3.
 But when anon outswelling by its side,
 A woman's robe he spied,
 Oh then Ladurlad started,
 As one, who in his grave
 Had heard an angel's call.
 Yea, Marriataly, then hast deign'd to save!
 Yea, Goddess! it is she,
 To thy dear image clinging senselessly,
 And thus in happy hour
 Upborne amid the wave
 By that preserving power.

 4.
 Headlong in hope and in joy
 Ladurlad dash'd in the water.
 {24}
 The water knew Kehama's spell,
 The water shrunk before him.
 Blind to the miracle,
 He rushes to his daughter,
 And treads the river-depths in transport wild,
 And clasps and saves his child.

 5.
 Upon the farther side a level shore
 Of sand was spread: thither Ladurlad bore
 His daughter, holding still with senseless hand
 The saving Goddess; there upon the sand
 He laid the livid maid,
 Rais'd up against his knees her drooping head;
 Bent to her lips, . . . her lips as pale as death, . . .
 If he might feel her breath,
 His own the while in hope and dread suspended;
 Chaf'd her cold breast, and ever and anon
 Let his hand rest upon her heart extended.

 6.
 Soon did his touch perceive, or fancy there,
 The first faint motion of returning life.
 He chafes her feet, and lays them bare
 In the sun; and now again upon her breast
 {25}
 Lays his hot hand; and now her lips he prest,
 For now the stronger throb of life he knew:
 And her lips tremble too!
 The breath comes palpably,
 Her quivering lids unclose
 Feebly and feebly fell,
 Relapsing as it seem'd to dead repose.

 7.
 So in her father's arms thus languidly,
 While over her with earnest gaze he hung,
 Silent and motionless she lay,
 And painfully and slowly writh'd at fits,
 At fits to short convulsive starts was stung.
 Till when the struggle and strong agony
 Had left her, quietly she lay repos'd:
 Her eyes now resting on Ladurlad's face,
 Relapsing now, and now again unclos'd.
 The look she fix'd upon his face, implies
 Nor thought nor feeling; senselessly she lies,
 Compos'd like one who sleeps with open eyes.

 8.
 Long he leant over her,
 {26}
 In silence and in fear.
 Kailyal! . . . at length he cried in such a tone,
 As a poor mother ventures who draws near,
 With silent footstep, to her child's sick bed.
 My Father! cried the maid, and rais'd her head,
 Awakening then to life and thought, . . . thou here?
 For when his voice she heard,
 The dreadful past recurr'd,
 Which dimly, like a dream of pain,
 Till now with troubled sense confus'd her brain.

 9.
 And hath he spar'd us then? she cried,
 Half rising as she spake,
 For hope and joy the sudden strength supplied;
 In mercy hath he curb'd his cruel will,
 That still thou livest? But as thus she said,
 Impatient of that look of hope, her sire
 Shook hastily his head;
 Oh! he hath laid a Curse upon my life,
 A clinging curse, quoth he;
 Hath sent a fire into my heart and brain,
 A burning fire, for ever there to be!
 The winds of Heaven must never breathe on me;
 {27}
 The rains and dews must never fall on me;
 Water must mock my thirst and shrink from me;
 The common earth must yield no fruit to me;
 Sleep, blessed Sleep! must never light on me;
 And Death, who comes to all, must fly from me;
 And never, never set Ladurlad free.

 10.
 This is a dream! exclaim'd the incredulous maid,
 Yet in her voice the while a fear exprest,
 Which in her larger eye was manifest.
 This is a dream! she rose and laid her hand
 Upon her father's brow, to try the charm;
 He could not bear the pressure there; . . . he shrunk, . . .
 He warded off her arm,
 As though it were an enemy's blow, he smote
 His daughter's arm aside.
 Her eye glanced down, his mantle she espied
 And caught it up; . . . Oh misery! Kailyal cried,
 He bore me from the river-depths, and yet
 His garment is not wet!



 IV.
 THE DEPARTURE.

 {28}

 1.
 Reclin'd beneath a Cocoa's feathery shade
 Ladurlad lies,
 And Kailyal on his lap her head hath laid,
 To hide her streaming eyes.
 The boatman, sailing on his easy way,
 With envious eye beheld them where they lay;
 For every herb and flower
 Was fresh and fragrant with the early dew;
 Sweet sung the birds in that delicious hour,
 And the cool gale of morning as it blew,
 Not yet subdued by day's increasing power,
 Ruffling the surface of the silvery stream,
 {29}
 Swept o'er the moisten'd sand, and rais'd no shower.
 Telling their tale of love,
 The boatman thought they lay
 At that lone hour, and who so blest as they!

 2.
 But now the sun in heaven is high,
 The little songsters of the sky
 Sit silent in the sultry hour,
 They pant and palpitate with heat;
 Their bills are open languidly
 To catch the passing air;
 They hear it not, they feel it not,
 It murmurs not, it moves not.
 The boatman, as he looks to land,
 Admires what men so mad to linger there,
 For yonder Cocoa's shade behind them falls,
 A single spot upon the burning sand.

 3.
 There all the morning was Ladurlad laid,
 Silent and motionless, like one at ease;
 There motionless upon her father's knees,
 Reclin'd the silent maid.
 {30}
 The man was still, pondering with steady mind,
 As if it were another's Curse,
 His own portentous lot;
 Scanning it o'er and o'er in busy thought,
 As though it were a last night's tale of woe,
 Before the cottage door,
 By some old beldame sung,
 While young and old assembled round,
 Listened, as if by witchery bound,
 In fearful pleasure to her wonderous tongue.

 4.
 Musing so long he lay, that all things seem
 Unreal to his sense, even like a dream,
 A monstrous dream of things which could not be.
 That beating, burning brow, . . . why it was now
 The height of noon, and he was lying there
 In the broad sun, all bare!
 What if he felt no wind? the air was still,
 That was the general will
 Of nature, not his own peculiar doom;
 Yon rows of rice erect and silent stand,
 The shadow of the Cocoa's lightest plume
 Is steady on the sand.

 {31}

 5.
 Is it indeed a dream? he rose to try,
 Impatient to the water-side he went,
 And down he bent,
 And in the stream he plung'd his hasty arm
 To break the visionary charm.
 With fearful eye and fearful heart,
 His daughter watch'd the event;
 She saw the start and shudder,
 She heard the in-drawn groan,
 For the Water knew Kehama's charm,
 The water shrunk before his arm.
 His dry hand mov'd about unmoisten'd there;
 As easily might that dry hand avail
 To stop the passing gale,
 Or grasp the impassive air.
 He is Almighty then!
 Exclaim'd the wretched man in his despair;
 Air knows him, Water knows him; Sleep
 His dreadful word will keep;
 Even in the grave there is no rest for me,
 Cut off from that last hope, . . . the wretches' joy;
 And Veeshnoo hath no power to save,
 Nor Seeva to destroy.

 {32}

 6.
 Oh! wrong not them! quoth Kailyal,
 Wrong not the Heavenly Powers!
 Our hope is all in them: They are not blind!
 And lighter wrongs than ours,
 And lighter crimes than his,
 Have drawn the Incarnate down among mankind;
 Already have the Immortals heard our cries,
 And in the mercy of their righteousness
 Beheld us in the hour of our distress!
 She spake with streaming eyes,
 Where pious love and ardent feeling beam;
 And turning to the Image, threw
 Her grateful arms around it, . . . It was thou
 Who saved'st me from the stream!
 My Marriataly, it was thou!
 I had not else been here
 To share my Father's Curse,
 To suffer now, . . . and yet to thank thee thus!

 7.
 Here then, the maiden cried, dear Father, here
 Raise our own Goddess, our divine Preserver!
 The mighty of the earth despise her rites,
 {33}
 She loves the poor who serve her.
 Set up her image here,
 With heart and voice the guardian Goddess bless,
 For jealously would she resent
 Neglect and thanklessness. . . .
 Set up her image here,
 And bless her for her aid with tongue and soul sincere.

 8.
 So saying, on her knees the maid
 Began the pious toil.
 Soon their joint labour scoops the easy soil;
 They raise the image up with reverent hand,
 And round its rooted base they heap the sand.
 O Thou whom we adore,
 O Marriataly, thee do I implore,
 The virgin cried; my Goddess, pardon thou
 The unwilling wrong, that I no more,
 With dance and song,
 Can do thy daily service, as of yore!
 The flowers which last I wreath'd around thy brow,
 Are withering there; and never now
 Shall I at eve adore thee,
 And swimming round with arms outspread,
 {34}
 Poise the full pitcher on my head,
 In dextrous dance before thee;
 White underneath the reedy shed, at rest,
 My father sate the evening rites to view,
 And blest thy name, and blest
 His daughter too.

 9.
 Then heaving from her heart a heavy sigh,
 O Goddess! from that happy home, cried she,
 The Almighty Man hath forced us!
 And homeward with the thought unconsciously
 She turn'd her dizzy eye. . . . But there on high,
 With many a dome, and pinnacle, and spire,
 The summits of, the Golden Palaces
 Blaz'd in the dark blue sky, aloft, like fire.
 Father, away! she cried, away!
 Why linger we so nigh?
 For not to him hath Nature given
 The thousand eyes of Deity,
 Always and every where with open sight,
 To persecute our flight!
 Away . . . away! she said,
 And took her father's hand, and like a child
 He followed where she led.



 V.
 THE SEPARATION.

 {35}

 1.
 Evening comes on: arising from the stream,
 Homeward the tall flamingo wings his flight;
 And where he sails athwart the setting beam,
 His scarlet plumage glows with deeper light.
 The watchman, at the wish'd approach of night,
 Gladly forsakes the field, where he all day,
 To scare the winged plunderers from their prey,
 With shout and sling, on yonder clay-built height,
 Hath borne the sultry ray.
 Hark! at the Golden Palaces,
 The Bramin strikes the hour.
 For leagues and leagues around, the brazen sound
 {36}
 Rolls through the stillness of departing day,
 Like thunder far away.

 2.
 Behold them wandering on their hopeless way,
 Unknowing where they stray,
 Yet sure where'er they stop to find no rest.
 The evening gale is blowing,
 It plays among the trees;
 Like plumes upon a warrior's crest,
 They see yon cocoas tossing to the breeze.
 Ladurlad views them with impatient mind,
 Impatiently he hears
 The gale of evening blowing,
 The sound of waters flowing,
 As if all sights and sounds combin'd
 To mock his irremediable woe:
 For not for him the blessed waters flow,
 For not for him the gales of evening blow,
 A fire is in his heart and brain,
 And Nature hath no healing for his pain.

 3.
 The Moon is up, still pale
 {37}
 Amid the lingering light.
 A cloud ascending in the eastern sky,
 Sails slowly o'er the vale,
 And darkens round and closes-in the night.
 No hospitable house is nigh,
 No traveller's home the wanderers to invite.
 Forlorn, and with long watching overworn,
 The wretched father and the wretched child
 Lie down amid the wild.

 4.
 Before them full in sight,
 A white flag flapping to the winds of night,
 Marks where the tyger seiz'd his human prey.
 Far, far away with natural dread,
 Shunning the perilous spot,
 At other times abhorrent had they fled;
 But now they heed it not.
 Nothing they care; the boding death-flag now
 In vain for them may gleam and flutter there.
 Despair and agony in him,
 Prevent all other thought;
 And Kailyal hath no heart or sense for aught,
 Save her dear father's strange and miserable lot.

 {38}

 5.
 There in the woodland shade,
 Upon the lap of that unhappy maid,
 His head Ladurlad laid,
 And never word he spake;
 Nor heav'd he one complaining sigh,
 Nor groan'd he with his misery,
 But silently for her dear sake
 Endur'd the raging pain.
 And now the moon was hid on high,
 No stars were glimmering in the sky;
 She could not see her father's eye,
 How red with burning agony.
 Perhaps he may be cooler now;
 She hoped, and long'd to touch his brow
 With gentle hand, yet did not dare
 To lay the painful pressure there.
 Now forward from the tree she bent,
 And anxiously her head she leant,
 And listened to his breath.
 Ladurlad's breath was short and quick,
 Yet regular it came,
 And like the slumber of the sick,
 In pantings still the same.
 {39}
 Oh if he sleeps! . . . her lips unclose,
 Intently listening to the sound,
 That equal sound so like repose.
 Still quietly the sufferer lies,
 Bearing his torment now with resolute will;
 He neither moves, nor groans, nor sighs.
 Doth satiate cruelty bestow
 This little respite to his woe,
 She thought, or are there Gods who look below!

 6.
 Perchance, thought Kailyal, willingly deceiv'd,
 Our Marriataly hath his pain reliev'd,
 And she hath bade the blessed sleep assuage
 His agony, despite the Rajah's rage.
 That was a hope which fill'd her gushing eyes,
 And made her heart in silent yearnings rise,
 To bless the Power divine in thankfulness.
 And yielding to that joyful thought her mind,
 Backward the maid her aching head reclin'd
 Against the tree, and to her father's breath
 In fear she hearken'd still with earnest ear.
 But soon forgetful fits the effort broke:
 In starts of recollection then she woke;
 {40}
 Till now benignant Nature overcame
 The Virgin's weary and exhausted frame,
 Nor able more her painful watch to keep,
 She clos'd her heavy lids, and sunk to sleep.

 7.
 Vain was her hope! he did not rest from pain,
 The Curse was burning in his brain.
 Alas! the innocent maiden thought he slept,
 But Sleep the Rajah's dread commandment kept,
 Sleep knew Kehama's Curse.
 The dews of night fell round them now,
 They never bath'd Ladurlad's brow,
 They knew Kehama's Curse.
 The night-wind is abroad,
 Aloft it moves among the stirring trees.
 He only heard the breeze, . . .
 No healing aid to him it brought,
 It play'd around his head and touch'd him not,
 It knew Kehama's Curse.

 8.
 Listening, Ladurlad lay in his despair,
 If Kailyal slept, for wherefore should she share
 {41}
 Her father's wretchedness which none could cure?
 Better alone to suffer; he must bear
 The burthen of his Curse, but why endure
 The unavailing presence of her grief?
 She too, apart from him, might find relief;
 For dead the Rajah deem'd her, and as thus
 Already she his dread revenge had fled,
 So might she still escape and live secure.

 9.
 Gently he lifts his head,
 And Kailyal does not feel;
 Gently he rises up, . . . she slumbers still;
 Gently he steals away with silent tread.
 Anon she started, for she felt him gone;
 She call'd, and through the stillness of the night,
 His step was heard in flight.
 Mistrustful for a moment of the sound,
 She listens! till the step is heard no more;
 But then she knows that he indeed is gone,
 And with a thrilling shriek she rushes on.
 The darkness and the wood impede her speed;
 She lifts her voice again,
 Ladurlad! . . . and again, alike in vain,
 {42}
 And with a louder cry
 Straining its tone to hoarseness; . . . far away,
 Selfish in misery,
 He heard the call and faster did he fly.

 10.
 She leans against that tree whose jutting bough
 Smote her so rudely. Her poor heart
 How audibly it panted,
 With sudden stop and start:
 Her breath how short and painfully it came!
 Hark! all is still around her, . . .
 And the night so utterly dark,
 She opened her eyes and she closed them,
 And the blackness and blank were the same.

 11.
 'Twas like a dream of horror, and she stood
 Half doubting whether all indeed were true.
 A Tyger's howl loud echoing through the wood,
 Rous'd her; the dreadful sound she knew,
 And turn'd instinctively to what she feared.
 Far off the Tyger's hungry howl was heard;
 A nearer horror met the maiden's view,
 {43}
 For right before her a dim form appear'd,
 A human form in that black night,
 Distinctly shaped by its own lurid light,
 Such light as the sickly moon is seen to shed,
 Through spell-rais'd fogs, a bloody baleful red.

 12.
 That Spectre fix'd his eyes upon her full;
 The light which shone in their accursed orbs
 Was like a light from Hell,
 And it grew deeper, kindling with the view.
 She could not turn her sight
 From that infernal gaze, which like a spell
 Bound her, and held her rooted to the ground.
 It palsied every power;
 Her limbs avail'd her not in that dread hour.
 There was no moving thence,
 Thought, memory, sense were gone:
 She heard not now the Tyger's nearer cry,
 She thought not on her father now,
 Her cold heart's-blood ran back,
 Her hand lay senseless on the bough it clasp'd,
 Her feet were motionless;
 Her fascinated eyes
 {44}
 Like the stone eye-balls of a statue fix'd,
 Yet conscious of the sight that blasted them.

 13.
 The wind is abroad,
 It opens the clouds;
 Scattered before the gale,
 They skurry through the sky,
 And the darkness retiring rolls over the vale.
 The stars in their beauty come forth on high,
 And through the dark-blue night
 The moon rides on triumphant, broad and bright.
 Distinct and darkening in her light
 Appears that Spectre foul.
 The moon beam gives his face and form to sight,
 The shape of man,
 The living form and face of Arvalan!
 His hands are spread to clasp her.

 14.
 But at that sight of dread the maid awoke;
 As if a lightning-stroke
 Had burst the spell of fear,
 Away she broke all franticly and fled.
 {45}
 There stood a temple near beside the way,
 An open fane of Pollear, gentle God,
 To whom the travellers for protection pray.
 With elephantine head and eye severe,
 Here stood his image, such as when he seiz'd
 And tore the rebel giant from the ground,
 With mighty trunk wreath'd round
 His impotent bulk, and on his tusks, on high
 Impal'd upheld him between earth and sky.

 15.
 Thither the affrighted maiden sped her flight,
 And she hath reach'd the place of sanctuary;
 And now within the temple in despite,
 Yea, even before the altar, in his sight,
 Hath Arvalan with fleshly arm of might
 Seiz'd her. That instant the insulted God
 Caught him aloft, and from his sinuous grasp,
 As if from some tort catapult let loose,
 Over the forest hurl'd him all abroad.

 16.
 Overcome with dread,
 She tarried not to see what heavenly power
 {46}
 Had saved her in that hour.
 Breathless and faint she fled.
 And now her foot struck on the knotted root
 Of a broad manchineil, and there the maid
 Fell senselessly beneath the deadly shade.



 VI.
 CASYAPA.

 {47}

 1.
 Shall this then be thy fate, O lovely Maid,
 Thus, Kailyal, must thy sorrows then be ended!
 Her face upon the ground,
 Her arms at length extended,
 There like a corpse behold her laid,
 Beneath the deadly shade.
 What if the hungry Tyger, prowling by,
 Should snuff his banquet nigh?
 Alas, Death needs not now his ministry;
 The baleful boughs hang o'er her,
 The poison-dews descend.
 What power will now restore her,
 {48}
 What God will be her friend?

 2.
 Bright and so beautiful was that fair night,
 It might have calm'd the gay amid their mirth,
 And given the wretched a delight in tears.
 One of the Glendoveers,
 The loveliest race of all of heavenly birth,
 Hovering with gentle motion o'er the earth,
 Amid the moonlight air,
 In sportive flight was floating round and round,
 Unknowing where his joyous way was tending.
 He saw the maid where motionless she lay,
 And stoopt his flight descending,
 And rais'd her from the ground.
 Her heavy eye-lids are half clos'd,
 Her cheeks are pale and livid like the dead,
 Down hang her loose arms lifelessly,
 Down hangs her languid head.

 3.
 With timely pity touch'd for one so fair,
 The gentle Glendoveer
 Prest her thus pale and senseless to his breast,
 {49}
 And springs aloft in air with sinewy wings,
 And bears the Maiden there,
 Where Himakoot, the holy Mount, on high
 From mid-earth rising in mid-Heaven,
 Shines in its glory like the throne of Even.
 Soaring with strenuous flight above,
 He bears her to the blessed Grove,
 Where in his ancient and august abodes,
 There dwells old Casyapa, the Sire of Gods.

 4.
 The Father of the Immortals sate,
 Where underneath the Tree of Life
 The fountains of the Sacred River sprung:
 The Father of the Immortals smil'd
 Benignant on his son.
 Knowest thou, he said, my child,
 Ereenia, knowest thou whom thou bringest here,
 A mortal to the holy atmosphere?

 EREENIA.
 I found her in the Groves of Earth,
 Beneath a poison-tree,
 {50}
 Thus lifeless as thou seest her.
 In pity have I brought her to these bowers,
 Not erring, Father! by that smile . . .
 By that benignant eye!

 CASYAPA.
 What if the maid be sinful? If her ways
 Were ways of darkness, and her death predoom'd
 To that black hour of midnight, when the Moon
 Hath turn'd her face away,
 Unwilling to behold
 The unhappy end of guilt?

 EREENIA.
 Then what a lie, my Sire, were written here,
 In these fair characters! And she had died,
 Sure proof of purer life and happier doom,
 Now in the moonlight, in the eye of Heaven,
 If I had left so fair a flower to fade.
 But thou, . . . all knowing as thou art,
 Why askest thou of me?
 O Father, oldest, holiest, wisest, best,
 To whom all things are plain,
 {51}
 Why askest thou of me?

 CASYAPA.
 Knowest thou Kehama?

 EREENIA.
 The Almighty Man!
 Who knows not him and his tremendous power?
 The Tyrant of the Earth,
 The Enemy of Heaven!

 CASYAPA.
 Fearest thou the Rajah?

 EREENIA.
 He is terrible!

 CASYAPA.
 Yea, he is terrible! such power hath he,
 That hope hath entered Hell.
 The Asuras and the spirits of the damn'd
 Acclaim their Hero; Yamen, with the might
 Of Godhead, scarce can quell
 {52}
 The rebel race accurst;
 Half from their beds of torture they uprise,
 And half uproot their chains.
 Is there not fear in Heaven?
 The souls that are in bliss suspend their joy;
 The danger hath disturb'd
 The calm of Deity,
 And Brama fears, and Veeshnoo turns his face
 In doubt toward Seeva's throne.

 EREENIA.
 I have seen Indra tremble at his prayers,
 And at his dreadful penances turn pale.
 They claim and wrest from Seeva power so vast,
 That even Seeva's self,
 The Highest, cannot grant and be secure.

 CASYAPA.
 And darest thou, Ereenia, brave
 The Almighty Tyrant's power?

 EREENIA.
 I brave him, Father! I?

 {53}

 CASYAPA.
 Darest thou brave his vengeance? . . . for if not,
 Take her again to earth,
 Cast her before the tyger in his path,
 Or where the death-dew-dropping tree
 May work Kehama's will.

 EREENIA.
 Never!

 CASYAPA.
 Then meet his wrath! for he, even he,
 Hath set upon this worm his wanton foot.

 EREENIA.
 I knew her not, how wretched and how fair,
 When here I wafted her: . . . poor Child of Earth,
 Shall I forsake thee, seeing thee so fair,
 So wretched? O my Father, let the maid
 Dwell in the Sacred Grove.

 CASYAPA.
 That must not be,
 For Force and Evil then would enter here;
 {54}
 Ganges, the holy stream which cleanseth sin,
 Would flow from hence polluted in its springs,
 And they who gasp upon its banks in death,
 Feel no salvation. Piety and peace
 And Wisdom, these are mine; but not the power
 Which could protect her from the Almighty Man;
 Nor when the spirit of dead Arvalan
 Should persecute her here to glut his rage,
 To heap upon her yet more agony,
 And ripen more damnation for himself.

 EREENIA.
 Dead Arvalan?

 CASYAPA.
 All power to him, whereof
 The disembodied spirit in its state
 Of weakness could be made participant,
 Kehama hath assign'd, until his days
 Of wandering shall be numbered.

 EREENIA.
 Look! she drinks
 The gale of healing from the blessed Groves.
 {55}
 She stirs, and lo! her hand
 Hath touch'd the Holy River in its source,
 Who would have shrunk if aught impure were nigh.

 CASYAPA.
 The Maiden, of a truth, is pure from sin.

 5.
 The waters of the holy Spring
 About the hand of Kailyal play;
 They rise, they sparkle, and they sing,
 Leaping where languidly she lay,
 As if with that rejoicing stir
 The holy Spring would welcome her.
 The Tree of Life which o'er her spread,
 Benignant bow'd its sacred head,
 And dropt its dews of healing;
 And her heart-blood at every breath,
 Recovering from the strife of death,
 Drew in new strength and feeling.
 Behold her beautiful in her repose,
 A life-bloom reddening now her dark-brown cheek;
 And lo! her eyes unclose,
 Dark as the depth of Ganges' spring profound
 {56}
 When night hangs over it,
 Bright as the moon's refulgent beam,
 That quivers on its clear up-sparkling stream.

 6.
 Soon she let fall her lids,
 As one who, from a blissful dream
 Waking to thoughts of pain,
 Fain would return to sleep, and dream again.
 Distrustful of the sight,
 She moves not, fearing to disturb
 The deep and full delight.
 In wonder fix'd, opening again her eye
 She gazes silently,
 Thinking her mortal pilgrimage was past,
 That she had reach'd her heavenly home of rest,
 And these were Gods before her,
 Or spirits of the blest.

 7.
 Lo! at Ereenia's voice,
 A Ship of Heaven comes sailing down the skies.
 Where wouldst thou bear her? cries
 The ancient Sire of Gods.
 {57}
 Straight to the Swerga, to my Bower of Bliss,
 The Glendoveer replies,
 To Indra's own abodes.
 Foe of her foe, were it alone for this
 Indra should guard her from his vengeance there;
 But if the God forbear,
 Unwilling yet the perilous strife to try,
 Or shrinking from the dreadful Rajah's might, . . .
 Weak as I am, O Father, even I
 Stand forth in Seeva's sight.

 8.
 Trust thou in Him whatever betide,
 And stand forth fearlessly!
 The Sire of Gods replied:
 All that He wills is right, and doubt not thou,
 Howe'er our feeble scope of sight
 May fail us now,
 His righteous will in all things must be done.
 My blessing be upon thee, O my son!



 VII.
 THE SWERGA.

 {58}

 1.
 Then in the Ship of Heaven, Ereenia laid
 The waking, wondering Maid;
 The Ship of Heaven, instinct with thought, display'd
 Its living sail, and glides along the sky.
 On either side in wavy tide,
 The clouds of morn along its path divide;
 The Winds who swept in wild career on high,
 Before its presence check their charmed force;
 The Winds that loitering lagg'd along their course,
 Around the living Bark enamour'd play,
 Swell underneath the sail, and sing before its way.

 {59}

 2.
 That Bark, in shape, was like the furrowed shell
 Wherein the Sea-Nymphs to their parent-king,
 On festal day, their duteous offerings bring.
 Its hue? . . . Go watch the last green light
 Ere Evening yields the western sky to Night;
 Or fix upon the Sun thy strenuous sight
 Till thou hast reach'd its orb of chrysolite.
 The sail from end to end display'd
 Bent, like a rainbow, o'er the maid.
 An Angel's head, with visual eye,
 Through trackless space, directs its chosen way;
 Nor aid of wing, nor foot, nor fin,
 Requires to voyage o'er the obedient sky.
 Smooth as the swan when not a breeze at even
 Disturbs the surface of the silver stream,
 Through air and sunshine sails the Ship of Heaven.

 3.
 Recumbent there the Maiden glides along
 On her aerial way,
 How swift she feels not, though the swiftest wind
 Had flagg'd in flight behind.
 Motionless as a sleeping babe she lay,
 {60}
 And all serene in mind,
 Feeling no fear; for that etherial air
 With such new life and joyance fill'd her heart,
 Fear could not enter there;
 For sure she deem'd her mortal part was o'er,
 And she was sailing to the heavenly shore;
 And that Angelic form, who mov'd beside,
 Was some good Spirit sent to be her guide.

 4.
 Daughter of Earth! therein thou deem'st aright.
 And never yet did form more beautiful,
 In dreams of night descending from on high,
 Bless the religious Virgin's gifted sight;
 Nor, like a vision of delight,
 Rise on the raptur'd Poet's inward eye.
 Of human form divine was he,
 The immortal Youth of Heaven who floated by;
 Even such as that divinest form shall be
 In those blest stages of our onward race,
 When no infirmity,
 Low thought, nor base desire, nor wasting care,
 Deface the semblance of our heavenly sire.
 The wings of Eagle or of Cherubim
 {61}
 Had seem'd unworthy him:
 Angelic power and dignity and grace
 Were in his glorious pennons; from the neck
 Down to the ankle reach'd their swelling web,
 Richer than robes of Tyrian die, that deck
 Imperial majesty:
 Their colour like the winter's moonless sky
 When all the stars of midnight's canopy
 Shine forth; or like the azure deep at noon,
 Reflecting back to heaven a brighter blue.
 Such was their tint when clos'd, but when outspread,
 The permeating light
 Shed through their substance thin a varying hue;
 Now bright as when the Rose,
 Beauteous as fragrant, gives to scent and sight
 A like delight; now like the juice that flows
 From Douro's generous vine,
 Or ruby when with deepest red it glows;
 Or as the morning clouds refulgent shine
 When, at forthcoming of the Lord of Day,
 The Orient, like a shrine,
 Kindles as it receives the rising ray,
 And heralding his way,
 Proclaims the presence of the power divine.

 {62}

 5.
 Thus glorious were the wings
 Of that celestial Spirit, as he went
 Disporting through his native element.
 Nor these alone
 The gorgeous beauties that they gave to view:
 Through the broad membrane branch'd a pliant bone;
 Spreading like fibres from their parent stem,
 Its veins like interwoven silver shone,
 Or as the chaster hue
 Of pearls that grace some Sultan's diadem.
 Now with slow stroke and strong, behold him smite
 The buoyant air, and now in gentler flight,
 On motionless wing expanded, shoot along.

 6.
 Through air and sunshine sails the Ship of Heaven.
 Far far beneath them lies
 The gross and heavy atmosphere of earth;
 And with the Swerga gales,
 The Maid of mortal birth
 At every breath a new delight inhales.
 And now toward its port the Ship of Heaven,
 Swift as a falling meteor, shapes its flight,
 {63}
 Yet gently as the dews of night that gem,
 And do not bend the hare-bell's slenderest stem.
 Daughter of Earth, Ereenia cried, alight,
 This is thy place of rest, the Swerga this,
 Lo, here my Bower of Bliss!

 7.
 He furl'd his azure wings, which round him fold
 Graceful as robes of Grecian chief of old.
 The happy Kailyal knew not where to gaze:
 Her eyes around in joyful wonder roam,
 Now turn'd upon the lovely Glendoveer,
 Now on his heavenly home.

 EREENIA.
 Here, Maiden, rest in peace,
 And I will guard thee, feeble as I am.
 The Almighty Rajah shall not harm thee here,
 While Indra keeps his throne.

 KAILYAL.
 Alas, thou fearest him!
 Immortal as thou art, thou fearest him!
 I thought that death had sav'd me from his power;
 {64}
 Not even the dead are safe.

 EREENIA.
 Long years of life and happiness,
 O Child of Earth, be thine!
 From death I sav'd thee, and from all thy foes
 Will save thee, while the Swerga is secure.

 KAILYAL.
 Not me alone, O gentle Deveta!
 I have a father suffering upon earth,
 A persecuted, wretched, poor, good man,
 For whose strange misery
 There is no human help,
 And none but I dare comfort him
 Beneath Kehama's curse.
 O gentle Deveta, protect him too!

 EREENIA.
 Come, plead thyself to Indra! words like thine
 May win their purpose, rouse his slumbering heart,
 And make him yet put forth his arm to wield
 The thunder, while the thunder is his own.

 {65}

 8.
 Then to the garden of the Deity
 Ereenia led the maid.
 In the mid garden tower'd a giant Tree;
 Rock-rooted on a mountain-top, it grew,
 Rear'd its unrivall'd head on high,
 And stretch'd a thousand branches o'er the sky,
 Drinking with all its leaves celestial dew.
 Lo! where from thence as from a living well
 A thousand torrents flow!
 For still in one perpetual shower,
 Like diamond drops, etherial waters fell
 From every leaf of all its ample bower.
 Rolling adown the steep
 From that aerial height,
 Through the deep shade of aromatic trees,
 Half-seen, the cataracts shoot their gleams of light,
 And pour upon the breeze
 Their thousand voices; far away the roar,
 In modulations of delightful sound,
 Half-heard and ever varying, floats around.
 Below, an ample Lake expanded lies,
 Blue as the o'er-arching skies;
 Forth issuing from that lovely Lake,
 {66}
 A thousand rivers water Paradise.
 Full to the brink, yet never overflowing,
 They cool the amorous gales, which, ever blowing,
 O'er their melodious surface love to stray;
 Then winging back their way,
 Their vapours to the parent Tree repay;
 And ending thus where they began,
 And feeding thus the source from whence they came,
 The eternal rivers of the Swerga ran,
 For ever renovate, yet still the same.

 9.
 On that etherial Lake whose waters lie
 Blue and transpicuous, like another sky,
 The Elements had rear'd their King's abode.
 A strong controuling power their strife suspended,
 And there their hostile essences they blended,
 To form a Palace worthy of the God.
 Built on the Lake the waters were its floor;
 And here its walls were water arch'd with fire,
 And here were fire with water vaulted o'er;
 And spires and pinnacles of fire
 Round watery cupolas aspire,
 And domes of rainbow rest on fiery towers;
 {67}
 And roofs of flame are turreted around
 With cloud, and shafts of cloud with flame are bound.
 Here, too, the Elements for ever veer,
 Ranging around with endless interchanging;
 Pursued in love, and so in love pursuing,
 In endless revolutions here they roll;
 For ever their mysterious work renewing,
 The parts all shifting, still unchanged the whole.
 Even we on earth, at intervals, descry
 Gleams of the glory, streaks of flowing light,
 Openings of heaven, and streams that flash at night
 In fitful splendour, through the northern sky.

 10.
 Impatient of delay, Ereenia caught
 The Maid aloft, and spread his wings abroad,
 And bore her to the presence of the God.
 There Indra sate upon his throne reclin'd,
 Where Devetas adore him;
 The lute of Nared, warbling on the wind,
 All tones of magic harmony combin'd
 To sooth his troubled mind,
 While the dark-eyed Apsaras danced before him.
 In vain the God-musician played,
 {68}
 In vain the dark-eyed Nymphs of Heaven essay'd
 To charm him with their beauties in the dance;
 And when he saw the mortal Maid appear,
 Led by the heroic Glendoveer,
 A deeper trouble fill'd his countenance.
 What hast thou done, Ereenia, said the God,
 Bringing a mortal here?
 And while he spake his eye was on the Maid.
 The look he gave was solemn, not severe;
 No hope to Kailyal it convey'd,
 And yet it struck no fear;
 There was a sad displeasure in his air,
 But pity, too, was there.

 EREENIA.
 Hear me, O Indra! On the lower earth
 I found this child of man, by what mishap
 I know not, lying in the lap of death.
 Aloft I bore her to our Father's grove;
 Not having other thought, than when the gales
 Of bliss had heal'd her, upon earth again
 To leave its lovely daughter. Other thoughts
 Arose, when Casyapa declar'd her fate;
 For she is one who groans beneath the power
 {69}
 Of the dread Rajah, terrible alike
 To men and Gods. His son, dead Arvalan,
 Arm'd with a portion, Indra, of thy power
 Already wrested from thee, persecutes
 The Maid, the helpless one, the innocent.
 What then behov'd me but to waft her here
 To my own Bower of Bliss? what other choice?
 The spirit of foul Arvalan, not yet
 Hath power to enter here; here thou art yet
 Supreme, and yet the Swerga is thine own.

 INDRA.
 No child of man, Ereenia, in the Bowers
 Of Bliss may sojourn, till he hath put off
 His mortal part; for on mortality
 Time and Infirmity and Death attend,
 Close followers they, and in their mournful train
 Sorrow and Pain and Mutability:
 Did they find entrance here, we should behold
 Our joys, like earthly summers, pass away.
 Those joys perchance may pass; a stronger hand
 May wrest my sceptre, and unparadise
 The Swerga; . . . but, Ereenia, if we fall,
 Let it be Fate's own arm that casts us down,
 {70}
 We will not rashly hasten and provoke
 The blow, nor bring ourselves the ruin on.

 EREENIA.
 Fear courts the blow. Fear brings the ruin on.
 Needs must the chariot-wheels of Destiny
 Crush him who throws himself before their track,
 Patient and prostrate.

 INDRA.
 All may yet be well.
 Who knows but Veeshnoo will descend, and save,
 Once more incarnate?

 EREENIA.
 Look not there for help,
 Nor build on unsubstantial hope thy trust!
 Our Father Casyapa hath said he turns
 His doubtful eyes to Seeva, even as thou
 Dost look to him for aid. But thine own strength
 Should for thine own salvation be put forth;
 Then might the higher powers approving see
 And bless the brave resolve . . . Oh, that my arm
 Could wield yon lightnings which play idly there,
 {71}
 In inoffensive radiance, round thy head!
 The Swerga should not need a champion now,
 Nor Earth implore deliverance still in vain!

 INDRA.
 Thinkest thou I want the will? rash Son of Heaven,
 What if my arm be feeble as thine own
 Against the dread Kehama? He went on
 Conquering in irresistible career,
 Till his triumphant car had measur'd o'er
 The insufficient earth, and all the kings
 Of men received his yoke; then had he won
 His will, to ride upon their necks elate,
 And crown his conquests with the sacrifice
 That should, to men and gods, proclaim him Lord
 And Sovereign Master of the vassal World,
 Sole Rajah, the Omnipotent below.
 The steam of that portentous sacrifice
 Arose to Heaven. Then was the hour to strike.
 Then in the consummation of his pride,
 His height of glory, then the thunder-bolt
 Should have gone forth, and hurl'd him from his throne
 Down to the fiery floor of Padalon,
 To everlasting burnings, agony
 {72}
 Eternal, and remorse which knows no end.
 That hour went by: grown impious in success,
 By prayer and penances he wrested now
 Such power from Fate, that soon, if Seeva turn not
 His eyes on earth, and no Avatar save,
 Soon will he seize the Swerga for his own,
 Roll on through Padalon his chariot wheels,
 Tear up the adamantine bolts which lock
 The accurst Asuras to its burning floor,
 And force the drink of Immortality
 From Yamen's charge . . . Vain were it now to strive;
 My thunder cannot pierce the sphere of power
 Wherewith, as with a girdle, he is bound.

 KAILYAL.
 Take me to earth, O gentle Deveta!
 Take me again to earth! This is no place
 Of hope for me! . . . my Father still must bear
 His curse . . . he shall not bear it all alone;
 Take me to earth, that I may follow him! . . .
 I do not fear the Almighty Man! the Gods
 Are feeble here; but there are higher powers
 Who will not turn their eyes from wrongs like ours;
 Take me to earth, O gentle Deveta! . . .

 {73}

 11.
 Saying thus she knelt, and to his knees she clung,
 And bow'd her head, in tears and silence praying.
 Rising anon, around his neck she flung
 Her arms, and there with folded hands she hung,
 And fixing on the guardian Glendoveer
 Her eyes, more eloquent than Angel's tongue,
 Again she cried, There is no comfort here!
 I must be with my Father in his pain . . .
 Take me to earth, O Deveta, again!

 12.
 Indra with admiration heard the maid.
 O Child of Earth, he cried,
 Already in thy spirit thus divine,
 Whatever weal or woe betide,
 Be that high sense of duty still thy guide,
 And all good Powers will aid a soul like thine.
 Then turning to Ereenia, thus he said,
 Take her where Ganges hath its second birth,
 Below our sphere, and yet above the earth:
 There may Ladurlad rest beyond the power
 Of the dread Rajah, till the fated hour.



 VIII.
 THE SACRIFICE.

 {74}

 1.
 Dost thou tremble, O Indra, O God of the Sky,
 Why slumber those thunders of thine?
 Dost thou tremble on high, . . .
 Wilt thou tamely the Swerga resign, . . .
 Art thou smitten, O Indra, with dread?
 Or seest thou not, seest thou not, Monarch divine,
 How many a day to Seeva's shrine
 Kehama his victim hath led?
 Nine and ninety days are fled,
 Nine and ninety steeds have bled;
 One more, the rite will be complete,
 One victim more; and this the dreadful day!
 {75}
 Then will the impious Rajah seize thy seat,
 And wrest the thunder-sceptre from thy sway.
 Along the mead the hallowed steed
 Yet bends at liberty his way;
 At noon his consummating blood will flow.
 O day of woe! above, below,
 That blood confirms the Almighty Tyrant's reign!
 Thou tremblest, O Indra, O God of the Sky,
 Thy thunder is vain!
 Thou tremblest on high for thy power!
 But where is Veeshnoo at this hour?
 But where is Seeva's eye?
 Is the Destroyer blind?
 Is the Preserver careless for mankind?

 2.
 Along the mead the hallowed Steed
 Still wanders wheresoever he will,
 O'er hill, or dale, or plain;
 No human hand hath trick'd that mane
 From which he shakes the morning dew;
 His mouth has never felt the rein,
 His lips have never froth'd the chain;
 For pure of blemish and of stain,
 {76}
 His neck unbroke to mortal yoke,
 Like Nature free the Steed must be,
 Fit offering for the Immortals he.
 A year and day the Steed must stray
 Wherever chance may guide his way,
 Before he fall at Seeva's shrine;
 The year and day have past away,
 Nor touch of man hath marr'd the rite divine.
 And now at noon the Steed must bleed;
 The perfect rite to-day must force the meed
 Which Fate reluctant shudders to bestow;
 Then must the Swerga-God
 Yield to the Tyrant of the World below;
 Then must the Devetas obey
 The Rajah's rod, and groan beneath his hateful sway.

 3.
 The Sun rides high; the hour is nigh;
 The multitude who long,
 Lest aught should mar the rite,
 In circle wide on every side,
 Have kept the Steed in sight,
 Contract their circle now, and drive him on.
 Drawn in long files before the Temple-court,
 {77}
 The Rajah's archers flank an ample space;
 Here, moving onward still, they drive him near,
 Then, opening, give him way to enter here.

 4.
 Behold him, how he starts and flings his head!
 On either side in glittering order spread,
 The archers ranged in narrowing lines appear;
 The multitude behind close up the rear
 With moon-like bend, and silently await
 The awful end,
 The rite that shall from Indra wrest his power.
 In front, with far-stretch'd walls, and many a tower
 Turret and dome and pinnacle elate,
 The huge Pagoda seems to load the land:
 And there before the gate
 The Bramin band expectant stand,
 The axe is ready for Kehama's hand.

 5.
 Hark! at the Golden Palaces
 The Bramin strikes the time!
 One, two, three, four, a thrice-told chime,
 And then again, one, two.
 {78}
 The bowl that in its vessel floats, anew
 Must fill and sink again,
 Then will the final stroke be due.
 The Sun rides high, the noon is nigh,
 And silently, as if spell-bound,
 The multitude expect the sound.

 6.
 Lo! how the Steed, with sudden start,
 Turns his quick head to every part;
 Long files of men on every side appear.
 The sight might well his heart affright,
 And yet the silence that is here
 Inspires a stranger fear;
 For not a murmur, not a sound
 Of breath or motion rises round,
 No stir is heard in all that mighty crowd;
 He neighs, and from the temple-wall
 The voice re-echoes loud,
 Loud and distinct, as from a hill
 Across a lonely vale, when all is still.

 7.
 Within the temple, on his golden throne
 {79}
 Reclin'd, Kehama lies,
 Watching with steady eyes
 The perfum'd light that, burning bright,
 Metes out the passing hours.
 On either hand his eunuchs stand,
 Freshening with fans of peacock-plumes the air,
 Which, redolent of all rich gums and flowers,
 Seems, overcharged with sweets, to stagnate there.
 Lo! the time-taper's flame ascending slow
 Creeps up its coil toward the fated line;
 Kehama rises and goes forth,
 And from the altar, ready where it lies,
 He takes the axe of sacrifice.

 8.
 That, instant from the crowd, with sudden shout,
 A man sprang out
 To lay upon the Steed his hand profane.
 A thousand archers, with unerring eye,
 At once let fly,
 And with their hurtling arrows fill the sky.
 In vain they fall upon him fast as rain;
 He bears a charmed life, which may defy
 All weapons, . . . and the darts that whizz around,
 {80}
 As from an adamantine panoply
 Repell'd, fall idly to the ground.
 Kehama clasp'd his hands in agony,
 And saw him grasp the hallowed courser's mane,
 Spring up with sudden bound,
 And with a frantic cry,
 And madman's gesture, gallop round and round.

 9.
 They seize, they drag him to the Rajah's feet.
 What doom will now be his, . . what vengeance meet
 Will he, who knows no mercy, now require?
 The obsequious guards around, with blood-hound eye,
 Look for the word, in slow-consuming fire,
 By piece-meal death, to make the wretch expire,
 Or hoist his living carcase, hook'd on high,
 To feed the fowls and insects of the sky;
 Or if aught worse inventive cruelty
 To that remorseless heart of royalty
 Might prompt, accursed instruments they stand
 To work the wicked will with wicked hand.
 Far other thoughts were in the multitude;
 Pity, and human feelings, held them still;
 And stifled sighs and groans supprest were there,
 {81}
 And many a secret curse and inward prayer
 Call'd on the insulted Gods to save mankind.
 Expecting some new crime in fear they stood,
 Some horror which would make the natural blood
 Start, with cold shudderings thrill the sinking heart,
 Whiten the lip, and make the abhorrent eye
 Roll back and close, prest in for agony.

 10.
 How then fared he for whom the mighty crowd
 Suffered in spirit thus, . . . how then fared he?
 A ghastly smile was on his lip, his eye
 Glared with a ghastly hope, as he drew nigh,
 And cried aloud, Yes, Rajah! it is I!
 And wilt thou kill me now?
 The countenance of the Almighty Man
 Fell when he knew Ladurlad, and his brow
 Was clouded with despite, as one ashamed.
 That wretch again! indignant he exclaim'd,
 And smote his forehead, and stood silently
 Awhile in wrath: then, with ferocious smile,
 And eyes which seem'd to darken his dark cheek,
 Let him go free! he cried; he hath his Curse,
 And Vengeance upon him can wreak no worse . . .
 {82}
 But ye who did not seize him . . . tremble ye!

 11.
 He bade the archers pile their weapons there:
 No manly courage fill'd the slavish band,
 No sweetening vengeance rous'd a brave despair.
 He call'd his horsemen then, and gave command
 To hem the offenders in, and hew them down.
 Ten thousand scymitars at once uprear'd,
 Flash up, like waters sparkling to the sun;
 A second time the fatal brands appear'd
 Lifted aloft, . . . they glitter'd then no more,
 Their light was gone, their splendour quenched in gore.
 At noon the massacre begun,
 And night clos'd in before the work of death was done.



 IX.
 THE HOME-SCENE.

 {83}

 1.
 The steam of slaughter from that place of blood
 Spread o'er the tainted sky.
 Vultures, for whom the Rajah's tyranny
 So oft had furnish'd food, from far and nigh
 Sped to the lure: aloft with joyful cry,
 Wheeling around, they hover'd over head;
 Or, on the temple perch'd, with greedy eye,
 Impatient watch'd the dead.
 Far off the tygers, in the inmost wood,
 Heard the death-shriek, and snuff'd the scent of blood.
 They rose, and through the covert went their way,
 Couch'd at the forest edge, and waited for their prey.

 {84}

 2.
 He who had sought for death went wandering on,
 The hope which had inspir'd his heart was gone,
 Yet a wild joyance still inflam'd his face,
 A smile of vengeance, a triumphant glow.
 Where goes he? . . . Whither should Ladurlad go!
 Unwittingly the wretch's footsteps trace
 Their wonted path toward his dwelling-place;
 And wandering on, unknowing where,
 He starts at finding he is there.

 3.
 Behold his lowly home,
 By yonder broad-bough'd plane o'ershaded:
 There Marriataly's image stands,
 And there the garland twin'd by Kailyal's hands
 Around its brow hath faded.
 The Peacocks, at their master's sight,
 Quick from the leafy thatch alight,
 And hurry round, and search the ground,
 And veer their glancing necks from side to side,
 Expecting from his hand
 Their daily dole, which erst the maid supplied,
 Now all too long denied.

 {85}

 4.
 But as he gaz'd around,
 How strange did all accustom'd sights appear!
 How differently did each familiar sound
 Assail his altered ear!
 Here stood the marriage bower,
 Rear'd in that happy hour
 When he, with festal joy and youthful pride,
 Had brought Yedillian home, his beauteous bride.
 Leaves not its own, and many a borrowed flower,
 Had then bedeck'd it, withering ere the night;
 But he who look'd, from that auspicious day,
 For years of long delight,
 And would not see the marriage-bower decay,
 There planted and nurst up, with daily care,
 The sweetest herbs that scent the ambient air,
 And train'd them round to live and flourish there.
 Nor when dread Yamen's will
 Had call'd Yedillian from his arms away,
 Ceas'd he to tend the marriage-bower, but still,
 Sorrowing, had drest it like a pious rite
 Due to the monument of past delight.

 5.
 He took his wonted seat before the door, . . .
 {86}
 Even as of yore,
 When he was wont to view, with placid eyes,
 His daughter at her evening sacrifice.
 Here were the flowers which she so carefully
 Did love to rear for Marriataly's brow;
 Neglected now,
 Their heavy heads were drooping, over-blown:
 All else appeared the same as heretofore,
 All . . . save himself alone;
 How happy then, . . . and now a wretch for evermore!

 6.
 The market-flag which hoisted high,
 From far and nigh,
 Above yon cocoa grove is seen,
 Hangs motionless amid the sultry sky.
 Loud sounds the village-drum: a happy crowd
 Is there; Ladurlad hears their distant voices,
 But with their joy no more his heart rejoices;
 And how their old companion now may fare,
 Little they know, and less they care.
 The torment he is doom'd to hear
 Was but to them the wonder of a day,
 A burthen of sad thoughts soon put away.

 {87}

 7.
 They knew not that the wretched man was near,
 And yet it seem'd, to his distempered ear,
 As if they wrong'd him with their merriment.
 Resentfully he turn'd away his eyes,
 Yet turn'd them but to find
 Sights that enraged his mind
 With envious grief more wild and overpowering.
 The tank which fed his fields was there, and there
 The large-leav'd lotus on the waters flowering.
 There, from the intolerable heat,
 The buffaloes retreat;
 Only their nostrils rais'd to meet the air,
 Amid the sheltering element they rest.
 Impatient of the sight, he clos'd his eyes,
 And bow'd his burning head, and in despair
 Calling on Indra, . . . Thunder-God! he said,
 Thou owest to me alone this day thy throne,
 Be grateful, and in mercy strike me dead!

 8.
 Despair had rous'd him to that hopeless prayer,
 Yet thinking on the heavenly Powers, his mind
 Drew comfort; and he rose and gather'd flowers,
 {88}
 And twin'd a crown for Marriataly's brow;
 And taking then her withered garland down,
 Replaced it with the blooming coronal.
 Not for myself, the unhappy Father cried,
 Not for myself, O mighty one! I pray,
 Accursed as I am beyond thy aid!
 But, oh! be gracious still to that dear Maid
 Who crown'd thee with these garlands day by day,
 And danced before thee aye at even-tide
 In beauty and in pride.
 O Marriataly, wheresoe'er she stray
 Forlorn and wretched, still be thou her guide!

 9.
 A loud and fiendish laugh replied,
 Scoffing his prayer. Aloft, as from the air,
 The sound of insult came: he look'd, and there
 The visage of dead Arvalan came forth,
 Only his face amid the clear blue sky,
 With long-drawn lips of insolent mockery,
 And eyes whose lurid glare
 Was like a sulphur fire,
 Mingling with darkness ere its flames expire.

 {89}

 10.
 Ladurlad knew him well: enraged to see
 The cause of all his misery,
 He stoop'd and lifted from the ground
 A stake, whose fatal point was black with blood;
 The same wherewith his hand had dealt the wound,
 When Arvalan, in hour with evil fraught,
 For violation seiz'd the shrieking Maid.
 Thus arm'd, in act again to strike he stood,
 And twice with inefficient wrath essay'd
 To smite the impassive shade.
 The lips of scorn their mockery-laugh renew'd,
 And Arvalan put forth a hand and caught
 The sun-beam, and condensing there its light,
 Upon Ladurlad turn'd the burning stream.
 Vain cruelty! the stake
 Fell in white ashes from his hold, but he
 Endur'd no added pain; his agony
 Was full, and at the height;
 The burning stream of radiance nothing harm'd him:
 A fire was in his heart and brain,
 And from all other flame
 Kehama's Curse had charm'd him.

 {90}

 11.
 Anon the Spirit wav'd a second hand;
 Down rush'd the obedient whirlwind from the sky;
 Scoop'd up the sand like smoke, and from on high
 Shed the hot shower upon Ladurlad's head.
 Where'er he turns, the accursed Hand is there;
 East, West, and North and South, on every side
 The Hand accursed waves in air to guide
 The dizzying storm; ears, nostrils, eyes and mouth,
 It fills and choaks, and, clogging every pore,
 Taught him new torments might be yet in store.
 Where shall he turn to fly? behold his house
 In flames; uprooted lies the marriage-bower,
 The Goddess buried by the sandy shower.
 Blindly, with staggering step, he reels about,
 And still the accursed Hand pursued,
 And still the lips of scorn their mockery laugh renew'd.

 12.
 What, Arvalan! hast thou so soon forgot
 The grasp of Pollear? Wilt thou still defy
 The righteous Powers of Heaven? or know'st thou not
 That there are yet superior Powers on high,
 {91}
 Son of the Wicked? . . . Lo, in rapid flight,
 Ereenia hastens from the etherial height;
 Bright is the sword celestial in his hand,
 Like lightning in its path athwart the sky.
 He comes and drives, with angel-arm, the blow.
 Oft have the Asuras, in the wars of Heaven,
 Felt that keen sword by arm angelic driven,
 And fled before it from the fields of light.
 Thrice through the vulnerable shade
 The Glendoveer impels the griding blade.
 The wicked Shade flies howling from his foe.
 So let that spirit foul
 Fly, and for impotence of anger, howl,
 Writhing with pain, and o'er his wounds deplore;
 Worse punishment hath Arvalan deserv'd,
 And righteous Fate hath heavier doom in store.

 13.
 Not now the Glendoveer pursued his flight.
 He bade the Ship of Heaven alight,
 And gently there he laid
 The astonished Father by the happy Maid,
 The Maid now shedding tears of deep delight.
 {92}
 Beholding all things with incredulous eyes,
 Still dizzy with the sand-storm, there he lay,
 While sailing up the skies, the living Bark,
 Through air and sunshine, held its heavenly way.



 X.
 MOUNT MERU.

 {93}

 1.
 Swift through the sky the vessel of the Suras
 Sails up the fields of ether like an Angel.
 Rich is the freight, O Vessel, that thou bearest!
 Beauty and Virtue,
 Fatherly cares and filial veneration,
 Hearts which are prov'd and strengthen'd by affliction,
 Manly resentment, fortitude and action,
 Womanly goodness;
 All with which Nature halloweth her daughters,
 Tenderness, truth and purity and meekness,
 Piety, patience, faith and resignation,
 {94}
 Love and devotement.
 Ship of the Gods! how richly art thou laden!
 Proud of the charge, thou voyagest rejoicing.
 Clouds float around to honour thee, and Evening
 Lingers in heaven.

 2.
 A Stream descends on Meru mountain;
 None hath seen its secret fountain;
 It had its birth, so sages say,
 Upon the memorable day
 When Parvati presumed to lay,
 In wanton play,
 Her hands, too venturous Goddess in her mirth,
 On Seeva's eyes, the light and life of Earth.
 Thereat the heart of the Universe stood still;
 The Elements ceas'd their influences; the Hours
 Stopt on the eternal round; Motion and Breath,
 Time, Change, and Life and Death,
 In sudden trance opprest, forgot their powers.
 A moment, and the dread eclipse was ended;
 But, at the thought of Nature thus suspended,
 The sweat on Seeva's forehead stood,
 And Ganges thence upon the World descended,
 {95}
 The Holy River, the Redeeming Flood.

 3.
 None hath seen its secret fountain;
 But on the top of Meru mountain,
 Which rises o'er the hills of earth,
 In light and clouds it hath its mortal birth.
 Earth seems that pinnacle to rear
 Sublime above this worldly sphere,
 Its cradle, and its altar, and its throne;
 And there the new-born River lies
 Outspread beneath its native skies,
 As if it there would love to dwell
 Alone and unapproachable.
 Soon flowing forward, and resign'd
 To the will of the Creating Mind,
 It springs at once, with sudden leap,
 Down from the immeasurable steep.
 From rock to rock, with shivering force rebounding,
 The mighty cataract rushes; Heaven around,
 Like-thunder, with the incessant roar resounding,
 And Meru's summit shaking with the sound.
 Wide spreads the snowy foam, the sparkling spray
 Dances aloft; and ever there, at morning,
 {96}
 The earliest, sun-beams haste to wing their way,
 With rain-bow wreaths the holy flood adorning;
 And duly the adoring Moon at night
 Sheds her white glory there,
 And in the watery air
 Suspends her halo-crowns of silver light.

 4.
 A mountain-valley in its blessed breast
 Receives the stream, which there delights to lie,
 Untroubled and at rest,
 Beneath the untainted sky.
 There in a lovely lake it seems to sleep,
 And thence, through many a channel dark and deep,
 Their secret way the holy Waters wind,
 Till, rising underneath the root
 Of the Tree of Life on Himakoot,
 Majestic forth they flow to purify mankind.

 5.
 Toward this Lake, above the nether sphere,
 The living Bark, with angel eye,
 Directs its course along the obedient sky.
 Kehama hath not yet dominion here;
 {97}
 And till the dreaded hour,
 When Indra by the Rajah shall be driven
 Dethron'd from Heaven,
 Here may Ladurlad rest beyond his power.
 The living Bark alights; the Glendoveer
 Then lays Ladurlad by the blessed Lake; . . .
 O happy Sire, and yet more happy Daughter!
 The etherial gales his agony aslake,
 His daughter's tears are on his cheek,
 His hand is in the water;
 The innocent man, the man opprest,
 Oh joy! . . . hath found a place of rest
 Beyond Kehama's sway,
 His curse extends not here; his pains have past away.

 6.
 O happy Sire, and happy Daughter!
 Ye on the banks of that celestial water
 Your resting place and sanctuary have found.
 What! hath not then their mortal taint defil'd
 The sacred solitary ground?
 Vain thought! . . the Holy Valley smil'd
 Receiving such a sire and child;
 Ganges, who seem'd asleep to lie,
 {98}
 Beheld them with benignant eye,
 And ripped round melodiously,
 And roll'd her little waves, to meet
 And welcome their beloved feet.
 The gales of Swerga thither fled,
 And heavenly odours there were shed
 About, below, and overhead;
 And Earth, rejoicing in their tread,
 Hath built them up a blooming Bower,
 Where every amaranthine flower
 Its deathless blossom interweaves
 With bright and undecaying leaves.

 7.
 Three happy beings are there here,
 The Sire, the Maid, the Glendoveer.
 A fourth approaches, . . . who is this
 That enters in the Bower of Bliss?
 No form so fair might painter find
 Among the daughters of mankind;
 For death her beauties hath refin'd,
 And unto her a form hath given,
 Fram'd of the elements of Heaven;
 Pure dwelling-place for perfect mind.
 {99}
 She stood and gaz'd on sire and child;
 Her tongue not yet had power to speak,
 The tears were streaming down her cheek;
 And when those tears her sight beguil'd,
 And still her faultering accents fail'd,
 The Spirit, mute and motionless,
 Spread out her arms for the caress,
 Made still and silent with excess
 Of love and painful happiness.

 8.
 The Maid that lovely form survey'd;
 Wistful she gaz'd, and knew her not;
 But Nature to her heart convey'd
 A sudden thrill, a startling thought,
 A feeling many a year forgot,
 Now like a dream anew recurring,
 As if again in every vein
 Her mother's milk was stirring.
 With straining neck and earnest eye
 She stretch'd her hands imploringly,
 As if she fain would have her nigh,
 Yet fear'd to meet the wish'd embrace,
 At once with love and awe opprest,
 {100}
 Not so, Ladurlad; he could trace,
 Though brighten'd with angelic grace,
 His own Yedillian's earthly face;
 He ran and held her to his breast!
 Oh joy above all joys of Heaven,
 By Death alone to others given,
 This moment hath to him restor'd
 The early-lost, the long-deplor'd.

 9.
 They sin who tell us love can die.
 With life all other passions fly,
 All others are but vanity.
 In Heaven Ambition cannot dwell,
 Nor Avarice in the vaults of Hell;
 Earthly these passions of the Earth,
 They perish where they have their birth;
 But Love is indestructible.
 Its holy flame for ever burneth,
 From Heaven it came, to Heaven returneth;
 Too oft on Earth a troubled guest,
 At times deceiv'd, at times opprest,
 It here is tried and purified,
 Then hath in Heaven its perfect rest:
 {101}
 It soweth here with toil and care,
 But the harvest-time of Love is there.
 Oh! when a Mother meets on high
 The Babe she lost in infancy,
 Hath she not then, for pains and fears,
 The day of woe, the watchful night,
 For all her sorrow, all her tears,
 An over-payment of delight!

 10.
 A blessed family is this
 Assembled in the Bower of Bliss!
 Strange woe, Ladurlad, hath been thine,
 And pangs beyond all human measure,
 And thy reward is now divine,
 A foretaste of eternal pleasure.
 He knew indeed there was a day
 When all these joys would pass away,
 And he must quit this blest abode;
 And, taking up again the spell,
 Groan underneath the baleful load,
 And wander o'er the world again
 Most wretched of the sons of men:
 Yet was this brief repose, as when
 {102}
 A traveller in the Arabian sands,
 Half-fainting on his sultry road,
 Hath reach'd the water-place at last;
 And resting there beside the Well,
 Thinks of the perils he has past,
 And gazes o'er the unbounded plain,
 The plain which must be travers'd still,
 And drinks, . . . yet cannot drink his fill;
 Then girds his patient loins again.
 So to Ladurlad now was given
 New strength, and confidence in Heaven,
 And hope, and faith invincible.
 For often would Ereenia tell
 Of what in elder days befell,
 When other Tyrants, in their might,
 Usurp'd dominion o'er the earth;
 And Veeshnoo took a human birth,
 Deliverer of the Sons of men;
 And slew the huge Ermaccasen,
 And piece-meal rent, with lion force,
 Errenen's accursed corse,
 And humbled Baly in his pride;
 And when the Giant Ravanen
 Had borne triumphant, from his side,
 {103}
 Sita, the earth-born God's beloved bride,
 Then, from his island-kingdom, laugh'd to scorn
 The insulted husband, and his power defied;
 How to revenge the wrong in wrath he hied,
 Bridging the sea before his dreadful way,
 And met the hundred-headed foe,
 And dealt him the unerring blow;
 By Brama's hand the righteous lance was given,
 And by that arm immortal driven,
 It laid the mighty Tyrant low;
 And Earth and Ocean, and high Heaven,
 Rejoiced to see his overthrow.
 Oh! doubt not thou, Yedillian cried,
 Such fate Kehama will betide;
 For there are Gods who look below. . . .
 Seeva, the Avenger, is not blind,
 Nor Veeshnoo careless for mankind.

 11.
 Thus was Ladurlad's soul imbued
 With hope and holy fortitude;
 And Child and Sire, with pious mind
 Alike resolv'd, alike resign'd,
 Look'd onward to the evil day:
 {104}
 Faith was their comfort, Faith their stay;
 They trusted woe would pass away,
 And Tyranny would sink subdued,
 And Evil yield to Good.

 12.
 Lovely wert thou, O Flower of Earth!
 Above all flowers of mortal birth;
 But foster'd in this blissful bower
 From day to day, and hour to hour,
 Lovelier grew the lovely flower.
 O blessed, blessed company!
 When men and heavenly spirits greet,
 And they whom Death had severed meet,
 And hold again communion sweet; . . .
 O blessed, blessed company!
 The Sun, careering round the sky,
 Beheld them with rejoicing eye,
 And bade his willing Charioteer
 Relax their speed as they drew near;
 Arounin check'd the rainbow reins,
 The seven green coursers shook their manes,
 And brighter rays around them threw;
 The Car of glory in their view
 {105}
 More radiant, more resplendent grew;
 And Surya, through his veil of light,
 Beheld the Bower, and blest the sight.
 The Lord of Night, as he sail'd by,
 Stay'd his pearly boat on high;
 And, while around the blissful Bower
 He bade the softest moonlight flow,
 Lingered to see that earthly flower,
 Forgetful of his dragon foe,
 Who, mindful of their ancient feud,
 With open jaws of rage pursued.
 There all good Spirits of the air,
 Suras and Devetas repair,
 Aloft they love to hover there
 And view the flower of mortal birth,
 Here, for her innocence and worth,
 Transplanted from the fields of earth; . . .
 And him who, on the dreadful day
 When Heaven was fill'd with consternation,
 And Indra trembled with dismay,
 And, for the sounds of joy and mirth,
 Woe was heard and lamentation,
 Defied the Rajah in his pride,
 Though all in Heaven and Earth beside
 Stood mute in dolorous expectation;
 {106}
 And, rushing forward in that hour,
 Saved the Swerga from his power.
 Grateful for this they hover nigh,
 And bless the blessed company.

 13.
 One God alone, with wanton eye,
 Beheld them in their bower;
 O ye, he cried, who have defied
 The Rajah, will ye mock my power?
 'Twas Camdeo riding on his lory,
 'Twas the immortal youth of Love;
 If men below and Gods above,
 Subject alike, quoth he, have felt these darts,
 Shall ye alone, of all in story,
 Boast impenetrable hearts?
 Hover here, my gentle lory,
 Gently hover, while I see
 To whom hath Fate decreed the glory,
 To the Glendoveer or me.

 14.
 Then, in the dewy evening sky,
 The bird of gorgeous plumery
 Pois'd his wings and hover'd nigh.
 {107}
 It chanced at that delightful hour
 Kailyal sate before the Bower,
 On the green bank with amaranth sweet,
 Where Ganges warbled at her feet.
 Ereenia there, before the Maid,
 His sails of ocean-blue displayed;
 And sportive in her sight,
 Mov'd slowly o'er the lake with gliding flight;
 Anon, with sudden stroke and strong,
 In rapid course careering, swept along;
 Now shooting downward from his heavenly height,
 Plunged in the deep below,
 Then rising, soar'd again,
 And shook the sparkling waters off like rain,
 And hovering o'er the silver surface hung.
 At him young Camdeo bent the bow;
 With living bees the bow was strung,
 The fatal bow of sugar-cane,
 And flowers which would inflame the heart
 With their petals barb'd the dart.

 15.
 The shaft, unerringly addrest,
 Unerring flew, and smote Ereenia's breast.
 Ah, Wanton! cried the Glendoveer,
 {108}
 Go aim at idler hearts,
 Thy skill is baffled here!
 A deeper love I bear that Maid divine,
 Sprung from a higher will,
 A holier power than thine!
 A second shaft, while thus Ereenia cried,
 Had Camdeo aim'd at Kailyal's side,
 But, lo! the Bees which strung his bow
 Broke off, and took their flight.
 To that sweet Flower of earth they wing their way,
 Around her raven tresses play,
 And buzz about her with delight,
 As if, with that melodious sound,
 They strove to pay their willing duty
 To mortal purity and beauty.
 Ah, Wanton! cried the Glendoveer,
 No power hast thou for mischief here!
 Chuse thou some idler breast,
 For these are proof, by nobler thoughts possest.
 Go, to thy plains of Matra go,
 And string again thy broken bow!

 16.
 Rightly Ereenia spake; and ill had thoughts
 Of earthly love beseem'd the sanctuary
 {109}
 Where Kailyal had been wafted, that the Soul
 Of her dead mother there might strengthen her,
 Feeding her with the milk of heavenly lore;
 And influxes of Heaven imbue her heart
 With hope and faith, and holy fortitude,
 Against the evil day. Here rest a while
 In peace, O Father! mark'd for misery
 Above all sons of men; O Daughter! doom'd
 For sufferings and for trials above all
 Of women; . . . yet both favour'd, both belov'd
 By all good Powers, here rest a while in peace.



 XI.
 THE ENCHANTRESS.

 {110}

 1.
 When from the sword, by arm angelic driven,
 Foul Arvalan fled howling, wild in pain,
 His thin essential spirit, rent and riven
 With wounds, united soon and heal'd again;
 Backward the accursed turn'd his eye in flight,
 Remindful of revengeful thoughts even then,
 And saw where, gliding through the evening light,
 The Ship of Heaven sail'd upward through the sky,
 Then, like a meteor, vanish'd from his sight.
 Where should he follow? vainly might he try
 To trace through trackless air its rapid course;
 {111}
 Nor dar'd he that; angelic arm defy,
 Still sore and writhing from its dreaded force.

 2.
 Should he the lust of vengeance lay aside?
 Too long had Arvalan in ill been train'd;
 Nurst up in power and tyranny and pride,
 His soul the ignominious thought disdain'd.
 Or to his mighty father should he go,
 Complaining of defeature twice sustain'd,
 And ask new powers to meet the immortal foe? . . .
 Repulse he fear'd not, but he fear'd rebuke,
 And sham'd to tell him of his overthrow.
 There dwelt a dread Enchantress in a nook
 Obscure; old help-mate she to him had been,
 Lending her aid in many a secret sin;
 And there, for counsel, now his way he took.

 3.
 She was a woman whose unlovely youth,
 Even like a cankered rose, which none will cull,
 Had withered on the stalk; her heart was full
 Of passions which had found no natural scope,
 Feelings which there had grown but ripened not;
 {112}
 Desires unsatisfied, abortive hope,
 Repinings which provoked vindictive thought,
 These restless elements for ever wrought,
 Fermenting in her with perpetual stir,
 And thus her spirit to all evil mov'd;
 She hated men because they lov'd not her,
 And hated women because they were lov'd.
 And thus, in wrath and hatred and despair,
 She tempted Hell to tempt her; and resign'd
 Her body to the Demons of the Air,
 Wicked and wanton fiends who, where they will,
 Wander abroad, still seeking to do ill,
 And take whatever vacant form they find,
 Carcase of man or beast, that life hath left;
 Foul instrument for them of fouler mind.
 To these the Witch her wretched body gave,
 So they would wreak her vengeance on mankind,
 She thus at once their mistress and their slave;
 And they, to do such service nothing loth,
 Obeyed her bidding, slaves and masters both.

 4.
 So from this cursed intercourse she caught
 Contagious power of mischief, and was taught
 {113}
 Such secrets as are damnable to guess.
 Is there a child whose little lovely ways
 Might win all hearts, . . . on whom his parents gaze
 Till they shed tears of joy and tenderness?
 Oh! hide him from that Witch's withering sight!
 Oh! hide him from the eye of Lorrinite!
 Her look hath crippling in it, and her curse
 All plagues which on mortality can light;
 Death is his doom if she behold, . . . or worse, . . .
 Diseases loathsome and incurable,
 And inward sufferings that no tongue can tell.
 Woe was to him, on whom that eye of hate
 Was bent; for, certain as the stroke of Fate,
 It did its mortal work; nor human arts
 Could save the unhappy wretch, her chosen prey;
 For gazing, she consum'd his vital parts,
 Eating his very core of life away.
 The wine which from yon wounded palm on high
 Fills yonder gourd, as slowly it distills,
 Grows sour at once if Lorrinite pass by.
 The deadliest worm, from which all creatures fly,
 Fled from the deadlier venom of her eye;
 The babe unborn, within its mother's womb,
 Started and trembled when the Witch came nigh,
 {114}
 And in the silent chambers of the tomb
 Death shuddered her unholy tread to hear,
 And, from the dry and mouldering bones, did fear
 Force a cold sweat, when Lorrinite was near.

 5.
 Power made her haughty: by ambition fir'd,
 Ere long to mightier mischiefs she aspir'd.
 The Calis, who o'er Cities rule unseen,
 Each in her own domain a Demon Queen,
 And there ador'd with blood and human life,
 They knew her, and in their accurst employ
 She stirr'd up neighbouring states to mortal strife.
 Sani, the dreadful God, who rides abroad
 Upon the King of the Ravens, to destroy
 The offending sons of men, when his four hands
 Were weary with their toil, would let her do
 His work of vengeance upon guilty lands;
 And Lorrinite, at his commandment, knew
 When the ripe earthquake should be loos'd, and where
 To point its course. And in the baneful air
 The pregnant seeds of death he bade her strew,
 All deadly plagues and pestilence to brew.
 The Locusts were her army, and their bands,
 {115}
 Where'er she turn'd her skinny finger, flew;
 The floods in ruin roll'd at her commands;
 And when, in time of drought, the husbandman
 Beheld the gathered rain about to fall,
 Her breath would drive it to the desert sands.
 While in the marshes parch'd and gaping soil,
 The rice-roots by the searching Sun were dried;
 And in lean groupes, assembled at the side
 Of the empty tank, the cattle dropt and died;
 And Famine, at her bidding, wasted wide
 The wretched land; till, in the public way,
 Promiscuous where the dead and dying lay,
 Dogs fed on human bones in the open light of day.

 6.
 Her secret cell the accursed Arvalan,
 In quest of vengeance, sought, and thus began.
 Mighty mother! mother wise!
 Revenge me on my enemies.

 LORRINITE.
 Com'st thou, son, for aid to me?
 Tell me who have injur'd thee,
 Where they are, and who they be;
 {116}
 Of the Earth, or of the Sea,
 Or of the aerial company?
 Earth, nor Sea, nor Air is free
 From the powers who wait on me,
 And my tremendous witchery.

 ARVALAN.
 She for whom so ill I sped,
 Whom my Father deemeth dead,
 Lives, for Marriataly's aid
 From the water sav'd the maid.
 In hatred I desire her still,
 And in revenge would have my will.
 A Deveta with, wings of blue,
 And sword whose edge even now I rue,
 In a Ship of Heaven on high,
 Pilots her along the sky.
 Where they voyage thou canst tell,
 Mistress of the mighty spell.

 7.
 At this the Witch, through shrivell'd lips and thin,
 Sent forth a sound half-whistle and half-hiss.
 Two winged Hands came in,
 {117}
 Armless and bodyless,
 Bearing a globe of liquid crystal, set
 In frame as diamond bright, yet black as jet.
 A thousand eyes were quench'd in endless night,
 To form that magic globe; for Lorrinite
 Had, from their sockets, drawn the liquid sight,
 And kneaded it, with re-creating skill,
 Into this organ of her mighty will.
 Look in yonder orb, she cried,
 Tell me what is there descried.

 ARVALAN.
 A mountain top, in clouds of light
 Envelop'd, rises on my sight;
 Thence a cataract rushes down,
 Hung with many a rainbow crown;
 Light and clouds conceal its head,
 Below, a silver Lake is spread;
 Upon its shores a Bower I see,
 Fit home for blessed company.
 See they come forward, . . . one, two, three, . . .
 The last a Maiden, . . . it is she!
 The foremost shakes his wings of blue,
 'Tis he whose sword even yet I rue;
 {118}
 And in that other one I know
 The visage of my deadliest foe.
 Mother, let thy magic might
 Arm me for the mortal fight;
 Helm and shield and mail afford,
 Proof against his dreaded sword.
 Then will I invade their seat,
 Then shall vengeance be compleat.

 LORRINITE.
 Spirits, who obey my will,
 Hear him, and his wish fulfill.

 8.
 So spake the mighty one, nor farther spell
 Needed. Anon a sound, like smother'd thunder,
 Was heard, slow rolling under;
 The solid pavement of the cell
 Quak'd, heav'd, and cleft asunder,
 And, at the feet of Arvalan display'd,
 Helmet and mail and shield and scymitar were laid.

 9.
 The Asuras, often put to flight,
 {119}
 And scattered in the fields of light,
 By their foes' celestial might,
 Forged this enchanted armour for the fight.
 'Mid fires intense did they anneal,
 In mountain furnaces, the quivering steel,
 Till trembling through each deepening hue,
 It settled in a midnight blue;
 Last they cast it, to aslake,
 In the penal icy lake.
 Then, they consign'd it to the Giant brood;
 And, while they forged the impenetrable arms,
 The Evil Powers, to oversee them, stood,
 And there imbued
 The work of Giant strength with magic charms.
 Foul Arvalan, with joy, survey'd
 The crescent sabre's cloudy blade,
 With deeper joy the impervious mail,
 The shield and helmet of avail.
 Soon did he himself array,
 And bade her speed him on his way.

 10.
 Then she led him to the den,
 Where her chariot, night and day,
 {120}
 Stood harness'd, ready for the way.
 Two Dragons, yok'd in adamant, convey
 The magic car; from either collar sprung
 An adamantine rib, which met in air,
 O'er-arch'd, and crost, and bent diverging there,
 And firmly in its arc upbore,
 Upon their brazen necks, thereat of power.
 Arvalan mounts the car, and in his hand
 Receives the magic reins from Lorrinite;
 The dragons, long obedient to command,
 Their ample sails expand;
 Like steeds well-broken to fair lady's hand,
 They feel the reins of might,
 And up the northern sky begin their flight.

 11.
 Son of the Wicked, doth thy soul delight
 To think its hour of vengeance now is nigh?
 Lo! where the far-off light
 Of Indra's palace flashes on his sight,
 And Meru's heavenly summit shines on high,
 With clouds of glory bright,
 Amid the dark-blue sky.
 Already, in his hope, doth he espy
 {121}
 Himself secure in mail of tenfold charms,
 Ereenia writhing from the magic blade,
 The Father sent to bear his Curse, . . . the Maid
 Resisting vainly in his impious arms.

 12.
 Ah, Sinner! whose anticipating soul
 Incurs the guilt even when the crime is spar'd!
 Joyous toward Meru's summit on he far'd,
 While the twin Dragons, rising as he guides,
 With steady flight, steer northward for the pole.
 Anon, with irresistible controul,
 Force mightier far than his arrests their course;
 It wrought as though a Power unseen had caught
 Their adamantine yokes to drag them on.
 Straight on they bend their way, and now, in vain,
 Upward doth Arvalan direct the rein!
 The rein of magic might avails no more;
 Bootless its strength against that unseen Power
 Which, in their mid career,
 Hath seiz'd the Chariot and the Charioteer.
 With hands resisting, and down-pressing feet
 Upon their hold insisting,
 He struggles to maintain his difficult seat.
 {122}
 Seeking in vain with that strange Power to vie,
 Their doubled speed the affrighted Dragons try.
 Forced in a stream from whence was no retreat,
 Strong as they are, behold, them whirled along,
 Headlong, with useless pennons, through the sky.

 13.
 What power was that, which, with resistless might
 Foil'd the dread magic thus of Lorrinite?
 'Twas all-commanding Nature . . They were here
 Within the sphere of the adamantine rocks
 Which gird Mount Meru round, as far below
 That heavenly height where Ganges hath its birth
 Involv'd in clouds and light,
 So far above its roots of ice and snow.
 On . . on they roll, . . rapt headlong they roll on; . .
 The lost canoe, less rapidly than this,
 Down the precipitous stream is whirl'd along
 To the brink of Niagara's dread abyss.
 On . . on . . they roll, and now, with shivering shock,
 Are dash'd against the rock that girds the Pole.
 Down from his shatter'd mail the unhappy Soul
 Is dropt, . . ten thousand thousand fathoms down, . . .
 Till in an ice-rift, 'mid the eternal snow,
 {123}
 Foul Arvalan is stopt. There let him howl,
 Groan there, . . and there, with unavailing moan,
 For aid on his Almighty Father call.
 All human sounds are lost
 Amid those deserts of perpetual frost,
 Old Winter's drear domain,
 Beyond the limits of the living World,
 Beyond Kehama's reign.
 Of utterance and of motion soon bereft,
 Frozen to the ice-rock, there behold him lie,
 Only the painful sense of Being left,
 A Spirit who must feel, and cannot die,
 Bleaching and bare beneath the polar sky.



 XII.
 THE SACRIFICE COMPLEATED.

 {124}

 1.
 O ye who, by the Lake
 On Meru Mount, partake
 The joys which Heaven hath destin'd for the blest,
 Swift, swift, the moments fly,
 The silent hours go by,
 And ye must leave your dear abode of rest.
 O wretched Man, prepare
 Again thy Curse to bear!
 Prepare, O wretched Maid, for farther woe!
 The fatal hour draws near,
 When Indra's heavenly sphere
 Must own the Tyrant of the World below.
 {125}
 To-day the hundredth Steed,
 At Seeva's shrine, must bleed,
 The dreadful sacrifice is full to-day;
 Nor man nor God hath power,
 At this momentous hour,
 Again to save the Swerga from his sway.
 Fresh woes, O Maid divine,
 Fresh trials must be thine;
 And what must thou, Ladurlad, yet endure!
 But let your hearts be strong,
 And bear ye bravely on,
 For Providence is good, and virtue is secure.

 2.
 They, little deeming that the fatal day
 Was come, beheld where, through the morning sky,
 A Ship of Heaven drew nigh.
 Onward they watch it steer its steady flight;
 Till, wondering, they espy
 Old Casyapa, the Sire of Gods, alight.
 But, when Ereenia saw the Sire appear,
 At that unwonted and unwelcome sight
 His heart receiv'd a sudden shock of fear:
 Thy presence doth its doleful tidings tell,
 {126}
 O Father! cried the startled Glendoveer,
 The dreadful hour is near! I know it well!
 Not for less import would the Sire of Gods
 Forsake his ancient and august abodes.

 3.
 Even so: serene the immortal Sire replies;
 Soon like an earthquake will ye feel the blow
 Which consummates the mighty sacrifice:
 And this World, and its Heaven, and all therein
 Are then Kehama's. To the second ring
 Of these seven Spheres, the Swerga-King,
 Even now, prepares for flight, . .
 Beyond the circle of the conquer'd world,
 Beyond the Rajah's might.
 Ocean, that clips this inmost of the Spheres,
 And girds it round with everlasting roar,
 Set like a gem appears
 Within that beading shore.
 Thither fly all the Sons of heavenly race:
 I, too, forsake mine ancient dwelling-place.
 And now, O Child and Father, ye must go,
 Take up the burthen of your woe,
 And wander once again below.
 {127}
 With patient heart hold onward to the end, . . .
 Be true unto yourselves, and bear in mind
 That every God is still the good Man's friend;
 And they, who suffer bravely, save mankind.

 4.
 Oh tell me, cried Ereenia, for from thee
 Nought can be hidden, when the end will be!

 5.
 Seek not to know, old Casyapa replied,
 What pleaseth Heaven to hide.
 Dark is the abyss of time,
 But light enough to guide your steps is given;
 Whatever weal or woe betide,
 Turn never front the way of truth aside,
 And leave the event, in holy hope, to Heaven.
 The moment is at hand, no more delay,
 Ascend the etherial bark, and go your way;
 And Ye, of heavenly nature, follow me.

 6.
 The will of Heaven be done, Ladurlad cried,
 Nor more the man replied;
 {128}
 But placed his daughter in the etherial Bark,
 Then took his seat beside.
 There was no word at parting, no adieu.
 Down from that empyreal height they flew:
 One groan Ladurlad breath'd, yet uttered not,
 When, to his heart and brain
 The fiery Curse again like lightning shot.
 And now on earth, the Sire and Child alight,
 Up soar'd the Ship of Heaven, and sail'd away from sight.

 7.
 O ye immortal Bowers,
 Where hitherto the Hours
 Have led their dance of happiness for aye,
 With what a sense of woe
 Do ye expect the blow,
 And see your heavenly dwellers driven away!
 Lo! where the aunnay-birds of graceful mien,
 Whose milk-white forms were seen,
 Lovely as Nymphs, your ancient trees between,
 And by your silent springs,
 With melancholy cry,
 Now spread unwilling wings;
 Their stately necks reluctant they protend,
 {129}
 And through the sullen sky,
 To other worlds, their mournful progress bend.
 The affrighted gales to-day
 O'er their beloved streams no longer play,
 The streams of Paradise have ceas'd to flow;
 The Fountain-Tree withholds its diamond shower,
 In this portentous hour, . .
 This dolorous hour, . . this universal woe.
 Where is the Palace, whose far-flashing beams,
 With streaks and streams of ever-varying light,
 Brighten'd the polar night
 Around the frozen North's extremest shore?
 Gone like a morning rainbow, . . like a dream. . .
 A star that shoots and falls, and then is seen no more.

 8.
 Now! now! . . . Before the Golden Palaces,
 The Bramin strikes the inevitable hour.
 The fatal blow is given,
 That over Earth and Heaven
 Confirms the Almighty Rajah in his power.
 All evil Spirits then,
 That roam the World about,
 Or wander through the sky,
 {130}
 Set up a joyful shout.
 The Asuras and the Giants join the cry,
 The damn'd in Padalon acclaim
 Their hop'd Deliverer's name;
 Heaven trembles with the thunder-drowning sound;
 Back starts affrighted Ocean from the shore,
 And the adamantine vaults, and brazen floor
 Of Hell, are shaken with the roar.
 Up rose the Rajah through the conquer'd sky,
 To seize the Swerga for his proud abode;
 Myriads of evil Genii round him fly,
 As royally, on wings of winds, he rode,
 And scal'd high Heaven, triumphant like a God.



NOTES.

{133}

  _Calmly she took her seat_.--I. p. 8.

SHE, says Bernier, whom I saw burn herself, when I parted from
_Surat_ to travel into _Persia_, in the presence of Monsieur _Chardin_
of _Paris_, and of many _English_ and _Dutch_, was of a middle age,
and not unhandsome. To represent unto you the undaunted cheerfulness
that appeared in her countenance, the resolution with which she
marched, washed herself, spoke to the people; the confidence with
which she looked upon us, viewed her little cabin, made up of very dry
millet-straw and small wood, went into this cabin, and sat down upon
the pile, and took her husband's head into her lap, and a torch into
her own hand, and kindled the cabin, whilst I know not how many
_Brahmans_ were busy in kindling the fire round about: To represent to
you, I say, all this as it ought, is {134} not possible for me; I can
at present scarce believe it myself, though it be but a few days since
I saw it.


  _They strip her ornaments away._--I. p. 8.

She went out again to the river, and taking up some water in her
hands, muttered some prayers, and offered it to the sun. All her
ornaments were then taken from her; and her armlets were broken, and
chaplets of white flowers were put upon her neck and hands. Her hair
was tucked up with five combs; and her forehead was marked with clay
in the same manner as that of her husband--STAVORINUS.


  _Around her neck they leave_
  _The marriage-knot alone._--I. p. 8.

When the time for consummating the marriage is come, they light the
fire Homam with the wood of Ravasiton. The Bramin blesses the former,
which being done, the bridegroom takes three handfuls of rice, and
throws it on the bride's head, who does the same to him. Afterwards
the bride's father clothes her in a dress according to his condition,
and washes the bridegroom's feet; the bride's mother observing to pour
out the water. This being done, the father puts his daughter's hand in
his own, puts water into it, some pieces of money, {135} and, giving
it to the bridegroom, says, at the same time, I have no longer any
thing to do with you, and I give you up to the power of another. The
_Tali_, which is a ribbon with a golden head hanging at it, is held
ready; and, being shewn to the company, some prayers and blessings are
pronounced; after which the bridegroom takes it, and hangs it about
the bride's neck. This knot is what particularly secures his
possession of her; for, before he had had the _Tali_ on, all the rest
of the ceremonies might have been made to no purpose; for it has
sometimes happened, that, when the bridegroom was going to fix it on,
the bride's father has discovered his not being satisfied with the
bridegroom's gift, when another, offering more, has carried off the
bride with her father's consent. But when once the _Tali_ is put on,
the marriage is indissoluble; and, whenever the husband dies, the
_Tali_ is burnt along with him, to shew that the marriage bands are
broke. Besides these particular ceremonies, the people have notice of
the wedding by a _Pandal_, which is raised before the bride's door
some days before. The whole concludes with an entertainment which the
bride's father gives to the common friends; and during this festivity,
which continues five days, alms are given to the poor, and the fire
Homam is kept in. The seventh day, the new-married couple set out for
the {136} bridegroom's house, whither they frequently go by
torch-light. The bride and bridegroom are carried in a sedan, pass
through the chief streets of the city, and are accompanied by their
friends, who are either on horseback or mounted on elephants.--A.
ROGER.


  _They force her on, they bind her to the dead_.--I. p. 9.

'Tis true, says Bernier, that I have seen some of them, which, at the
sight of the pile and the fire, appeared to have some apprehension,
and that, perhaps, would have gone back. Those demons, the Bramins,
that are there with their great sticks, astonish them, and hearten
them up, or even thrust them in; as I have seen it done to a young
woman that retreated five or six paces from the pile, and to another,
that was much disturbed when, she saw the fire take hold of her
clothes, these executioners thrusting her in with their long poles.

At Lahor, I saw a very handsome and a very young woman burnt; I
believe she was not above twelve years of age. This poor unhappy
creature appeased rather dead than alive when she came near the pile;
she shook and wept bitterly. Meanwhile, three or four of these
executioners, the Bramins, together with an old hag that held her
under the arm, thrust her on, and made her sit down upon the wood;
and, lest she should run away, {137} they tied her legs and hands; and
so they burnt her alive. I had enough to do to contain myself for
indignation.--BERNIER.

Pietro Della Valle conversed with a widow, who was about to burn
herself by her own choice. She told him, that, generally speaking,
women were not forced to burn themselves; but sometimes, among people
of rank, when a young woman, who was handsome, was left a widow, and
in danger of marrying again, (which is never practised among them,
because of the confusion and disgrace which are inseparable from such
a thing,) or of falling into other irregularities, then, indeed, the
relations of the husband, if they are at all tenacious of the honour
of the family, compel her to burn herself, whether she likes it or no,
merely to prevent the inconveniences which might take place.

Dellon also, whom I consider as one of the best travellers in the
East, expressly asserts, that widows are burnt there "_de gré, ou de
force. L'on n'en voit que trop qui aprés avoir desiré et demandé la
mort avec un courage intrepide, et aprés avoir obtenu et acheté la
permission de se brûler, ont tremblé à là veuë du bucher, se sont
repenties, mais trop tard, de leur imprudence, et ont fait d'inutiles
efforts pour se retracter. Mais lorsque cela arrive, bien loin que les
Bramenes soient touchés_ {138} _d'aucune pieté, ils lient cruellement
ces malheureuses, et les brûlent par force, sans avoir aucun egard à
leurs plaintes, ni à leurs cris._"--Tom. i. p. 138.

It would be easy to multiply authorities upon this point. Let it
suffice to mention one important historical fact: When the great
Alboquerque had established himself it Goa, he forbade these accursed
sacrifices, the women extolled him for it as their benefactor and
deliverer, (_Commentarios de Alb._ ii. 20,) and no European in India
was ever so popular, or so revered by the natives. Yet, if we are to
believe the anti-missionares, none but fools, fanatics, and pretenders
to humanity, would wish to deprive the Hindoo women of the right of
burning themselves! "It may be useful (says Colonel Mark Wilks,) to
examine the reasonableness of interfering with the most exceptionable
of all their institutions. It has been thought an abomination not to
be tolerated, that a widow should immolate herself on the funeral pile
of her deceased husband. But what judgement should we form of the
Hindoo, who (if any of our institutions admitted the parallel) should
_forcibly_ pretend to stand between a Christian and the hope of
eternal salvation? And shall we not hold him to be a driveller in
politics and morals, a fanatic in religion, and a pretender in
humanity, who would forcibly wrest this hope from the Hindoo {139}
widow?"--_Historical Sketches of the South of India_, vol. i. p. 499.

Such opinions, and such language, may safely be left to the
indignation and pity which they cannot fail to excite. I shall only
express my astonishment, that any thing so monstrous, and so miserably
futile, should have proceeded from a man of learning, great good
sense, and general good feelings, as Colonel Wilks evidently appears
to be.


  _One drops, another plunges in._--I. p. 10.

When Bernier was passing from Amad-Avad to Agra, there came news to
him in a borough, where the caravan rested under the shade, (staying
for the cool of the evening to march on their journey,) that a woman
was then upon the point of burning herself with the body of her
husband. I presently rose, says he, and ran to the place where it was
to be done, which was a great pit, with a pile of wood raised in it,
whereon I saw laid a dead corpse, and a woman, which, at a distance,
seemed to me pretty fair, sitting near it on the same pile, besides
four or five Bramins, putting the fire to it from all sides; five
women of a middle age, and well enough dressed, holding one another by
the hand, and dancing about the pit, and a great crowd of people, men
and women, looking {140} on. The pile of wood was presently all on
fire, because store of oil and butter had been thrown upon it: and I
saw, at the same time, through the flames, that the fire took hold of
the clothes of the woman, that were imbued with well-scented oils,
mingled with powder of sandal and saffron. All this I saw, but
observed not that the woman was at all disturbed; yea, it was said,
that she had been heard to pronounce, with great force, these two
words, _five_, _two_, to signify, according to the opinion of those
that hold the soul's transmigration, that this was the _fifth_ time
she had burnt herself with the same husband, and that there remained
but two more for perfection; as if she had at that time this
remembrance, or some prophetical spirit. But here ended not this
infernal tragedy: I thought it was only by way of ceremony that these
five women sung and danced about the pit; but I was altogether
surprised when I saw, that the flame having taken hold of the clothes
of one of them, she cast herself, with her head foremost, into the
pit; and that after her, another, being overcome by the flame and the
smoke, did the like; and my astonishment redoubled afterwards, when I
saw that the remaining three took one another again by the hand,
continued their dance without any apparent fear; and that at length
they precipitated themselves, one after another, into the fire, as
their {141} companions had done. I learnt that these had been five
slaves, who, having seen their mistress extremely afflicted at the
sickness of her husband, and heard her promise him, that she would not
survive him, but burn herself with him, were so touched with
compassion and tenderness towards this their mistress, that they
engaged themselves in a promise to follow her in her resolution, and
to burn themselves with her.--BERNIER.

This excellent traveller relates an extraordinary circumstance which
occurred at one of these sacrifices. A woman was engaged in some
love-intrigues with a young Mahommedan, her neighbour, who was a
tailor, and could play finely upon the tabor. This woman, in the hopes
she had of marrying this young man, poisoned her husband, and
presently came away to tell the tailor, that it was time to be gone
together, as they had projected, or else she should be obliged to burn
herself. The young man, fearing lest he might be entangled in a
mischievous business, flatly refused her. The woman, not at all
surprised at it, went to her relations, and advertised them of the
sudden death of her husband, and openly protested that she would not
survive him, but burn herself with him. Her kindred, well satisfied
with so generous a resolution, and the great honour she did to the
whole family, presently had a pit made and filled with wood, exposing
{142} the corpse upon it, and kindling the fire. All being prepared,
the woman goes to embrace and bid farewell to all her kindred that
were there about the pit, among whom was also the tailor, who had been
invited to play upon the tabor that day, with many others of that sort
of men, according to the custom of the country. This fury of a woman
being also come to this young man, made sign as if she would bid him
farewell with the rest; but, instead of gently embracing him, she
taketh him with all her force about his collar, pulls him to the pit,
and tumbleth him, together with herself, into the ditch, where they
both were soon dispatched.--BERNIER.

The Hindoos sometimes erect a chapel on the spot where one of these
sacrifices has been performed, both on account of the soul of the
deceased, and as a trophy of her virtue. I remember to have seen one
of these places, where the spot on which the funeral pile had been
erected was inclosed and covered with bamboos, formed into a kind of
bower planted with flowering creepers. The inside was set round with
flowers, and at one end, there was an image.--CRAWFURD.

Some of the Yogees, who smear themselves with ashes, use none but what
they collect from funeral piles,--human ashes! PIETRO DELLA VALLE.

From a late investigation, it appears, that the number {143} of women
who sacrifice themselves within thirty miles round Calcutta every
year, is, on an average, upwards of two hundred. The Pundits have
already been called on to produce the sanction of their Shasters for
this custom. The passages exhibited are vague and general in their
meaning, and differently interpreted by the same casts. Some sacred
verses commend the practice, but none command it; and the Pundits
refer once more to _custom_. They have, however, intimated, that if
government will pass a regulation, amercing by fine every Brahmin who
attends a burning, or every Zemindar who permits him to attend it, the
practice cannot possibly long continue; for that the ceremony,
unsanctified by the presence of the priests, will lose its dignity and
consequence in the eyes of the people.

The civilized world may expect soon to hear of the abolition of this
opprobrium of a Christian administration, the female sacrifice; which
has subsisted, to our certain knowledge, since the time of Alexander
the Great.--CLAUDIUS BUCHANAN.

This practice, however, was manifestly unknown when the Institutes of
Menu were written. Instructions are there given for the conduct of a
widow: "Let her," it is said, "emaciate her body, by living
voluntarily on pure flowers, roots, and fruit; but let her not, when
her {144} lord is deceased, even pronounce the name of another man.
Let her continue till death forgiving all injuries, performing harsh
duties, avoiding every sensual pleasure, and cheerfully practising the
incomparable rules of virtue, which have been followed by such women
as were devoted to one only husband. Many thousands of Brahmins,
having avoided sensuality from their early youth, and having left no
issue in their families, have ascended nevertheless to heaven; and,
like those abstemious men, a virtuous wife ascends to heaven, though
she have no child, if, after the decease of her lord, she devote
herself to pious austerity: but a widow, who, from a wish to bear
children, slights her deceased husband by marrying again, brings
disgrace on herself here below, and shall be excluded from the seat of
her lord."--_Inst. of Menu_, ch. 5, 157-161.

Second marriages were permitted to men.--_Ibid_. 167, 8-9.


  _Lo! Arvalan appears._--II. p. 11.

Many believe that some souls are sent back to the spot where their
bodies were burnt, or where their ashes are preserved, to wait there
until the new bodies they are destined to occupy be ready for their
reception. This appears to correspond with an opinion of Plato, which,
{145} with many other tenets of that philosopher, was adopted by the
early Christians; and an ordinance of the Romish church is still
extant, prohibiting having lights or making merriment in church-yards
at night, lest they should disturb the souls that might come
thither.--CRAWFURD.

According to the Danish missionaries, the souls of those who are
untimely slain wander about as diabolical spectres, doing evil to
mankind, and possessing those whom they persecute.--NIECAMP. i. 10.
§ 14.

The inhabitants of the hills near Rajamahall believe, that when God
sends a messenger to summon a person to his presence, if the messenger
should mistake his object, and carry off another, he is desired by the
Deity to take him away; but as the earthly mansion of his soul must be
decayed, it is destined to remain mid-way between heaven and earth,
and never can return to the presence of God. Whoever commits homicide
without a divine order, and whoever is killed by a snake, as a
punishment for some concealed crime, will be doomed to the same state
of wandering; and whoever hangs himself will wander eternally with a
rope about his neck.--_Asiat. Researches_.

Pope Benedict XII. drew up a list of 117 heretical opinions held by
the Armenian Christians, which he sent to the king of
Armenia,--instead of any other assistance, {146} when that prince
applied to him for aid against the Mahomedans. This paper was first
published by Bernino, and exhibits a curious mixture of mythologies.
One of their opinions was, that the souls of the adult wander about in
the air till the day of judgment; neither hell, nor the heavenly, nor
the terrestrial paradise, being open to them till that day shall have
past.

Davenant, in one of his plays, speculates upon such a state of
wandering as the lot of the soul after death:--

  I must to darkness go, hover in clouds,
  Or in remote untroubled air, silent
  As thoughts, or what is uncreated yet;
  Or I must rest in some cold shade, and shall
  Perhaps ne'er see that everlasting spring
  Of which philosophy so long has dreamt,
  And seems rather to wish than understand.
                    _Love and Honour._

I know no other author who has so often expressed to those who could
understand him, his doubts respecting a future state, and how
burthensome he felt them.


  _But I, all naked feeling and raw life_.--II. p. 13.

By the vital souls of those men who have committed {147} sins in the
body, another body, composed of _nerves_, with five sensations, in
order to be susceptible of torment, shall certainly be assumed after
death; and being intimately united with those minute nervous
particles, according to their distribution, they shall feel in that
new body the pangs inflicted in each case by the sentence of
Yama.--_Inst. of Menu_.

Henry More, the Platonist, has two applicable stanzas in his Song of
the Soul:--

   Like to a light fast lock'd in lanthorn dark,
   Whereby by night our wary steps we guide
   In slabby streets, and dirty channels mark,
   Some weaker rays through the black top do glide,
   And flusher streams, perhaps, from horny side;
   But when we've past the peril of the way,
   Arrived at home, and laid that case aside,--
   The naked light how clearly doth it ray,
  And spread its joyful beams as bright as summer's day.

   Even so the soul, in this contracted state,
   Confined to these strait instruments of sense,
   More dull and narrowly doth operate;
   At this hole hears,--the sight must ray from thence,--
   Here tastes, there smells;--but when she's gone from hence,
   {148}
   Like naked lamp she is one shining sphere,
   And round about has perfect cognoscence,
   Whatever in her horizon doth appear.
  She is one orb of sense, all eye, all airy ear.

Amid the uncouth allegory, and more uncouth language, of this strange
series of poems, a few passages are to be found of exceeding beauty.
Milton, who was the author's friend, had evidently read them.


  _Undying as I am!_--II. p. 12.

The Soul is not a thing of which a man may say, it hath been, it is
about to be, or is to be hereafter; for it is a thing without birth;
it is ancient, constant, and eternal, and is not to be destroyed in
this its mortal frame. How can the man who believeth that this thing
is incorruptible, eternal, inexhaustible, and without birth, think
that he can either kill or cause it to be killed! As a man throweth
away old garments and putteth on new, even so the Soul, having quitted
its old mortal frames, entereth into others which are new. The weapon
divideth it not, the fire burneth it not, the water corrupteth it not,
the wind drieth it not away;--for it is indivisible, inconsumable,
incorruptible, and is not to be dried away;--it is eternal, universal,
permanent, immoveable; it is {149} invisible, inconceivable, and
unalterable.--BHAGVAT GEETA.


  _Mariataly_.--II. p. 15.

Mariatale, as Sonnerat spells the name, was wife of the penitent
Chamadaguini, and mother of Parassourama, who was, in part, an
incarnation of Veeshno. This goddess, says Sonnerat, commanded the
elements, but could not preserve that empire longer than her heart was
pure. One day, while she was collecting water out of a tank, and,
according to her custom, was making a bowl of earth to carry it to the
house, she saw on the surface of the water, some figures of Grindovers
(Glendoveers) which were flying over her head. Struck with their
beauty, her heart admitted an impure thought, and the earth of the
bowl dissolved. From that time she was obliged to make use of an
ordinary vessel. This discovered to Chamadaguini that his wife had
deviated from purity; and, in the excess of his rage, he ordered his
son to drag her to the place where criminals were executed, and to
behead her. The order was executed; but Parassourama was so much
afflicted for the loss of his mother, that Chamadaguini told him to
take up the body, and fasten the head upon it, and repeat a prayer
(which he taught him for that purpose) in her ear, and then his mother
{150} would come to life again. The son ran eagerly to perform what he
was ordered, but, by a very singular blunder, he joined the head of
his mother to the body of a Parichi, who had been executed for her
crimes; a monstrous union, which gave to this woman the virtues of a
goddess, and the vices of a criminal. The goddess, becoming impure by
such a mixture, was driven from her house, and committed all kinds of
cruelties. The Deverkels, perceiving the destruction she made,
appeased her by giving her power to cure the small-pox, and promising
that she should be implored for that disorder. Mariatale is the great
goddess of the Parias;--to honour her, they have a custom of dancing
with several pots of water on their heads, placed one above the other:
These pots are adorned with the leaves of the Margosies, a tree
consecrated to her.


  _It was my hour of folly._--II. p. 13.

Among the qualities required for the proper execution of public
business, mention is made, "That a man must be able to keep in
subjection his lust, his anger, his avarice, his _folly_, and his
pride." The folly there specified is not to be understood in the usual
sense of the word in an European idiom, as a negative quality, or the
mere want of sense, but as a kind of obstinately stupid {151}
lethargy, or perverse absence of mind, in which the will is not
altogether passive: It seems to be a weakness peculiar to Asia, for we
cannot find a term by which to express the precise idea in the
European languages. It operates somewhat like the violent impulse of
fear, under which men will utter falsehoods totally incompatible with
each other, and utterly contrary to their own opinion, knowledge, and
conviction; and, it may be added also, their inclination and
intention.

A very remarkable instance of this temporary frenzy happened lately in
the supreme Court of Judicature at Calcutta, where a man (not an
idiot) swore, upon a trial, that he was no kind of relation to his
brother, who was then in Court, and who had constantly supported him
from his infancy; and that he lived in a house by himself, for which
he paid the rent from his own pocket, when it was proved that he was
not worth a rupee, and when the person in whose house he had always
resided stood at the bar close to him.

Another conjecture, and that exceedingly acute and ingenious, has been
started upon this _folly_, that it may mean the deception which a man
permits to be imposed on his judgment by his passions, as acts of
rapacity and avarice are often committed by men who ascribe them to
prudence and a just assertion of their own right; malice {152} and
rancour pass for justice, and brutality for spirit. This opinion, when
thoroughly examined, will very nearly tally with the former; for all
the passions, as well as fear, have an equal efficacy to disturb and
distort the mind: But to account for the _folly_ here spoken of as
being the offspring of the passions, instead of drawing a parallel
between it and the impulses of those passions, we must suppose the
impulses to act with infinitely more violence upon an Asiatic mind
than we can ever have seen exemplified in Europe. It is, however,
something like the madness so inimitably delineated in the Hero of
Cervantes, sensible enough upon some occasions, and at the same time
completely wild, and unconscious of itself upon others; and that, too,
originally produced by an effort of the will, though, in the end,
overpowering and superseding its functions.--HALHED.


  _The little songsters of the sky_
  _Sit silent in the sultry hour._--IV. p. 29.

The tufted lark, fixed to this fruitful land, says Sonnini, speaking
of Egypt, never forsakes it; it seems, however, that the excessive
heat annoys him. You may see these birds, as well as sparrows, in the
middle of the day, with their bills half open, and the muscles of
their breasts agitated, breathing with difficulty, and as if they
panted {153} for respiration. The instinct which induces them to
prefer those means of subsistence which are easily obtained, and in
abundance, although attended with some suffering, resembles the mind
of man, whom a thirst for riches engages to brave calamities and
dangers without number.


  _The Watchman._--V. 35.

The watchmen are provided with no offensive weapons excepting a sling;
on the contrary, they continue the whole day standing in one single
position, upon a pillar of clay raised about ten feet, where they
remain bellowing continually, that they may terrify, without hurting,
the birds who feed upon the crop. Every considerable field contains
several such centinels, stationed at different corners, who repeat the
call from one to another so incessantly, that the invaders have hardly
any opportunity of making good a livelihood in the field.

These watchmen are forced, during the rains, to erect, instead of a
clay pillar, a scaffolding of wood as high as the crop, over which
they suspend a roof of straw, to shelter their naked bodies from the
rain.--TENNANT.


  _The Golden Palaces_.--V. 35.

Every thing belonging to the sovereign of Ava has the {154} addition
of [Transcriber: the last letter of the word "sho-" is unreadable],
or golden, annexed to it; even his majesty's person is never mentioned
but in conjunction with this precious metal. When a subject means to
affirm that the king has heard any thing, he says, "it has reached the
golden ears;" he who obtained admission to the royal presence has been
at the "golden feet." The perfume of otto of roses, a nobleman observed
one day, "was an odour grateful to the golden nose."--SYMES.


  _A cloud ascending in the eastern sky_
  _Sails slowly o'er the vale,_
  _And darkens round, and closes in the night._--V. p. 37.

At this season of the year, it is not uncommon, towards the evening,
to see a small black cloud rising in the eastern part of the horizon,
and afterwards spreading itself to the north-west. This phenomenon is
always attended with a violent storm of wind, and flashes of the
strongest and most vivid lightning and heavy thunder, which is
followed by rain. These storms sometimes last for half an hour or
more; and, when they disperse, they leave the air greatly freshened,
and the sky of a deep, clear, and transparent blue. When they occur
near the full moon, the whole atmosphere is illuminated by a soft but
brilliant silver light, attended with gentle airs.--HODGES.

{155}

  _A white flag, flapping to the winds of night,_
  _Marks where the tyger seized his human prey._--V. p. 37.

It is usual to place a small white triangular flag, fixed to a bamboo
staff, of ten or twelve feet long, at the place where a tyger has
destroyed a man. It is common for the passengers, also, each to throw
a stone, or brick, near the spot, so that, in the course of a little
time, a pile equal to a good waggon-load is collected. This custom, as
well as the fixing a rag on any particular thorn-bush, near the fatal
spot, is in use likewise on various accounts. Many brambles may be
seen in a day's journey, completely covered with this motley
assemblage of remnants. The sight of the flags and piles of stones
imparts a certain melancholy, not perhaps altogether devoid of
apprehension: They may be said to be of service in pointing out the
places most frequented by tygers.--_Oriental Sports_, vol. ii. p. 22.


  _Pollear._--V. p. 45.

The first and greatest of the sons of Sevee is Pollear: he presides
over marriages: The Indians build no house without having first
carried a Pollear on the ground, which they sprinkle with oil, and
throw flowers on it {156} every day. If they do not invoke it before
they undertake any enterprise, they believe that God will make them
forget what they wanted to undertake, and that their labour will be in
vain. He is represented with an elephant's head, and mounted on a rat;
but in the pagodas they place him on a pedestal, with his legs almost
crossed. A rat is always put before the door of his chapel. This rat
was a giant, called Gudja-mouga-chourin, on whom the gods had bestowed
immortality, as well as great powers, which he abused, and did much
harm to mankind. Pollear, entreated by the sages and penitents to
deliver them, pulled out one of his tusks, and threw it against
Gudja-mouga-chourin; the tooth entered the giant's stomach, and
overthrew him, who immediately changed himself into a rat as large as
a mountain, and came to attack Pollear, who sprung on his back,
telling him, that hereafter he should ever be his carrier.

The Indians, in their adoration of this god, cross their arms, shut
the fist, and in this manner give themselves several blows on the
temples; then, but always with the arms crossed, they take hold of
their ears, and make three inclinations, bending the knee; after
which, with their hands joined, they address their prayers to him, and
strike their forehead. They have a great veneration for this deity,
whose image they place in all temples, streets, {157} highways, and,
in the country, at the foot of some tree, that all the world may have
an opportunity of invoking him before they undertake any concern, and
that travellers may make their adorations and offerings to him before
they pursue their journey.--SONNERAT.


  _The Glendoveers_.--VI. p. 48.

This word is altered from the _Grindouvers_ of Sonnerat, who describes
these celestial children of Casyapa as famous for their beauty; they
have wings, he adds, and fly in the air with their wives. I do not
know whether they are the _Gandharvas_ of the English orientalists.
The wings with which they are attired in the poem are borrowed from
the neglected story of Peter Wilkins, a work of great genius. Whoever
the author was, his winged people are the most beautiful creatures of
imagination that ever were devised. I copy his minute description of
the _graundee_, as he calls it:--Stothard has made some delightful
drawings of it in the Novelist's Magazine.

"She first threw up two long branches, or ribs, of the whale-bone, as
I called it before, (and indeed for several of its properties, as
toughness, elasticity, and pliableness, nothing I have ever seen can
so justly be compared to it,) which were jointed behind to the
upper-bone of the spine, and which, when not extended, lie bent over
the shoulders {158} on each side of the neck forwards, from whence, by
nearer and nearer approaches, they just meet at the lower rim of the
belly in a sort of point; but, when extended, they stand their whole
length above the shoulders, not perpendicularly, but spreading
outwards, with a web of the softest and most pliable and spungy
membrane that can be imagined in the interstices between them,
reaching from their root or joint on the back up above the hinder part
of the head, and near half way their own length; but, when closed, the
membrane falls down in the middle upon the neck, like an handkerchief.
There are also two other ribs, rising, as it were, from the same root,
which, when open, run horizontally, but not so long as the others.
These are filled up in the interstice between them and the upper ones
with the same membrane; and on the lower side of this is also a deep
flap of the membrane, so that the arms can be either above or below it
in flight, and are always above it when closed. This last rib, when
shut, flaps under the upper one, and also falls down with it before to
the waist; but it is not joined to the ribs below. Along the whole
spine-bone runs a strong, flat, broad, grisly cartilage, to which are
joined several other of these ribs, all which open horizontally, and
are filled in the interstices with the above membrane, and are jointed
to the ribs of the person just where {159} the plane of the back
begins to turn towards the breast and belly; and, when shut, wrap the
body round to the joints on the contrary side, folding neatly one side
over the other.

"At the lower spine are two more ribs extended horizontally when open,
jointed again to the hips, and long enough to meet the joint on the
contrary side cross the belly: and from the hip-joint, which is on the
outermost edge of the hip-bone, runs a pliable cartilage quite down
the outside of the thigh and leg to the ancle; from which there branch
out divers other ribs, horizontally also when open, but, when closed,
they encompass the whole thigh and leg, rolling inwards cross the back
of the leg and thigh, till they reach and just cover the cartilage.
The interstices of these are filled up with the same membrane. From
the two ribs which join to the lower spine-bone, there hangs down a
sort of short apron, very full of plaits, from hip-joint to hip-joint,
and reaches below the buttocks, half way or more to the hams. This has
also several small limber ribs in it. Just upon the lower spine-joint,
and above the apron, as I call it, there are two other long branches,
which, when close, extend upon the back from the point they join at
below to the shoulders, where each rib has a clasper, which, reaching
over the shoulders, just under the fold of the uppermost branch {160}
or ribs, hold up the two ribs flat to the back, like a V, the
interstices of which are filled up with the aforesaid membrane. This
last piece, in flight, falls down almost to the ancles, where the two
claspers, lapping under each leg within-side, hold it very fast; and
then, also, the short apron is drawn up, by the strength of the ribs
in it, between the thighs forward, and covers as far as the rim of the
belly. The whole arms are covered also from the shoulders to the wrist
with the same delicate membrane, fastened to ribs of proportionable
dimensions, and jointed to a cartilage on the outside in the same
manner as on the legs. It is very surprising to feel the difference of
these ribs when open and when closed; for closed, they are as pliable
as the finest whale-bone, or more so; but, when extended, are as
strong and stiff as a bone. They are tapering from the roots, and are
broader or narrower, as best suits the places they occupy, and the
stress they are put to, up to their points, which are almost as small
as a hair. The membrane between them is the most elastic thing I ever
met with, occupying no more space, when the ribs are closed, than just
from rib to rib, as flat and smooth as possible; but, when extended in
some postures, will dilate itself surprisingly,

"It is the most amazing thing in the world to observe the large
expansion of this graundee when open, and, {161} when closed, (as it
all is in a moment, upon the party's descent,) to see it fit so close
and compact to the body as no tailor can come up to it; and then the
several ribs lie so justly disposed in the several parts, that instead
of being, as one would imagine, a disadvantage to the shape, they make
the body and limbs look extremely elegant; and by the different
adjustment of their lines on the body and limbs, the whole, to my
fancy, somewhat resembles the dress of the old Roman warriors in their
buskins; and, to appearance, seems much more noble than any fictitious
garb I ever saw, or can frame a notion of to myself."


  _Mount Himakoot._--VI. p. 49.

_Dushmanta_. Say, Matali, what mountain is that which, like an evening
cloud, pours exhilarating streams, and forms a golden zone between the
western and eastern seas?

_Matali_. That, O king! is the mountain of Gandharvas, named
Hémacúta: The universe contains not a more excellent place for the
successful devotion of the pious. There Casyapa, father of the
immortals, ruler of men, son of Marichi, who sprang from the
self-existent, resides with his consort Aditi, blessed in holy
retirement.--We now enter the sanctuary of him who rules {162} the
world, and the groves which are watered by streams from celestial
sources.

_Dushmanta_. I see with equal amazement both the pious and their awful
retreat. It becomes, indeed, pure spirits to feed on balmy air in a
forest blooming with trees of life; to bathe in rills dyed yellow with
the golden dust of the lotus, and to fortify their virtue in the
mysterious bath; to meditate in caves, the pebbles of which are
unblemished gems; and to restrain their passions, even though nymphs
of exquisite beauty frolick around them. In this grove alone is
attained the summit of true piety, to which other hermits in vain
aspire.--SACONTALA.


  _Her death predoom'd_
  _To that black hour of midnight, when the Moon_
  _Hath turn'd her face away,_
  _Unwilling to behold_
  _The unhappy end of guilt!_--VI. p. 50.

I will now speak to thee of that time in which, should a devout man
die, he will never return; and of that time in which, dying, he shall
return again to earth.

Those holy men who are acquainted with Brahm, departing this life in
the fiery light of day, in the bright season of the moon, within the
six months of the sun's northern {163} course, go unto him: but those
who depart in the gloomy night of the Moon's dark season, and whilst
the Sun is yet within the southern part of his journey, ascend for a
while into the regions of the Moon, and again return to mortal birth.
These two, Light and Darkness, are esteemed the World's eternal ways:
he who walketh in the former path returneth not; whilst he who walketh
in the latter, cometh back again upon the earth.--KREESHNA, _in the
Bhagvat Geeta_.


  _Indra_.--VI. p. 52.

The Indian God of the visible Heavens is called _Indra_, or the King;
and _Divespetir_, Lord of the Sky. He has the character of the Roman
_Genius_, or chief of the Good Spirits. His consort is named _Sachi_;
his celestial city _Amaravati_; his palace _Vaijayanta_; his garden
_Nandana_; his chief elephant _Airevat_; his charioteer _Matali_; and
his weapon _Vajra_, or the thunder-bolt. He is the regent of winds and
showers, and, though the East is peculiarly under his care, yet his
Olympus is Meru, or the North Pole, allegorically represented as a
mountain of gold and gems. He is the Prince of the beneficent
Genii.--Sir W. JONES.

A distinct idea of Indra, the King of Immortals, may be collected from
a passage in the ninth section of the Geta.

{164}

"These having, through virtue, reached the mansion of the king of
_Suras_, feast on the exquisite heavenly food of the Gods; they, who
have enjoyed this lofty region of SWERGA, _but_ whose virtue is
exhausted, revisit the habitation of mortals."

He is the God of thunder and the five elements, with inferior Genii
under his command; and is conceived to govern the eastern quarter of
the world, but to preside, like the _Genius_ or _Agathodæmon_ of the
ancients, over the celestial bands, which are stationed on the summit
of MERU, or the North Pole, where he solaces the Gods with nectar
and heavenly music.

The _Cinnaras_ are the male dancers in SWERGA, or the Heaven of
Indra, and the Apsaras are his dancing girls, answering to the fairies
of the Persians, and to the damsels called in the Koran _hhúru
lûyùn_, or, _with antelope's eyes_.--Sir W. JONES.


  _I have seen Indra tremble at his prayer,_
  _And at his dreadful penances turn pale._--VI. p. 52.

Of such penances Mr. Halhed has produced a curious specimen:

"In the wood, Midhoo, which is on the confines of the kingdoms of
Brege, Tarakee selected a pleasant and beautiful spot, adorned with
verdure and blossoms, and {165} there exerted himself in penance and
mortification, externally, with the sincerest piety, but, in reality,
the most malignant intention, and with the determined purpose of
oppressing the Devetas; penances such as credulity itself was
astonished to hear; and they are here recounted:--

1. For a hundred years, he held up his arms and one foot towards
heaven, and fixed his eyes upon the sun the whole time.

2. For a hundred years, he remained standing on tip-toe.

3. For a hundred years more, he nourished himself with nothing but
water.

4. For a hundred years more, he lived upon nothing but air.

5. For a hundred years more, he stood and made his adorations in the
river.

6. For a hundred years more, he made those adorations buried up to his
neck in the earth.

7. For a hundred years more, enveloped with fire.

8. For a hundred years more, he stood upon his head with his feet
towards heaven.

9. For a hundred years more, he stood upon the palm of one hand
resting on the ground.

{166}

10. For a hundred years more, he hung by his hand from the branch of a
tree.

11. For a hundred years more, he hung from a tree with his head
downwards.

When he at length came to a respite from these severe mortifications,
a radiant glory encircled the devotee, and a flame of fire, arising
from his head, began to consume the whole world."--_From the Seeva
Pooraun_, MAURICE's _History of Hindostan_.

You see a pious Yogi, motionless as a pollard, holding his thick bushy
hair, and fixing his eyes on the solar orb. Mark--his body is half
covered with a white ant's edifice made of raised clay; the skin of a
snake supplies the place of his sacerdotal thread, and part of it
girds his loins; a number of knotty plants encircle and wound his
neck, and surrounding birds' nests almost conceal his shoulders.

_Dushmanta_. I bow to a man of his austere devotion.--SACONTALA.


  _That even Seeva's self,_
  _The Highest, cannot grant, and be secure._--VI. p. 52.

It will be seen from the following fable, that Seeva had once been
reduced to a very humiliating employment by one of Kehama's
predecessors:

{167}

_Ravana_, by his power and infernal arts, had subjugated all the gods
and demigods, and forced them to perform menial offices about his
person and household. _Indra_ made garlands of flowers to adorn him
withal; _Agni_ was his cook; _Surya_ supplied light by day, and
_Chandra_ by night; _Varuna_ purveyed water for the palace; _Kuvera_
furnished cash. The whole _nava-graha_ (the _nine planetary_ spheres)
sometimes arranged themselves into a ladder, by which, they serving as
steps, the tyrant ascended his throne: _Brahma_ (for the great gods
were there also; and I give this anecdote as I find it in my
memoranda, without any improved arrangement)--_Brahma_ was a herald,
proclaiming the giant's titles, the day of the week, month, &c. daily
in the palace,--a sort of speaking almanack: _Mahadeva_, (i. e.
Seeva,) in his Avatara of _Kandeh-roo_, performed the office of
barber, and trimmed the giants' beards: _Vishnu_ had the honourable
occupation of instructing and drilling the dancing and singing girls,
and selecting the fairest for the royal bed: _Ganesa_ had the care of
the cows, goats, and herds; _Vayu_ swept the house; _Yama_ washed the
linen;--and in this manner were all the gods employed in the menial
offices of _Ravana_, who rebuked and flogged them in default of
industry and attention. Nor were the female divinities exempted; for
_Bhavani_, in her name and form of _Satni_, {168} was head Aya, or
nurse, to Ravana's children; _Lakshmi_ and _Saraswati_ were also among
them, but it does not appear in what capacity.--MOOR's _Hindu
Pantheon_, p. 333.

Seeva was once in danger even of annihilation: "In passing from the
town of Silgut to Deonhully, says Colonel Wilks, I became accidentally
informed of a sect, peculiar, as I since understand, to the
north-eastern parts of Mysoor, the women of which universally undergo
the amputation of the first joints of the third and fourth fingers of
their right hands. On my arrival at Deonhully, after ascertaining that
the request would not give offence, I desired to see some of these
women; and, the same afternoon, seven of them attended at my tent. The
sect is a sub-division of the _Murresoo Wokul_,[1] and belongs to
the fourth great class of the Hindoos, viz. the Souder. Every woman of
the sect, previously to piercing the ears of her eldest daughter,
preparatory to her being betrothed in marriage, must necessarily
undergo this mutilation, which is performed by the blacksmith of the
village, for a regulated fee, by a surgical process sufficiently rude.
The finger to be amputated is placed on a block; the blacksmith places
a chisel over the articulation of the {169} joint, and chops it off at
a single blow. If the girl to be betrothed is motherless, and the
mother of the boy have not before been subject to the operation, it is
incumbent on her to perform the sacrifice. After satisfying myself
with regard to the facts of the case, I enquired into the origin of so
strange a practice, and one of the women related, with great fluency,
the following traditionary tale, which has since been repeated to me,
with no material deviation, by several others of the sect:

A Rachas (or giant) named _Vrica_, and in after times _Busm-aasoor_,
or the giant of the ashes, had, by a course of austere devotion to
_Mahadeo_ (Seeva) obtained from him the promise of whatever boon he
should ask. The Rachas accordingly demanded, that every person on
whose head he should place his right hand, might instantly be reduced
to ashes; and Mahadeo conferred the boon, without suspicion of the
purpose for which it was designed.

The Rachas no sooner found himself possessed of this formidable power,
than he attempted to use it for the destruction of his benefactor.
Mahadeo fled, the Rachas pursued, and followed the fugitive so closely
as to chace him into a duck grove; where Mahadeo, changing his form
and bulk, concealed himself in the centre of a fruit, then called
_tunda pundoo_, but since named _linga_ {170} _tunda_, from the
resemblance which its kernel thenceforward assumed to the _ling_, the
appropriate emblem of Mahadeo.

The Rachas having lost sight of Mahadeo, enquired of a husbandman, who
was working in the adjoining field, whether he had seen the fugitive,
and what direction he had taken. The husbandman, who had attentively
observed the whole transaction, fearful of the future resentment of
Mahadeo, and equally alarmed for the present vengeance of the giant,
answered aloud, that he had seen no fugitive, but pointed, at the same
time, with the little finger of his right hand, to the place of
Mahadeo's concealment.

In this extremity,[2] Vishnou descended, in the form of a
beautiful damsel, to the rescue of Mahadeo. The Rachas became
instantly enamoured;--the damsel was a _pure_ Brahmin, and might not
be approached by the _unclean_ Rachas. By degrees she appeared to
relent; and, as a previous condition to farther advances, enjoined the
performance of his ablutions in a neighbouring pool. After these were
finished, she prescribed, as a farther purification, the performance
of the _Sundia_,--a ceremony in which the right hand is successively
applied to the breast, to the crown of the head, and to other parts of
the body. {171} The Rachas, thinking only of love, and forgetful of
the powers of his right hand, performed the _Sundia_, and was himself
reduced to ashes.

Mahadeo now issued from the _linga tunda_, and, after the proper
acknowledgments for his deliverance, proceeded to discuss the guilt of
the treacherous husbandman, and determined on the loss of the finger
with which he had offended, as the proper punishment of his crime.

The wife of the husbandman, who had just arrived at the field with
food for her husband, hearing this dreadful sentence, threw herself at
the feet of Mahadeo. She represented the certain ruin of her family,
if her husband should be disabled for some months from performing the
labours of the farm, and besought the Deity to accept two of her
fingers, instead of one from her husband. Mahadeo, pleased with so
sincere a proof of conjugal affection, accepted the exchange, and
ordained, that her female posterity, in all future generations, should
sacrifice two fingers at his temple, as a memorial of the transaction,
and of their exclusive devotion to the God of the Ling.

The practice is, accordingly, confined to the supposed, posterity of
this single woman, and is not common to the whole sect of
Murresoo-Wokul. I ascertained the actual number of families who
observed this practice in three {172} successive districts through
which I afterwards passed, and I conjecture that, within the limits of
Misoor, they may amount to about two thousand houses.

The Hill of _Sectee_, in the talook of Colar, where the giant was
destroyed, is (according to this tradition) formed of the ashes of
Busmaa-soor: It is held in particular veneration by this sect, as the
chief seat of their appropriate sacrifice; and the fact of its
containing little or no moisture, is held to be a miraculous proof
that the ashes of the giant continue to absorb the most violent and
continued rain. This is a remarkable example of easy credulity. I have
examined the mountain, which is of a sloping form, and composed of
coarse granite.--_Hist. Sketches of the South of India_, vol. i. p.
442, note.


  _The Ship of Heaven._--VI. p. 56.

I have converted the _Vimana_, or self-moving Car of the Gods, into a
Ship. Capt. Wilford has given the history of its invention,--and, what
is more curious, has attempted to settle the geography of the story:

"A most pious and venerable sage, named RISHI'CE'SA, being very far
advanced in years, had resolved to visit, before he died, all the
famed places of pilgrimage; and, having performed his resolution, he
bathed at last in the sacred water of the _Ca'li_, where he observed
some {173} fishes engaged in amorous play, and restating on their
numerous progeny, which would sport like then in the stream, he
lamented the improbability of leaving any children: but, since he
might possibly be a father, even at his great age, he went immediately
to the king of that country, HIRANYAVERNA, who had fifty daughters,
and demanded one of them in marriage. So strange a demand gave the
prince great uneasiness: yet he was unwilling to incur the displeasure
of a saint, whose imprecations he dreaded; he, therefore, invoked
_Heri_, or _Vishnu_; to inspire him with a wise answer, and told the
hoar philosopher, that he should marry any one of his daughters, who,
of her own accord, should fix on him as her bridegroom. The sage,
rather disconcerted, left the palace; but, calling to mind the two
sons of ASWINI, he hastened to their terrestrial abode, and
requested that they would bestow on him both youth and beauty: they
immediately conducted him to _Abhimatada_, which we suppose to be
_Abydus_, in Upper _Egypt_; and, when he had bathed in the pool of
_Rupayauvana_, he was restored to the flower of his age with the
graces and charms of CA'MA'DE'VA. On his return to the palace, he
entered the secret apartments, called _antahpura_, where the fifty
princesses were assembled: and they were all so transported with the
vision of more than human beauty, {174} that they fell into an
ecstacy, whence the place was afterwards named _Mohast-han_, or
_Mohana_, and is, possibly, the same with _Mohannan_. They no sooner
had recovered from their trance, than each of them exclaimed, that she
would be his bride; and their altercation having brought
HIRANYAVERNA into their apartment, he terminated the contest by
giving them all in marriage to RISHICE'SA, who became the father of
a hundred sons; and, when he succeeded to the throne, built the city
of _Suc-haverddhana_, framed _vimânas_, or celestial, self-moving
cars, in which he visited the gods, and made gardens, abounding in
delights, which rivalled the bowers of INDRA; but, having granted
the desire, which he formed at _Matoyasangama_, or the place where the
fish were assembled, he resigned the kingdom to his eldest son
HIRANYAVRIDDHA, and returned, in his former shape, to the banks of
the Ca'li, where he closed his days in devotion.--WILFORD. _Asiatic
Researches_.

_Dushmanta_. In what path of the winds are we now journeying?

_Matali_. This is the way which leads along the triple river, heaven's
brightest ornament, and causes yon luminaries to roll in a circle with
diffused beams: it is the course of a gentle breeze which supports the
floating {175} forms of the gods; and this path was the second step of
Vishnu when he confounded the proud Bali.

* * *

_Dushmanta_. The car itself instructs me that we are moving over
clouds pregnant with showers; for the circumference of its wheels
disperses pellucid water.

* * *

_Dushmanta_. These chariot wheels yield no sound; no dust arises from
them, and the descent of the car gave me no shock.

_Matali_. Such is the difference, O King! between thy car and that of
Indra.--SACONTALA.

_And ending thus where they began_, &c.--VII. p. 66.

It has been supposed that the perpetual lamps, which were at one time
believed to have been found in certain sepulchres, were kept burning
by a similar process. For the lamp, it was argued, being hermetically
closed, so that no smoke could escape, the smoke was condensed into
its original liquid form; and thus the liquor which fed the flame
passing into smoke, and the smoke again into the liquor, the flame was
continually kept up. There still remained a difficulty about the wick;
some supposed that this was made of threads of gold inconceivably
fine: others, with less expense of fancy, said a wick of {176}
asbestos would answer the purpose.--FEYJOO. _Theatro Critico_, _T_.

  _The Raining Tree._--VII. p. 65.

The island of _Fierro_ is one of the most considerable of the
Canaries, and I conceive that name to be given it upon this account,
that its soil not affording so much as a drop of fresh water, seems to
be of _iron_; and, indeed, there is in this island neither river, nor
rivulet, nor well, nor spring, save that only, towards the sea-side,
there are some wells; but they lie at such a distance from the city,
that the inhabitants can make no use thereof. But the great Preserver
and Sustainer of all, remedies this inconvenience by a way so
extraordinary, that a man will be forced to sit down and acknowledge
that he gives in this an undeniable demonstration of his goodness and
infinite providence,

For, in the midst of the island, there is a tree, which is the only
one of its kind, inasmuch as it hath no resemblance to those mentioned
by us in this relation, nor to any other known to us in Europe. The
leaves of it are long and narrow, and continue in a constant verdure,
winter and summer; and its branches are covered with a cloud, which is
never dispelled, but resolved into a moisture, which causes to fall
from its leaves a very clear water, {177} and that in such abundance,
that the cisterns, which are placed at the foot of the tree to receive
it, are never empty, but contain enough to supply both men and
beasts.--MANDELSLO.

Feyjoo denies the existence of any such tree, upon the authority of P.
Tallandier, a French Jesuit, (quoted in Men. de Trevoux. 2715, art.
97.) who visited the island. "_Assi no dudo_," he adds, "_que este
Fenix de las plantas es ten fingedo como el de las aves._"--Theat.
Crit. _Tom. ii. Disc_. 2. § 65. What authority is due to the
testimony of this French Jesuit I do not know, never having seen his
book; but it appears, from the undoubted evidence of Glas, that its
existence is believed in the Canaries, and positively affirmed by the
inhabitants of Fierro itself.

"There are," says this excellent author, "only three fountains of
water in the whole island, one of them is called Acof,[3] which,
in the language of the ancient inhabitants, signifies river; a name,
however, which does not seem to have been given it on account of its
yielding much water, for in that respect it hardly deserves the same
of a fountain. More to the northward is another called Hapio; and in
the middle of the island is a spring, {178} yielding a stream about
the thickness of a man's finger. This last was discovered in the year
1565, and is called the Fountain of Anton Hernandez. On account of the
scarcity of water, the sheep, goats, and swine here do not drink in
the summer, but are taught to dig up the roots of fern, and chew them,
to quench their thirst. The great cattle are watered at those
fountains, and at a place where water distils from the leaves of a
tree. Many writers have made mention of this famous tree; some in such
a manner as to make it appear miraculous; others again deny the
existence of any such tree, among whom is Father Feyjoo, a modern
Spanish author, in his _Theatro Critico_. But he, and those who agree
with him in this matter, are as much mistaken as they who would make
it appear miraculous. This is the only island of all the Canaries
which I have not been in; but I have sailed with natives of Hierro,
who, when questioned about the existence of this tree, answered in the
affirmative.

The author of the History of the Discovery and Conquest has given us a
particular account of it, which I shall relate here at large. "The
district in which this tree stands is called Tigulahe; near to which,
and in the cliff, or steep rocky ascent that surrounds the whole
island, is a narrow gutter or gulley, which commences at the sea, and
continues to the summit of the cliff, where it joins or {179}
coincides with a valley, which is terminated by the steep front of a
rock. On the top of this rock grows a tree, called, in the language of
the ancient inhabitants, Garse, _i.e._ Sacred or Holy Tree, which,
for many years, has been preserved sound, entire, and fresh. Its
leaves constantly distil such a quantity of water as is sufficient to
furnish drink to every living creature in Hierro; nature having
provided this remedy for the drought of the island. It is situated
about a league and a half from the sea. Nobody knows of what species
it is, only that it is called Til. It is distinct from other, trees,
and stands by itself; the circumference of the trunk is about twelve
spans, the diameter four, and in height, from the ground to the top of
the highest branch, forty spans: The circumference of all the branches
together, is one hundred and twenty feet. The branches are thick and
extended; the lowest commence about the height of an ell from the
ground. Its fruit resembles the acorn, and tastes something like the
kernel of a pine-nut, but is softer and more aromatic. The leaves of
this tree resemble those of the laurel, but are larger, wider, and
more curved; they come forth in a perpetual succession, so that the
tree always remains green. Near to it grows a thorn, which fastens on
many of its branches, and interweaves with them; and, at a small
distance from the Garse, are some beech-trees, {180} bresos, and
thorns. On the north side of the trunk are two large tanks, or
cisterns, of rough stone, or rather one patera divided, each half
being twenty feet square, and sixteen spans in depth. One of these
contains water for the drinking of the inhabitants, and the other that
which they use for their cattle, washing, and such like purposes.
Every morning, near this part of the island, a cloud or mist arises
from the sea, which the south and easterly winds force against the
fore-mentioned steep cliff; so that the cloud, having no vent but by
the gutter, gradually ascends it, and from thence advances slowly to
the extremity of the valley, where it is stopped and checked by the
front of the rock which terminates the valley, and then rests upon the
thick leaves and wide-spreading branches of the tree; from whence it
distils in drops during the remainder of the day, until it is at
length exhausted, in the same manner that we see water drip from the
leaves of trees after a heavy shower of rain. This distillation is not
peculiar to the Garse, or Til, for the bresos which grow near it
likewise drop water; but their leaves being but few and narrow, the
quantity is so trifling, that, though the natives save some of it, yet
they make little or no account of any but what distils from the Til;
which, together with the water of some fountains, and what is saved in
the winter season, is sufficient to {181} serve them and their flocks.
This tree yields most water in those years when the Levant, or
easterly winds, have prevailed for a continuance; for by these winds
only, the clouds or mists are drawn hither from the sea. A person
lives on the spot near which this tree grows, who is appointed by the
Council to take care of it and its water, and is allowed a house to
live in, with a certain salary. He every day distributes to each
family of the district, seven pots or vessels full of water, besides
what he gives to the principal people of the island."

"Whether the tree which yields water at this present time be the same
as that mentioned in the above description, I cannot pretend to
determine, but it is probable there has been a succession of them; for
Pliny, describing the Fortunate Islands, says, "In the mountains of
Ombrion, are trees resembling the plant Ferula, from which water may
be procured by pressure: What comes from the black kind is bitter,
but that which the white yields is sweet and palatable."--GLAS's
_History of the Canary Islands_.

Cordeyro (_Historia Insulana_, lib. ii. c. 5.) says, that this tree
resembles what in other places is called the _Til_, (_Tilia_,) the
Linden Tree; and he proceeds, from these three letters, to make it an
emblem of the Trinity. The water, he says, was called the _Agua
Santa_, and the tree {182} itself the _Santa Arvore_,--appellations
not ill bestowed. According to his account the water was delivered out
in stated portions.

There is an account of a similar tree in Cockburne's Travels; but this
I believe to be a work of fiction. Bernal Diaz, however, mentions one
as growing at Naco, in Honduras, "_Que en mitad de la siesta, por
recio sol que hiziesse, parecia que la sombra del arbol refrescava el
corazon, caia del uno como rozio muy delgado que confortava las
cabezas._"--206.

There may be some exaggeration in the accounts of the Fierro Tree, but
that the story has some foundation I have no doubt. The islanders of
St. Thomas say, that they have a sort of trees whose leaves
continually are distilling water. (_Barbot. in Churckle_, 405.) It is
certain that a dew falls in hot weather from the lime,--a fact of
which any person may easily convince himself. The same property has
been observed in other English trees, as appears by the following
extract from the Monthly Magazine:

"In the beginning of August, after a sun-shine day, the air became
suddenly misty about six o'clock; I walked, however, by the road side
from seven to eight, and observed, in many places, that a shower of
big drops of water was falling under the large trees, although no rain
{183} fell elsewhere. The road and path continued dusty, and the
field-gates showed no signs of being wetted by the mist. I have often
noticed the like fact, but have not met with a satisfactory
explanation of this power in trees to condense mist."

I am not the only poet who has availed himself of the Fierro Tree. It
is thus introduced in the Columbus of Carrara,--a singular work,
containing, amid many extravagancies, some passages of rare merit:

  Ecce autem inspector miri dum devius ignis
  Fertur, in occursum miræ magis incidit undæ.

  Cum sis Luna potes; tenebræ minuere pudorem.
  Est mihi Virginitas, fateor, re charior omni,
  Attamen, hâc salvâ, fœcundæ si quoque Matris
  Nomina miscerem, duplici de nomine quantum
  Ambitiosa forem; certe non parva voluptas
  Me caperet, coram si quis me luderet infans
  Si mecum gestu, mecum loqueretur ocellis,
  Cumque potest, quacumque potest, me voce vocaret,
  Cujus et in vultu multum de matre viderem.
  Ni sinit hoc humana tamen nature licere,
  Fiat quâ ratione potest; mutare figuram
  Nil refert, voti compos si denique fiam.
  Annuit oranti facilis Dea; Virgine digna
  Et quia vota tulit, Virgo probat. Eligit ergo
  De grege Plantarum ligni quæ cœlibis esset.
  Visa fuit Platanus: placet hæc; si vertat in istam

  _Nared_.--VII. p. 67.

A very distinguished son of Brahma, named Nared, bears a strong
resemblance to Hermes or Mercury; he was a wise legislator, great in
arts and in arms, an eloquent messenger of the Gods either to one
another, or to favoured mortals, and a musician of exquisite skill.
His invention of the _Vina_, or Indian lute, is thus described in the
poem entitled _Magha_: "Nared sat watching from time to time his large
_Vina_, which, by the impulse of the breeze, yielded notes that
pierced successively the regions of his ear, and proceeded by musical
intervals."--_Asiatic Researches_, Sir W. JONES.

The _Vina_ is an Æolian harp. The people of Amboyna have a different
kind of Æolian instrument, which is thus described in the first
account of D'Entrecasteaux's Voyage: "Being on the sea-shore, I heard
some wind-instruments, the harmony of which, though sometimes very
correct, was intermixed with discordant notes that were by no means
unpleasing. These sounds, which were very musical, and formed fine
cadences, seemed to come from such a distance, that I for some time
imagined the natives were having a concert beyond the road-stead, near
a myriameter {190} from the spot where I stood. My ear was greatly
deceived respecting the distance, for I was not an hundred meters from
the instrument. It was a bamboo at least twenty meters in height,
which had been fixed in a vertical situation by the sea-side. I
remarked between each knot a slit about three centimeters long by a
centimeter and a half wide; these slits formed so many holes, which,
when the wind introduced itself into them, gave agreeable and
diversified sounds. As the knots of this long bamboo were very
numerous, care had been takes to make holes in different directions,
in order that, on whatever side the wind blew, it might always meet
with some of them. I cannot convey a better idea of the sound of this
instrument, than by comparing them to those of the
Harmonica."--LABILLARDIERE. _Voyage in Search of La Perouse_.

Nareda, the mythological offspring of _Saraswati_, patroness of music,
is famed for his talents in that science. So great were they, that he
became presumptuous; and, emulating the divine strains of _Krishna_,
he was punished by having his _Vina_ placed in the paws of a bear,
whence it emitted sounds far sweeter than the minstrelsy of the
mortified musician. I have a picture of this joke, in which _Krishna_
is forcing his reluctant friend to attend to his rough-visaged rival,
who is ridiculously touching the {191} chords of poor _Nareda's Vina_,
accompanied by a brother bruin on the cymbals. Krishna passed several
practical jokes on his humble and affectionate friend: He
metamorphosed him once into a woman, at another time into a
bear.--MOOR's _Hindu Pantheon_, p. 204.

  _Sole Rajah, the Omnipotent below._--VII. p. 71.

No person has given so complete a sample of the absurdity of oriental
titles as the Dutch traveller Struys, in his enumeration of "the proud
and blasphemous titles of the King of Siam,--they will hardly bear
sense," says the translator, in what he elsewhere calls, by a happy
blunder, "the idiotism of our tongue."

The Alliance, written with letters of fine gold, being full of godlike
glory. The most Excellent, containing all wise sciences. The most
Happy, which is not in the world among men. The Best and most Certain
that is {192} in Heaven, Earth, and Hell. The greatest Sweet, and
friendly Royal Word; whose powerful-sounding properties and glorious
fame range through the world, as if the dead were raised by a godlike
power, and wonderfully purged from ghostly and corporal corruption. At
this both spiritual and secular men admire with a special joy, whereas
no dignity may be herewith compared. Proceeding from a friendly,
illustrious, inconquerable, most mighty, and most high Lord; and a
royal Crown of Gold, adorned with nine sorts of precious stones. The
greatest, clearest, and most godlike Lord of unblameable Souls. The
most Holy, seeing every where, and protecting Sovereign of the city
JUDIA, whose many streets and open gates are thronged by troops of
men, which is the chief metropolis of the whole world, the royal
throne of the earth, that is adorned with nine sorts of stones, and
most pleasant valleys. He who guides the reins of the world, and has a
house more than the Gods of fine gold and of precious stones; they the
godlike Lords of thrones and of fine gold; the White, Red, and
Round-tayl'd Elephants,--which excellent creatures are the chiefest of
the nine sorts of Gods. To none hath the divine Lord given, in whose
hand is the victorious sword; who is like the fiery-armed God of
Battails, to the most illustrious.

The second is as blasphemous as the first, though hardly swells so far
out of sense.

The highest PADUCCO SYRY SULTAN, NELMONAM WELGACA, NELMOCHADIN
MAGIVIITHA, JOUKEN DER EAUTEN ALLAULA FYLAN, King of the whole world;
who makes the water rise and flow. A King that is like a God, and
shines like the Sun at noon-day. A King that gives a glance like the
moon when it is at full. Elected of God to be worthy as the North
Star, being of the race and offspring of the great Alexander; with a
great understanding, as a round orb, that tumbles hither and thither,
able to guess at the depth of the great sea. A King that hath amended
all the funerals of the departed Saints, and is as righteous as God,
and of such power that all the world may come and shelter under his
wings. A King that doth right in all things, as the Kings of old have
done. A King more liberal than all Kings. A King that hath many mines
of gold that God hath lent him; who hath built temples half gold and
half brass; sitting upon a throne of pure gold, and of all sorts of
precious stones. A King of the white Elephant, which Elephant is the
King of all Elephants, before whom many thousands of other Elephants
must bow and fall upon their knees. He whose eyes shine like the
morning-star. A King that hath Elephants with four teeth, red, purple,
and pied. Elephants, _ay_, and a BYYTENAQUES Elephant; for which
God has given him many and divers sorts of apparel {194} wrought with
most fine gold, ennobled with many precious stones: and, besides
these, so many Elephants used in battle, having harnesses of iron,
their teeth tipt with steel, and their harnesses laid over with
shining brass. A King that has many hundred horses, whose trappings
are wrought with fine gold, and adorned with precious stones of every
sort that are found in the universal world where the Sun shines, and
these shod with fine gold: besides so many hundred horses that are
used in war of every kind. A King who has all Emperours, Kings,
Princes, and Sovereigns in the whole world, from the rising to the
going down of the sun, under subjection;--and such as can obtain his
favour are by him promoted to great honour; but, on the contrary, such
as revolt, he burns with fire. A King who can show the power of God,
and whatever God has made.

And so, by this time, I hope you have heard enough of a King of
Elephants and Horses, though not a word of his Asses.--STRUYS.


  _The Sacrifice._--VIII. p. 74.

The _Aswamedha_, or sacrifice of a horse. Considerable difficulties
usually attended that ceremony; for the consecrated horse was to be
set at liberty for a certain time, and followed at a distance by the
owner, or his champion, {195} who was usually one of his near kinsmen;
and, if any person should attempt to stop it in its rambles, a battle
must inevitably ensue; besides, as the performer of a hundred
_Aswamedhas_ became equal to the God of the firmament, _Indra_ was
perpetually on the watch, and generally carried off the sacred animal
by force or by fraud.--WILFORD. _Asiat. Res_.

Mr. Halhed gives a very curious account of this remarkable sacrifice:

"The Ashum-meed-Jugg does not merely consist in the performance of
that ceremony which is open to the inspection of the world, namely, in
bringing a horse and sacrificing him; but Ashum-meed is to be taken in
a mystic signification, as implying that the sacrificer must look upon
himself to be typified in that horse, such as he shall be described,
because the religious duty of the Ashum-meed-Jugg comprehends all
those other religious duties, to the performance of which all the wise
and holy direct all their actions, and by which all the sincere
professors of every different faith aim at perfection: The mystic
signification thereof is as follows:

"The head of that unblemished horse is the symbol of the morning; his
eyes are the sun; his breath the wind; his wide-opening mouth is the
Bishwaner, or that innate warmth which invigorates all the world: His
body typifies {196} one entire year; his back paradise; his belly the
plains; his hoof this earth; his sides the four quarters of the
heavens; the bones thereof the intermediate spaces between the four
quarters; the rest of his limbs represent all distinct matter; the
places where those limbs meet, or his joints, imply the months and
halves of the months, which are called _peche_ (or fortnights): His
feet signify night and day; and night and day are of four kinds, 1.
the night and day of Birhma, 2. the night and day of angels, 3. the
night and day of the world of the spirits of deceased ancestors, 4.
the night and day of mortals; these four kinds are typified in his
four feet. The rest of his bones are the constellations of the fixed
stars, which are the twenty-eight stages of the moon's course, called
the Lunar year; his flesh is the clouds; his food the sand; his
tendons the rivers; his spleen and his liver the mountains; the hair
of his body the vegetables, and his long hair the trees: the fore part
of his body typifies the first half of the day, and the hinder part
the latter half; his yawning is the flash of the lightning, and his
turning himself is the thunder of the cloud: His urine represents the
rain, and his mental reflection is his only speech. The golden
vessels, which are prepared before the horse is let loose, are the
light of the day, and the place where those vessels are kept is a type
of the Ocean {197} of the East; the silver vessels, which are prepared
after the horse is let loose, are the light of the night; and the
place where those vessels are kept is a type of the Ocean of the West:
these two sorts of vessels are always before and after the horse. The
Arabian horse, which, on account of its swiftness, is called Hy, is
the performer of the journies of angels; the Tajee, which is of the
race of Persian horses, is the performer of the journies of the
Kundherps (or good spirits); the Wazba, which is of the race of the
deformed Tazee horses, is the performer of the journies of the Jins,
(or demons;) and the Ashoo, which is of the race of Turkish horses, is
the performer of the journies of mankind. This one horse, which
performs these several services, on account of his four different
sorts of riders, obtains the four different appellations. The place
where this horse remains is the great ocean, which signifies, the
great spirit of Perm-Atma, or the Universal Soul, which proceeds also
from that Perm-Atma, and is comprehended in the same Perm-Atma. The
intent of this sacrifice is, that a man should consider himself to be
in the place of that horse, and look upon all these articles as
typified in himself; and, conceiving the Atma (or divine soul) to be
an ocean, should let all thought of self be absorbed in that
Atma."--HALHED, _from Darul Shekuh_.

{198}

Compare this specimen of eastern sublimity with the description of the
horse in Job! Compare it also with the account of the Bengal horses,
in the very amusing work of Captain Williamson,--"which said horses,"
he says, "have generally Reman noses, and sharp narrow foreheads, much
white in their eyes, ill-shaped ears, square heads, thin necks, narrow
chests, shallow girths, lank bellies, cat hams, goose rumps, and
switch tails."--_Oriental Sports_, vol. ii. p. 206.


  _The Bowl that in its vessel floats._--VIII. p. 78.

The day and night are here divided into four quarters, each of six
hours, and these again into fifteen parts, of twenty-four minutes
each. For a chronometer they use a kind of dish of thin brass, at the
bottom of which there is a little hole; this is put into a vessel with
water, and it runs full in a certain time. They begin their first
quarter at six in the morning. They strike the quarters and
subdivisions of time with a wooden hammer, upon a flat piece of iron
or steel, of about ten inches in diameter, which is called a
_garnial_, and gives a pretty smart sound, which can be heard at some
distance. The quarters are first struck, and then as many times as the
brass dish has run full in that quarter. None but the chief men of a
district are allowed to have a _garnial_, and still they may {199} not
strike the first division of the first quarter, which is a privilege
reserved to the nabob alone. Those who attend at these clocks must be
of the Bramin cast.--STAVORINUS.


  _Lo, the time-taper's flame, ascending slow_
  _Creeps up its coil._--VIII. p. 79.

They make a sort of paste of the dust of a certain sort of wood, (the
learned and rich men of sandal, eagle-wood, and others that are
odoriferous), and of this paste they make sticks of several sorts,
drawing them through a hole, that they may be of an equal thickness.
They commonly make them one, two, or three yards long, about the
thickness of a goose-quill, to burn in the pagods before their idols,
or to use like a match to convey fire from one thing to another. These
sticks or ropes they coil, beginning at the centre, and so form a
spiral conical figure, like a fisherman's wheel, so that the last
circle shall be one, two, or three spans diameter, and will last one,
two, or three days, or more, according as it is in thickness. There
are of them in the temples that last ten, twenty, and thirty days.
This thing is hung up by the centre, and is lighted at the lower end,
whence the fire gently and insensibly runs round all the coil, on
which there are generally five marks, to distinguish the five parts of
the {200} night. This method of measuring time is so exact and true,
that they scarce ever find any considerable mistake in it. The
learned, travellers, and all others, who will rise at a certain hour
to follow their business, hang a little weight at the mark that shews
the hour they have a mind to rise at, which, when the fire comes
thither, drops into a brass bason set under it; and so the noise of it
falling awakes them, as our alarum-clocks do.--GEMELLI CARERI.


  _At noon the massacre begun,_
  _And night clos'd in before the work of death was done._
  --VIII. p. 82.

Of such massacres the ancient and modern history of the East supply
but too many examples. One may suffice:

After the surrender of the Ilbars Khan, Nadir prohibited his soldiers
from molesting the inhabitants; but their rapacity was more powerful
than their habits of obedience, or even their dread of his
displeasure, and they accordingly began to plunder. The instant Nadir
heard of their disobedience, he ordered the offenders to be brought
before him, and the officers were beheaded in his presence, and the
private soldiers dismissed with the loss of their ears and noses. The
executioners toiled till {201} sun-set, when he commanded the headless
trunks with their arms to be carried to the main-guard, and there to
be exposed for two days, as an example to others. I was present the
whole time, and saw the wonderful hand of God, which employs such
instruments for the execution of his divine vengeance; although not
one of the executioners was satisfied with Nadir Shah, yet nobody
dared to disobey his commands:--a father beheaded his son, and a
brother a brother, and yet presumed not to complain.--ABDUL KURREEM.


  _Behold his lovely home,_
  _By yonder broad-bough'd Plane o'ershaded._--IX. p. 84.

The plane-tree, that species termed the _Platanus Orientalis_, is
commonly cultivated in Kashmire, where it is said to arrive at a
greater perfection than in other countries. This tree, which in most
parts of Asia is called the _Chinur_, grows to the size of an oak, and
has a taper straight trunk, with a silver-coloured bark; and its leaf,
not unlike an expanded hand, is of a pale green. When in full foliage,
it has a grand and beautiful appearance; and, in the hot weather, it
affords a refreshing shade.--FORSTER.


  _The Marriage-Bower._--IX. p. 85.

The Pandal is a kind of arbour or bower raised before {202} the doors
of young married women. They set up two or three poles, seven or eight
foot in length, round which the leaves of the Pisan-tree, the symbol
of joy, are entwined. These poles support others that are laid
crossways, which are covered with leaves in order to form a shade. The
Siriperes are allowed to set up no more than three pillars, and the
infringing of this custom would be sufficient to cause an
insurrection.--A. ROGER, _in Picart_.


  _There, from the intolerable heat,_
  _The buffaloes retreat._--IX. p. 87.

About noon, in hot weather, the buffalo throws herself into the water
or mud of a tank, if there be one accessible at a convenient distance;
and, leaving nothing above water but her nose, continues there for
five or six hours, or until the heat abates.--BUCHANAN.

In the hot season, when water becomes very scarce, the buffaloes avail
themselves of any puddle they may find among the covers, wherein they
roll and rub themselves, so as in a short time to change what was at
first a shallow flat, into a deep pit, sufficient to conceal their own
bulk. The humidity of the soil, even when the water may have been
evaporated, is particularly gratifying to these animals, which cannot
bear heat, and which, if {203} not indulged in a free access to the
water, never thrive.--_Oriental Sports_, vol. i. p. 259.

The buffalo not only delights in the water, but will not thrive unless
it have a swamp to wallow in. There rolling themselves, they speedily
work deep hollows, wherein they lay immersed. No place seems to
delight the buffalo more than the deep verdure on the confines of
jiels and marshes, especially if surrounded by tall grass, so as to
afford concealment and shade, while the body is covered by the water.
In such situations they seem to enjoy a perfect ecstacy, having in
general nothing above the surface but their eyes and nostrils, the
horns being kept low down, and consequently entirely hidden from
view.--_Oriental Sports_, vol. ii. p. 49.

Captain Beaver describes these animals as to be found during the heat
of the day in the creeks and on the shores of the island of Bulama,
almost totally immerged in water, little more than their heads
appearing above it.


  _The market-flag._--IX. p. 86.

Many villages have markets on particular days, when not only fruits,
grain, and the common necessaries of life are sold, but occasionally
manufactures of various descriptions. These markets are well known to
all the neighbouring country, being on appointed days of the {204}
week, or of the lunar month; but, to remind those who may be
travelling of their vicinity to the means of supply, a _naugaurah_, or
large kettle-drum, is beat during the forenoon, and a small flag,
usually of white linen, with some symbolic figure in colours, or with
a coloured border, is hoisted on a very long bamboo, kept upright by
means of ropes fastened to pins driven into the ground. The flags of
Hindoo villages are generally square and plain; those of the
Mussulmans towns are ordinarily triangular, and bear the type of
their, religion, viz. a double-bladed scymitar.--_Oriental Sports_,
vol. i. p. 100.


  _Mount Meru._--X. p. 93.

According to the orthodox Hindus, the globe is divided into two
hemispheres, both called _Meru_; but the superior hemisphere is
distinguished by the name of _Sumeru_, which implies beauty and
excellence, in opposition to the lower hemisphere, or _Cumeru_, which
signifies the reverse: By _Meru_, without any adjunct, they generally
mean the higher or northern hemisphere, which they describe with a
profusion of poetic imagery as the seat of delights: while they
represent _Cumeru_ as the dreary habitation of demons, in some parts
intensely cold, and in others so hot that the waters are continually
boiling. In strict propriety, Meru denotes the pole and the polar
{205} regions; but it is the celestial north pole round which they
place the gardens and metropolis of _Indra_, while _Yama_ holds his
court in the opposite polar circle, or the Station of _Asuras_, who
warred with the _Suras_, or gods of the firmament.--WILFORD.
_Asiatic Researches_.

In the _Vayu Puráná_, we are told, that the water, or _Ogha_ of the
ocean, coming down from heaven like a stream of _Amrita_ upon _Meru_,
encircles it through seven channels, for the space of 84,000
_Yojanas_, and then divides into four streams, which, falling from the
immense height of Meru, rest themselves in four lakes, from which they
spring over the mountains through the air, just brushing the summits.
This wild account was not unknown in the west; for this passage is
translated almost verbally, by Pliny and Q. Curtius, in speaking of
the Ganges. _Cum magno fragore ipsius statim fontis Ganges erumpit_,
et magnorum montium juga recto alveo stringit, _et ubi primum mollis
planities contingat, in quodam lacu hospitatur_. The words in Italics
are from Pliny (vi. c. 18.) the others from Curtius (viii. c.
9.)--Capt. WILFORD. _As. Res_. vol. viii. p. 322. Calcutta edition.

The Swarganga, or Mandacini, rises from under the feet of Veeshno, at
the polar star, and, passing through the circle of the moon, it falls
upon the summit of Meru; where it divides into four streams, flowing
toward {206} the four cardinal points. These four branches pass
through four rocks, carved into the shape of four heads of different
animals. The Ganges running towards the south passes through a cow's
head: To the west is a horse's head, from which flows the Chaashu or
Oxus; towards the east is the head of an elephant, from which flows
the river Sita; and to the north is a lion's head, from which flows
the Bhadrasama.--WILFORD. _As. Res_. vol. viii. 317. Calc. edition.

The mountains through which the Ganges flows at Hurdwar, present the
spectator with the view of a grand natural amphitheatre; their
appearance is rugged and destitute of verdure; they run in ridges and
bluff points, in a direction east and west: At the back of the largest
range, rise, towering to the clouds, the lofty mountains of
Himmalayah, whose tops are covered with perpetual snow, which, on
clear days, present a most sublime prospect. Their large jagged
masses, broken into a variety of irregular shapes, added to their
stupendous height, impress the mind with an idea of antiquity and
grandeur coeval with the creation; and the eternal frost with which
they are encrusted appears to preclude the possibility of mortals ever
attaining their summit.

In viewing this grand spectacle of nature, the traveller may easily
yield his assent to, and pardon the superstitious {207} veneration of
the Hindoo votary, who, in the fervour of his imagination, assigns the
summit of these icy regions as the abode of the great Mahadeo, or
First Cause, where, seated on his throne of ice, he is supposed to
receive the homage of the surrounding universe.--FRANKLIN's _Life of
George Thomas_, p. 41.

At Gangóttara, three small streams fall down from impassable snowy
precipices, and unite into a small bason below, which is considered by
the Hindus as the source of the Ganges, over which, at that place, a
man can step. This is one of the five _Tirthas_, or stations, more
eminently sacred than the rest upon this sacred river. Narayana
Shastri, who gave this account, had visited it.--BUCHANAN.

The mountain, called Cailasa Cungri is exceedingly lofty. On its
summit there is a Bhowjputr tree, from the root of which sprouts or
gushes a small stream, which the people say is the source of the
Ganges, and that it comes from Vaicont'ha, or Heaven, as is also
related in the Puránas; although this source appears to the sight to
flow from the spot where grows this Bhowjputr tree, which is at an
ascent of some miles; and yet above this there is a still loftier
summit, where no one goes: But I have heard that, on that uppermost
pinnacle, there is a fountain or cavity, to which a Jogui somehow
penetrated, {208} who, having immersed his little finger in it, it
became petrified.--PURANA POORI. _Asiatic Researches_.

Respecting the true source of the Ganges much uncertainty still
prevails. In vain one of the most powerful sovereigns of Indostan, the
emperor Acbar, at the close of the sixteenth century, sent a number of
men, an army of discoverers, provided with every necessary, and the
most potent recommendations, to explore the course of the mighty river
which adorned and fertilised the vast extent of his dominions. They
were not able to penetrate beyond the famous _Mouth of the Cow_. This
is an immense aperture, in a ridge of the mountains of Thibet, to
which the natives of India have given this appellation, from the
fancied or real resemblance of the rocks which form the stupendous
chasm, to the mouth of an animal esteemed sacred throughout Indostan
from the remotest antiquity. From this opening the Ganges,
precipitating itself into a large and deep bason at the foot of the
mountains, forms a cataract, which is called Gangotri. The
impracticability of scaling these precipitous rocks, and advancing
beyond this formidable pass, has prevented the tracing whence this
rushing mass of water takes its primary rise.--WILCOCKE, _Note to
Stavorinus_.

  _The birth of Ganges._--X. p. 94.

I am indebted to Sir William Jones's Hymn to Ganga for this fable:

  "Above the stretch of mortal ken,
  On bless'd _Cailasa's_ top, where every stem
  Glow'd with a vegetable gem,
  Mahe'sa stood, the dread and joy of men;
  While Párvati, to gain a boon,
  Fix'd on his locks a beamy moon,
  And hid his frontal eye, in jocund play,
  With reluctant sweet delay.
  All nature straight was lock'd in dim eclipse,
  Till _Brahmans_ pure, with hallow'd lips,
  And warbled prayers, restored the day;
  When Ganga from his brow, by heavenly fingers press'd,
  Sprang radiant, and, descending, graced the caverns of the west."

The descent of the Ganges is related in the Ramayuna, one of the most
celebrated of the sacred books of the Bramins. This work the excellent
and learned Baptist missionaries at Serampore are at this time
employed in printing and translating; one volume has arrived in {210}
Europe, and from it I am tempted here to insert an extract of
considerable length. The reader will be less disposed to condemn the
fictions of Kehama as extravagant, when he compares them with this
genuine specimen of Hindoo fable. He will perceive, too, that no undue
importance has been attributed to the Horse of the Sacrifice in the
Poem.

"The son of Kooshika having, in mellifluous accents, related these
things to Rama, again addressed the descendant of Kakootitha.
Formerly, O hero! there was a king of Hyoodhya, named Sagura, the
Sovereign of Men, virtuous, desirous of children, but childless; O
Rama! the daughter of Vidurbhakeshinee, virtuous, attached to truth,
was his chief consort, and the daughter of Urishtunemi, Soomuti,
unequalled in beauty, his second spouse. With these two consorts, the
great king, going to Himuvat, engaged in sacred austerities on the
mountain in whose sacred stream Bhrigoo constantly bathed. A hundred
years being completed, the sage Bhrigoo, clothed with truth, rendered
propitious by his austerities, granted him this blessing: O sinless
One! thou shalt obtain a most numerous progeny; thy fame, O chief of
men! will be unparalleled in the universe. From one of thy consorts, O
sire! shall spring the founder of thy race, and, from the other, sixty
thousand sons.

{211}

"The queens, pleased, approached the chief of men who was thus
speaking, and, with hands respectfully joined, asked, O Brahman!
whose shall be the one son, and who shall produce the multitude? We, O
Brahman! desire to hear. May thy words be verified. Hearing their
request, the most virtuous Bhrigoo replied in these admirable words:
Freely say which of these favours ye desire, whether the one, founder
of the family, or the multitude of valiant, renowned, energetic sons.
O Rama! son of Rughoo, Keshinee hearing the words of the sage, in the
presence of the king accepted the one son, the founder of the family;
and Soomuti, sister of Soopurna, accepted the sixty thousand sons,
active and renowned. The king, O son of Rughoo! having respectfully
circumambulated the sage, bowing the head, returned with his spouses
to his own city.

"After some time had elapsed, his eldest spouse Keshinee bore to
Sugura a son, named Usumunja; and Soomuti, O chief of men! brought
forth a gourd, from which, on its being opened, came forth sixty
thousand sons. These, carefully brought up by their nurses, in jars
filled with clarified butter, in process of time attained the state of
youth;[4] and, after a long period, the {212} sixty thousand sons
of Sugura, possessed of youth and beauty, became men. The eldest son,
the offspring of Sugura, O son of Rughoo! chief of men, seizing
children, would throw them into the waters of the Suruyoo, and sport
himself with their drowning pangs. This evil person, the distresser of
good men, devoted to the injury of the citizens, was by his father
expelled from the city. The son of Usumunja, the heroic Ungshooman, in
conversation courteous and affectionate, was esteemed by all.

"After a long time, O chief of men! Sugura formed the steady resolve,
"I will perform a sacrifice." Versed in the Veda, the king, attended
by his instructors, having determined the things relating to the
sacrificial work, began to prepare the sacrifice.

"Hearing the words of Vishwa-mitra, the son of Rughoo, highly
gratified in the midst of the story, addressed the sage, bright as the
ardent flame, Peace be to Thee: I desire, O Brahman! to hear this
story at large, how my predecessors performed the sacrifice. Hearing
his words, Vishwa-mitra, smiling, pleasantly replied to Rama: {213}
"Attend, then, O Rama! to the story of Sugura, repeated at full
length. Where the great mountain Himuvat, the happy father-in-law of
Shunkura, and the mountain Bindhyo, overlooking the country around,
proudly vie with each other, there was the sacrifice of the great
Sugura performed. That land, sacred and renowned, is the habitation of
Rakshuses. At the command of Sugura, the hero Ungshooman, O Rama!
eminent in archery, a mighty charioteer, was the attendant (of the
horse.[5]) While the king was performing the sacrifice, a serpent,
assuming the form of Ununta, rose from the earth, and seized the
sacrificial horse. The sacrificial victim being stolen, all the
priests, O son of Rughoo! going to the king, said, Thy consecrated
horse has been stolen by some one in the form of a serpent. Kill the
thief, and bring back the sacred horse. This interruption in the
sacrifice portends evil to us all. Take those steps, O king! which may
lead to the completion of the sacrifice. Having heard the advice of
his instructors, the king, calling his sixty thousand sons into the
assembly, said, I perceive that the Rakshuses have not been to this
great sacrifice. A sacrifice of the Nagas is now performing by the
sages, and some god, in the form of a serpent, {214} has stolen the
devoted horse. Whoever he be, who, at the time of the Deeksha, has
been the cause of this afflictive circumstance, this unhappy event,
whether he be gone to Patala, or whether he remain in the waters, kill
him, O sons! and bring back my victim. May success attend you, O my
sons! At my command traverse the sea-girt earth, digging with mighty
labour, till you obtain a sight of the horse; each one piercing the
earth to the depth of a yojunga, go you in search of him who stole the
sacred horse. Being consecrated by the Deeksha, I, with my grandson
and my teachers, will remain with the sacrifice unfinished, till I
again behold my devoted horse.

"Thus instructed by their father Sugura, they, in obedience to him,
went with cheerful mind, O Rama! to the bottom of the earth. The
strong ones, having gone over the earth without obtaining a sight of
the horse, each of these mighty men pierced the earth, to the depth of
a yojuna, with their mighty arm, the stroke of which resembled the
thunder-bolt. Pierced by Kooddalas,[6] by Purighas,[7] by
Shoolas,[8] by Mooshulas,[9] {215} and Shuktis,[10] the
earth cried out as in darkness. Then arose, O Raghuva! a dreadful cry
of the serpents, the Usooras, the Rakshuses, and other creatures, as
of beings suffering death. These angry youths, O son of Rughoo! dug
the earth even to Patala, to the extent of sixty thousand yojunas.
Thus, O prince! the sons of the sovereign of men traversed
Jumboodweepa, inclosed with mountains, digging wherever they came. The
gods now, with the Gundburwas and the great serpents, struck with
astonishment, went all of them to Bruhma, and, bowing even to the foot
of the great spirit, they, full of terror, with dejected countenance,
addressed him thus: "O Deva! O divine One! the whole earth, covered
with mountains and woods, with rivers and continents, the sons of
Sugura are now digging up. By these digging, O Bruhma! the mightiest
beings are killed. This is the stealer of our consecrated victims; by
this (fellow) our horse was taken away:" Thus saying, these sons of
Sugura destroy all creatures. O most powerful! having heard this, it
becomes thee to interpose, before these horse-seekers destroy all thy
creatures endued with life."

Thus far the thirty-second Section, describing the digging of earth.

{216}

  SECTION THIRTY-THREE.

"Hearing the words of the gods, the divine Bruhma replied to these
affrighted ones, stupified with the Yuma-like power of these youths:
The wise Vasoo-deva, the great Madhuva, who claims the earth for his
spouse, that divine one, residing in the form of Kupila, supports the
earth. By the fire of his wrath he will destroy the sons of the king.
This piercing of the earth must, I suppose, be perceived by him, and
he will (effect) the destruction of the long-sighted sons of Sugura.
The thirty-three gods,[11] enemy-subduing, having heard the words
of Bruhma, returned home full of joy. The sons of Sugura, highly
renowned, thus digging the earth, a sound was produced resembling that
of conflicting elements. Having encompassed and penetrated the whole
earth, the sons of Sugura, returning to their father, said, The whole
earth has been traversed by us; and all the powerful gods, the
Danuvas, the Ruckshuses, the Pishachas, the serpents, and hydras, are
killed[12]; but we have not seen {217} thy horse, nor the thief.
What shall we do? Success be to thee: be pleased to determine what
more is proper. The virtuous king, having heard the words of his sons,
O son of Rughoo! angrily replied, Again commence digging. Having
penetrated the earth, and found the stealer of the horse, having
accomplished your intention, return again. Attentive to the words of
their father, the great Sugura, the sixty thousand descended to
Patala, and there renewed their digging. There, O chief of men! they
saw the elephant of that quarter of the globe, in size resembling a
mountain, with distorted eyes, supporting with his head this earth,
with its mountains and forests, covered with various countries, and
adorned with numerous cities. When, for the sake of rest, O
Kakootstha! the great elephant, through distress, refreshes himself by
moving his head, an earthquake is produced.

"Having respectfully circumambulated this mighty elephant, guardian of
the quarter, they, O Rama! praising him, penetrated into Patala. After
they had thus penetrated the east quarter, they opened their way to
the south. Here they saw that great elephant Muha-pudma, equal to a
huge mountain, sustaining the earth with his head. Beholding him, they
were filled with surprise; and, after the usual circumambulation, the
sixty thousand sons of the great Sugura perforated the west quarter.
{218} In this these mighty ones saw the elephant Soumunusa, of equal
size. Having respectfully saluted him, and enquired respecting his
health, these valiant ones digging, arrived at the north. In this
quarter, O chief of Rughoo! they saw the snow-white elephant Bhudra,
supporting this earth with his beautiful body. Circumambulating him,
they again penetrated the earth, and proceeded north-east to that
renowned quarter; all the sons of Sugura, through anger, pierced the
earth again. There all those magnanimous ones, terrible in swiftness,
and of mighty prowess, saw Kupila, Vasodeva the eternal,[13] and
near him the horse feeding. Filled, O son of Rughoo! with unparalleled
joy, they all knowing him to be the stealer of the horse, with eyes
starting with rage, seizing their spades and their _langulas_, and
even trees and stones, ran towards him full of wrath, calling out,
Stop, stop! thou art the stealer of our sacrificial horse: Thou stupid
one, know that we who have found thee are the sons of Rughoo. Kupila,
filled with excessive anger, uttered from his nostrils a loud sound,
and instantly, O Kakootstha! by Kupila of immeasurable power, were all
the sons of Sugura turned to a heap of ashes."

{219}

Thus far the thirty-third Section, describing the interview with
Kupila.


  SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.

"O son of Rughoo! Sugura, perceiving that his sons had been absent a
long time, thus addressed his grandson, illustrious by his own might:
Thou art a hero, possessed of science, in prowess equal to thy
predecessors. Search out the fate of thy paternal relatives, and the
person by whom the horse was stolen, that we may avenge ourselves on
these subterraneous beings, powerful and great. Take thy scymitar and
bow, O beloved one! and finding out thy deceased paternal relatives,
destroy my adversary. The proposed end being thus accomplished,
return. Bring me happily through this sacrifice.

"Thus particularly addrest by the great Sugura, Ungshooman, swift and
powerful, taking his bow and scymitar, departed. Urged by the king,
the chief of men traversed the subterraneous road dug by his great
ancestors. There the mighty one saw the elephant of the quarter,
adored by the gods, the Danuvas and Rukshuses, the Pishachas, the
birds and the serpents. Having circumambulated him, and asked
concerning his welfare, Ungshooman {220} enquired for his paternal
relatives, and the stealer of the sacred victim. The mighty elephant
of the quarter hearing, replied, O son of Usumunja! thou wilt
accomplish thine intention, and speedily return with the horse. Having
heard this, he, with due respect, enquired, in regular succession, of
all the elephants of the quarters. Honoured by all these guardians of
the eight sides of the earth, acquainted with speech, and eminent in
eloquence, he was told, Thou wilt return with the horse. Upon this
encouraging declaration, he swiftly went to the place where lay his
paternal relatives, the sons of Sugura, reduced to a heap of ashes.
(At this sight) the son of Usumunja, overwhelmed with sorrow on
account of their death, cried out with excess of grief. In this state
of grief, the chief of men beheld, grazing near, the sacrificial
horse. The illustrious one, desirous of performing the funeral
obsequies of these sons of the king, looked around for a receptacle of
water, but in vain. Extending his eager view, he saw, O Rama! the
sovereign of birds, the uncle of his paternal relatives, Soopurna, in
size resembling a mountain. Vinuteya, of mighty prowess, addressed him
thus: Grieve not, O chief of men! this slaughter is approved by the
universe. These great ones were reduced to ashes by Kupila of
unmeasurable might. It is not proper for thee, O wise one! to pour
common water upon {221} these ashes. Gunga, O chief of men! is the
eldest daughter of Himuvut. With her sacred stream, O valiant one!
perform the funeral ceremonies for thine ancestors. If the purifier of
the world flow on them, reduced to a heap of ashes, these ashes, being
wetted by Gunga, the illuminator of the world, the sixty thousand sons
of thy grandfather will be received into heaven. May success attend
thee! Bring Gunga to the earth from the residence of the gods. If thou
art able, O chief of men! possessor of the ample share, let the
descent of Gunga be accomplished by thee. Take the horse, and go
forth. It is thine, O hero! for to complete the great paternal
sacrifice.

"Having heard these words of Soopurna, Ungshooman, the heroic,
speedily seizing the horse, returned. Then, O son of Rughoo! being
come to the king, who was still performing the initiatory ceremonies,
he related to him the whole affair, and the advice of Soopurna.

"After hearing the terror-inspiring relation of Ungshooman, the king
finished the sacrifice, in exact conformity to the tenor and spirit of
the ordinance: Having finished his sacrifice, the sovereign of the
earth returned to his palace. The king, however, was unable to devise
any way for the descent of Gunga from heaven: after a long time,
unable to fix upon any method, he departed to heaven, having reigned
thirty thousand years.

{222}

"Sugura having, O Rama! paid the debt of nature, the people chose
Ungshooman, the pious, for their sovereign. Ungshooman, O son of
Rughoo! was a very great monarch. His son was called Dwileepa. Having
placed him on the throne, he, O Raguva! retiring to the pleasant top
of Mount Himuvut, performed the most severe austerities. This
excellent sovereign of men, illustrious as the immortals, was
exceedingly desirous of the descent of Gunga; but not obtaining his
wish, the renowned monarch, rich in sacred austerities, departed to
heaven, after having abode in the forest sacred to austerities,
thirty-two thousand years. Dwileepa, the highly energetic, being made
acquainted with the slaughter of his paternal great-uncles, was
overwhelmed with grief; but was still unable to fix upon a way of
deliverance. How shall I accomplish the descent of Gunga? How shall I
perform the funeral ablutions of these relatives? How shall I deliver
them? In such cogitations was his mind constantly engaged. While these
ideas filled the mind of the king, thoroughly acquainted with sacred
duties, there was born to him a most virtuous son, called
Bhugee-rutha. The illustrious king Dwileepa performed many sacrifices,
and governed the kingdom for thirty thousand years; but, O chief of
men! no way of obtaining the deliverance of his ancestors appearing,
he, by a disease, discharged the debt {223} of nature. Having
installed his own son Bhugee-rutha in the kingdom, the lord of men
departed to the paradise of Indra, through the merits of his own
virtuous deeds.

"The pious, the royal sage, Bhugee-rutha, O son of Rughoo! was
childless. Desirous of offspring, yet childless, the great monarch
entrusted the kingdom to the care of his counsellors; and, having his
heart set on obtaining the descent of Gunga, engaged in a long course
of sacred austerities upon the mountain Gokurna. With hands erected,
he, O son of Rughoo! surrounded in the hot season with five
fires,[14] according to the prescribed ordinance; in the cold
season lying in water; and in the rainy season exposed to the
descending clouds, feeding on fallen leaves, with his mind restrained,
and his sensual feelings subdued, this valiant and great king
continued a thousand years in the practice of the most severe
austerities. The magnanimous monarch of mighty arm having finished
this period, the divine Bruhma, the lord of creatures, the supreme
governor, was highly pleased; and with the gods, going near to the
great Bhugee-rutha, employed in sacred austerities, said to him, I am
propitious. O performer of sacred vows! ask a blessing. The mighty,
{224} the illustrious Bhugee-rutha, with hands respectfully joined,
replied to the sire of all, O divine one! if thou art pleased with me,
if the fruit of my austerities may be granted, let all the sons of
Sugura obtain water for their funeral rites. The ashes of the great
ones being wetted by the water of Gunga, let all my ancestors ascend
to the eternal heaven.[15] Let a child, O divine one! be granted to
us, that our family become not extinct. O God! let this great blessing
be granted to the family of Ikshwakoo. The venerable sire of all
replied to the king thus requesting in the sweetest and most pleasing
accents: Bhugee-rutha, thou mighty charioteer, be this great wish of
thine heart accomplished. Let prosperity attend thee, thou increaser
of the family of Ikshwakoo! Engage Hura, O king! to receive (in her
descent) Gunga, the eldest daughter of the mountain Himuvut. The
earth, O king! cannot sustain the descent of Gunga, nor beside
Shoolee[16] do I behold any one, O king! able to receive her. The
creator having thus replied to the king, and spoken to Gunga, returned
to heaven with Macroots and all the gods."

Thus far the thirty-fourth Section, describing the gift of the
blessing to Bhugee-rutha.

{225}

  SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.

"Pruja-puti being gone, Bhugee-rutha, O Rama! with uplifted arm,
without support, without a helper, immoveable as a dry tree, and
feeding on air, remained day and night on the tip of his great toe
upon the afflicted earth. A full year having now elapsed, the husband
of Ooma, and the lord of animals, who is reverenced by all worlds,
said to the king, I am propitious to thee, O chief of men! I will
accomplish thy utmost desire. To him the sovereign replied, O Hura,
receive Gunga! Bhurga,[17] thus addressed, replied, I will perform
thy desire; I will receive her on my head, the daughter of the
mountain. Muheshwura then, mounting on the summit of Himuvut,
addressed Gunga, the river flowing in the ether, saying, Descend, O
Gunga! The eldest daughter of Himuvut, adored by the universe, having
heard the words of the lord of Ooma, was filled with anger, and
assuming, O Rama! a form of amazing size, with insupportable celerity,
fell from the air upon the auspicious head of Shiva. The goddess
Gunga, irresistible, thought within herself, I will bear down Shunkura
with my stream, and enter Patala. The {226} divine Hura, the
three-eyed god, was aware of her proud resolution, and, being angry,
determined to prevent her design. The purifier, fallen upon the sacred
head of Roodra, was detained, O Rama! in the recesses of the orb of
his Juta, resembling Himuvut, and was unable, by the greatest efforts,
to descend to the earth. From the borders of the orb of his Juta, the
goddess could not obtain regress, but wandered there for many series
of years. Thus situated, Bhugee-rutha beheld her wandering there, and
again engaged in severe austerities.

"With these austerities, O son of Rughoo! Hura being greatly pleased,
discharged Gunga towards the lake Vindoo. In her flowing forth seven
streams were produced. Three of these streams[18] beautiful, filled
with water conveying happiness, Hladinee,[19] Pavunee,[20] and
Nulinee,[21] directed their course eastward: while
Soochukohoo,[22] Seeta,[23] and Sindhoo,[24] three pellucid
mighty rivers, flowed to the west. The seventh of these streams
followed king Bhugee-rutha. The royal sage, the illustrious {227}
Bhugee-rutha, seated on a resplendent car, led the way, while Gunga
followed. Pouring down from the sky upon the head of Shunkura, and
afterwards upon the earth, her streams rolled along with a shrill
sound. The earth was willingly chosen by the fallen fishes, the
turtles, the porpoises, and the birds. The royal sages, the
Gundhurvas, the Yukshas, and the Siddhas, beheld her falling from the
ether to the earth; yea, the gods, immeasurable in power, filled with
surprise, came thither with chariots resembling a city, horses, and
elephants, and litters, desirous of seeing the wonderful and
unparalleled descent of Gunga into the world. Irradiated by the
descending gods, and the splendour of their ornaments, the cloudless
atmosphere shone with the splendour of an hundred suns, while by the
uneasy porpoises, the serpents, and the fishes, the air was coruscated
as with lightning. Through the white foam of the waters, spreading in
a thousand directions, and the flights of water-fowl, the atmosphere
appeared filled with autumnal clouds. The water, pure from defilement,
falling from the head of Shunkura, and thence to the earth, ran in
some places with a rapid stream, in others in a tortuous current; here
widely spreading, there descending into caverns, and again spouting
upward; in some places it moved slowly, stream uniting with stream;
while repelled {228} in others, it rose upwards, and again fell to the
earth. Knowing its purity, the sages, the Gundhurvas, and the
inhabitants of the earth, touched the water fallen from the body of
Bhuva.[25] Those who, through a curse, had fallen from heaven to
earth, having performed ablution in this stream, became free from sin:
cleansed from sin by this water, and restored to happiness, they
entered the sky, and returned again to heaven. By this illustrious
stream was the world rejoiced, and by performing ablution in Gunga,
became free from impurity.

"The royal sage, Bhugee-rutha, full of energy, went before, seated on
his resplendent car, while Gunga followed after. The gods, O Rama!
with the sages, the Dityas, the Danuvas, the Rakshuses, the chief
Gundhurvas, and Yukshas, with the Kinnuras, the chief serpents, and
all the Upsuras, together with aquatic animals, following the chariot
of Bhugee-rutha, attended Gunga. Whither king Bhugee-rutha went,
thither went the renowned Gunga, the chief of streams, the destroyer
of all sin.

"After this, Gunga, in her course, inundated this sacrificial ground
of the great Juhnoo of astonishing deeds, {229} who was then offering
sacrifice. Juhnoo, O Raghuva! perceiving her pride enraged, drank up
the whole of the water of Gunga:--a most astonishing deed! At this the
gods, the Gundhurvas, and the sages, exceedingly surprised, adored the
great Juhnoo, the most excellent of men, and named Gunga the daughter
of this great sage.

"The illustrious chief of men, pleased, discharged Gunga from his
ears. Having liberated her, he, recognizing the great Bhugee-rutha,
the chief of kings, then present, duly, honoured him, and returned to
the place of sacrifice. From this deed Gunga, the daughter of Jahnoo,
obtained the name Jahnuvee.

"Gunga now went forward again, following the chariot of Bhugee-rutha.
Having reached the sea, the chief of streams proceeded to Patala, to
accomplish the work of Bhugee-rutha. The wise and royal sage, having
with great labour conducted Gunga thither, there beheld his ancestors
reduced to ashes. Then, O chief of Rughoo's race, that heap of ashes,
bathed by the excellent waters of Gunga, and purified from sin, the
sons of the king obtained heaven. Having arrived at the sea, the king,
followed by Gunga, entered the subterraneous regions, where lay the
sacred ashes. After these, O Rama! had been laved by the water of
Gunga, Bruhma, the lord of all, thus addressed the king: O chief of
men! thy predecessors, {230} the sixty thousand sons of the great
Sugura, are all delivered by thee: and the great and perennial
receptacle of water, called by Sugura's name, shall henceforth be
universally known by the appellation of Sagura.[26] As long, O
king! as the waters of the sea continue in the earth, so long shall
the sons of Sugura remain in heaven, in all the splendour of gods.

"This Gunga, O king! shall be thy eldest daughter, known throughout
the three worlds (by the name) Bhagee-ruthee; and because she passed
through the earth, the chief of rivers shall be called Gunga[27]
throughout the universe. (She shall also be) called Triputhaga, on
account of her proceeding forward in three different directions,
watering the three worlds. Thus is she named by the gods and sages.
She is called Gunga, O sovereign of the Vashyas! on account of her
flowing through Gang;[28] and her third name, O thou observer of
vows! is Bhagee-ruthee. O, accomplished one! through affection to
thee, and regard to me, these names will remain: as long as Gunga, the
great river, shall remain in the world, so long shall thy deathless
fame live throughout {231} the universe. O lord of men! O king!
perform here the funeral rites of all thine ancestors. Relinquish thy
vows,[29] O king! this devout wish of theirs was not obtained by
thine ancestors highly renowned, chief among the pious; not by
Ungshooman, unparalleled in the universe, so earnestly desiring the
descent of Gunga, O beloved one! was this object of desire obtained.
Nor, O possessor of prosperity! O sinless one! could she be (obtained)
by thine illustrious father Dwileepa, the Rajurshi eminently
accomplished, whose energy was equal to that of a Muhurshi, and who,
established in all the virtues of the Kshutras, in secret austerities
equalled myself. This great design has been fully accomplished by
thee, O chief of men! Thy fame, the blessing so much desired, will
spread throughout the world. O subduer of enemies! this descent of
Gunga has been effected by thee. This Gunga is the great abode of
virtue: by this deed thou art become possessed of the divinity itself.
In this stream constantly bathe thyself, O chief of men! Purified, O
most excellent of mortals! be a partaker of the fruit of holiness;
perform the funeral ceremonies of all thy ancestors. May blessings
attend thee, O chief of men! I return to heaven.

{232}

"The renowned one, the sovereign of the gods, the sire of the
universe, having thus spoken, returned to heaven.

"King Bhugee-rutha, the royal sage, having performed the funeral
ceremonies of the descendants of Sugura, in proper order of
succession, according to the ordinance; the renowned one having also,
O chief of men! performed the customary ceremonies, and purified
himself, returned to his own city, where he governed the kingdom.
Having (again,) O Raghura! possessed of abundant wealth, obtained
their king, his people rejoiced; their sorrow was completely removed;
they increased in wealth and prosperity, and were freed from disease.

"Thus, O Rama! has the story of Gunga been related at large by me. May
prosperity attend thee: May every good be thine. The evening is fast
receding. He who causes this relation, securing wealth, fame,
longevity, posterity, and heaven, to be heard among the Brahmans, the
Kshutriyas, or the other tribes of men, his ancestors rejoice, and to
him are the gods propitious: and he who hears this admirable story of
the descent of Gunga, ensuring long life, shall obtain, O Kakootstha!
all the wishes of his heart. All his sins shall be destroyed, and his
life and fame be abundantly prolonged."

{233}

End of the thirty-fifth Section, describing the descent of Gunga.


  _Parvati._--X. p. 94.

All the Devetas, and other inhabitants of the celestial regions, being
collected, at the summons of Bhagavat, to arrange the ceremonials of
the marriage of Seeva and Parvati, first came Brahma, mounted on his
goose, with the Reyshees at his stirrup; next Veeshnu, riding on
Garoor his eagle, with the chank, the chakra, the club, and the pedive
in his hands; Eendra also, and Yama, and Cuvera, and Varuna, and the
rivers Ganga and Jumna, and the Seven Seas. The Gandarvas also, and
Apsaras, and Vasookee, and other serpents, in obedience to the
commands of Seeva, all dressed in superb chains and habits of
ceremony, were to be seen in order amidst the crowded and glittering
cavalcade.

And now, Seeva, after the arrival of all the Devetas, and the
completion of the preparations for the procession, set out, in the
utmost pomp and splendour, from the mountain Kilas. His third eye
flamed like the sun, and the crescent on his forehead assumed the form
of a radiated diadem; his snakes were exchanged for chains and
necklaces of pearls and rubies, his ashes for sandal and perfume, and
his elephant's skin for a silken robe, {234} so that none of the
Devetas in brilliance came near his figure. The bridal attendants now
spread wide abroad the carpet of congratulation, and arranged in order
the banquet of bliss. Nature herself assumed the appearance of
renovated youth, and the sorrowing universe recalled its
long-forgotten happiness. The Gandarvas and Apsaras began their
melodious songs, and the Genes and Keeners displayed the magic of
their various musical instruments. The earth and its inhabitants
exulted with tongues of glorification and triumph; fresh moisture
invigorated the withered victims of time; a thousand happy and
animating conceptions inspired the hearts of the intelligent, and
enlightened the wisdom of the thoughtful: The kingdom of external
forms obtained gladness, the world of intellect acquired brightness.
The dwellers upon earth stocked the casket of their ideas with the
jewels of delight, and reverend pilgrims exchanged their beads for
pearls. The joy of those on earth ascended up to Heaven, and the Tree
of the bliss of those in Heaven extended its auspicious branches
downwards to the earth. The eyes of the Devetas flamed like torches on
beholding these scenes of rapture, and the hearts of the just kindled
like touchwood on hearing these ravishing symphonies. Thus Seeva set
off like a garden in full blow, and Paradise was eclipsed by his
motion.--MAURICE, _from the Seeva-Pooraun_.

{235}

  _Thereat the heart of the Universe stood still._--X. p. 94.

After these lines were written, I was amused at finding a parallel
passage in a sermon:

_Quando o Sol parou às vozes de Josuè, aconteceram no mundo todas
aquellas consequencias, que parando o movimento celeste, consideram os
Filosofos. As plantas por todo aquelle tempo nam creceram; as
calidades dos elementos, e dos mixtos, nam se alteraram; a geraçam e
corrupçam com que se conserva o mundo, cessou; as artes e os
exercicios de hum e outro Emisferio estiveram suspensos; os Antipodas
nam trabalhavam, porque lhes faltava a luz, os de cima cançados de
tam comprido dia deixavam o trabalho; estes pasmados de verem o Sol
que se nam movia; aquelles tambem pasmados de esperarem pelo Sol, que
nam chegava; cuidavam que se acabàra para elles a luz; imaginavam que
se acabava o mundo: tudo era lagrimas, tudo assombros, tudo horrores,
tudo confusoens_.--VIEYRA, Sermoens, _tom. ix. p._ 505.


  _Surya._--X. p. 105.

_Surya_, the Sun. The poets and painters describe his car as drawn by
seven green horses, preceded by _Arun_, or the Dawn, who acts as his
charioteer, and followed by thousands of genii, worshipping him, and
modulating his {236} praises. Surya is believed to have descended
frequently from his car in a human shape, and to have left a race on
earth, who are equally renowned in the Indian stories with the
Heliadai of Greece. It is very singular that his two sons, called
_Aswinau_, or _Aswinicumarau_, in the Dual, should be considered as
twin brothers, and painted like Castor and Pollux; but they have each
the character of Æsculapius among the gods, and are believed to have
been born of a nymph, who, in the form of a mare, was impregnated with
sun-beams.--Sir W. JONES.

That sun, O daughter of Ganga! than which nothing is higher, to which
nothing is equal, enlightens the summit of the sky--with the sky
enlightens the earth--with the earth enlightens the lower
worlds;--enlightens the higher worlds, enlightens other worlds;--it
enlightens the breast,--enlightens all besides the breast.--Sir W.
JONES, _from the Veda_.


  _Forgetful of his Dragon foe._--X. p. 105.

_Ra'hu_ was the son of _Cas'yapa_ and _Dity_, according to some
authorities; but others represent _Sinhica'_ (perhaps the sphinx) as
his natural mother. He had four arms; his lower parts ended in a tail
like that of a dragon; and his aspect was grim and gloomy, like the
_darkness_ of the chaos, whence he had also the name of _Tamas_. He
was {237} the adviser of all mischief among the _Daityas_, who had a
regard for him: but among the _De'vatas_ it was his chief delight to
sow dissension; and when the gods had produced the _amrit_, by
churning the ocean, he disguised himself like one of them, and
received a portion of it; but the Sun and Moon having discovered his
fraud, _Vishnu_ severed his head and two of his arms from the rest of
his monstrous body. That part of the nectareous fluid which he had
time to swallow secured his immortality: his trunk and dragon-like
tail fell on the mountain of _Malaya_, where _Mini_, a _Brahman_,
carefully preserved them by the name of _Ce'tu_; and, as if a complete
body had been formed from them, like a dismembered _polype_, he is
even said to have adopted _Ce'tu_ as his own child. The head, with two
arms, fell on the sands of _Barbara_, where _Pi't'he'na's_ was then
walking with _Sinhica'_, by some called his wife: They carried the
_Daitya_ to their palace, and adopted him as their son; whence he
acquired the name of _Paite'he'nasi_. This extravagant fable is, no
doubt, astronomical; _Ra'hu_ and _Ce'tu_ being clearly the _nodes_, or
what astrologers call the _head_ and _tail_ of the dragon. It is
added, that they appeased _Vishnu_, and obtained re-admission to the
firmament, but were no longer visible from the earth, their
enlightened sides being turned from it; that _Ra'hu_ strives, during
eclipses, to wreak vengeance on the Sun {238} and Moon, who detected
him; and that _Ce'tu_ often appears as a comet, a whirlwind, a fiery
meteor, a water-spout, or a column of sand.--WILFORD. _Asiatic
Researches_.


  _Suras._--X. p. 105.

The word _Sura_ in Sanscrit signifies both wine and true wealth;
hence, in the first _C'hand_ of the _Ramayan_ of VALMIC, it is
expressly said that the _Devetas_, having received the _Sura_,
acquired the title of _Suras_, and the _Daityas_ that of _Asura_, from
not having received it. The _Veda_ is represented as that wine and
true wealth.--PATERSON. _Asiat. Researches_.


  _Camdeo._--X. p. 106.

  Eternal CAMA! or doth SMARA bright,
  Or proud ANANGA, give thee more delight?
                     _Sir W. Jones_.

He was the son of MAYA, or the general _attracting_ power, and
married to RETTY, or _Affection_, and his bosom friend is BESSENT,
or _Spring_. He is represented a a beautiful youth, sometimes
conversing with his mother and consort in the midst of his gardens and
temples; sometimes riding by moonlight on a parrot or lory, a attended
by dancing girls or nymphs, the foremost {239} whom bears his colours,
which are a _fish_ on a red ground. His favourite place of resort is a
large tract of country round _Agra_, and principally the plains of
_Matra_, where KRISHEN also, and the nine GOPIA, who are clearly
the _Apollo_ and _Muses_ of the Greeks, usually spend the night with
music and dance. His bow of sugar-cane or flowers, with a string of
bees, and his _five_ arrows, each pointed with an Indian blossom of a
heating quality, are allegories equally new and beautiful.

It is possible that the words _Dipuc_ and _Cupid_, which have the same
signification, may have the same origin; since we know that the old
Hetrurians, from whom great part of the Roman language and religion
was derived, and whose system had a near affinity with that of the
Persians and Indians, used to write their lines alternately forwards
and backwards, as furrows are made by the ploughs.--Sir W. JONES.

Mahadeva and Parvati were playing with dice at the ancient game of
Chaturanga, when they disputed, and parted in wrath; the goddess
retiring to the forest of Gauri, and the god repairing to Cushadwip.
They severally performed rigid acts of devotion to the Supreme Being;
but the fires which they kindled blazed so vehemently as to threaten a
general conflagration. The Devas, in great alarm, hastened to Brahma,
who led them {240} to Mahadeva, and supplicated him to recall his
consort; but the wrathful deity only answered, That she most come by
her own free choice. They accordingly dispatched Gunga, the river
goddess, who prevailed on Parvati to return to him, on condition that
his love for her should be restored. The celestial mediators then
employed Cama-Deva, who wounded Mahadeva with one of his flowery
arrows; but the angry divinity reduced him to ashes with a flame from
his eye. Parvati soon after presented herself before him in the form
of a Cirati, or daughter of a mountaineer, and seeing him enamoured of
her, resumed her own shape. In the place where they were reconciled, a
grove sprang up, which was named Camavana; and the relenting god, in
the character of Cameswara, consoled the afflicted Reti, the widow of
Cama, by assuring her that she should rejoin her husband when he
should be born again in the form of Pradyumna, son of Crishna, and
should put Sambara to death. This favourable prediction was in due
time accomplished, and Pradyumna having sprung to life, he was
instantly seized by the demon Sambara, who placed him in a chest,
which he threw into the ocean; but a large fish, which had swallowed
the chest, was caught, in a net, and carried to the palace of a
tyrant, where the unfortunate Reti had been compelled to do menial
service. {241} It was her lot to open the fish, and seeing an infant
in the chest, she nursed him in private, and educated him, till he had
sufficient strength to destroy the malignant Sambara. He had before
considered Reti as his mother; but the minds of them both being,
irradiated, the prophecy of Mahadeva was remembered, and the God of
Love was again united with the Goddess of Pleasure.--WILFORD.
_Asiatic Researches_.


  _Eating his very core of life away._--XI. p. 113.

One of the wonders of this country is the _Jiggerkhar_, (or
liver-eater.) One of this class can steal away the liver of another by
looks and incantations. Other accounts say, that, by looking at a
person, he deprives him of his senses, and then steals from him
something resembling the seed of a pomegranate, which he hides in the
calf of his leg. The _Jiggerkhar_ throws on the fire the grain before
described, which thereupon spreads to the size of a dish, and he
distributes it amongst his fellows, to be eaten; which ceremony
concludes the life of the fascinated person. A _Jiggerkhar_ is able to
communicate his art to another, which he does by learning him the
incantations, and by making him eat a bit of the liver-cake. If any
one cut open the calf of the magician's leg, extract the grain, and
give it to the afflicted person {242} to eat, he immediately recovers.
Those _Jiggerkhars_ are mostly women. It is said, moreover, that they
can bring intelligence from a great distance in a short space of time;
and if they are thrown into a river, with a stone tied to them, they
nevertheless will not sink. In order to deprive any one of this wicked
power, they brand his temples, and every joint in his body, cram his
eyes with salt, suspend him for forty days in a subterraneous cavern,
and repeat over him certain incantations. In this state he is called
_Detche-reh_. Although, after having undergone this discipline, he is
not able to destroy the liver of any one, yet he retains the power of
being able to discover another _Jiggerkhar_, and is used for detecting
these disturbers of mankind. They can also cure many diseases, by
administering a potion, or by repeating an incantation. Many other
marvellous stories are told of these people.--AYEEN ACBERY.

An Arabian old woman, by name Meluk, was thrown in prison, on a charge
of having bewitched, or, as they call it, eaten the heart of a young
native of Ormuz, who had lately, from being a Christian, turned
Mahommedan. The cause of offence was, that the young man, after
keeping company some time with one of her daughters, had forsaken her:
He himself, who was in a pitiable condition, and in danger of his
life, was one of her {243} accusers. This sort of witchcraft, which
the Indians call eating the heart, and which is what we call
bewitching, as sorcerers do by their venomous and deadly looks, is not
a new thing, nor unheard of elsewhere; for many persons practised it
formerly in Sclavonia, and the country of the Triballes, as we learn
from Ortelius, who took the account from Pliny, who, upon the report
of Isigones, testifies, that this species of enchantment was much in
use among these people, and many others whom he mentions, as it is at
present here, especially among the Arabians who inhabit the western
coast of the Persian gulph, where this art is common. The way in which
they do it is only by the eyes and the mouth, keeping the eyes fixed
steadily upon the person whose heart they design to eat, and
pronouncing, between their teeth, I know not what diabolical words, by
virtue of which, and by the operation of the devil, the person, how
hale and strong soever, falls immediately into an unknown and
incurable disease, which makes him appear phthysical, consumes him
little by little, and at last destroys him. And this takes place
faster or slower as the heart is eaten, as they say; for these
sorcerers can either eat the whole or a part only; that is, can
consume it entirely and at once, or bit by bit, as they please. The
vulgar give it this name, because they believe that the devil, acting
upon {244} the imagination of the witch when she mutters her wicked
words, represents invisibly to her the heart and entrails of the
patient, taken out of his body, and makes her devour them. In which
these wretches find so delightful a task, that very often, to satisfy
their appetite, without any impulse of resentment or enmity, they will
destroy innocent persons, and even their nearest relatives, as there
is a report that our prisoner killed one of her own daughters in this
manner.

This was confirmed to me by a similar story, which I heard at Ispahan,
from the mouth of P. Sebastian de Jesus, a Portugueze Augustinian, a
man to be believed, and of singular virtue, who was prior of their
convent when I departed. He assured me, that, on one of the places
dependent upon Portugal, on the confines of Arabia Felix, I know not
whether it was at Mascate or at Ormuz, an Arab having been taken up
for a similar crime, and convicted of it, for he confessed the fact,
the captain, or governor of the place, who was a Portugueze, that he
might better understand the truth of these black and devilish actions,
of which there is no doubt in this country, made the sorcerer be
brought before him before he was led to his punishment, and asked him,
If he could eat the inside of a cucumber without opening it, as well
as the heart of a man? The sorcerer said yes; and, in order to {245}
prove it, a cucumber was brought: he looked at it, never touching it,
steadily for some time, with his usual enchantments, and then told the
captain he had eaten the whole inside; and accordingly, when it was
opened, nothing was found but the rind. This is not impossible; for
the devil, of whom they make use in these operations, having, in the
order of nature, greater power than all inferior creatures, can, with
God's permission, produce these effects, and others more marvellous.

The same father told me, that one of these sorcerers, whether it was
the same or not I do not know, having been taken for a similar
offence, was asked, If he could eat the heart of the Portuguese
captain? and he replied no; for the Franks had a certain thing upon
the breast, which covered them like a cuirass, and was so
impenetrable, that it was proof against all his charms. This can be
nothing else than the virtue of baptism, the armour of the faith, and
the privilege of the sons of the church, against which the gates of
hell cannot prevail.

To return, however, to my first subject:--This witch of Combru made
some difficulty at first to confess her guilt; but seeing herself
pressed with threats of death, and being led, in fact, to the public
square, where I saw her with the sick young man, she said, that though
she had not been the cause of his complaint, perhaps she could cure
{246} it, if they would let her remain alone with him, in his house,
without interruption; by which she tacitly confessed her witchcraft:
For it is held certain in these countries, that these wicked women can
remove the malady which they have caused, if it be not come to the
last extremity. And of many remedies which they use to restore health
to the sufferers, there is one very extraordinary, which is, that the
witch casts something out of her mouth, like the grain of a
pomegranate, which is believed to be a part of the heart that she had
eaten. The patient picks it up immediately, as part of his own
intestines, and greedily swallows it; and by this means, as if his
heart was replaced in his body, he recovers by degrees his health. I
dare not assure you of these things as certainly true, not having
myself seen them, surpassing as they do the course of nature. If they
are as is said, it can be only in appearance, by the illusions of the
devil; and if the afflicted recover actually their health, it is
because the same devil ceases to torment them. Without dwelling longer
upon these curious speculations,--the witch having given hopes that
she would cure the patient, the officers promised that she should
receive no injury, and they were both sent home; but an archer was set
over her as a guard, that she might not escape.--PIETRO DELLA VALLE.

{247}

  _The Calis._--XI. p. 114.

The Calis and Pandaris are the protectresses of cities; each city has
its own. They address prayers to these tutelary divinities, and build
temples to them, offering to them blood in sacrifice, and sometimes
human victims. These objects of worship are not immortal, and they
take their name from the city over which they preside, or from the
form in which they are represented. They are commonly framed of a
gigantic stature, having several arms, and the head surrounded with
flames; several fierce animals are also placed under their
feet.--SONNERAT.


  _Sani, the dreadful God, who rides abroad_
  _Upon the King of the Ravens._--XI. p. 114.

Mr. Moor has a curious remark upon this subject:

"Sani being among the astrologers of India, as well as with their
sapient brethren of Europe, a planet of malignant aspects, the
ill-omened raven may be deemed a fit _Vahan_ for such a dreaded being.
But this is not, I think, a sufficient reason for the conspicuous
introduction of the raven into the mythological machinery of the Hindu
system, so accurate, so connected, and so complete in all its parts;
although the investigations that it hath hitherto undergone have not
fully developed or reached such points {248} of perfection. Now let me
ask the reason, why, both in England and in India, the raven it so
rare a bird? It breeds every year, like the crow, and is much longer
lived; and while the latter bird abounds every where, to a degree
bordering on nuisance, a pair of ravens, for they are seldom seen
singly or in trios, are scarcely found duplicated in any place.
Perhaps, take England or India over, two pair of ravens will not be
found, on an average, in the extent of five hundred or a thousand
acres. I know not, for I write where I have no access to books, if our
naturalists have sought the theory of this; or whether it may have
first occurred to me, which it did while contemplating the character
and attributes of Sani, that the raven destroys its young; and if this
notion be well founded, and on no other can I account for the rareness
of the annual-breeding long-lived raven, we shall at once see the
propriety of symbolizing it with Saturn, or Kronos, or Time, devouring
or destroying his own offspring.--MOOR's _Hindu Pantheon_, p. 311.


  _A thousand eyes were quench'd in endless night,_
  _To form that magic globe._--XI. p. 117.

A similar invention occurs in Dr. Beaumont's Psyche, one of the most
extraordinary poems in our language. I am far from claiming any merit
for such inventions, which {249} no man can value more cheaply,--but
such as it is, I am not beholden for it to this forgotten writer,
whose strange, long, but by no means uninteresting work I had never
read till after two editions of Kehama were printed.

  A stately mirror's all-enamell'd case
   The second was; no crystal ever yet
  Smil'd with such pureness: never ladies' glass
   Its owner flattered with so smooth a cheat.
  Nor could Narcissus' fount with such delight
  Into his fair destruction him invite.

  For He in that and self-love being drown'd,
   Agenor from him pluck'd his doting eyes:
  And, shuffled in her fragments, having found
   Old Jezabels, he stole the dog's due prize.
  Goliah's staring bacins too he got,
  Which he with Pharaoh's all together put.

  But not content with these, from Phaeton,
   From Joab, Icarus, Nebuchadnezzar,
  From Philip and his world-devouring son,
   From Sylla, Cataline, Tully, Pompey, Cæsar,
  From Herod, Cleopatra, and Sejanus,
  From Agrippina and Domitianus,

{250}

  And many surly stoics, theirs he pull'd;
   Whose proudest humours having drained out,
  He blended in a large and polish'd mould;
   Which up he fill'd with what from Heaven he brought,
  In extract of those looks of Lucifer,
  In which against his God he breathed war.

  Then to the North, that glassy kingdom, where
   Establish'd frost and ice for ever reign,
  He sped his course, and meeting Boreas there,
   Pray'd him this liquid mixture to restrain.
  When lo! as Boreas oped his mouth and blew
  For his command, the slime all solid grew.

  Thus was the mirror forged, and contain'd
   The vigour of those self-admiring eyes
  Agenor's witchcraft into it had strain'd;
   A dangerous juncture of proud fallacies;
  Whose fair looks so inamour'd him, that he
  Thrice having kiss'd it, nam'd it Philanty.

  Inchanted Psyche ravish'd was to see
   The Glass herself upon herself reflect
  With trebled majesty. The sun, when he
   Is by Aurora's roseat fingers deckt,
  {251}
  Views not his repercussed self so fair
  Upon the eastern main, as she did here.


  _Be true unto yourselves._--XII. p. 127.

The passage in which Menu exhorts a witness to speak the truth is one
of the few sublime ones in his Institutes. "The soul itself is its own
witness; the soul itself is its own refuge; offend not thy conscious
soul, the supreme internal witness of men! . . The sinful have said in
their hearts, none see us. Yes, the gods distinctly see them, and so
does the spirit within their breasts . . The guardian deities of the
firmament, of the earth, of the waters, of the human heart, of the
moon, of the sun, and of fire, of punishment after death, of the
winds, of night, of both twilights, and of justice, perfectly know the
state of all spirits clothed with bodies. . . O friend to virtue! that
supreme Spirit, _which thou believest one and the same with thyself_,
resides in thy bosom perpetually, and is an all-knowing inspector of
thy goodness or of thy wickedness. If thou beest not at variance, by
speaking falsely, with Yama, the subduer of all, with Vaivaswata the
punisher, with that great Divinity who dwells in thy breast,--go not
on a pilgrimage to the river Ganga, nor to the plains of Curu, for
thou hast no need of expiation.--_Ch. viii. p._ 84, 85, 86, 91, 92.

{252}

  _The Aunnay Birds._--XII. p. 128.

The Aunnays act a considerable part in the history of the Nellah
Rajah, an amusing romance, for a translation of which we are indebted
to Mr. Kindersley. They are milk-white, and remarkable for the
gracefulness of their walk.

END OF VOLUME FIRST.


THE CURSE OF KEHAMA.

 XIII.
 THE RETREAT.

 {1}

 1.
 Around her Father's neck the Maiden lock'd
 Her arms, when that portentous blow was given;
 Clinging to him she heard the dread uproar,
 And felt the shuddering shock which ran through Heaven.
 Earth underneath them rock'd,
 Her strong foundations heaving in commotion,
 Such as wild winds upraise in raving Ocean,
 As though the solid base were rent asunder.
 {2}
 And lo! where, storming the astonish'd sky,
 Kehama and his evil host ascend!
 Before them rolls the thunder,
 Ten thousand thousand lightnings round them fly,
 Upward the lengthening pageantries aspire,
 Leaving from Earth to Heaven a widening wake of fire.

 2.
 When the wild uproar was at length allay'd,
 And Earth, recovering from the shock, was still,
 Thus to her father spake the imploring Maid.
 Oh! by the love which we so long have borne
 Each other, and we ne'er shall cease to bear, . .
 Oh! by the sufferings we have shar'd,
 And must not cease to share, . .
 One boon I supplicate in this dread hour,
 One consolation in this hour of woe!
 Thou hast it in thy power, refuse not thou
 The only comfort now
 That my poor heart can know.

 3.
 O dearest, dearest Kailyal! with a smile
 Of tenderness and sorrow, he replied,
 {3}
 O best belov'd, and to be lov'd the best
 Best worthy, . . set thy duteous heart at rest.
 I know thy wish, and let what will betide,
 Ne'er will I leave thee wilfully again.
 My soul is strengthen'd to endure its pain;
 Be thou, in all my wanderings, still my guide;
 Be thou, in all my sufferings, at my side.

 4.
 The Maiden, at those welcome words, imprest
 A passionate kiss upon her father's cheek:
 They look'd around them, then, as if to seek
 Where they should turn, North, South, or East or West,
 Wherever to their vagrant feet seem'd best.
 But, turning from the view her mournful eyes,
 Oh, whither should we wander, Kailyal cries,
 Or wherefore seek in vain a place of rest?
 Have we not here the Earth beneath our tread,
 Heaven overhead,
 A brook that winds through this sequester'd glade,
 And yonder woods, to yield us fruit and shade!
 The little all our wants require is nigh;
 Hope we have none, . . why travel on in fear?
 We cannot fly from Fate, and Fate will find us here.

 {4}

 5.
 'Twas a fair scene wherein they stood,
 A green and sunny glade amid the wood,
 And in the midst an aged Banian grew.
 It was a goodly sight to see
 That venerable tree,
 For o'er the lawn, irregularly spread,
 Fifty straight columns propt its lofty head;
 And many a long depending shoot,
 Seeking to strike its root,
 Straight like a plummet, grew towards the ground.
 Some on the lower boughs, which crost their way,
 Fixing their bearded fibres, round and round,
 With many a ring and wild contortion wound;
 Some to the passing wind at times, with sway
 Of gentle motion swung,
 Others of younger growth, unmov'd, were hung
 Like stone-drops from the cavern's fretted height.
 Beneath was smooth and fair to sight,
 Nor weeds nor briars deform'd the natural floor,
 And through the leafy cope which bower'd it o'er
 Came gleams of checquered light.
 So like a temple did it seem, that there
 A pious heart's first impulse would be prayer.

 {5}

 6.
 A brook, with easy current, murmured near;
 Water so cool and clear
 The peasants drink not from the humble well,
 Which they with sacrifice of rural pride,
 Have wedded to the cocoa-grove beside;
 Nor tanks of costliest masonry dispense
 To those in towns who dwell,
 The work of Kings, in their beneficence.
 Fed by perpetual springs, a small lagoon,
 Pellucid, deep, and still, in silence join'd
 And swell'd the passing stream. Like burnish'd steel
 Glowing, it lay beneath the eye of noon;
 And when the breezes, in their play,
 Ruffled the darkening surface, then, with gleam
 Of sudden light, around the lotus stem
 It rippled, and the sacred flowers that crown
 The lakelet with their roseate beauty, ride,
 In gentlest waving rock'd, from side to side;
 And as the wind upheaves
 Their broad and buoyant weight, the glossy leaves
 Flap on the twinkling waters, up and down.

 7.
 They built them here a bower; of jointed cane,
 {6}
 Strong for the needful use, and light and long
 Was the slight frame-work rear'd, with little pain;
 Lithe creepers, then, the wicker-sides supply,
 And the tall jungle-grass fit roofing gave
 Beneath that genial sky.
 And here did Kailyal, each returning day,
 Pour forth libations from the brook, to pay
 The Spirits of her Sires their grateful rite;
 In such libations pour'd in open glades,
 Beside clear streams and solitary shades,
 The Spirits of the virtuous dead delight.
 And duly here, to Marriataly's praise,
 The Maid, as with an Angel's voice of song,
 Pour'd her melodious lays
 Upon the gales of even,
 And gliding in religious dance along,
 Mov'd, graceful as the dark-eyed Nymphs of Heaven,
 Such harmony to all her steps was given,

 8.
 Thus ever, in her Father's doting eye,
 Kailyal perform'd the customary rite;
 He, patient of his burning pain the while,
 Beheld her, and approv'd her pious toil;
 And sometimes, at the sight,
 {7}
 A melancholy smile
 Would gleam upon his awful countenance,
 He, too, by day and night, and every hour,
 Paid to a higher Power his sacrifice;
 An offering, not of ghee, or fruit, or rice,
 Flower-crown, or blood; but of a heart subdued,
 A resolute, unconquer'd fortitude,
 An agony represt, a will resign'd,
 To her, who, on her secret throne reclin'd,
 Amid the milky Sea, by Veeshnoo's side,
 Looks with an eye of mercy on mankind.
 By the Preserver, with his power endued,
 There Voomdavee beholds this lower clime,
 And marks the silent sufferings of the good,
 To recompense them in her own good time.

 9.
 O force of faith! O strength of virtuous will!
 Behold him, in his endless martyrdom,
 Triumphant still!
 The Curse still burning in his heart and brain,
 And yet doth he remain
 Patient the while, and tranquil, and content!
 The pious soul hath fram'd unto itself
 {8}
 A second nature, to exist in pain
 As in its own allotted element.

 10.
 Such strength the will reveal'd had given
 This holy pair, such influxes of grace,
 That to their solitary resting place
 They brought the peace of Heaven.
 Yea all around was hallowed! Danger, Fear,
 Nor thought of evil ever entered here.
 A charm was on the Leopard when he came
 Within the circle of that mystic glade;
 Submiss he crouch'd before the heavenly maid,
 And offered to her touch his speckled side;
 Or with arch'd back erect, and bending head,
 And eyes half-clos'd for pleasure, would he stand,
 Courting the pressure of her gentle hand.

 11.
 Trampling his path through wood and brake,
 And canes which crackling fall before his way,
 And tassel-grass, whose silvery feathers play
 O'ertopping the young trees,
 On comes the Elephant, to slake
 {9}
 His thirst at noon in yon pellucid springs.
 Lo! from his trunk upturn'd, aloft he flings
 The grateful shower; and now
 Plucking the broad-leav'd bough
 Of yonder plane, with waving motion slow,
 Fanning the languid air,
 He moves it to and fro.
 But when that form of beauty meets his sight,
 The trunk its undulating motion stops,
 From his forgetful hold the plane-branch drops,
 Reverent he kneels, and lifts his rational eyes
 To her as if in prayer;
 And when she pours her angel voice in song,
 Entranced he listens to the thrilling notes,
 Till his strong temples, bath'd with sudden dews,
 Their fragrance of delight and love diffuse.

 12.
 Lo! as the voice melodious floats around,
 The Antelope draws near,
 The Tygress leaves her toothless cubs to hear,
 The Snake comes gliding from the secret brake,
 Himself in fascination forced along
 By that enchanting song;
 {10}
 The antic Monkies, whose wild gambols late,
 When not a breeze wav'd the tall jungle-grass,
 Shook the whole wood, are hush'd, and silently
 Hang on the cluster'd trees.
 All things in wonder and delight are still;
 Only at times the Nightingale is heard,
 Not that in emulous skill that sweetest bird
 Her rival strain would try,
 A mighty songster, with the Maid to vie;
 She only bore her part in powerful sympathy.

 13.
 Well might they thus adore that heavenly Maid!
 For never Nymph of Mountain,
 Or Grove, or Lake, or Fountain,
 With a diviner presence fill'd the shade.
 No idle ornaments deface
 Her natural grace,
 Musk-spot, nor sandal-streak, nor scarlet stain,
 Ear-drop nor chain, nor arm nor ankle-ring,
 Nor trinketry on front, or neck, or breast,
 Marring the perfect form: she seem'd a thing
 Of Heaven's prime uncorrupted work, a child
 Of early Nature undefil'd,
 {11}
 A daughter of the years of innocence.
 And therefore all things lov'd her. When she stood
 Beside the glassy pool, the fish, that flies
 Quick as an arrow from all other eyes,
 Hover'd to gaze on her. The mother bird,
 When Kailyal's steps she heard,
 Sought not to tempt her from her secret nest,
 But, hastening to the dear retreat, would fly
 To meet and welcome her benignant eye.

 14.
 Hope we have none, said Kailyal to her Sire.
 Said she aright? and had the Mortal Maid
 No thoughts of heavenly aid, . .
 No secret hopes her inmost heart to move
 With longings of such deep and pure desire,
 As vestal Maids, whose piety is love,
 Feel in their extasies, when rapt above,
 Their souls unto their heavenly Spouse aspire?
 Why else so often doth that searching eye
 Roam through the scope of sky?
 Why, if she sees a distant speck on high,
 Starts there that quick suffusion to her cheek?
 'Tis but the Eagle, in his heavenly height;
 {12}
 Reluctant to believe, she hears his cry,
 And marks his wheeling flight,
 Then languidly averts her mournful sight.
 Why ever else, at morn, that waking sigh,
 Because the lovely form no more is nigh
 Which hath been present to her soul all night;
 And that injurious fear
 Which ever, as it riseth, is represt,
 Yet riseth still within her troubled breast,
 That she no more shall see the Glendoveer!

 15.
 Hath he forgotten me? The wrongful thought
 Would stir within her, and, though still repell'd
 With shame and self-reproaches, would recur.
 Days after days unvarying come and go,
 And neither friend nor foe
 Approaches them in their sequestered bower.
 Maid of strange destiny! but think not thou
 Thou art forgotten now,
 And hast no cause for farther hope or fear.
 High-fated Maid, thou dost not know
 What eyes watch over thee for weal and woe!
 Even at this hour,
 {13}
 Searching the dark decrees divine,
 Kehama, in the fulness of his power,
 Perceives his thread of fate entwin'd with thine.
 The Glendoveer, from his far sphere,
 With love that never sleeps, beholds thee here,
 And, in the hour permitted, will be near.
 Dark Lorrinite on thee hath fix'd her sight,
 And laid her wiles, to aid
 Foul Arvalan when he shall next appear;
 For well she ween'd his Spirit would renew
 Old vengeance now, with unremitting hate;
 The Enchantress well that evil nature knew,
 The accursed Spirit hath his prey in view,
 And thus, while all their separate hopes pursue,
 All work, unconsciously, the will of Fate.

 16.
 Fate work'd its own the while. A band
 Of Yoguees, as they roam'd the land,
 Seeking a spouse for Jaga-Naut their God,
 Stray'd to this solitary glade,
 And reach'd the bower wherein the Maid abode.
 Wondering at form so fair, they deem'd the power
 Divine had led them to his chosen bride,
 And seiz'd and bore her from her father's side.


 XIV.
 JAGA-NAUT.

 1.
 Joy in the city of great Jaga-Naut!
 Joy in the seven-headed Idol's shrine!
 A virgin-bride his ministers have brought,
 A mortal maid, in form and face divine,
 Peerless among all daughters of mankind;
 Search'd they the world again from East to West,
 In endless quest,
 Seeking the fairest and the best,
 No maid so lovely might they hope to find; . .
 For she hath breath'd celestial air,
 And heavenly food hath been her fare,
 And heavenly thoughts and feelings give her face
 That heavenly grace.
 {15}
 Joy in the city of great Jaga-Naut,
 Joy in the seven-headed Idol's shrine!
 The fairest Maid his Yoguees sought,
 A fairer than the fairest have they brought,
 A maid of charms surpassing human thought,
 A maid divine.

 2.
 Now bring ye forth the Chariot of the God!
 Bring him abroad,
 That through the swarming City he may ride;
 And by his side
 Place ye the Maid of more than mortal grace,
 The Maid of perfect form and heavenly face!
 Set her aloft in triumph, like a bride
 Upon the bridal car,
 And spread the joyful tidings wide and far, . .
 Spread it with trump and voice
 That all may hear, and all who hear rejoice, . .
 The Mighty One hath found his mate! the God
 Will ride abroad!
 To-night will he go forth from his abode!
 Ye myriads who adore him,
 Prepare the way before him!

 {16}

 3.
 Uprear'd on twenty wheels elate,
 Huge as a Ship, the bridal car appear'd;
 Loud creak its ponderous wheels, as through the gate
 A thousand Bramins drag the enormous load.
 There, thron'd aloft in state,
 The image of the seven-headed God
 Came forth from his abode; and at his side
 Sate Kailyal like a bride;
 A bridal statue rather might she seem,
 For she regarded all things like a dream,
 Having no thought, nor fear, nor will, nor aught
 Save hope and faith, that liv'd within her still.

 4.
 O silent Night, how have they startled thee
 With the brazen trumpet's blare!
 And thou, O Moon! whose quiet light serene
 Filleth wide heaven, and bathing hill and wood,
 Spreads o'er the peaceful valley like a flood,
 How have they dimm'd thee with the torches' glare,
 Which round yon moving pageant flame and flare,
 As the wild rout, with deafening song and shout,
 Fling their long flashes out,
 That, like infernal lightnings, fire the air.

 {17}

 5.
 A thousand pilgrims strain
 Arm, shoulder, breast and thigh, with might and main,
 To drag that sacred wain,
 And scarce can draw along the enormous load.
 Prone fall the frantic votaries in its road,
 And, calling on the God,
 Their self-devoted bodies there they lay
 To pave his chariot-way.
 On Jaga-Naut they call,
 The ponderous Car rolls on, and crushes all.
 Through blood and bones it ploughs its dreadful path.
 Groans rise unheard; the dying cry,
 And death and agony
 Are trodden under foot by yon mad throng,
 Who follow close, and thrust the deadly wheels along.

 6.
 Pale grows the Maid at this accursed sight;
 The yells which round her rise
 Have rous'd her with affright,
 And fear hath given to her dilated eyes
 A wilder light.
 Where shall those eyes be turn'd? she knows not where!
 {18}
 Downward they dare not look, for there
 Is death and horror, and despair;
 Nor can her patient looks to Heaven repair,
 For the huge Idol over her, in air,
 Spreads his seven hideous heads, and wide
 Extends their snaky necks on every side;
 And all around, behind, before,
 The bridal Car, is the raging rout,
 With frantic shout, and deafening roar,
 Tossing the torches' flames about.
 And the double double peals of the drum are there,
 And the startling burst of the trumpet's blare;
 And the gong, that seems, with its thunders dread,
 To stun the living, and waken the dead.
 The ear-strings throb as if they were broke,
 And the eye-lids drop at the weight of its stroke.
 Fain would the Maid have kept them fast,
 But open they start at the crack of the blast.

 7.
 Where art thou, Son of Heaven, Ereenia! where
 In this dread hour of horror and despair?
 Thinking on him, she strove her fear to quell,
 If he be near me, then will all be well;
 And, if he reck not for my misery,
 {19}
 Let come the worst, it matters not to me.
 Repel that wrongful thought,
 O Maid! thou feelest, but believ'st it not;
 It is thine own imperfect nature's fault
 That lets one doubt of him arise within.
 And this the Virgin knew; and, like a sin,
 Repell'd the thought, and still believ'd him true;
 And summoned up her spirit to endure
 All forms of fear, in that firm trust secure.

 8.
 She needs that faith, she needs that consolation,
 For now the Car hath measured back its track
 Of death, and hath re-entered now its station.
 There, in the Temple-court, with song and dance,
 A harlot-band, to meet the Maid, advance.
 The drum hath ceas'd its peals; the trump and gong
 Are still; the frantic crowd forbear their yells;
 And sweet it was to hear the voice of song,
 And the sweet music of their girdle-bells,
 Armlets and anklets, that, with chearful sounds
 Symphonious tinkled as they wheel'd around.

 9.
 They sung a bridal measure,
 {20}
 A song of pleasure,
 A hymn of joyaunce and of gratulation.
 Go, chosen One, they cried,
 Go, happy bride!
 For thee the God descends in expectation;
 For thy dear sake
 He leaves his heaven, O Maid of matchless charms.
 Go, happy One, the bed divine partake,
 And fill his longing arms!
 Thus to the inner fane,
 With circling dance and hymeneal strain,
 The astonish'd Maid they led,
 And there they laid her on the bridal bed.
 Then forth they went, and clos'd the Temple-gate,
 And left the wretched Kailyal to her fate.

 10.
 Where art thou, Son of Heaven, Ereenia, where?
 From the loathed bed she starts, and in the air
 Looks up, as if she thought to find him there!
 Then, in despair,
 Anguish and agony, and hopeless prayer,
 Prostrate she laid herself upon the floor.
 There, trembling as she lay,
 {21}
 The Bramin of the fane advanced
 And came to seize his prey.

 11.
 But as the Priest drew nigh,
 A power invisible opposed his way;
 Starting, he uttered wildly a death-cry,
 And fell. At that the Maid all eagerly
 Lifted in hope her head;
 She thought her own deliverer had been near;
 When lo! with other life re-animate,
 She saw the dead arise,
 And in the fiendish joy within his eyes,
 She knew the hateful Spirit who look'd through
 Their specular orbs, . . cloth'd in the flesh of man
 She knew the accursed soul of Arvalan.

 12.
 But not in vain, with the sudden shriek of fear,
 She calls Ereenia now; the Glendoveer
 Is here! Upon the guilty sight he burst
 Like lightning from a cloud, and caught the accurst,
 Bore him to the roof aloft, and on the floor
 With vengeance dash'd him, quivering there in gore.

 {22}

 13.
 Lo! from the pregnant air, . . heart-withering sight!
 There issued forth the dreadful Lorrinite,
 Seize him! the Enchantress cried;
 A host of Demons at her word appear,
 And like tornado winds, from every side
 At once, they rush upon the Glendoveer.
 Alone against a legion, little here
 Avails his single might,
 Nor that celestial faulchion, which in fight
 So oft had put the rebel race to flight.
 There are no Gods on earth to give him aid;
 Hemm'd round, he is overpower'd, beat down, and bound,
 And at the feet of Lorrinite is laid.

 14.
 Meantime the scattered members of the slain,
 Obedient to her mighty voice, assum'd
 Their vital form again,
 And that foul Spirit, upon vengeance bent,
 Fled to the fleshly tenement.
 Lo! here, quoth Lorrinite, thou seest thy foe!
 Him in the Ancient Sepulchres, below
 The billows of the Ocean, will I lay;
 {23}
 Gods are there none to help him now, and there
 For Man there is no way.
 To that dread scene of durance and despair,
 Asuras, bear your enemy! I go
 To chain him in the Tombs. Meantime do thou,
 Freed from thy foe, and now secure from fear,
 Son of Kehama, take thy pleasure here.

 15.
 Her words the accursed race obey'd;
 Forth with a sound like rushing winds they fled,
 And of all aid from Earth or Heaven bereft,
 Alone with Arvalan the Maid was left.
 But in that hour of agony, the Maid
 Deserted not herself; her very dread
 Had calm'd her; and her heart
 Knew the whole horror, and its only part.
 Yamen, receive me undefil'd! she said,
 And seiz'd a torch, and fir'd the bridal bed.
 Up ran the rapid flames; on every side
 They find their fuel wheresoe'er they spread,
 Thin hangings, fragrant gums, and odorous wood,
 That pil'd like sacrificial altars stood.
 Around they run, and upward they aspire,
 And, lo! the huge Pagoda lin'd with fire.

 {24}

 16.
 The wicked Soul, who had assum'd again
 A form of sensible flesh, for his foul will,
 Still bent on base revenge, and baffled still,
 Felt that corporeal shape alike to pain
 Obnoxious as to pleasure; forth he flew,
 Howling and scorch'd by the devouring flame;
 Accursed Spirit! still condemn'd to rue,
 The act of sin and punishment the same.
 Freed from his loathsome touch, a natural dread
 Came on the self-devoted, and she drew
 Back from the flames, which now toward her spread,
 And, like a living monster, seem'd to dart
 Their hungry tongues toward their shrinking prey.
 Soon she subdued her heart;
 O Father! she exclaim'd, there was no way
 But this! and thou, Ereenia, who for me
 Sufferest, my soul shall bear thee company.

 17.
 So having said, she knit
 Her body up to work her soul's desire,
 And rush at once amid the thickest fire.
 A sudden cry withheld her, . . Kailyal, stay!
 {25}
 Child! Daughter! I am here! the voice exclaims,
 And from the gate, unharm'd, through smoke and flames
 Like as a God, Ladurlad made his way;
 Wrapt his preserving arms around, and bore
 His Child, uninjur'd, o'er the burning floor.


 XV.
 THE CITY OF BALY.

 {26}

 KAILYAL.
 Ereenia!

 LADURLAD.
 Nay, let no reproachful thought
 Wrong his heroic heart! The Evil Powers
 Have the dominion o'er this wretched World,
 And no good Spirit now can venture here.

 KAILYAL.
 Alas, my Father! he hath ventur'd here,
 And sav'd me from one horror. But the Powers
 {27}
 Of Evil beat him down, and bore away
 To some dread scene of durance and despair,
 The Ancient Tombs, methought their Mistress said,
 Beneath the ocean-waves: no way for Man
 Is there; and Gods, she boasted, there are none
 On Earth to help him now.

 LADURLAD.
 Is that her boast?
 And hath she laid him in the Ancient Tombs,
 Relying that the Waves will guard him there?
 Short-sighted are the eyes of Wickedness,
 And all its craft but folly. O, my child!
 The Curses of the Wicked are upon me,
 And the immortal Deities, who see
 And suffer all things for their own wise end,
 Have made them blessings to us!

 KAILYAL.
 Then thou knowest
 Where they have borne him?

 LADURLAD.
 To the Sepulchres
 {28}
 Of the Ancient Kings, which Baly, in his power,
 Made in primeval times; and built above them
 A City, like the Cities of the Gods,
 Being like a God himself. For many an age
 Hath Ocean warr'd against his Palaces,
 Till overwhelm'd, they lie beneath the waves,
 Not overthrown, so well the Mighty One
 Had laid their deep foundations. Rightly said
 The Accursed, that no way for Man was there,
 But not like Man am I!

 1.
 Up from the ground the Maid exultant sprung,
 And clapp'd her happy hands, in attitude
 Of thanks, to Heaven, and flung
 Her arms around her Father's neck, and stood
 Struggling awhile for utterance, with excess
 Of hope and pious thankfulness.
 Come . . come! she cried, O let us not delay, . .
 He is in torments there, . . away! . . away!

 2.
 Long time they travell'd on; at dawn of day
 Still setting forward with the earliest light,
 {29}
 Nor ceasing from their way
 Till darkness clos'd the night.
 Short refuge from the noontide heat,
 Reluctantly compell'd, the Maiden took;
 And ill her indefatigable feet
 Could that brief tarriance brook.
 Hope kept her up, and her intense desire
 Supports that heart which ne'er at danger quails,
 Those feet which never tire,
 That frame which never fails.

 3.
 Their talk was of the City of the days
 Of old, Earth's wonder once; and of the fame
 Of Baly its great founder, . . he whose name
 In ancient story, and in poet's praise,
 Liveth and flourisheth for endless glory,
 Because his might
 Put down the wrong, and aye upheld the right.
 Till for ambition, as old sages tell,
 The mighty Monarch fell:
 For he too, having made the World his own,
 Then, in his pride, had driven
 The Devetas from Heaven,
 {30}
 And seiz'd triumphantly the Swerga throne.
 The Incarnate came before the Mighty One,
 In dwarfish stature, and in mien obscure;
 The sacred cord he bore,
 And ask'd, for Brama's sake, a little boon,
 Three steps of Baly's ample reign, no more.
 Poor was the boon requir'd, and poor was he
 Who begg'd, . . a little wretch it seem'd to be;
 But Baly ne'er refus'd a suppliant's prayer.
 A glance of pity, in contemptuous mood,
 He on the Dwarf cast down,
 And bade him take the boon,
 And measure where he would.

 4.
 Lo, Son of giant birth,
 I take my grant! the Incarnate power replies.
 With his first step he measur'd o'er the Earth,
 The second spann'd the skies.
 Three paces thou hast granted,
 Twice have I set my footstep, Veeshnoo cries,
 Where shall the third be planted?

 5.
 Then Baly knew the God, and at his feet,
 {31}
 In homage due, he laid his humbled head.
 Mighty art thou, O Lord of Earth and Heaven,
 Mighty art thou! he said,
 Be merciful, and let me be forgiven.
 He ask'd for mercy of the merciful,
 And mercy for his virtue's sake was shown.
 For though he was cast down to Padalon,
 Yet there, by Yamen's throne,
 Doth Baly sit in majesty and might,
 To judge the dead, and sentence them aright.
 And forasmuch as he was still the friend
 Of righteousness, it is permitted him,
 Yearly, from those drear regions to ascend,
 And walk the Earth, that he may hear his name
 Still hymn'd and honour'd, by the grateful voice
 Of humankind, and in his fame rejoice.

 6.
 Such was the talk they held upon their way,
 Of him to whose old City they were bound;
 And now, upon their journey, many a day
 Had risen and clos'd, and many a week gone round,
 And many a realm and region had they past,
 When now the Ancient Towers appear'd at last.

 {32}

 7.
 Their golden summits, in the noon-day light,
 Shone o'er the dark-green deep that roll'd between;
 For domes, and pinnacles, and spires were seen
 Peering above the sea, . . a mournful sight!
 Well might the sad beholder ween from thence
 What works of wonder the devouring wave
 Had swallowed there, when monuments so brave
 Bore record of their old magnificence.
 And on the sandy shore, beside the verge
 Of Ocean, here and there, a rock-hewn fane
 Resisted in its strength the surf and surge
 That on their deep foundations beat in vain.
 In solitude the Ancient Temples stood,
 Once resonant with instrument and song,
 And solemn dance of festive multitude;
 Now as the weary ages pass along,
 No voice they hear, save of the Ocean flood,
 Which roars for ever on the restless shores;
 Or, visiting their solitary caves,
 The lonely sound of Winds, that moan around
 Accordant to the melancholy waves.

 8.
 With reverence did the travellers see
 {33}
 The works of ancient days, and silently
 Approach the shore. Now on the yellow sand,
 Where round their feet the rising surges part,
 They stand. Ladurlad's heart
 Exulted in his wonderous destiny.
 To Heaven he rais'd his hand
 In attitude of stern heroic pride;
 Oh what a power, he cried,
 Thou dreadful Rajah, doth thy Curse impart!
 I thank thee now! . . Then turning to the Maid,
 Thou see'st how far and wide
 Yon Towers extend, he said,
 My search must needs be long. Meantime the flood
 Will cast thee up thy food, . .
 And in the Chambers of the Rock by night,
 Take thou thy safe abode,
 No prowling beast to harm thee, or affright,
 Can enter there; but wrap thyself with care
 From the foul Bird obscene that thirsts for blood;
 For in such caverns doth the Bat delight
 To have its haunts. Do thou with stone and shout,
 Ere thou liest down at evening, scare them out,
 And in this robe of mine involve thy feet.
 Duly commend us both to Heaven in prayer,
 {34}
 Be of good heart, and let thy sleep be sweet.

 9.
 So saying, he put back his arm, and gave
 The cloth which girt his loins, and prest her hand
 With fervent love, then down the sloping sand
 Advanced into the sea: the coming Wave,
 Which knew Kehama's Curse, before his way
 Started, and on he went as on dry land,
 And still around his path the waters parted.
 She stands upon the shore, where sea-weeds play,
 Lashing her polish'd ankles, and the spray
 Which off her Father, like a rainbow, fled,
 Falls on her like a shower; there Kailyal stands,
 And sees the billows rise above his head.
 She, at the startling sight, forgot the power
 The Curse had given him, and held forth her hands
 Imploringly, . . . her voice was on the wind,
 And the deaf Ocean o'er Ladurlad clos'd.
 Soon she recall'd his destiny to mind,
 And, shaking off that natural fear, compos'd
 Her soul with prayer, to wait the event resign'd.

 10.
 Alone, upon the solitary strand,
 {35}
 The lovely one is left; behold her go,
 Pacing with patient footsteps, to and fro,
 Along the bending sand.
 Save her, ye Gods! from Evil Powers, and here
 From man she need not fear;
 For never Traveller comes near
 These awful ruins of the days of yore,
 Nor fisher's bark, nor venturous mariner,
 Approach the sacred shore.
 All day she walk'd the beach, at night she sought
 The Chamber of the Rock; with stone and shout
 Assail'd the Bats obscene, and scar'd them out;
 Then in her Father's robe involv'd her feet,
 And wrapt her mantle round to guard her head,
 And laid her down: the rock was Kailyal's bed,
 Her chamber-lamps were in the starry sky,
 The winds and waters were her lullaby.

 11.
 Be of good heart, and let thy sleep be sweet,
 Ladurlad said, . . Alas! that cannot be
 To one whose days are days of misery.
 How often did she stretch her hands to greet
 Ereenia, rescued in the dreams of night!
 {36}
 How oft amid the vision of delight,
 Fear in her heart all is not as it seems;
 Then from unsettled slumber start, and hear
 The Winds that moan above, the Waves below!
 Thou hast been call'd, O Sleep! the friend of Woe,
 But 'tis the happy who have call'd thee so.

 12.
 Another day, another night are gone,
 A second passes, and a third wanes on.
 So long she paced the shore,
 So often on the beach she took her stand,
 That the wild Sea-Birds knew her, and no more
 Fled, when she past beside them on the strand.
 Bright shine the golden summits in the light
 Of the noon-sun, and lovelier far by night
 Their moonlight glories o'er the sea they shed:
 Fair is the dark-green deep; by night and day
 Unvex'd with storms, the peaceful billows play,
 As when they clos'd upon Ladurlad's head:
 The firmament above is bright and clear;
 The sea-fowl, lords of water, air, and land,
 Joyous alike upon the wing appear,
 Or when they ride the waves, or walk the sand;
 {37}
 Beauty and light and joy are every-where;
 There is no sadness and no sorrow here,
 Save what that single human breast contains,
 But oh! what hopes, and fears, and pains are there!

 13.
 Seven miserable days the expectant Maid,
 From earliest dawn till evening, watch'd the shore;
 Hope left her then; and in her heart she said,
 Never shall I behold my Father more!


 XVI.
 THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.

 {38}

 1.
 When the broad Ocean on Ladurlad's head
 Had clos'd and arch'd him o'er,
 With steady tread he held his way
 Adown the sloping shore.
 The dark-green waves, with emerald hue,
 Imbue the beams of day,
 And on the wrinkled sand below,
 Rolling their mazy network to and fro,
 Light shadows shift and play.
 The hungry Shark, at scent of prey,
 Toward Ladurlad darted;
 Beholding then that human form erect,
 {39}
 How like a God the depths he trod,
 Appall'd the monster started,
 And in his fear departed.
 Onward Ladurlad went with heart elate,
 And now hath reach'd the Ancient City's gate.

 2.
 Wondering, he stood awhile to gaze
 Upon the works of elder days.
 The brazen portals open stood,
 Even as the fearful multitude
 Had left them, when they fled
 Before the rising flood.
 High over-head, sublime,
 The mighty gateway's storied roof was spread,
 Dwarfing the puny piles of younger time.
 With the deeds of days of yore
 That ample roof was sculptur'd o'er,
 And many a godlike form there met his eye,
 And many an emblem dark of mystery.
 Through these wide portals oft had Baly rode
 Triumphant from his proud abode,
 When, in his greatness, he bestrode
 The Aullay, hugest of four-footed kind,
 {40}
 The Aullay-Horse, that in his force,
 With elephantine trunk, could bind
 And lift the elephant, and on the wind
 Whirl him away, with sway and swing,
 Even like a pebble from the practis'd sling.

 3.
 Those streets which never, since the days of yore,
 By human footstep had been visited;
 Those streets; which never more
 A human foot shall tread,
 Ladurlad trod. In sun-light, and sea-green,
 The thousand palaces were seen
 Of that proud city, whose superb abodes
 Seem'd rear'd by Giants for the immortal Gods.
 How silent and how beautiful they stand,
 Like things of Nature! the eternal rocks
 Themselves not firmer. Neither hath the sand
 Drifted within their gates, and choak'd their doors,
 Nor slime defil'd their pavements and their floors.
 Did then the Ocean wage
 His war for love and envy, not in rage,
 O thou fair City, that he spares thee thus?
 Art thou Varounin's capital and court,
 {41}
 Where all the Sea-Gods for delight resort,
 A place too godlike to be held by us,
 The poor degenerate children of the Earth?
 So thought Ladurlad, as he look'd around,
 Weening to hear the sound
 Of Mermaid's shell, and song
 Of choral throng from some imperial hall,
 Wherein the Immortal Powers, at festival,
 Their high carousals keep.
 But all is silence dread,
 Silence profound and dead,
 The everlasting stillness of the Deep.

 4.
 Through many a solitary street,
 And silent market-place, and lonely square,
 Arm'd with the mighty Curse, behold him fare.
 And now his feet attain that royal fane
 Where Baly held of old his awful reign.
 What once had been the Garden spread around,
 Fair Gardens, once which wore perpetual green,
 Where all sweet flowers through all the year were found,
 And all fair fruits were through all seasons seen;
 A place of Paradise, where each device
 {42}
 Of emulous Art with Nature strove to vie;
 And Nature, on her part,
 Call'd forth new powers wherewith to vanquish Art.
 The Swerga-God himself, with envious eye,
 Survey'd those peerless gardens in their prime;
 Nor ever did the Lord of Light,
 Who circles Earth and Heaven upon his way,
 Behold from eldest time a goodlier sight
 Than were the groves which Baly, in his might,
 Made for his chosen place of solace and delight.

 5.
 It was a Garden still beyond all price,
 Even yet it was a place of Paradise;
 For where the mighty Ocean could not spare,
 There had he, with his own creation,
 Sought to repair his work of devastation.
 And here were coral bowers,
 And grots of madrepores,
 And banks of spunge, as soft and fair to eye
 As e'er was mossy bed
 Whereon the Wood Nymphs lie
 With languid limbs in summer's sultry hours.
 Here, too, were living flowers
 {43}
 Which, like a bud compacted,
 Their purple cups contracted,
 And now in open blossom spread,
 Stretch'd like green anthers many a seeking head.
 And arborets of jointed stone were there,
 And plants of fibres fine, as silkworm's thread;
 Yea, beautiful as Mermaid's golden hair
 Upon the waves dispread:
 Others that, like the broad banana growing,
 Rais'd their long wrinkled leaves of purple hue,
 Like streamers wide out-flowing.
 And whatsoe'er the depths of Ocean hide
 From human eyes, Ladurlad there espied,
 Trees of the deep, and shrubs and fruits and flowers,
 As fair as ours,
 Wherewith the Sea-Nymphs love their locks to braid,
 When to their father's hall, at festival
 Repairing, they, in emulous array,
 Their charms display,
 To grace the banquet, and the solemn day.

 6.
 The golden fountains had not ceas'd to flow,
 And, where they mingled with the briny Sea,
 {44}
 There was a sight of wonder and delight,
 To see the fish, like birds in air,
 Above Ladurlad flying.
 Round those strange waters they repair,
 Their scarlet fins outspread and plying,
 They float with gentle hovering there;
 And now upon those little wings,
 As if to dare forbidden things,
 With wilful purpose bent,
 Swift as an arrow from a bow
 They dash across, and to and fro,
 In rapid glance, like lightning go
 Through that unwonted element.
 Almost in scenes so wonderous fair,
 Ladurlad had forgot
 The mighty cause which led him there;
 His busy eye was every where,
 His mind had lost all thought;
 His heart, surrendered to the joys
 Of sight, was happy as a boy's.
 But soon the awakening thought recurs
 Of him who, in the Sepulchres,
 Hopeless of human aid, in chains is laid;
 And her who, on the solitary shore,
 {45}
 By night and day her weary watch will keep,
 Till she shall see them issuing from the deep.

 7.
 Now hath Ladurlad reach'd the Court
 Of the great Palace of the King; its floor
 Was of the marble rock; and there before
 The imperial door,
 A mighty Image on the steps was seen,
 Of stature huge, of countenance serene.
 A crown and sceptre at his feet were laid;
 One hand a scroll display'd,
 The other pointed there, that all might see;
 My name is Death, it said,
 In mercy have the Gods appointed me.
 Two brazen gates beneath him, night and day
 Stood open; and within them you behold
 Descending steps, which in the living stone
 Were hewn, a spacious way
 Down to the Chambers of the Kings of old.

 8.
 Trembling with hope, the adventurous man descended
 The sea-green light of day
 {46}
 Not far along the vault extended;
 But where the slant reflection ended,
 Another light was seen
 Of red and fiery hue,
 That with the water blended,
 And gave the secrets of the Tombs to view.

 9.
 Deep in the marble rock, the Hall
 Of Death was hollowed out, a chamber wide,
 Low-roof'd, and long; on either side,
 Each in his own alcove, and on his throne,
 The Kings of old were seated: in his hand
 Each held the sceptre of command,
 From whence, across that scene of endless night,
 A carbuncle diffused its everlasting light.

 10.
 So well had the embalmers done their part
 With spice and precious unguents, to imbue
 The perfect corpse, that each had still the hue
 Of living man, and every limb was still
 Supple and firm and full, as when of yore
 Its motion answered to the moving will.
 {47}
 The robes of royalty which once they wore,
 Long since had mouldered off and left them bare:
 Naked upon their thrones behold them there,
 Statues of actual flesh, . . a fearful sight!
 Their large and rayless eyes
 Dimly reflecting to that gem-born light,
 Glaz'd, fix'd, and meaningless, . . . yet, open wide,
 Their ghastly balls belied
 The mockery of life in all beside.

 11.
 But if, amid these Chambers drear,
 Death were a sight of shuddering and of fear,
 Life was a thing of stranger horror here.
 For at the farther end, in yon alcove,
 Where Baly should have lain, had he obey'd
 Man's common lot, behold Ereenia laid.
 Strong fetters link him to the rock; his eye
 Now rolls and widens, as with effort vain
 He strives to break the chain,
 Now seems to brood upon his misery.
 Before him couch'd there lay
 One of the mighty monsters of the deep,
 Whom Lorrinite encountering on the way,
 {48}
 There station'd, his perpetual guard to keep;
 In the sport of wanton power, she charm'd him there,
 As if to mock the Glendoveer's despair.
 Upward his form was human, save that here
 The skin was cover'd o'er with scale on scale
 Compact, a panoply of natural mail.
 His mouth, from ear to ear,
 Weapon'd with triple teeth, extended wide,
 And tusks on either side;
 A double snake below, he roll'd
 His supple lengths behind in many a sinuous fold.

 12.
 With red and kindling eye, the Beast beholds
 A living man draw nigh,
 And, rising on his folds,
 In hungry joy awaits the expected feast,
 His mouth half-open, and his teeth unsheath'd.
 Then on he sprung, and in his scaly arms
 Seiz'd him, and fasten'd on his neck, to suck,
 With greedy lips, the warm life-blood: and sure
 But for the mighty power of magic charms,
 As easily as, in the blithesome hour
 Of spring, a child doth crop the meadow flower,
 {49}
 Piecemeal those claws
 Had rent their victim, and those armed jaws
 Snapt him in twain. Naked Ladurlad stood,
 Yet fearless and unharm'd in this dread strife,
 So well Kehama's Curse had charm'd his fated life.

 13.
 He too, . . . for anger, rising at the sight
 Of him he sought, in such strange thrall confin'd.
 With desperate courage fir'd Ladurlad's mind, . . .
 He, too, unto the fight himself addrest,
 And grappling breast to breast,
 With foot firm-planted stands,
 And seiz'd the monster's throat with both his hands.
 Vainly, with throttling grasp, he prest
 The impenetrable scales;
 And lo! the guard rose up, and round his foe,
 With gliding motion, wreath'd his lengthening coils,
 Then tighten'd all their folds with stress and strain.
 Nought would the raging Tyger's strength avail
 If once involv'd within those mighty toils;
 The arm'd Rhinoceros, so clasp'd, in vain
 Had trusted to his hide of rugged mail,
 His bones all broken, and the breath of life
 {50}
 Crush'd from the lungs, in that unequal strife.
 Again, and yet again, he sought to break
 The impassive limbs; but when the monster found
 His utmost power was vain,
 A moment he relax'd in every round,
 Then knit his coils again with closer strain,
 And, bearing forward, forced him to the ground.

 14.
 Ereenia groan'd in anguish at the sight
 Of this dread fight: once more the Glendoveer
 Essay'd to break his bonds, and fear
 For that brave spirit who had sought him here,
 Stung him to wilder strugglings. From the rock
 He rais'd himself half up, . . with might and main
 Pluck'd at the adamantine chain;
 And now, with long and unrelaxing strain,
 In obstinate effort of indignant strength,
 Labour'd and strove in vain;
 Till his immortal sinews fail'd at length;
 And yielding, with an inward groan, to fate,
 Despairingly, he let himself again
 Fall prostrate on his prison-bed of stone,
 Body and chain alike with lifeless weight.

 {51}

 15.
 Struggling they lay in mortal fray
 All day, while day was in our upper sphere,
 For light of day,
 And natural darkness never entered here;
 All night, with unabated might,
 They waged the unremitting fight.
 A second day, a second night,
 With furious will they wrestled still.
 The third came on, the fourth is gone;
 Another comes, another goes,
 And yet no respite, no repose;
 But day and night, and night and day,
 Involv'd in mortal strife they lay;
 Six days and nights have past away,
 And still they wage, with mutual rage,
 The unremitting fray.
 With mutual rage their war they wage,
 But not with mutual will;
 For when the seventh morning came,
 The monster's worn and wearied frame
 In this strange contest fails;
 And weaker, weaker, every hour
 He yields beneath strong Nature's power,
 {52}
 For now the Curse prevails.

 16.
 Sometimes the Beast sprung up to bear
 His foe aloft; and, trusting there
 To shake him from his hold,
 Relax'd the rings that wreath'd him round;
 But on his throat Ladurlad hung,
 And weigh'd him to the ground;
 And if they sink, or if they float,
 Alike with stubborn clasp he clung,
 Tenacious of his grasp;
 For well he knew with what a power,
 Exempt from Nature's laws,
 The Curse had arm'd him for this hour;
 And in the monster's gasping jaws,
 And in his hollow eye,
 Well could Ladurlad now descry
 The certain signs of victory.

 17.
 And now the guard no more can keep
 His painful watch; his eyes, opprest,
 Are fainting for their natural sleep;
 {53}
 His living flesh and blood must rest,
 The Beast must sleep or die.
 Then he, full faint and languidly,
 Unwreathes his rings and strives to fly,
 And still retreating, slowly trails
 His stiff and heavy length of scales.
 But that unweariable foe,
 With will relentless, follows still;
 No breathing time, no pause of fight
 He gives, but presses on his flight;
 Along the vaulted chambers, and the ascent
 Up to the emerald-tinted light of day,
 He harasses his way,
 Till lifeless, underneath his grasp,
 The huge Sea-Monster lay.

 18.
 That obstinate work is done! Ladurlad cried,
 One labour yet remains!
 And thoughtfully he eyed
 Ereenia's ponderous chains;
 And with vain effort, half-despairing, tried
 The rivets deep in-driven. Instinctively,
 As if in search of aid, he look'd around:
 {54}
 Oh, then, how gladly, in the near alcove,
 Fallen on the ground its lifeless Lord beside,
 The crescent scymitar he spied,
 Whose cloudy blade, with potent spells imbued,
 Had lain so many an age unhurt in solitude.

 19.
 Joyfully springing there
 He seiz'd the weapon, and with eager stroke
 Hew'd at the chain; the force was dealt in vain,
 For not as if through yielding air
 Past the descending scymitar,
 Its deaden'd way the heavy water broke;
 Yet it bit deep. Again, with both his hands,
 He wields the blade, and dealt a surer blow.
 The baser metal yields
 To that fine edge, and lo! the Glendoveer
 Rises and snaps the half-sever'd links, and stands
 Freed from his broken bands.


 XVII.
 BALY.

 {55}

 1.
 This is the appointed night,
 The night of joy and consecrated mirth,
 When, from his judgement-seat in Padalon,
 By Yamen's throne,
 Baly goes forth, that he may walk the Earth
 Unseen, and hear his name
 Still hymn'd and honour'd by the grateful voice
 Of humankind, and in his fame rejoice.
 Therefore from door to door, and street to street,
 With willing feet,
 Shaking their firebrands, the glad children run;
 {56}
 Baly! great Baly! they acclaim,
 Where'er they run they bear the mighty name;
 Where'er they meet,
 Baly! great Baly! still their choral tongues repeat.
 Therefore at every door the votive flame
 Through pendant lanthorns sheds its painted light,
 And rockets hissing upward through the sky,
 Fall like a shower of stars
 From Heaven's black canopy.
 Therefore, on yonder mountain's templed height,
 The brazen cauldron blazes through the night.
 Huge as a Ship that travels the main sea
 Is that capacious brass; its wick as tall
 As is the mast of some great admiral.
 Ten thousand votaries bring
 Camphor and ghee to feed the sacred flame;
 And while, through regions round, the nations see
 Its fiery pillar curling high in heaven,
 Baly! great Baly! they exclaim,
 For ever hallowed be his blessed name!
 Honour and praise to him for ever more be given!

 2.
 Why art not thou among the festive throng,
 {57}
 Baly, O Mighty One! to hear thy fame?
 Still as of yore, with pageantry and song
 The glowing streets along,
 They celebrate thy name;
 Baly! great Baly! still
 The grateful habitants of Earth acclaim,
 Baly! great Baly! still
 The ringing walls and echoing towers proclaim.
 From yonder mountain the portentous flame
 Still blazes to the nations as before;
 All things appear to human eyes the same,
 As perfect as of yore;
 To human eyes, . . but how unlike to thine!
 Thine which were wont to see
 The Company divine,
 That with their presence came to honour thee!
 For all the blessed ones of mortal birth
 Who have been cloth'd with immortality,
 From the eight corners of the Earth,
 From the Seven Worlds assembling, all
 Wont to attend thy solemn festival.
 Then did thine eyes behold
 The wide air peopled with that glorious train,
 Now may'st thou seek the blessed ones in vain,
 {58}
 For Earth and Air are now beneath the Rajah's reign.

 3.
 Therefore the Mighty One hath walk'd the Earth
 In sorrow and in solitude to-night.
 The sound of human mirth
 To him is no delight;
 He turns away from that ungrateful sight,
 Hallowed not now by visitants divine,
 And there he bends his melancholy way
 Where, in yon full-orb'd Moon's refulgent light,
 The Golden Towers of his old City shine
 Above the silver sea. The mighty Chief
 There bent his way in grief,
 As if sad thoughts indulged would work their own relief.

 4.
 There he beholds upon the sand
 A lovely Maiden in the moonlight stand.
 The land-breeze lifts her locks of jet,
 The waves around her polish'd ancles play,
 Her bosom with the salt sea-spray is wet;
 Her arms are crost, unconsciously, to fold
 That bosom from the cold,
 {59}
 While statue-like she seems her watch to keep,
 Gazing intently on the restless deep.

 5.
 Seven miserable days had Kailyal there,
 From earliest dawn till evening, watch'd the deep;
 Six nights within the chamber of the rock,
 Had laid her down, and found in prayer
 That comfort which she sought in vain from sleep.
 But when the seventh night came,
 Never should she behold her Father more,
 The wretched Maiden said in her despair;
 Yet would not quit the shore,
 Nor turn her eyes one moment from the sea:
 Never before
 Had Kailyal watch'd it so impatiently,
 Never so eagerly had hop'd before,
 As now when she believ'd, and said, all hope was o'er.

 6.
 Beholding her, how beautiful she stood,
 In that wild solitude,
 Baly from his invisibility
 Had issued then, to know her cause of woe;
 {60}
 But that, in the air beside her, he espied
 Two Powers of Evil for her hurt allied,
 Foul Arvalan and dreadful Lorrinite.
 The Mighty One they could not see,
 And marking with what demon-like delight
 They kept their innocent prey in sight,
 He waits, expecting what the end may be.

 7.
 She starts; for lo! where floating many a rood,
 A Monster, hugest of the Ocean brood,
 Weltering and lifeless, drifts toward the shore.
 Backward she starts in fear before the flood,
 And, when the waves retreat,
 They leave their hideous burthen at her feet.

 8.
 She ventures to approach with timid tread,
 She starts, and half draws back in fear,
 Then stops, and stretches on her head,
 To see if that huge beast indeed be dead.
 Now growing bold, the Maid advances near,
 Even to the margin of the ocean-flood.
 Rightly she reads her Father's victory,
 {61}
 And lifts her joyous hands, exultingly,
 To Heaven in gratitude.
 Then spreading them toward the Sea,
 While pious tears bedim her streaming eyes,
 Come! come! my Father, come to me!
 Ereenia, come! she cries.
 Lo! from the opening deep they rise,
 And to Ladurlad's arms the happy Kailyal flies.

 9.
 She turn'd from him, to meet, with beating heart,
 The Glendoveer's embrace.
 Now turn to me, for mine thou art!
 Foul Arvalan exdaim'd; his loathsome face
 Came forth, and from the air,
 In fleshly form, he burst.
 Always in horror and despair,
 Had Kailyal seen that form and face accurst,
 But yet so sharp a pang had ne'er
 Shot with a thrill like death through all her frame,
 As now when on her hour of joy the Spectre came.

 10.
 Vain is resistance now,
 {62}
 The fiendish laugh of Lorrinite is heard;
 And, at her dreadful word,
 The Asuras once again appear,
 And seize Ladurlad and the Glendoveer.

 11.
 Hold your accursed hands!
 A Voice exclaim'd, whose dread commands
 Were fear'd through all the vaults of Padalon;
 And there among them, in the midnight air,
 The presence of the mighty Baly shone.
 He, making manifest his mightiness,
 Put forth on every side an hundred arms,
 And seiz'd the Sorceress; maugre all her charms,
 Her and her fiendish ministers he caught
 With force as uncontroulable as fate;
 And that unhappy Soul, to whom
 The Almighty Rajah's power availeth not
 Living to avert, nor dead to mitigate
 His righteous doom.

 12.
 Help, help, Kehama! Father, help! he cried;
 But Baly tarried not to abide
 {63}
 That mightier Power; with irresistible feet
 He stampt and cleft the Earth; it opened wide,
 And gave him way to his own judgement-seat.
 Down, like a plummet, to the World below
 He sunk, and bore his prey
 To righteous punishment, and endless woe.


 XVIII.
 KEHAMA'S DESCENT.

 {64}

 1.
 The Earth, by Baly's feet divided,
 Clos'd o'er his way as to the judgement-seat
 He plunged and bore his prey.
 Scarce had the shock subsided,
 When, darting from the Swerga's heavenly heights,
 Kehama, like a thunderbolt, alights.
 In wrath he came, a bickering flame
 Flash'd from his eyes which made the moonlight dim,
 And passion forcing way from every limb,
 Like furnace-smoke, with terrors wrapt him round.
 Furious he smote the ground;
 {65}
 Earth trembled underneath the dreadful stroke,
 Again in sunder riven;
 He hurl'd in rage his whirling weapon down.
 But lo! the fiery sheckra to his feet
 Return'd, as if by equal force re-driven,
 And from the abyss the voice of Baly came:
 Not yet, O Rajah, hast thou won
 The realms of Padalon!
 Earth and the Swerga are thine own,
 But, till Kehama shall subdue the throne
 Of Hell, in torments Yamen holds his son.

 2.
 Fool that he is! . . in torments let him lie!
 Kehama, wrathful at his son, replied.
 But what am I
 That thou should'st brave me? . . kindling in his pride
 The dreadful Rajah cried.
 Ho! Yamen! hear me. God of Padalon,
 Prepare thy throne,
 And let the Amreeta cup
 Be ready for my lips, when I anon
 Triumphantly shall take my seat thereon,
 And plant upon thy neck my royal feet.

 {66}

 3.
 In voice like thunder thus the Rajah cried,
 Impending o'er the abyss, with menacing hand
 Put forth, as in the action of command,
 And eyes that darted their red anger down.
 Then drawing back he let the earth subside,
 And, as his wrath relax'd, survey'd,
 Thoughtful and silently, the mortal Maid.
 Her eye the while was on the farthest sky,
 Where up the etherial height
 Ereenia rose and past away from sight.
 Never had she so joyfully
 Beheld the coming of the Glendoveer,
 Dear as he was and he deserv'd to be,
 As now she saw him rise and disappear.
 Come now what will, within her heart said she,
 For thou art safe, and what have I to fear?

 4.
 Meantime the Almighty Rajah, late
 In power and majesty and wrath array'd,
 Had laid his terrors by
 And gaz'd upon the Maid.
 Pride could not quit his eye,
 {67}
 Nor that remorseless nature from his front
 Depart; yet whoso had beheld him then
 Had felt some admiration mix'd with dread,
 And might have said
 That sure he seem'd to be the King of Men;
 Less than the greatest that he could not be,
 Who carried in his port such might and majesty.

 5.
 In fear no longer for the Glendoveer,
 Now toward the Rajah Kailyal turn'd her eyes
 As if to ask what doom awaited her.
 But then surprise,
 Even as with fascination, held them there,
 So strange a thing it seem'd to see the change
 Of purport in that all-commanding brow,
 That thoughtfully was bent upon her now.
 Wondering she gaz'd, the while her Father's eye
 Was fix'd upon Kehama haughtily;
 It spake defiance to him, high disdain,
 Stern patience, unsubduable by pain,
 And pride triumphant over agony.

 6.
 Ladurlad, said the Rajah, thou and I
 {68}
 Alike have done the work of Destiny,
 Unknowing each to what the impulse tended;
 But now that over Earth and Heaven my reign
 Is stablish'd, and the ways of Fate are plain
 Before me, here our enmity is ended.
 I take away thy Curse. . . As thus he said,
 The fire which in Ladurlad's heart and brain
 Was burning, fled, and left him free from pain.
 So rapidly his torments were departed,
 That at the sudden ease he started,
 As with a shock, and to his head
 His hands up-fled,
 As if he felt through every failing limb
 The power and sense of life forsaking him.

 7.
 Then turning to the Maid, the Rajah cried,
 O Virgin, above all of mortal birth
 Favour'd alike in beauty and in worth,
 And in the glories of thy destiny,
 Now let thy happy heart exult with pride,
 For Fate hath chosen thee
 To be Kehama's bride,
 To be the Queen of Heaven and Earth,
 And of whatever Worlds beside
 {69}
 Infinity may hide . . . For I can see
 The writing which, at thy nativity,
 All-knowing Nature wrought upon thy brain,
 In branching veins, which to the gifted eye
 Map out the mazes of futurity.
 There is it written, Maid, that thou and I,
 Alone of human kind a deathless pair,
 Are doom'd to share
 The Amreeta-drink divine
 Of immortality. Come, Maiden mine!
 High-fated One, ascend the subject sky,
 And by Kehama's side
 Sit on the Swerga throne, his equal bride.

 8.
 Oh never, . . never . . Father! Kailyal cried;
 It is not as he saith, . . it cannot be!
 I! . . I, his bride!
 Nature is never false; he wrongeth her!
 My heart belies such lines of destiny.
 There is no other true interpreter!

 9.
 At that reply Kehama's darkening brow
 {70}
 Bewray'd the anger which he yet supprest.
 Counsel thy daughter; tell her thou art now
 Free from thy Curse, he said, and bid her bow
 In thankfulness to Fate's benign behest.
 Bid her her stubborn will restrain,
 For Destiny at last must be obey'd,
 And tell her, while obedience is delay'd,
 Thy Curse will burn again.

 10.
 She needeth not my counsel, he replied,
 And idly, Rajah, dost thou reason thus
 Of Destiny! for though all other things
 Were subject to the starry influencings,
 And bow'd submissive to thy tyranny,
 The virtuous heart, and resolute will are free.
 Thus in their wisdom did the Gods decree
 When they created man. Let come what will,
 This is our rock of strength; in every ill,
 Sorrow, oppression, pain and agony,
 The spirit of the good is unsubdued,
 And, suffer as they may, they triumph still.

 11.
 Obstinate fools! exclaim'd the Mighty One,
 {71}
 Fate and my pleasure must be done,
 And ye resist in vain!
 Take your fit guerdon till we meet again!
 So saying, his vindictive hand he flung
 Towards them, fill'd with curses; then on high
 Aloft he sprung, and vanish'd through the Sky.


 XIX.
 MOUNT CALASAY.

 {72}

 1.
 The Rajah, scattering curses as he rose,
 Soar'd to the Swerga, and resum'd his throne.
 Not for his own redoubled agony,
 Which now through heart and brain,
 With renovated pain,
 Rush'd to its seat, Ladurlad breathes that groan,
 That groan is for his child; he groan'd to see
 The lovely one defil'd with leprosy,
 Which, as the enemy vindictive fled,
 O'er all her frame with quick contagion spread.
 She, wondering at events so passing strange,
 {73}
 And fill'd with hope and fear,
 And joy to see the Tyrant disappear,
 And glad expectance of her Glendoveer,
 Perceiv'd not in herself the hideous change.
 His burning pain, she thought, had forced the groan
 Her father breath'd; his agonies alone
 Were present to her mind; she claspt his knees,
 Wept for his Curse, and did not feel her own.

 2.
 Nor when she saw her plague, did her good heart,
 True to itself, even for a moment fail.
 Ha, Rajah! with disdainful smile she cries,
 Mighty and wise and wicked as thou art,
 Still thy blind vengeance acts a friendly part.
 Shall I not thank thee for this scurf and scale
 Of dire deformity, whose loathsomeness,
 Surer than panoply of strongest mail,
 Arms me against all foes? Oh, better so,
 Better such foul disgrace,
 Than that this innocent face
 Should tempt thy wooing! That I need not dread;
 Nor ever impious foe
 Will offer outrage now, nor farther woe
 {74}
 Will beauty draw on my unhappy head;
 Safe through the unholy world may Kailyal go.

 3.
 Her face in virtuous pride
 Was lifted to the skies,
 As him and his poor vengeance she defied;
 But earthward, when she ceas'd, she turn'd her eyes,
 As if she sought to hide
 The tear which in her own despite would rise.
 Did then the thought of her own Glendoveer
 Call forth that natural tear?
 Was it a woman's fear,
 A thought of earthly love, which troubled her?
 Like yon thin cloud amid the moonlight sky
 That flits before the wind
 And leaves no trace behind,
 The womanly pang past over Kailyal's mind.
 This is a loathsome sight to human eye,
 Half-shrinking at herself, the Maiden thought,
 Will it be so to him? Oh surely not!
 The immortal Powers, who see
 Through the poor wrappings of mortality,
 Behold the soul, the beautiful soul, within,
 {75}
 Exempt from age and wasting malady,
 And undeform'd, while pure and free from sin.
 This is a loathsome sight to human eye,
 But not to eyes divine,
 Ereenia, Son of Heaven, oh not to thine!

 4.
 The wrongful thought of fear, the womanly pain
 Had past away, her heart was calm again.
 She rais'd her head, expecting now to see
 The Glendoveer appear;
 Where hath he fled, quoth she,
 That he should tarry now? Oh had she known
 Whither the adventurous Son of Heaven was flown,
 Strong as her spirit was, it had not borne
 The awful thought, nor dar'd to hope for his return.

 5.
 For he in search of Seeva's throne was gone,
 To tell his tale of wrong;
 In search of Seeva's own abode
 The daring one began his heavenly road.
 O wild emprize! above the farthest skies
 He hop'd to rise!
 {76}
 Him who is thron'd beyond the reach of thought,
 The Alone, the Inaccessible, he sought.
 O wild emprize! for when in days of yore,
 For proud pre-eminence of power,
 Brama and Veeshnoo, wild with rage, contended,
 And Seeva, in his might,
 Their dread contention ended;
 Before their sight
 In form a fiery column did he tower,
 Whose head above the highest height extended,
 Whose base below the deepest depth descended.
 Downward, its depth to sound,
 Veeshnoo a thousand years explor'd
 The fathomless profound,
 And yet no base he found:
 Upward, to reach its head,
 Ten myriad years the aspiring Brama soar'd,
 And still, as up he fled,
 Above him still the Immeasurable spread.
 The rivals own'd their lord,
 And trembled and ador'd.
 How shall the Glendoveer attain
 What Brama and what Veeshnoo sought in vain?

 {77}

 6.
 Ne'er did such thought of lofty daring enter
 Celestial Spirit's mind. O wild adventure
 That throne to find, for he must leave behind
 This World, that in the centre,
 Within its salt-sea girdle, lies confin'd;
 Yea the Seven Earths that, each with its own ocean,
 Ring clasping ring, compose the mighty round.
 What power of motion,
 In less than endless years shall bear him there,
 Along the limitless extent,
 To the utmost bound of the remotest spheres?
 What strength of wing
 Suffice to pierce the Golden Firmament
 That closes all within?
 Yet he hath past the measureless extent,
 And pierced the Golden Firmament;
 For Faith hath given him power, and Space and Time
 Vanish before that energy sublime.
 Nor doth Eternal Night,
 And outer Darkness, check his resolute flight;
 By strong desire through all he makes his way,
 Till Seeva's Seat appears, . . behold Mount Calasay!

 {78}

 7.
 Behold the Silver Mountain! round about
 Seven ladders stand, so high, the aching eye,
 Seeking their tops in vain amid the sky,
 Might deem they led from earth to highest heaven.
 Ages would pass away,
 And Worlds with age decay,
 Ere one whose patient feet from ring to ring
 Must win their upward way,
 Could reach the summit of Mount Calasay.
 But that strong power that nerv'd his wing,
 That all-surmounting will,
 Intensity of faith and holiest love,
 Sustain'd Ereenia still,
 And he hath gain'd the plain, the sanctuary above.

 8.
 Lo, there the Silver Bell,
 That, self-sustain'd, hangs buoyant in the air!
 Lo! the broad Table there, too bright
 For mortal sight,
 From whose four sides the bordering gems unite
 Their harmonizing rays,
 In one mid fount of many-colour'd light.
 {79}
 The stream of splendour, flashing as it flows,
 Plays round, and feeds the stem of yon celestial Rose.
 Where is the Sage whose wisdom can declare
 The hidden things of that mysterious flower,
 That flower which serves all mysteries to bear?
 The sacred triangle is there,
 Holding the Emblem which no tongue may tell.
 Is this the Heaven of Heavens, where Seeva's self doth dwell?

 9.
 Here first the Glendoveer
 Felt his wing flag, and paus'd upon his flight.
 Was it that fear came over him, when here
 He saw the imagin'd throne appear?
 Not so, for his immortal sight
 Endur'd the Table's light;
 Distinctly he beheld all things around,
 And doubt and wonder rose within his mind
 That this was all he found.
 Howbeit he lifted up his voice and spake.
 There is oppression in the World below;
 Earth groans beneath the yoke; yea, in her woe,
 She asks if the Avenger's eye is blind?
 Awake, O Lord, awake!
 {80}
 Too long thy vengeance sleepeth. Holy One!
 Put thou thy terrors on for mercy's sake,
 And strike the blow, in justice to mankind!

 10.
 So as he pray'd, intenser faith he felt,
 His spirit seem'd to melt
 With ardent yearnings of increasing love;
 Upward he turn'd his eyes
 As if there should be something yet above;
 Let me not, Seeva! seek in vain! he cries,
 Thou art not here, . . for how should these contain thee?
 Thou art not here, . . for how should I sustain thee?
 But thou, where'er thou art,
 Canst hear the voice of prayer,
 Canst hear the humble heart.
 Thy dwelling who can tell,
 Or who, O Lord, hath seen thy secret throne?
 But thou art not alone,
 Not unapproachable!
 O all-containing Mind,
 Thou who art every where,
 Whom all who seek shall find,
 Hear me, O Seeva! hear the suppliant's prayer!

 {81}

 11.
 So saying, up he sprung,
 And struck the Bell, which self-suspended, hung
 Before the mystic Rose.
 From side to side the silver tongue
 Melodious swung, and far and wide
 Soul-thrilling tones of heavenly music rung.
 Abash'd, confounded,
 It left the Glendoveer; . . yea all astounded
 In overpowering fear and deep dismay;
 For when that Bell had sounded,
 The Rose, with all the mysteries it surrounded,
 The Bell, the Table, and Mount Calasay,
 The holy Hill itself, with all thereon,
 Even as a morning dream before the day
 Dissolves away, they faded and were gone.

 12.
 Where shall he rest his wing, where turn for flight,
 For all around is Light,
 Primal, essential, all-pervading Light!
 Heart cannot think, nor tongue declare,
 Nor eyes of Angel bear
 That Glory unimaginably bright;
 {82}
 The Sun himself had seem'd
 A speck of darkness there,
 Amid that Light of Light!

 13.
 Down fell the Glendoveer,
 Down through all regions, to our mundane sphere
 He fell; but in his ear
 A voice, which from within him came, was heard,
 The indubitable word
 Of Him to whom all secret things are known:
 Go, ye who suffer, go to Yamen's throne.
 He hath the remedy for every woe;
 He setteth right whate'er is wrong below.


 XX.
 THE EMBARKATION.

 {83}

 1.
 Down from the Heaven of Heavens Ereenia fell
 Precipitate, yet imperceptible
 His fall, nor had he cause nor thought of fear;
 And when he came within this mundane sphere,
 And felt that Earth was near,
 The Glendoveer his azure wings expanded,
 And, sloping down the sky
 Toward the spot from whence he sprung on high,
 There on the shore he landed.

 2.
 Kailyal advanced to meet him,
 {84}
 Not moving now as she was wont to greet him;
 Joy in her eye and in her eager pace;
 With a calm smile of melancholy pride
 She met him now, and, turning half aside,
 Her warning hand repell'd the dear embrace.
 Strange things, Ereenia, have befallen us here,
 The Virgin said; the Almighty Man hath read
 The lines which, traced by Nature on my brain,
 There to the gifted eye
 Make all my fortunes plain,
 Mapping the mazes of futurity.
 He sued for peace, for it is written there
 That I with him the Amreeta cup must share;
 Wherefore he bade me come, and by his side
 Sit on the Swerga-throne, his equal bride.
 I need not tell thee what reply was given;
 My heart, the sure interpreter of Heaven,
 His impious words belied.
 Thou seest his poor revenge! So having said,
 One look she glanced upon her leprous stain
 Indignantly, and shook
 Her head in calm disdain.

 3.
 O Maid of soul divine!
 {85}
 O more than ever dear,
 And more than ever mine,
 Replied the Glendoveer;
 He hath not read, be sure, the mystic ways
 Of Fate; almighty as he is, that maze
 Hath mock'd his fallible sight.
 Said he the Amreeta-cup? So far aright
 The Evil One may see; for Fate displays
 Her hidden things in part, and part conceals,
 Baffling the wicked eye
 Alike with what she hides, and what reveals,
 When with unholy purpose it would pry
 Into the secrets of futurity.
 So may it be permitted him to see
 Dimly the inscrutable decree;
 For to the world below,
 Where Yamen guards the Amreeta, we must go;
 Thus Seeva hath exprest his will, even he
 The Holiest hath ordain'd it; there, he saith,
 All wrongs shall be redrest
 By Yamen, by the righteous Power of Death.

 4.
 Forthwith the Father and the fated Maid,
 {86}
 And that heroic Spirit, who for them
 Such flight had late essay'd,
 The will of Heaven obey'd.
 They went their way along the road
 That leads to Yamen's dread abode.

 5.
 Many a day hath past away
 Since they began their arduous way,
 Their way of toil and pain;
 And now their weary feet attain
 The Earth's remotest bound
 Where outer Ocean girds it round.
 But not like other Oceans this,
 Rather it seem'd a drear abyss,
 Upon whose brink they stood.
 Oh, scene of fear! the travellers hear
 The raging of the flood;
 They hear how fearfully it roars,
 But clouds of darker shade than night
 For ever hovering round those shores,
 Hide all things from their sight.
 The Sun upon that darkness pours
 His unavailing light;
 {87}
 Nor ever Moon nor Stars display,
 Through the thick shade, one guiding ray
 To shew the perils of the way.

 6.
 There, in a creek, a vessel lay.
 Just on the confines of the day,
 It rode at anchor in its bay,
 These venturous pilgrims to convey
 Across that outer Sea.
 Strange vessel sure it seem'd to be,
 And all unfit for such wild sea!
 For through its yawning side the wave
 Was oozing in; the mast was frail,
 And old and torn its only sail.
 How shall that crazy vessel brave
 The billows, that in wild commotion
 For ever roar and rave?
 How hope to cross the dreadful Ocean,
 O'er which eternal shadows dwell,
 Whose secrets none return to tell!

 7.
 Well might the travellers fear to enter!
 {88}
 But summon'd once on that adventure,
 For them was no retreat.
 Nor boots it with reluctant feet
 To linger on the strand;
 Aboard! aboard!
 An awful voice, that left no choice,
 Sent forth its stern command,
 Aboard! aboard!
 The travellers hear that voice in fear,
 And breathe to Heaven an inward prayer,
 And take their seats in silence there.

 8.
 Self-hoisted then, behold the sail
 Expands itself before the gale;
 Hands, which they cannot see, let slip
 The cable of that fated ship;
 The land breeze sends her on her way,
 And lo! they leave the living light of day!


 XXI.
 THE WORLD'S END.

 {89}

 1.
 Swift as an arrow in its flight
 The Ship shot through the incumbent night;
 And they have left behind
 The raging billows and the roaring wind,
 The storm, the darkness, and all mortal fears;
 And lo! another light
 To guide their way appears,
 The light of other spheres.

 2.
 That instant, from Ladurlad's heart and brain
 {90}
 The Curse was gone; he feels again
 Fresh as in Youth's fair morning, and the Maid
 Hath lost her leprous stain.
 The dreadful Man hath no dominion here,
 Starting she cried; O happy, happy hour!
 We are beyond his power!
 Then raising to the Glendoveer,
 With heavenly beauty bright, her angel face,
 Turn'd not reluctant now, and met his dear embrace.

 3.
 Swift glides the Ship, with gentle motion,
 Across that calm and quiet ocean;
 That glassy sea, which seem'd to be
 The mirror of tranquillity.
 Their pleasant passage soon was o'er,
 The Ship hath reach'd its destin'd shore;
 A level belt of ice which bound,
 As with an adamantine mound,
 The waters of the sleeping Ocean round.
 Strange forms were on the strand
 Of earth-born spirits slain before their time;
 Who, wandering over sea and sky and land,
 Had so fulfill'd their term; and now were met
 {91}
 Upon this icy belt, a motley band,
 Waiting their summons, at the appointed hour
 When each before the judgement-seat must stand,
 And hear his doom from Baly's righteous power.

 4.
 Foul with habitual crimes, a hideous crew
 Were there, the race of rapine and of blood.
 Now, having overpast the mortal flood,
 Their own deformity they knew,
 And knew the meed that to their deeds was due.
 Therefore in fear and agony they stood,
 Expecting when the evil Messenger
 Among them should appear. But with their fear
 A hope was mingled now;
 O'er the dark shade of guilt a deeper hue
 It threw, and gave a fiercer character
 To the wild eye and lip and sinful brow.
 They hop'd that soon Kehama would subdue
 The inexorable God, and seize his throne,
 Reduce the infernal World to his command,
 And, with his irresistible right hand,
 Redeem them from the vaults of Padalon.

 {92}

 5.
 Apart from these a milder company,
 The victims of offences not their own,
 Look'd when the appointed Messenger should come;
 Gathered together some, and some alone
 Brooding in silence on their future doom.
 Widows whom, to their husbands' funeral fire,
 Force or strong error led, to share the pyre,
 As to their everlasting marriage-bed:
 And babes, by sin unstain'd,
 Whom erring parents vow'd
 To Ganges, and the holy stream profan'd
 With that strange sacrifice, rite unordain'd
 By Law, by sacred Nature unallow'd:
 Others more hapless in their destiny,
 Scarce having first inhaled this vital breath,
 Whose cradles from some tree
 Unnatural hands suspended,
 Then left, till gentle Death,
 Coming like Sleep, their feeble moanings ended;
 Or for his prey the ravenous Kite descended;
 Or, marching like an army from their caves,
 The Pismires blacken'd o'er, then bleach'd and bare
 {93}
 Left their unharden'd bones to fall asunder there.

 6.
 Innocent Souls! thus set so early free
 From sin and sorrow and mortality,
 Their spotless spirits all-creating Love
 Receiv'd into its universal breast.
 Yon blue serene above
 Was their domain; clouds pillowed them to rest;
 The Elements on them like nurses tended,
 And with their growth etherial substance blended.
 Less pure than these is that strange Indian bird
 Who never dips in earthly streams her bill,
 But, when the sound of coming showers is heard,
 Looks up, and from the clouds receives her fill.
 Less pure the footless fowl of Heaven, that never
 Rest upon earth, but on the wing for ever
 Hovering o'er flowers, their fragrant food inhale,
 Drink the descending dew upon its way,
 And sleep aloft while floating on the gale.
 And thus these innocents in yonder sky
 Grow and are strengthen'd, while the allotted years
 Perform their course, then hitherward they fly,
 Being free from mortal taint, so free from fears,
 {94}
 A joyous band, expecting soon to soar
 To Indra's happy spheres,
 And mingle with the blessed company
 Of heavenly spirits there for evermore.

 7.
 A Gulph profound surrounded
 This icy belt; the opposite side
 With highest rocks was bounded;
 But where their heads they hide,
 Or where their base is founded,
 None could espy. Above all reach of sight
 They rose, the second Earth was on their height,
 Their feet were fix'd in everlasting night.

 8.
 So deep the Gulph, no eye
 Could plum its dark profundity,
 Yet all its depth must try; for this the road
 To Padalon, and Yamen's dread abode.
 And from below continually
 Ministrant Demons rose and caught
 The Souls whose hour was come;
 Then, with their burthen fraught,
 {95}
 Plunged down, and bore them to receive their doom.

 9.
 Then might be seen who went in hope, and who
 Trembled to meet the meed
 Of many a foul misdeed, as wild they threw
 Their arms retorted from the Demons' grasp,
 And look'd around, all eagerly, to seek
 For help, where help was none; and strove for aid
 To clasp the nearest shade;
 Yea, with imploring looks and horrent shriek,
 Even from one Demon to another bending,
 With hands extending,
 Their mercy they essay'd.
 Still from the verge they strain,
 And from the dreadful gulph avert their eyes,
 In vain; down plunge the Demons, and their cries
 Feebly, as down they sink, from that profound arise.

 10.
 What heart of living man could, undisturb'd,
 Bear sight so sad as this! What wonder there
 If Kailyal's lip were blanch'd with inmost dread!
 The chill which from that icy belt
 {96}
 Struck through her, was less keen than what she felt
 With her heart's-blood through every limb dispread.
 Close to the Glendoveer she clung,
 And clasping round his neck her trembling hands,
 She clos'd her eyes, and there in silence hung.

 11.
 Then to Ladurlad said the Glendoveer,
 These Demons, whom thou seest, the ministers
 Of Yamen, wonder to behold us here;
 But for the dead they come, and not for us:
 Therefore, albeit they gaze upon thee thus,
 Have thou no fear.
 A little while thou must be left alone,
 Till I have borne thy Daughter down,
 And placed her safely by the throne
 Of him who keeps the Gate of Padalon.

 12.
 Then taking Kailyal in his arms, he said,
 Be of good heart, Beloved! it is I
 Who bear thee. Saying this, his wings he spread,
 Sprung upward in the sky, and pois'd his flight,
 Then plunged into the Gulph, and sought the World of Night.


 XXII.
 THE GATE OF PADALON.

 {97}

 1.
 The strong foundations of this inmost Earth
 Rest upon Padalon. That icy Mound
 Which girt the mortal Ocean round,
 Reach'd the profound, . .
 Ice in the regions of the upper air,
 Crystal midway, and adamant below,
 Whose strength sufficed to bear
 The weight of all this upper World of ours,
 And with its rampart clos'd the Realm of Woe.
 Eight gates hath Padalon; eight heavenly Powers
 Have them in charge, each alway at his post,
 {98}
 Lest, from their penal caves, the accursed host,
 Maugre the might of Baly and the God,
 Should break, and carry ruin all abroad.

 2.
 Those gates stand ever open, night and day,
 And Souls of mortal men
 For ever throng the way.
 Some from the dolorous den,
 Children of sin and wrath, return no more:
 They, fit companions of the Spirits accurst,
 Are doom'd, like them in baths of fire immerst,
 Or weltering upon beds of molten ore,
 Or, stretch'd upon the brazen floor,
 Are fasten'd down with adamantine chains;
 While on their substance inconsumable,
 Leeches of fire for ever hang and pull,
 And worms of fire for ever gnaw their food,
 That, still renew'd,
 Freshens for ever their perpetual pains.

 3.
 Others there were whom Baly's voice condemned,
 By long and painful penance, to atone
 {99}
 Their fleshly deeds. Them, from the Judgement-Throne,
 Dread Azyoruca, where she sat involv'd
 In darkness as a tent, receiv'd, and dealt
 To each the measure of his punishment;
 Till, in the central springs of fire, the Will
 Impure is purged away; and the freed soul,
 Thus fitted to receive its second birth,
 Embodied once again, revisits Earth.

 4.
 But they whom Baly's righteous voice absolv'd,
 And Yamen, viewing with benignant eye,
 Dismiss'd to seek their heritage on high,
 How joyfully they leave this gloomy bourne,
 The dread sojourn
 Of Guilt and twin-born Punishment and Woe,
 And wild Remorse, here link'd with worse Despair!
 They to the eastern Gate rejoicing go:
 The Ship of Heaven awaits their coming there,
 And on they sail, greeting the blessed light,
 Through realms of upper air,
 Bound for the Swerga once; but now no more
 Their voyage rests upon that happy shore;
 Since Indra, by the dreadful Rajah's might
 {100}
 Compell'd, hath taken flight,
 On to the second World their way they wend,
 And there, in trembling hope, await the doubtful end.

 5.
 For still in them doth hope predominate,
 Faith's precious privilege, when higher Powers
 Give way to fear in these portentous hours.
 Behold the Wardens eight,
 Each silent at his gate
 Expectant stands; they turn their anxious eyes
 Within, and, listening to the dizzy din
 Of mutinous uproar, each in all his hands
 Holds all his weapons, ready for the fight.
 For, hark! what clamorous cries
 Upon Kehama for deliverance call!
 Come, Rajah! they exclaim, too long we groan
 In torments. Come, Deliverer! yonder throne
 Awaits thee . . . Now, Kehama! Rajah, now!
 Earthly Almighty, wherefore tarriest thou? . .
 Such were the sounds that rung, in wild uproar,
 O'er all the echoing vaults of Padalon;
 And as the Asuras from the brazen floor,
 Struggling against their fetters, strove to rise,
 {101}
 Their clashing chains were heard, and shrieks and cries,
 With curses mix'd, against the Fiends who urge,
 Fierce on their rebel limbs, the avenging scourge.

 6.
 These were the sounds which, at the southern gate,
 Assail'd Ereenia's ear; alighting here
 He laid before Neroodi's feet the Maid,
 Who, pale and cold with fear,
 Hung on his neck, well-nigh a lifeless weight.

 7.
 Who and what art thou? cried the Guardian Power,
 Sight thus unwonted wondering to behold, . .
 O Son of Light!
 Who comest here at this portentous hour,
 When Yamen's throne
 Trembles, and all our might can scarce keep down
 The rebel race from seizing Padalon: . . .
 Who and what art thou? and what wild despair,
 Or wilder hope, from realms of upper air,
 Tempts thee to bear
 This mortal Maid to our forlorn abodes?
 Fitter for her, I ween, the Swerga bowers,
 {102}
 And sweet society of heavenly Powers,
 Than this, . . a doleful scene,
 Even in securest hours.
 And whither would ye go?
 Alas! can human or celestial ear,
 Unmadden'd, hear
 The shrieks and yellings of infernal woe?
 Can living flesh and blood
 Endure the passage of the fiery flood?

 8.
 Lord of the Gate, replied the Glendoveer,
 We come obedient to the will of Fate;
 And haply doom'd to bring
 Hope and salvation to the Infernal King,
 For Seeva sends us here.
 Even He to whom futurity is known,
 The Holiest, bade us go to Yamen's throne.
 Thou seest my precious charge;
 Under thy care, secure from harm, I leave her,
 While I ascend to bear her father down.
 Beneath the shelter of thine arm receive her!

 9.
 Then quoth he to the Maid,
 {103}
 Be of good cheer, my Kailyal! dearest dear,
 In faith subdue thy dread,
 Anon I shall be here. So having said,
 Aloft, with vigorous bound, the Glendoveer
 Sprung in celestial might,
 And soaring up, in spiral circles, wound
 His indefatigable flight.

 10.
 But, as he thus departed,
 The Maid, who at Neroodi's feet was lying,
 Like one entranced or dying,
 Recovering strength from sudden terror, started;
 And gazing after him with straining sight,
 And straining arms, she stood,
 As if in attitude
 To win him back from flight.
 Yea, she had shap'd his name
 For utterance, to recall and bid him stay,
 Nor leave her thus alone; but virtuous shame
 Represt the unbidden sounds upon their way;
 And calling faith to aid,
 Even in this fearful hour, the pious Maid
 Collected courage, till she seem'd to be
 {104}
 Calm and in hope, such power had piety.
 Before the Giant Keeper of the Gate
 She crost her patient arms, and at his feet,
 Prepar'd to meet
 The awful will of Fate with equal mind,
 She took her seat resign'd.

 11.
 Even the stern trouble of Neroodi's brow
 Relax'd as he beheld the valiant Maid.
 Hope, long unfelt till now,
 Rose in his heart reviving, and a smile
 Dawn'd in his brightening countenance, the while
 He gaz'd on her with wonder and delight.
 The blessing of the Powers of Padalon,
 Virgin, be on thee! cried the admiring God;
 And blessed be the hour that gave thee birth,
 Daughter of Earth,
 For thou to this forlorn abode hast brought
 Hope, who too long hath been a stranger here.
 And surely for no lamentable lot,
 Nature, who erreth not,
 To thee that heart of fortitude hath given,
 Those eyes of purity, that face of love: . .
 {105}
 If thou beest not the inheritrix of Heaven,
 There is no truth above.

 12.
 Thus as Neroodi spake, his brow severe
 Shone with an inward joy; for sure he thought
 When Seeva sent so fair a creature here,
 In this momentous hour,
 Ere long the World's deliverance would be wrought,
 And Padalon escape the Rajah's power.
 With pious mind the Maid, in humble guise
 Inclin'd, received his blessing silently,
 And rais'd her grateful eyes
 A moment, then again
 Abas'd them at his presence. Hark! on high
 The sound of coming wings! . . her anxious ears
 Have caught the distant sound. Ereenia brings
 His burthen down! Upstarting from her seat,
 How joyfully she rears
 Her eager head! and scarce upon the ground
 Ladurlad's giddy feet their footing found,
 When, with her trembling arms, she claspt him round.
 No word of greeting,
 Nor other sign of joy at that strange meeting.
 {106}
 Expectant of their fate,
 Silent, and hand in hand,
 Before the Infernal Gate,
 The Father and his heavenly Daughter stand.

 13.
 Then to Neroodi said the Glendoveer,
 No Heaven-born Spirit e'er hath visited
 This region drear and dread; but I, the first
 Who tread your World accurst.
 Lord of the Gate, to whom these realms are known,
 Direct our fated way to Yamen's throne.

 14.
 Bring forth my Chariot, Carmala! quoth then
 The Keeper of the way.
 It was the Car wherein
 On Yamen's festal day,
 When all the Powers of Hell attend their King,
 Yearly to Yamenpur did he repair
 To pay his homage there.
 Pois'd on a single wheel, it mov'd along,
 Instinct with motion; by what wonderous skill
 Compact, no human tongue could tell,
 {107}
 Nor human wit devise; but on that wheel
 Moving or still,
 As if an inward life sustain'd its weight,
 Supported, stood the Car of miracle.

 15.
 Then Carmala brought forth two mantles, white
 As the swan's breast, and bright as mountain snow,
 When from the wintry sky
 The sun, late-rising, shines upon the height,
 And rolling vapours fill the vale below.
 Not without pain the unaccustom'd sight
 That brightness could sustain;
 For neither mortal stain,
 Nor parts corruptible, remain,
 Nor aught that time could touch, or force destroy,
 In that pure web whereof the robes were wrought;
 So long had it in ten-fold fires been tried,
 And blanch'd, and to that brightness purified.
 Apparel'd thus, alone,
 Children of Earth, Neroodi cried,
 In safety may ye pass to Yamen's throne.
 Thus only can your living flesh and blood
 Endure the passage of the fiery flood.

 {108}

 16.
 Of other frame, O Son of Heaven, art thou!
 Yet hast thou now to go
 Through regions which thy heavenly mould will try.
 Glories unutterably bright, I know,
 And beams intense of empyrean light,
 Thine eye divine can bear: but fires of woe,
 The sight of torments, and the cry
 Of absolute despair,
 Might not these things dismay thee on thy flight,
 And thy strong pennons flag and fail thee there?
 Trust not thy wings, celestial though thou art;
 Nor thy good heart, which horror might assail
 And pity quail,
 Pity in these abodes of no avail;
 But take thy seat this mortal pair beside,
 And Carmala the infernal Car will guide.
 Go, and may happy end your way betide!
 So as he spake, the self-mov'd Car roll'd on,
 And lo! they pass the Gate of Padalon.


 XXIII.
 PADALON.

 {109}

 1.
 Whoe'er hath lov'd with venturous step to tread
 The chambers dread
 Of some deep cave, and seen his taper's beam
 Lost in the arch of darkness overhead,
 And mark'd its gleam,
 Playing afar upon the sunless stream,
 Where, from their secret bed,
 And course unknown and inaccessible,
 The silent waters well;
 Whoe'er hath trod such caves of endless night,
 He knows, when measuring back the gloomy way,
 {110}
 With what delight refresh'd, his eye
 Perceives the shadow of the light of day,
 Through the far portal slanting, where it falls
 Dimly reflected on the watry walls;
 How heavenly seems the sky,
 And how, with quicken'd feet, he hastens up,
 Eager again to greet
 The living World, and blessed sunshine there,
 And drink, as from a cup
 Of joy, with thirsty lips, the open air.

 2.
 Far other light than that of day there shone
 Upon the travellers, entering Padalon.
 They, too, in darkness entered on their way,
 But, far before the Car,
 A glow, as of a fiery furnace light,
 Fill'd all before them. 'Twas a light which made
 Darkness itself appear
 A thing of comfort, and the sight, dismay'd,
 Shrunk inward from the molten atmosphere.
 Their way was through the adamantine rock
 Which girt the World of Woe; on either side
 Its massive walls arose, and overhead
 {111}
 Arch'd the long passage; onward as they ride,
 With stronger glare the light around them spread,
 And lo! the regions dread,
 The World of Woe before them, opening wide.

 3.
 There rolls the fiery flood,
 Girding the realms of Padalon around.
 A sea of flame it seem'd to be,
 Sea without bound;
 For neither mortal, nor immortal sight,
 Could pierce across through that intensest light.
 A single rib of steel,
 Keen as the edge of keenest scymitar,
 Spann'd this wide gulph of fire. The infernal Car
 Roll'd to the Gulph, and on its single wheel
 Self-balanced; rose upon that edge of steel.
 Red-quivering float the vapours overhead;
 The fiery gulph beneath them spread,
 Tosses its billowing blaze with rush and roar;
 Steady and swift the self-mov'd Chariot went,
 Winning the long ascent,
 Then, downward rolling, gains the farther shore.

 {112}

 4.
 But, oh! what sounds and sights of woe,
 What sights and sounds of fear,
 Assail the mortal travellers here!
 Their way was on a causey straight and wide,
 Where penal vaults on either side were seen,
 Ranged like the cells wherein
 Those wonderous winged alchemists infold
 Their stores of liquid gold.
 Thick walls of adamant divide
 The dungeons; and from yonder circling flood,
 Off-streams of fire through secret channels glide,
 And wind among them, and in each provide
 An everlasting food
 Of righteous torments for the accursed brood.

 5.
 These were the rebel race, who, in their might
 Confiding impiously, would fain have driven
 The Deities supreme from highest Heaven;
 But by the Suras, in celestial fight,
 Oppos'd and put to flight,
 Here, in their penal dens, the accursed crew,
 {113}
 Not for its crime, but for its failure, rue
 Their wild ambition. Yet again they long
 The contest to renew,
 And wield their arms again in happier hour;
 And with united power,
 Following Kehama's triumph, to press on
 From World to World, and Heaven to Heaven, and Sphere
 To Sphere, till Hemakoot shall be their own,
 And Meru Mount, and Indra's Swerga-Bowers,
 And Brama's region, where the heavenly Hours
 Weave the vast circle of his age-long day.
 Even over Veeshnoo's empyreal seat
 They trust the Rajah shall extend their sway,
 And that the seven-headed Snake, whereon
 The strong Preserver sets his conquering feet,
 Will rise and shake him headlong from his throne,
 When, in their irresistible array,
 Amid the Milky Sea they force their way.
 Even higher yet their frantic thoughts aspire;
 Yea, on their beds of torment as they lie,
 The highest, holiest Seeva, they defy,
 And tell him they shall have anon their day,
 When they will storm his realm, and seize Mount Calasay.

 {114}

 6.
 Such impious hopes torment
 Their raging hearts, impious and impotent;
 And now, with unendurable desire
 And lust of vengeance, that, like inward fire,
 Doth aggravate their punishment, they rave
 Upon Kehama; him the accursed rout
 Acclaim; with furious cries and maddening shout
 They call on him to save;
 Kehama! they exclaim;
 Thundering, the dreadful echo rolls about,
 And Hell's whole vault repeats Kehama's name.

 7.
 Over these dens of punishment, the host
 Of Padalon maintain eternal guard,
 Keeping upon the walls their vigilant ward.
 At every angle stood
 A watch-tower, the decurion Demon's post,
 Where, rais'd on high, he view'd with sleepless eye
 His trust, that all was well. And over these,
 Such was the perfect discipline of Hell,
 Captains of fifties and of hundreds held
 Authority, each in his loftier tower;
 {115}
 And chiefs of legions over them had power;
 And thus all Hell with towers was girt around.
 Aloft the brazen turrets shone
 In the red light of Padalon,
 And on the walls between,
 Dark moving, the infernal Guards were seen,
 Gigantic Demons pacing to and fro;
 Who ever and anon,
 Spreading their crimson pennons, plunged below,
 Faster to rivet down the Asuras' chains;
 And with the snaky scourge and fiercer pains,
 Repress their rage rebellious. Loud around,
 In mingled sound, the echoing lash, the clash
 Of chains, the ponderous hammer's iron stroke,
 With execrations, groans, and shrieks and cries
 Combin'd, in one wild dissonance, arise;
 And through the din there broke,
 Like thunder heard through all the warring winds,
 The dreadful name. Kehama, still they rave,
 Hasten and save!
 Now, now, Deliverer! now, Kehama, now!
 Earthly Almighty, wherefore tarriest thou!

 8.
 Oh, if that name abhorr'd,
 {116}
 Thus utter'd, could well nigh
 Dismay the Powers of Hell, and daunt their Lord,
 How fearfully to Kailyal's ear it came!
 She, as the Car roll'd on its rapid way,
 Bent down her head, and clos'd her eyes for dread;
 And deafening, with strong effort from within,
 Her ears against the din,
 Cover'd and prest them close with both her hands.
 Sure if the mortal Maiden had not fed
 On heavenly food, and long been strengthened
 With heavenly converse for such end vouchsaf'd,
 Her human heart had fail'd, and she had died
 Beneath the horrors of this awful hour.
 But heaven supplied a power
 Beyond her earthly nature, to the measure
 Of need infusing strength;
 And Fate, whose secret and unerring pleasure
 Appointed all, decreed
 An ample meed and recompence at length.
 High-fated Maid, the righteous hour is nigh!
 The all-embracing Eye
 Of Retribution still beholdeth thee;
 Bear onward to the end, O Maid, courageously!

 {117}

 9.
 On roll'd the Car, and lo! afar
 Upon its height the Towers of Yamenpur
 Rise on the astonish'd sight.
 Behold the infernal City, Yamen's seat
 Of empire, in the midst of Padalon,
 Where the eight causeys meet.
 There on a rock of adamant it stood,
 Resplendent far and wide,
 Itself of solid diamond edified,
 And all around it roll'd the fiery flood.
 Eight bridges arch'd the stream; huge piles of brass
 Magnificent, such structures as beseem
 The Seat and Capital of such great God,
 Worthy of Yamen's own august abode.
 A brazen tower and gateway at each end
 Of each was rais'd, where Giant Wardens stood,
 Station'd in arms the passage to defend,
 That never foe might cross the fiery flood.

 10.
 Oh what a gorgeous sight it was to see
 The Diamond City blazing on its height
 With more than mid-sun splendour, by the light
 {118}
 Of its own fiery river!
 Its towers and domes and pinnacles and spires,
 Turrets and battlements, that flash and quiver
 Through the red restless atmosphere for ever.
 And hovering over head,
 The smoke and vapours of all Padalon,
 Fit firmament for such a world, were spread,
 With surge and swell, and everlasting motion,
 Heaving and opening like tumultuous ocean.

 11.
 Nor were there wanting there
 Such glories as beseem'd such region well;
 For though with our blue heaven and genial air
 The firmament of Hell might not compare,
 As little might our earthly tempests vie
 With the dread storms of that infernal sky,
 Whose clouds of all metallic elements
 Sublim'd were full. For, when its thunder broke,
 Not all the united World's artillery,
 In one discharge, could equal that loud stroke;
 And though the Diamond Towers and Battlements
 Stood firm upon their adamantine rock,
 Yet, while it vollied round the vault of Hell,
 {119}
 Earth's solid arch was shaken with the shock,
 And Cities in one mighty ruin fell.
 Through the red sky terrific meteors scour;
 Huge stones come hailing down; or sulphur-shower,
 Floating amid the lurid air like snow,
 Kindles in its descent,
 And with blue fire-drops rains on all below.
 At times the whole supernal element
 Igniting, burst in one vast sheet of flame,
 And roar'd as with the sound
 Of rushing winds, above, below, around;
 Anon the flame was spent, and overhead
 A heavy cloud of moving darkness spread.

 12.
 Straight to the brazen bridge and gate
 The self-mov'd Chariot bears its mortal load.
 At sight of Carmala,
 On either side the Giant guards divide,
 And give the chariot way.
 Up yonder winding road it rolls along,
 Swift as the bittern soars on spiral wing,
 And lo! the Palace of the Infernal King!

 {120}

 13.
 Two forms inseparable in unity
 Hath Yamen; even as with hope or fear
 The Soul regardeth him doth he appear;
 For hope and fear,
 At that dread hour, from ominous conscience spring,
 And err not in their bodings. Therefore some,
 They who polluted with offences come,
 Behold him as the King
 Of Terrors, black of aspect, red of eye;
 Reflecting back upon the sinful mind,
 Heighten'd with vengeance, and with wrath divine,
 Its own inborn deformity.
 But to the righteous Spirit how benign
 His awful countenance,
 Where, tempering justice with parental love,
 Goodness and heavenly grace
 And sweetest mercy shine! Yet is he still
 Himself the same, one form, one face, one will;
 And these his twofold aspects are but one;
 And change is none
 In him, for change in Yamen could not be,
 The Immutable is he.

 {121}

 14.
 He sate upon a marble sepulchre
 Massive and huge, where, at the Monarch's feet,
 The righteous Baly had his judgement-seat.
 A Golden Throne before them vacant stood;
 Three human forms sustain'd its ponderous weight,
 With lifted hands outspread, and shoulders bow'd
 Bending beneath their load.
 A fourth was wanting. They were of the hue
 Of coals of fire; yet were they flesh and blood,
 And living breath they drew;
 And their red eye-balls roll'd with ghastly stare,
 As thus, for their misdeeds, they stood tormented there.

 15.
 On steps of gold those fiery Statues stood,
 Who bore the Golden Throne. A cloud behind
 Immoveable was spread; not all the light
 Of all the flames and fires of Padalon
 Could pierce its depth of night.
 There Azyoruca veil'd her awful form
 In those eternal shadows: there she sate,
 And as the trembling Souls, who crowd around
 The Judgement-Seat, received the doom of fate,
 {122}
 Her giant arms, extending from the cloud,
 Drew them within the darkness. Moving out,
 To grasp and bear away the innumerous rout,
 For ever and for ever thus were seen
 The thousand mighty arms of that dread Queen.

 16.
 Here, issuing from the car, the Glendoveer
 Did homage to the God, then rais'd his head.
 Suppliants we come, he said,
 I need not tell thee by what wrongs opprest,
 For nought can pass on earth to thee unknown;
 Sufferers from tyranny we seek for rest,
 And Seeva bade us go to Yamen's throne;
 Here, he hath said, all wrongs shall be redrest.
 Yamen replied, Even now the hour draws near,
 When Fate its hidden ways will manifest.
 Not for light purpose would the Wisest send
 His suppliants here, when we, in doubt and fear,
 The awful issue of the hour attend.
 Wait ye in patience and in faith the end!


 XXIV.
 THE AMREETA.

 {123}

 1.
 So spake the King of Padalon, when, lo!
 The voice of lamentation ceas'd in Hell,
 And sudden silence all around them fell,
 Silence more wild and terrible
 Than all the infernal dissonance before.
 Through that portentous stillness, far away,
 Unwonted sounds were heard, advancing on,
 And deepening on their way;
 For now the inexorable hour
 Was come, and in the fullness of his power,
 {124}
 Now that the dreadful rites had all been done,
 Kehama from the Swerga hastened down,
 To seize upon the throne of Padalon.

 2.
 He came in all his might and majesty,
 With all his terrors clad, and all his pride;
 And, by the attribute of Deity,
 Which he had won from Heaven, self-multiplied,
 The dreadful One appear'd on every side.
 In the same indivisible point of time,
 At the eight Gates he stood at once, and beat
 The Warden-Gods of Hell beneath his feet;
 Then, in his brazen Cars of triumph, straight,
 At the same moment, drove through every gate.
 By Aullays, hugest of created kind,
 Fiercest, and fleeter than the viewless wind,
 His Cars were drawn, ten yokes of ten abreast, . .
 What less sufficed for such almighty weight?
 Eight bridges from the fiery flood arose
 Growing before his way; and on he goes,
 And drives the thundering Chariot-wheels along,
 At once o'er all the roads of Padalon.

 {125}

 3.
 Silent and motionless remain
 The Asuras on their bed of pain,
 Waiting, with breathless hope, the great event.
 All Hell was hush'd in dread,
 Such awe that omnipresent coming spread;
 Nor had its voice been heard, though all its rout
 Innumerable had lifted up one shout;
 Nor if the infernal firmament
 Had, in one unimaginable burst,
 Spent its collected thunders, had the sound
 Been audible, such louder terrors went
 Before his forms substantial. Round about
 The presence scattered lightnings far and wide,
 That quench'd on every side,
 With their intensest blaze, the feebler fire
 Of Padalon, even as the stars go out,
 When, with prodigious light,
 Some blazing meteor fills the astonish'd night.

 4.
 The Diamond City shakes;
 The adamantine Rock
 Is loosen'd with the shock;
 {126}
 From its foundation mov'd, it heaves and quakes;
 The brazen portals crumbling fall to dust;
 Prone fall the Giant Guards
 Beneath the Aullays crush'd.
 On, on, through Yamenpur, their thundering feet
 Speed from all points to Yamen's judgement-seat.
 And lo! where multiplied,
 Behind, before him, and on every side,
 Wielding all weapons in his countless hands,
 Around the Lord of Hell Kehama stands!
 Then, too, the Lord of Hell put forth his might:
 Thick darkness, blacker than the blackest night,
 Rose from their wrath, and veil'd
 The unutterable fight.
 The power of Fate and Sacrifice prevail'd,
 And soon the strife was done.
 Then did the Man-God re-assume
 His unity, absorbing into one
 The consubstantiate shapes; and as the gloom
 Opened, fallen Yamen on the ground was seen,
 His neck beneath the conquering Rajah's feet,
 Who on the marble tomb
 Had his triumphal seat.

 {127}

 5.
 Silent the Man-Almighty sate; a smile
 Gleam'd on his dreadful lips, the while
 Dallying with power, he paus'd from following up
 His conquest, as a man in social hour
 Sips of the grateful cup,
 Again and yet again, with curious taste,
 Searching its subtle flavour ere he drink.
 Even so Kehama now forbore his haste;
 Having within his reach whate'er he sought,
 On his own haughty power he seem'd to muse,
 Pampering his arrogant heart with silent thought.
 Before him stood the Golden Throne in sight,
 Right opposite; he could not chuse but see,
 Nor seeing chuse but wonder. Who are ye
 Who bear the Golden Throne, tormented there?
 He cried; for whom doth Destiny prepare
 The imperial seat? and why are ye but Three?

 FIRST STATUE.
 I of the Children of Mankind was first,
 Me miserable! who, adding store to store,
 Heapt up superfluous wealth; and now accurst,
 For ever I the frantic crime deplore.

 {128}

 SECOND STATUE.
 I o'er my Brethren of Mankind the first
 Usurping power, set up a throne sublime,
 A King and Conqueror: therefore thus accurst,
 For ever I in vain repent the crime.

 THIRD STATUE.
 I on the Children of Mankind the first,
 In God's most holy name, impos'd a tale
 Of impious falsehood; therefore thus accurst,
 For ever I in vain the crime bewail.

 6.
 Even as thou here beholdest us,
 Here we have stood, tormented thus,
 Such countless ages, that they seem to be
 Long as eternity,
 And still we are but Three.
 A Fourth will come to share
 Our pain, at yonder vacant corner bear
 His portion of the burthen, and compleat
 The golden Throne for Yamen's judgement-seat.
 Thus hath it been appointed: he must be
 {129}
 Equal in guilt to us, the guilty Three.
 Kehama, come! too long we wait for thee!

 7.
 Thereat, with one accord,
 The Three took up the word, like choral song,
 Come, Rajah! Man-God! Earth's Almighty Lord!
 Kehama, come! we wait for thee too long.

 8.
 A short and sudden laugh of wondering pride
 Burst from him in his triumph: to reply
 Scornful he deign'd not; but with alter'd eye,
 Wherein some doubtful meaning seem'd to lie,
 He turn'd to Kailyal. Maiden, thus he cried,
 I need not bid thee see
 How vain it is to strive with Fate's decree,
 When hither thou hast fled to fly from me,
 And lo! even here thou find'st me at thy side.
 Mine thou must be, being doom'd with me to share
 The Amreeta-cup of immortality;
 Yea, by Myself I swear
 It hath been thus appointed. Joyfully
 Join then thy hand and heart and will with mine,
 {130}
 Nor at such glorious destiny repine,
 Nor in thy folly more provoke my wrath divine.

 9.
 She answer'd; I have said. It must not be!
 Almighty as thou art,
 Thou hast put all things underneath thy feet,
 But still the resolute heart
 And virtuous will are free.
 Never, oh! never, . . never . . can there be
 Communion, Rajah, between thee and me.

 10.
 Once more, quoth he, I urge, and once alone.
 Thou seest yon Golden Throne,
 Where I anon shall set thee by my side;
 Take thou thy seat thereon,
 Kehama's willing bride,
 And I will place the Kingdoms of the World
 Beneath thy Father's feet,
 Appointing him the King of mortal men:
 Else underneath that Throne,
 The Fourth supporter, he shall stand and groan;
 Prayers will be vain to move my mercy then.

 {131}

 11.
 Again the Virgin answer'd, I have said!
 Ladurlad caught her in his proud embrace,
 While on his neck she hid
 In agony her face.

 12.
 Bring forth the Amreeta-cup! Kehama cried
 To Yamen, rising sternly in his pride.
 It is within the Marble Sepulchre,
 The vanquish'd Lord of Padalon replied,
 Bid it be opened. . . . Give thy treasure up!
 Exclaim'd the Man-Almighty to the Tomb.
 And at his voice and look
 The massy fabric shook, and opened wide.
 A huge Anatomy was seen reclin'd
 Within its marble womb. Give me the Cup!
 Again Kehama cried; no other charm
 Was needed than that voice of stern command.
 From his repose the ghastly form arose,
 Put forth his bony and gigantic arm,
 And gave the Amreeta to the Rajah's hand.
 Take! drink! with accents dread the Spectre said,
 For thee and Kailyal hath it been assign'd,
 {132}
 Ye only of the Children of Mankind.

 13.
 Then was the Man-Almighty's heart elate;
 This is the consummation! he exclaim'd,
 Thus have I triumphed over Death and Fate.
 Now, Seeva! look to thine abode!
 Henceforth, on equal footing we engage,
 Alike immortal now, and we will wage
 Our warfare, God to God!
 Joy fill'd his impious soul,
 And to his lips he rais'd the fatal bowl.

 14.
 Thus long the Glendoveer had stood,
 Watching the wonders of the eventful hour,
 Amaz'd but undismay'd; for in his heart
 Faith, overcoming fear, maintain'd its power.
 Nor had that faith abated, when the God
 Of Padalon was beaten down in fight;
 For then he look'd to see the heavenly might
 Of Seeva break upon them. But when now
 He saw the Amreeta in Kehama's hand,
 An impulse which denied all self-command
 {133}
 In that extremity
 Stung him, and he resolved to seize the cup,
 And dare the Rajah's force in Seeva's sight.
 Forward he sprung to tempt the unequal fray,
 When lo! the Anatomy,
 With warning arm, withstood his desperate way,
 And from the Golden Throne the fiery Three
 Again, in one accord, renew'd their song,
 Kehama, come! we wait for thee too long.

 15.
 O fool of drunken hope and frantic vice!
 Madman! to seek for power beyond thy scope
 Of knowledge, and to deem
 Less than omniscience could suffice
 To wield omnipotence! O fool, to dream
 That immortality could be
 The meed of evil! . . yea thou hast it now,
 Victim of thine own wicked heart's device,
 Thou hast thine object now, and now must pay the price.

 16.
 He did not know the awful mystery
 Of that divinest cup, that as the lips
 {134}
 Which touch it, even such its quality,
 Good or malignant: Madman! and he thinks
 The blessed prize is won, and joyfully he drinks.

 17.
 Then Seeva opened on the Accursed One
 His Eye of Anger: upon him alone
 The wrath-beam fell. He shudders . . . but too late;
 The deed is done,
 The dreadful liquor works the will of Fate.
 Immortal he would be,
 Immortal he remains; but through his veins
 Torture at once and immortality,
 A stream of poison doth the Amreeta run,
 Infinite everlasting agony.
 And while within the burning anguish flows,
 His outward body glows
 Like molten ore beneath the avenging eye,
 Doom'd thus to live and burn eternally.
 The fiery Three,
 Beholding him, set up a fiendish cry,
 A song of jubilee:
 Come, Brother, come! they sung; too long
 We in our torments have expected thee;
 {135}
 Come, Brother, come! henceforth we bear no more
 The unequal weight; Come, Brother, we are Four!

 18.
 Vain his almightiness, for mightier pain
 Subdued all power; pain ruled supreme alone.
 And yielding to the bony hand
 The unemptied cup, he mov'd toward the throne,
 And at the vacant corner took his stand.
 Behold the Golden Throne at length compleat,
 And Yamen silently ascends the Judgement-Seat.

 19.
 For two alone, of all mankind, to me
 The Amreeta-Cup was given,
 Then said the Anatomy;
 The Man hath drank, the Woman's turn is next.
 Come, Kailyal, come, receive thy doom,
 And do the Will of Heaven! . .
 Wonder, and Fear, and Awe at once perplext
 The mortal Maiden's heart, but over all
 Hope rose triumphant. With a trembling hand,
 Obedient to his call,
 She took the fated Cup; and, lifting up
 {136}
 Her eyes, where holy tears began to swell,
 Is it not your command,
 Ye heavenly Powers? as on her knees she fell,
 The pious Virgin cried;
 Ye know my innocent will, my heart sincere,
 Ye govern all things still,
 And wherefore should I fear!

 20.
 She said, and drank. The Eye of Mercy beam'd
 Upon the Maid: a cloud of fragrance steam'd
 Like incense-smoke, as all her mortal frame
 Dissolved beneath the potent agency
 Of that mysterious draught; such quality,
 From her pure touch, the fated Cup partook.
 Like one entranced she knelt,
 Feeling her body melt
 Till all but what was heavenly past away:
 Yet still she felt
 Her spirit strong within her, the same heart,
 With the same loves, and all her heavenly part,
 Unchanged, and ripen'd to such perfect state,
 In this miraculous birth, as here on Earth,
 Dimly our holiest hopes anticipate.

 {137}

 21.
 Mine! mine! with rapturous joy Ereenia cried,
 Immortal now, and yet not more divine;
 Mine, mine. . . for ever mine!
 The immortal Maid replied,
 For ever, ever, thine!

 22.
 Then Yamen said, O thou to whom, by Fate,
 Alone of all mankind, this lot is given,
 Daughter of Earth, but now the Child of Heaven
 Go with thy heavenly Mate,
 Partaker now of his immortal bliss;
 Go to the Swerga Bowers,
 And there recall the hours
 Of endless happiness.

 23.
 But that sweet Angel, for she still retain'd
 Her human loves and human piety,
 As if reluctant at the God's commands,
 Linger'd, with anxious eye
 Upon her father fix'd, and spread her hands
 Toward him wistfully.
 {138}
 Go! Yamen cried, nor cast that look behind
 Upon Ladurlad at this parting hour,
 For thou shalt find him in thy Mother's Bower.

 24.
 The Car, as Carmala his word obey'd,
 Mov'd on, and bore away the Maid,
 While from the Golden Throne the Lord of Death
 With love benignant, on Ladurlad smil'd,
 And gently on his head his blessing laid.
 As sweetly as a child,
 Whom neither thought disturbs nor care encumbers,
 Tir'd with long play, at close of summer day,
 Lies down and slumbers,
 Even thus as sweet a boon of sleep partaking,
 By Yamen blest, Ladurlad sunk to rest.
 Blessed that sleep! more blessed was the waking!
 For on that night a heavenly morning broke,
 The light of heaven was round him when he woke,
 And in the Swerga, in Yedillian's Bower,
 All whom he lov'd he met, to part no more.

THE END.



NOTES.

{141}

  _The Banian Tree._--XIII. p. 4.

The _Burghut_, or Banian, often measures from twenty-four to thirty feet
in girth. It is distinguished from every other tree hitherto known, by
the very peculiar circumstance of throwing out roots from all its
branches. These, being pendant, and perfectly lax, in time reach the
ground, which they penetrate, and ultimately become substantial props to
the very massy horizontal boughs, which, but for such a support, must
either be stopt in their growth, or give way, from their own weight.
Many of these _quondam_ roots, changing their outward appearance from a
brown rough rind to a regular bark, not unlike that of the beech,
increase to a great diameter. They may be often seen from four to five
feet in circumference, and {142} in a true perpendicular line. An
observer, ignorant of their nature, might think them artificial, and
that they had been placed for the purpose of sustaining the boughs from
which they originated. They proceed from all the branches
indiscriminately, whether near or far removed from the ground. They
appear like new swabs, such as are in use on board ships: however, few
reach sufficiently low to take a hold of the soil, except those of the
lower branches. I have seen some do so from a great height, but they
were thin, and did not promise well. Many of the ramifications pendant
from the higher boughs are seen to turn round the lower branches, but
without any obvious effect on either; possibly, however, they may derive
sustenance, even from that partial mode of communication. The height of
a full-grown Banian may be from sixty to eighty feet; and many of them,
I am fully confident, cover at least two acres. Their leaves are similar
to, but rather larger than those of the laurel. The wood of the trunk is
used only for fuel; it is light and brittle; but the pillars formed by
the roots are valuable, being extremely elastic and light, working with
ease, and possessing great toughness: it resembles a good kind of
ash.--_Oriental Field Sports_, vol. ii. p. 113.


{143}

  ----_The Well_
  _Which they, with sacrifice of rural pride,_
  _Have wedded to the Cocoa-Grove beside._--XIII. p. 5.

It is a general practice, that, when a plantation is made, a well should
be dug at one of its sides. The well and the tope are married; a
ceremony at which all the village attends, and in which often much money
is expended. The well is considered as the husband, as its waters, which
are copiously furnished to the young trees during the first hot season,
are supposed to cherish and impregnate them. Though vanity and
superstition are evidently the basis of these institutions, yet we
cannot help admiring their effects, so beautifully ornamenting a torrid
country, and affording such general convenience.--_Oriental Sports_, p.
10.


  _Tanks._--XIII. p. 5.

Some of these tanks are of very great extent, often covering eight or
ten acres; and, besides having steps of masonry, perhaps fifty or sixty
feet in breadth, are faced with brick-work, plastered in the most
substantial manner. The corners are generally ornamented with round or
polygon pavilions of a neat appearance.--_Oriental Sports_, vol. ii. p.
116.

{144}

There are two kinds of tanks, which we confound under one common name,
though nothing can be more different. The first is the _Eray_, which is
formed by throwing a mound or bank across a valley or hollow ground, so
that the rain water collects in the upper part of the valley, and is let
out on the lower part by sluices, for the purposes of cultivation. The
other kind is the _Culam_, which is formed by digging out the earth, and
is destined for supplying the inhabitants with water for domestic
purposes. The _Culams_ are very frequently lined on all the four sides
with cut stone, and are the most elegant works of the
natives.--BUCHANAN.

Where there are no springs or rivers to furnish them with water, as it
is in the northern parts, where there are but two or three springs, they
supply this defect by saving of rain water; which they do by casting up
great banks in convenient places, to stop and contain the rains that
fall, and so save it till they have occasion to let it out into the
fields: They are made rounding, like a C, or half-moon. Every town has
one of these ponds, which, if they can get but filled with water, they
count their corn is as good as in the barn. It was no small work to the
ancient inhabitants to make all these banks, of which there is a great
number, being some two, some three fathoms in height, and in length some
above a mile, some {145} less, not all of a size. They are now grown
over with great trees, and so seem natural hills. When they would use
the water, they cut a gap in one end of the bank, and so draw the water
by little and little, as they have occasion, for the watering their
corn.

These ponds, in dry weather, dry up quite. If they should dig these
ponds deep, it would not be so convenient for them. It would indeed
contain the water well, but would not so well, nor in such plenty, empty
out itself into their grounds. In these ponds are alligators, which,
when the water is dried up, depart into the woods, and down to the
rivers, and, in the time of rains, come up again into the ponds. They
are but small, nor do use to catch people, nevertheless they stand in
some fear of them.

The corn they sow in these parts is of that sort that is soonest ripe,
fearing lest their waters should fail. As the water dries out of these
ponds, they make use of them for fields, treading the mud with
buffaloes, and then sowing rice thereon, and frequently casting up water
with scoops on it.--KNOX, p. 9.


  _The Lotus._--XIII. p. 5.

The lotus abounds in the numerous lakes and ponds of the province of
Garah; and we had the pleasure of comparing {146} several varieties;
single and full, white, and tinged with deep or with faint tints of red.
To a near view, the simple elegance of the white lotus gains no
accession of beauty from the multiplication of its petals, nor from the
tinge of gaudy hue; but the richest tint is most pleasing, when a lake,
covered with full-blown lotas, is contemplated.--_Journey from Mirzapur
to Nagpur_.--Asiatic Annual Register, 1806.


  _They built them up a Bower, &c._--XIII. p. 5.

The materials of which these houses are made are always easy to be
procured, and the structure is so simple, that a spacious, and by no
means uncomfortable dwelling, suited to the climate, may be erected in
one day. Our habitation, consisting of three small rooms, and a hall
open to the north, in little more than four hours was in readiness for
our reception; fifty or sixty labourers completed it in that time, and
on emergency could perform the work in much less. Bamboos, grass for
thatching, and the ground rattan, are all the materials requisite: not a
nail is used in the whole edifice: A row of strong bamboos, from eight
to ten feet high, are fixed firm in the ground, which describe the
outline, and are the supporters of the building: smaller bamboos are
then tied horizontally, by strips of the ground rattan, to these upright
posts: {147} The walls, composed of bamboo mats, are fastened to the
sides with similar ligatures: bamboo rafters are quickly raised, and a
roof formed, over which thatch is spread in regular layers, and bound to
the roof by filaments of rattan. A floor of bamboo grating is next laid
in the inside, elevated two or three feet above the ground: this grating
is supported on bamboos, and covered with mats and carpets. Thus ends
the process, which is not more simple than effectual. When the workmen
take pains, a house of this sort is proof against very inclement
weather. We experienced, during our stay at Meeday, a severe storm of
wind and rain, but no water penetrated, nor thatch escaped: and if the
tempest should blow down the house, the inhabitants would run no risk of
having, their brains knocked out, or their bones broken; the fall of the
whole fabric would not crush a lady's lap-dog.--SYMES's _Embassy to
Ava_.


  _Jungle-grass._--XIII. p. 6.

In this district the long grass called jungle is more prevalent than I
ever yet noticed. It rises to the height of seven or eight feet, and is
topped with a beautiful white down, resembling a swan's feather. It is
the mantle with which nature here covers all the uncultivated ground,
and at once veils the indolence of the people and the nakedness {148} of
their land. It has a fine shewy appearance, as it undulates in the wind,
like the waves of the sea. Nothing but the want of greater variety to
its colour prevents it from being one of the finest and most beautiful
objects in that rich store of productions with which nature
spontaneously supplies the improvident natives.--TENNANT.


  _In such libations, pour'd in open glades,_
  _Beside clear streams and solitary shades,_
  _The Spirits of the virtuous dead delight._--XIII. p. 6.

The Hindoos are enjoined by the _Veds_ to offer a cake, which is called
_Peenda_, to the ghosts of their ancestors, as far back as the third
generation. This ceremony is performed on the day of the new moon in
every month. The offering of water is in like manner commanded to be
performed daily; and this ceremony is called _Tarpan_, to satisfy, to
appease. The souls of such men as have left children to continue their
generation, are supposed to be transported, immediately upon quitting
their bodies, into a certain region called the _Peetree Log_, where they
may continue in proportion to their former virtues, provided these
ceremonies be not neglected; otherwise they are precipitated into
_Nark_, and doomed to be born again in the bodies of unclean beasts; and
until, by repeated {149} regenerations, all their sins are done away,
and they attain such a degree of perfection as will entitle them to what
is called _Mooktee_, eternal salvation, by which is understood a release
from future transmigration, and an absorption in the nature of the
godhead, who is called Brahm.--WILKINS. _Note to the Bhagvat Geeta_.

The divine names are always pleased with an oblation in empty glades,
naturally clean, on the banks of rivers, and in solitary spots.--_Inst.
of Menu_.


  _Voomdavee._--XIII. p. 7.

This wife of Veeshnoo is the Goddess of the Earth and of Patience. No
direct adoration is paid her; but she is held to be a silent and
attentive spectator of all that passes in the world.--KINDERSLEY.


  _Tassel Grass._--XIII. p. 8.

The _Surput_, or tassel-grass, which is much the same as the
guinea-grass, grows to the height of twelve or fourteen feet. Its stem
becomes so thick as to resemble in some measure a reed. It is very
strong, and grows very luxuriantly: it is even used as a fence against
cattle; for which purpose it is often planted on banks, excavated from
ditches, to enclose fields of corn, &c. It grows wild in all the
uncultivated parts of India, but especially in the {150} lower
provinces, in which it occupies immense tracts; sometimes mixing with,
and rising above coppices; affording an asylum for elephants,
rhinoceroses, tygers, &c. It frequently is laid by high winds, of which
breeding sows fail not to take advantage, by forming their nests, and
concealing their young under the prostrate grass.--_Oriental Sports_,
vol. i. p. 32.


  _Lo, from his trunk, upturn'd, aloft he flings_
  _The grateful shower, and now,_
  _Plucking the broad-leav'd bough_
  _Of yonder plane,--he moves it to and fro._--XIII. p. 9.

Nature has provided the elephant with means to cool its heated surface,
by enabling it to draw from its throat, by the aid of its trunk, a
copious supply of saliva, which the animal spurts with force very
frequently all over its skin. It also sucks up dust, and blows it over
its back and sides, to keep off the flies, and may often be seen fanning
itself with a large bough, which it uses with great ease and
dexterity.--_Oriental Sports_, vol. i. p. 100.


  _Till his strong temples, bathed with sudden dews,_
  _Their fragrance of delight and love diffuse._--XIII p. 9.

The Hindoo poets frequently allude to the fragrant juice which oozes, at
certain seasons, from small ducts {151} in the temples of the male
elephant, and is useful in relieving him from the redundant moisture,
with which he is then oppressed; and they even describe the bees as
allured by the scent, and mistaking it for that of the sweetest flowers.
When Crishna visited Sanc'ha-dwip, and had destroyed the demon who
infested that delightful country, he passed along the bank of a river,
and was charmed with a delicious odour, which its waters diffused in
their course: He was eager to view the source of so fragrant a stream,
but was informed by the natives that it flowed from the temples of an
elephant, immensely large, milk-white, and beautifully formed; that he
governed a numerous race of elephants; and that the odoriferous fluid
which exuded from his temples in the season of love had formed the
river; that the Devas, or inferior gods, and the Apsarases, or nymphs,
bathed and sported in its waters, impassioned and intoxicated with the
liquid perfume.--WILFORD. _Asiatic Researches_.


  _The antic monkeys, whose wild gambols late_
  _Shook the whole wood._--XIII. p. 10.

They are so numerous on the island of Bulama, says Captain Beaver in his
excellent book, that I have seen, on a calm evening, when there was not
an air sufficiently strong to agitate a leaf, the whole surrounding wood
{152} in as much motion, from their playful gambols among its branches,
as if it had blown a strong wind.


  _Not that in emulous skill that sweetest bird_
  _Her rival strain would try._--XIII. p. 10.

I have been assured, by a credible eye-witness, that two wild antelopes
used often to come from their woods to the place where a more savage
beast, Sirajuddaulah, entertained himself with concerts, and that they
listened to the strains with an appearance of pleasure, till the
monster, in whose soul there was no music, shot one of them, to display
his archery. A learned native of this country told me that he had
frequently seen the most venomous and malignant snakes leave their
holes, upon hearing tunes on a flute, which, as he supposed, gave them
peculiar delight. An intelligent Persian, who repeated his story again
and again, and permitted me to write it down from his lips, declared, he
had more than once been present when a celebrated lutanist, _Mirza
Mohammed_, surnamed _Bulbul_, was playing to a large company, in a grove
near _Shiraz_, where he distinctly saw the nightingales trying to vie
with the musician; sometimes warbling on the trees, sometimes fluttering
from branch to branch, as if they wished to approach the instrument
whence the melody proceeded, and at length dropping on {153} the ground,
in a kind of ecstacy, from which they were soon raised, he assured me,
by a change of the mode. I hardly know, says Sir William Jones, how to
disbelieve the testimony of men who had no system of their own to
support, and could have no interest in deceiving me.--_Asiatic
Researches_.


  _No idle ornaments deface_
  _Her natural grace._--XIII. p. 10.

The Hindoo Wife, in Sir William Jones's poem, describes her own
toilet-tasks:--

  Nor were my night thoughts, I confess,
  Free from solicitude for dress;
  How best to bind my flowing hair
  With art, yet with an artless air,--
  My hair, like musk in scent and hue,
  Oh! blacker far, and sweeter too!
  In what nice braid, or glossy curl,
  To fix a diamond or a pearl,
  And where to smooth the love-spread toils
  With nard or jasmin's fragrant oils;
  How to adjust the golden _Teic_,[30]
  And most adorn my forehead sleek;
  {154}
  What _Condals_[31] should emblaze my ears,
  Like _Seita's_[32] waves, or _Seita's_[33] tears;
  How elegantly to dispose
  Bright circlets for my well-form'd nose;
  With strings of rubies how to deck,
  Or emerald rows, my stately neck;
  While some that ebon tower embraced,
  Some pendent sought my slender waist;
  How next my purfled veil to chuse
  From silken stores of varied hues,
  Which would attract the roving view,
  Pink, violet, purple, orange, blue;
  The loveliest mantle to select,
  Or unembellished or bedeck'd;
  And how my twisted scarf to place
  With most inimitable grace,
  (Too thin its warp, too fine its woof,
  For eyes of males not beauty-proof;)
  What skirts the mantle best would suit,
  Ornate, with stars, or tissued fruit,
  {155}
  The flower-embroidered or the plain,
  With silver or with golden vein;
  The _Chury_[34] bright, which gayly shows
  Fair objects aptly to compose;
  How each smooth arm, and each soft wrist,
  By richest _Cosees_[35] might be kiss'd,
  While some my taper ankles round,
  With sunny radiance tinged the ground.

See how he kisses the lip of my rival, and imprints on her forehead an
ornament of pure musk, black as the young antelope on the lunar orb!
Now, like the husband of _Reti_, he fixes white blossoms on her dark
locks, where they gleam like flashes of lightning among the curled
clouds. On her breasts, like two firmaments, he places a string of gems
like a radiant constellation; he binds on her arms, graceful as the
stalks of the water-lily, and adorned with hands glowing like the petals
of its flower, a bracelet of sapphires, which resemble a cluster of
bees. Ah! see how he ties round her waist a rich girdle illumined with
golden bells, which seem to laugh as they tinkle, at the inferior
brightness of the leafy garlands which lovers hang on their bowers, to
propitiate the god of {156} desire. He places her soft foot, as he
reclines by her side, on his ardent bosom, and stains it with the ruddy
hue of Yavaca.--_Songs of Jayadeva_.


  _Sandal-streak._--XIII. p. 10.

The Hindoos, especially after bathing, paint their faces with ochres and
sandal-wood ground very fine into a pulp.

The custom is principally confined to the male sex, though the women
occasionally wear a round spot, either of sandal, which is of a light
dun colour, or of _singuiff_, that is, a preparation of vermilion,
between the eye-brows, and a stripe of the same running up the front of
the head, in the furrow made according to the general practice of
dividing all the frontal hair equally to the right and left, where it is
rendered smooth, and glazed by a thick mucilage, made by steeping
lintseed for a while in water. When dry, the hair is all firmly matted
together, and will retain its form for many days together.--_Oriental
Sports_, vol. i. p. 271.


  _Nor arm, nor ankle-ring._--XIII. p. 10.

Glass rings are universally worn by the women of the Decan, as an
ornament on the wrists; and their applying closely to the arm is
considered as a mark of delicacy {157} and beauty, for they must of
course be past over the hand. In doing this a girl seldom escapes
without drawing blood, and rubbing part of the skin from her hand; and
as every well-dressed girl has a number of rings on each arm, and as
these are frequently breaking, the poor creatures suffer much from their
love of admiration.--BUCHANAN.


  _The dear retreat._--XIII. p. 11.

There is a beautiful passage in Statius, which may be quoted here: It is
in that poet's best manner:

  Qualis vicino volucris jam sedula partu,
  Jamque timens quâ fronde domum suspendat inanem,
  Providet hinc ventos, hinc anxia cogitat angues,
  Hinc homines; tandem dubiæ placet umbra, novisque
  Vix stetit in ramis, et protinus arbor amatur.
                             _Achil_. ii. 212.


  _Jaga-Naut._--XIV. p. 14.

This temple is to the Hindoos what Mecca is to the Mahommedans. It is
resorted to by pilgrims from every quarter of India. It is the chief
seat of Brahminical power, and a strong-hold of their superstition. At
the {158} annual festival of the Butt Jattra, seven hundred thousand
persons (as has been computed by the Pundits in College) assemble at
this place. The number of deaths in a single year, caused by voluntary
devotement, by imprisonment for non-payment of the demands of the
Brahmins, or by the scarcity of provisions for such a multitude, is
incredible. The precincts of the place are covered with
bones.--CLAUDIUS BUCHANAN.

Many thousands of people are employed in carrying water from Hurdwar to
Juggernat, for the uses of that temple. It is there supposed to be
peculiarly holy, as it issues from what is called the Cow's Mouth. This
superstitious notion is the cause of as much lost labour as would long
since have converted the largest province of Asia into a garden. The
numbers thus employed are immense; they travel with two flasks of the
water slung over the shoulder by means of an elastic piece of bamboo.
The same quantity which employs, perhaps, fifteen thousand persons,
might easily be carried down the Ganges in a few boats annually. Princes
and families of distinction have this water carried to them in all parts
of Hindostan; it is drank at feasts, as well as upon religious
occasions.--TENNANT.

A small river near Kinouge is held by some as even more efficacious in
washing away moral defilement than {159} the Ganges itself. Dr Tennant
says, that a person in Ceylon drinks daily of this water, though at the
distance of, perhaps, three thousand miles, and at the expense of five
thousand rupees per month!

No distinction of casts is made at this temple, but all, like a nation
descended from one common stock, eat, drink, and make merry
together.--STAVORINUS.


  _The seven-headed Idol._--XIV. p. 15.

The idol of _Jaggenat_ is in shape like a serpent, with seven heads; and
on the cheeks of each head it hath the form of a wing upon each cheek,
which wings open and shut and flap as it is carried in a stately
chariot, and the idol in the midst of it; and one of the _moguls_
sitting behind it in the chariot, upon a convenient place, with a
canopy, to keep the sun from injuring of it.

When I, with horror, beheld these strange things, I called to mind the
eighteenth chapter of the _Revelations_, and the first verse, and
likewise the sixteenth and seventeenth verses of the said chapter, in
which places there is a beast, and such idolatrous worship, mentioned;
and those sayings in that text are herein truly accomplished in the
sixteenth verse; for the _Bramins_ are all marked in the forehead, and
likewise all that come to worship the {160} idol are marked also in
their foreheads.--BRUTON. _Churchill's Collection_,


  _The Chariot of the God._--XIV. p. 15.

The size of the chariot is not exaggerated. Speaking of other such,
Niecamp says, _Currus tam horrendæ magnitudinis sunt, ut vel mille
homines uni trahendo vix sufficiant._--i. 10. § 18.

They have built a great chariot, that goeth on sixteen wheels of a side,
and every wheel is five feet in height, and the chariot itself is about
thirty feet high. In this chariot, on their great festival days, at
night, they place their wicked god _Jaggarnat_; and all the _Bramins_,
being in number nine thousand, then attend this great idol, besides of
_ashmen_ and _fackeires_ some thousands, or more than a good many.

The chariot is most richly adorned with most rich and costly ornaments;
and the aforesaid wheels are placed very complete in a round circle, so
artificially, that every wheel doth its proper office without any
impediment; for the chariot is aloft, and in the centre betwixt the
wheels: they have also more than two thousand lights with them: And this
chariot, with the idol, is also drawn with the greatest and best men of
the town; and they are so eager and greedy to draw it, that whosoever,
{161} by shouldering, crowding, shoving, heaving, thrusting, or any
violent way, can but come to lay a hand upon the ropes, they think
themselves blessed and happy: and, when it is going along the city,
there are many that will offer themselves as a sacrifice to this idol,
and desperately lie down on the ground, that the chariot-wheels may run
over them, whereby they are killed outright; some get broken arms, some
broken legs; so that many of them are so destroyed, and by this means
they think to merit heaven.--BRUTON. _Churchill's Collection_.

They sometimes lie down in the track of this machine a few hours before
its arrival, and, taking a soporiferous draught, hope to meet death
asleep.--CLAUDIUS BUCHANAN.


  _A harlot-band._--XIV. p. 19.

There are in India common women, called Wives of the Idol. When a woman
has made a vow to obtain children, if she brings into the world a
beautiful daughter, she carries her to _Bod_, so their idol is called,
with whom she leaves her. This girl, when she is arrived at a proper
age, takes an apartment in the public place, hangs a curtain before the
door, and waits for those who are passing, as well Indians as those of
other sects among whom this debauchery is permitted. She prostitutes
{162} herself for a certain price, and all that she can thus acquire she
carries to the priest of the idol, that he may apply it to the service
of the temple. Let us, says the Mohammedan relater, bless the almighty
and glorious God, that he has chosen us, to exempt us from all the
crimes into which men are led by their unbelief.--_Anciennes Relations_.

Incited, unquestionably, says Mr. Maurice, by the hieroglyphic emblem of
vice so conspicuously elevated, and so strikingly painted in the temples
of Mahadeo, the priests of that deity industriously selected the most
beautiful females that could be found, and, in their tenderest years,
with great pomp and solemnity, consecrated them (as it is impiously
called) to the service of the presiding divinity of the pagoda. They
were trained up in every art to delude and to delight; and, to the
fascination of external beauty, their artful betrayers added the
attractions arising from mental accomplishments. Thus was an invariable
rule of the Hindoos, _that women have no concern with literature_,
dispensed with upon this infamous occasion. The moment these hapless
victims reached maturity, they fell victims to the lust of the Brahmins.
They were early taught to practise the most alluring blandishments, to
roll the expressive eye of wanton pleasure, and to invite to criminal
indulgence, by {163} stealing upon the beholder the tender look of
voluptuous languishing. They were instructed to mould their elegant and
airy forms into the most enticing attitudes and the most lascivious
gestures, while the rapid and graceful motion of their feet, adorned
with golden bells, and glittering with jewels, kept unison with the
exquisite melody of their voices. Every pagoda has a band of these young
syrens, whose business, on great festivals, is to dance in public before
the idol, to sing hymns in his honour, and in private to enrich the
treasury of that pagoda with the wages of prostitution. These women are
not, however, regarded in a dishonourable light; they are considered as
_wedded to the idol_, and they partake of the veneration paid to him.
They are forbidden even to desert the pagoda where they are educated,
and are never permitted to marry; but the offspring, if any, of their
criminal embraces are considered as sacred to the idol: the boys are
taught to play on the sacred instruments used at the festivals, and the
daughters are devoted to the abandoned occupations of their
mothers.--_Indian Antiquities_.

These impostors take a young maid, of the fairest they can meet with, to
be the bride, (as they speak and bear the besotted people in hand) of
_Jagannat_, and they leave her all night in the temple (whither they
{164} have carried her) with the idol, making her believe that
_Jagannat_ himself will come and embrace her, and appointing her to ask
him, whether it will be a fruitful year, what kind of processions,
feasts, prayers, and alms he demands to be made for it. In the mean time
one of these lustful priests enters at night by a little back-door into
the temple, deflowereth this young maid, and maketh her believe any
thing he pleaseth; and the next day, being transported from this temple
into another with the same magnificence, she was carried before upon the
chariot of triumph, on the side of _Jagannat_ her bridegroom: these
_Brahmans_ make her say aloud, before all the people, whatsoever she had
been taught of these cheats, as if she had learnt it from the very mouth
of _Jagannat._--BERNIER.


  _Baly._--XV. p. 26.

The fifth incarnation was in a Bramin dwarf, under the name of Vamen; it
was wrought to restrain the pride of the giant Baly. The latter, after
having conquered the gods, expelled them from Sorgon; he was generous,
true to his word, compassionate, and charitable. Vichenou, under the
form of a very little Bramin, presented himself before him while he was
sacrificing, and asked him for three paces of land to build a hut. Baly
ridiculed the {165} apparent imbecility of the dwarf, in telling him,
that he ought not to limit his demand to a bequest so trifling; that his
generosity could bestow a much larger donation of land. Vamen answered,
That, being of so small a stature, what he asked was more than
sufficient. The prince immediately granted his request, and, to ratify
his donation, poured water into his right hand; which was no sooner done
than the dwarf grew so prodigiously, that his body filled the universe!
He measured the earth with one pace, and the heavens with another, and
then summoned Baly to give him his word for the third. The prince then
recognised Vichenou, adored him, and presented his head to him; but the
god, satisfied with his submission, sent him to govern the Padalon, and
permitted him to return every year to the earth, the day of the full
moon, in the month of November.--SONNERAT's _Voyages_, vol. i. p. 24.


  _The sacred cord._--XV. p. 30.

The Brahmans who officiate at the temples generally go with their heads
uncovered, and the upper part of the body naked. The _Zennar_, or sacred
string, is hung round the body from the left shoulder; a piece of white
cotton cloth is wrapped round the loins, which descends under the knee,
but lower on the left side than on the {166} other; and in cold weather
they sometimes cover their bodies with a shawl, and their heads with a
red cap.--The _Zennar_ is made of a particular kind of perennial cotton,
called _Verma_: it is composed of a certain number of threads of a fixed
length: the _Zennar_ worn by the Khatries has fewer threads than that
worn by the Brahmans, and that worn by the Bhyse fewer than that worn by
the Khatries; but those of the Sodra cast are excluded from this
distinction, none of them being permitted to wear it.--CRAUFURD.


  _The City of Baly._--XV. p. 31.

  Ruins of Malâbalipûr, the City of the great Baly.

A rock, or rather hill of stone, is that which first engrosses the
attention on approaching the place; for as it rises abruptly out of a
level plain of great extent, consists chiefly of one single stone, and
is situated very near to the sea-beach, it is such a kind of object as
an inquisitive traveller would naturally turn aside to examine. Its
shape is also singular and romantic, and, from a distant view, has an
appearance like some antique and lofty edifice. On coming near to the
foot of the rock from the north, works of imagery and sculpture crowd so
thick upon the eye, as might seem to favour the idea of {167} a
petrified town, like those that have been fabled in different parts of
the world, by too credulous travellers. Proceeding on by the foot of the
hill, on the side facing the sea, there is a pagoda rising out of the
ground, of one solid stone, about sixteen or eighteen feet high, which
seems to have been cut upon the spot, out of a detached rock, that has
been found of a proper size for that purpose. The top is arched, and the
style of architecture according to which it is formed different from any
now used in those parts. A little further on, there appears, upon a huge
surface of stone, that juts out a little from the side of the hill, a
numerous group of human figures, in bass-relief, considerably larger
than life, representing the most remarkable persons whose actions are
celebrated in the Nahâbharit, each of them in an attitude, or with
weapons, or other insignia, expressive of his character, or of some one
of his most famous exploits. All these figures are doubtless much less
distinct than they were at first; for upon comparing these and the rest
of the sculptures that are exposed to the sea-air, with others at the
same place, whose situation has afforded them protection from that
element, the difference is striking; the former being every where much
defaced, while the others are fresh as recently finished. An excavation
in another part of the east side of the great rock appears {168} to have
been made on the same plan, and for the same purpose, that Chowltries
are usually built in that country, that is to say, for the accommodation
of travellers. The rock is hollowed out to the size of a spacious room,
and two or three rows of pillars are left, as a seeming support to the
mountainous mass of stone which forms the roof.

The ascent of the hill on the north is, from its natural shape, gradual
and easy at first, and is in other parts rendered more so, by very
excellent steps, cut out in several places where the communication would
be difficult or impracticable without them. A winding stair of this sort
leads to a kind of temple cut out of the solid rock, with some figures
of idols in high relief upon the walls, very well finished. From this
temple there are flights of steps, that seem to have led to some edifice
formerly standing upon the hill; nor does it seem absurd to suppose that
this may have been a palace, to which this temple may have appertained;
for, besides the small detached range of stairs that are here and there
cut in the rock, and seem as if they had once led to different parts of
one great building, there appear in many places small water channels cut
also in the rock, as if for drains to an house; and the whole top of the
hill is strewed with small round pieces of brick, which may be supposed,
{169} from their appearance, to have been worn down to their present
form during the lapse of many ages. On a plain surface of the rock,
which may once have served as the floor of some apartment, there is a
platform of stone, about 8 or 9 feet long, by 3 or 4 wide, in a
situation rather elevated, with two or three steps leading up to it,
perfectly resembling a couch or bed, and a lion very well executed at
the upper end of it, by way of pillow; the whole of one piece, being
part of the hill itself. This the Bramins, inhabitants of the place,
call the bed of Dhermarâjah, or Judishter, the eldest of the five
brothers, whose exploits are the leading subject in the Mahabhârit. And
at a considerable distance from this, at such a distance, indeed, as the
apartments of the women might be supposed to be from that of the men, is
a bath, excavated also from the rock, with steps in the inside, which
the Bramins call the Bath of Dropedy, the wife of Judishter and his
brothers. How much credit is due to this tradition, and whether this
stone couch may not have been anciently used as a kind of throne, rather
than a bed, is matter for future enquiry. A circumstance, however, which
may seem to favour this idea is, that a throne, in the Shanscrit and
other Hindoo languages, is called _Singhâsen_, which is compounded of
_Sing_, a lion, and _ásen_, a seat.

{170}

But though these works may be deemed stupendous, they are surpassed by
others that are to be seen at the distance of about a mile, or mile and
half, to the south of the hill. They consist of two pagodas, of about
30 feet long, by 20 feet wide, and about as many in height, cut out of
the solid rock, and each consisting originally of one single stone.
Their form is different from the style of architecture according to
which idol temples are now built in that country. These sculptures
approach nearer to the Gothic taste, being surmounted by arched roofs,
or domes, not semicircular, but composed of two segments of circles
meeting in a point at top. Near these also stand an elephant full as big
as life, and a lion much larger than the natural size, both hewn also
out of one stone.

The great rock is about 50 or 100 yards from the sea; but close to the
sea are the remains of a pagoda built of brick, and dedicated to Sîb,
the greatest part of which has evidently been swallowed up by that
element; for the door of the innermost apartment, in which the idol is
placed, and before which there are always two or three spacious courts
surrounded with walls, is now washed by the waves, and the pillar used
to discover the meridian at the time of founding the pagoda is seen
standing at some distance in the sea. In the neighbourhood of {171} this
building there are some detached rocks, washed also by the waves, on
which there appear sculptures, though now much worn and defaced: And the
natives of the place declared to the writer of this account, that the
more aged people among them remembered to have seen the tops of several
pagodas far out in the sea, which, being covered with copper, (probably
gilt,) were particularly visible at sun-rise, as their shining surface
used then to reflect the sun's rays, but that now that effect was no
longer produced, as the copper had since become incrusted with mould and
verdigrease.--CHAMBERS. _Asiatic Researches_.

Daniel has a beautiful passage concerning Richard II.--sufficiently
resembling this part of the poem to be inserted here:

   To _Flint_, from thence, unto a restless bed,
  That miserable night he comes convey'd;
  Poorly provided, poorly followed,
  Uncourted, unrespected, unobey'd;
  Where, if uncertain Sleep but hovered
  Over the drooping cares that heavy weigh'd,
  {172}
  Millions of figures Fantasy presents
  Unto that sorrow wakened grief augments.

   His new misfortune makes deluded Sleep
  Say 'twas not so:--false dreams the truth deny:
  Wherewith he starts; feels waking cares do creep
  Upon his soul, and gives his dream the lie,
  Then sleeps again:--and then again as deep
  Deceits of darkness mock his misery.

  _The Aullay._--XVI. p. 40.

This monster of Hindoo imagination is a horse with the trunk of an
elephant, but bearing about the same proportion to the elephant in size,
that the elephant itself does to a common sheep. In one of the prints to
Mr. Kindersley's "Specimens of Hindoo Literature," an aullay is
represented taking up an elephant with his trunk.

Malecheren, (which is probably another name for Baly), in an excursion
which he made one day alone, and in {173} disguise, came to a garden in
the environs of his city Mahâbalipoor, where was a fountain so
inviting, that two celestial nymphs had come down to bathe there. The
Rajah became enamoured of one of them, who condescended to allow of his
attachment to her; and she and her sister nymph used thenceforward to
have frequent interviews with him in that garden. On one of those
occasions they brought with them a male inhabitant of the heavenly
regions, to whom they introduced the Rajah; and between him and
Malecheren a strict friendship ensued; in consequence of which he
agreed, at the Rajah's earnest request, to carry him in disguise to see
the court of the divine Inder,--a favour never before granted to any
mortal. The Rajah returned from thence with new ideas of splendour and
magnificence, which he immediately adopted in regulating his court and
his retinue, and in beautifying his seat of government. By this means
Mahâbalipoor became soon celebrated beyond all the cities of the earth;
and on account of its magnificence having been brought to the gods
assembled at the court of Inder, their jealousy was so much excited at
it, that they sent orders to the God of the Sea to let loose his
billows, and overflow a place which impiously pretended to vie in
splendour with their celestial mansions. This {174} command he obeyed,
and the city was at once overflowed by that furious element, nor has it
ever since been able to rear its head.--CHAMBERS. _Asiat. Res._


  _Round those strange waters they repair._--XVI. p. 44.

In the Bahia dos Artifices, which is between the river Jagoarive and S.

they say comes to drink there.--_Noticias do Brazil_. MSS. i. 8.

Brahma is considered as the immediate creator of all things, and
particularly as the disposer of each person's {175} fate, which he
inscribes within the skull of every created being, and which the gods
themselves cannot avert.--KINDERSLEY, p. 21. NIECAMP. vol. i. p. 10.

It is by the sutures of the skull that these lines of destiny are
formed. See also a note to Thalaba, (vol. i. p. 260, second edition,)

  _The Seven Earths._--XIX. p. 77.

The seas which surround these earths are, 1. of salt water, inclosing
our inmost earth; 2. of fresh water; 3. of _tyre_, curdled milk; 4. of
_ghee_, clarified butter; 5. of _cauloo_, a liquor drawn from the
_pullum_ tree; 6. of liquid sugar; 7. of milk. The whole system is
inclosed in one broad circumference of pure gold, beyond which reigns
impenetrable darkness.--KINDERSLEY.

I know not whether the following fable was invented to account for the
saltness of our sea:

"Agastya is recorded to have been very low in stature; and one day,
previously to the rectifying the too oblique posture of the earth,
walking with Veeshnu on the shore of the ocean, the insolent Deep asked
the God, who that dwarf was strutting by his side? Veeshnu replied, it
was the patriarch Agastya going to restore the earth to its true
balance. The sea, in utter contempt of his pigmy, form, dashed him with
his spray as he passed along; on, which the sage, greatly incensed at
the designed affront, {177} scooped up some of the water in the hollow
of his hand, and drank it off: he again and again repeated the draught,
nor desisted till he had drained the bed of the ocean of the entire
volume of its waters. Alarmed at this effect of his holy indignation,
and dreading an universal drought, the Devatas made intercession with
Agastya to relent from his anger, and again restore an element so
necessary to the existence of nature, both animate and inanimate.
Agastya, pacified, granted their request, and discharged the imbibed
fluid in a way becoming the histories of a gross physical people to
relate, but by no means proper for this page; away, however, that
evinced his sovereign power, while it marked his ineffable contempt for
the vain fury of an element, contending with a being armed with the
delegated power of the Creator of all things. After this miracle, the
earth being, by the same power, restored to its just balance, Agastya
and Veeshnu separated: when the latter, to prevent any similar accident
occurring, commanded the _great serpent_ (that is, of the sphere) to
wind its enormous folds round the seven continents, of which, according
to Sanscreet geography, the earth consists, and appointed, as perpetual
guardians, to watch over and protect it, the eight powerful genii, so
renowned in the Hindoo system of mythology, as presiding over the eight
points of the world."--MAURICE.

{178}

The Pauranics (said Ramachandra to Sir William Jones) will tell you that
our earth is a plane figure studded with eight mountains, and surrounded
by seven seas of milk, nectar, and other fluids; that the part which we
inhabit is one of seven islands, to which eleven smaller isles are
subordinate; that a god, riding on a huge elephant, guards each of the
eight regions; and that a mountain of gold rises and gleams in the
centre.--_Asiatic Researches_.

"Eight original mountains and seven seas, BRAHMA, INDRA, the SUN,
and RUDRA, _these are permanent;_ not thou, not I, not this or that
people. Wherefore then should anxiety be raised in our minds?"--_Asiatic

  _Mount Calasay._--XIX. p. 77.

The residence of _Ixoru_ is upon the silver mount _Calaja_, to the south
of the famous mountain _Mahameru_, being a most delicious place, planted
with all sorts of trees, that bear fruit all the year round. The roses
and other flowers send forth a most odoriferous scent; and the pond at
the foot of the mount is inclosed with pleasant walks of trees, that
afford an agreeable shade, whilst the peacocks and divers other birds
entertain the ear with their harmonious noise, as the beautiful women do
the eyes. The circumjacent woods are inhabited by a certain people {179}
called _Munis_, or _Rixis_, who, avoiding the conversation of others,
spend their time in offering daily sacrifices to their god.

It is observable, that though these pagans are generally black
themselves, they do represent these _Rixis_ to be of a fair complexion,
with long white beards, and long garments hanging cross-ways, from about
the neck down over the breast. They are in such high esteem among them,
they believe that whom they bless are blessed, and whom they curse are
cursed.

Within the mountain lives another generation, called _Jexaquinnera_ and
_Quendra_, who are free from all trouble, spend their days in continual
contemplations, praises, and prayers to God. Round about the mountain
stand seven ladders, by which you ascend to a spacious plain, in the
middle whereof is a bell of silver, and a square table, surrounded with
nine precious stones, of divers colours. Upon this table lies a silver
rose, called _Tamora Pua_, which contains two women as bright and fair
as a pearl: one is called _Brigasiri_, i. e. _the Lady of the Mouth;_
the other _Tarasiri_, i.e. _the Lady of the Tongue_,--because they
praise God with the mouth and tongue. In the centre of this rose is the
_triangle_ of _Quivelinga_, which they say is the permanent residence of
God.--BALDÆUS.

"Except the First Cause, whatever may appear, and may not appear, in the

"As the great elements are in various beings, entering, yet not
entering, (that is, pervading, not destroying,) thus am I in them, yet
not in them.

"Even thus far may inquiry be made by him who seeks to know the
principle of mind in union and separation, which must be _everywhere,
always_."--_Asiatic Researches_. Sir W. JONES, _from the Bhagavat_.

I am the creation and the dissolution of the whole universe. There is
not any thing greater than I, and all things hang on me, even as
precious gems upon a string. I am moisture in the water, light in the
sun and moon, invocation in the _Veds_, sound in the firmament, human
nature in mankind, sweet-smelling savour in the earth, glory in the
source of light: In all things I am life; and I am zeal in the zealous:
and know, O Arjoon! that I am the eternal seed of all nature. I am the
understanding {181} of the wise, the glory of the proud, the strength of
the strong, free from lust and anger; and in animals I am desire
regulated by moral fitness.--KREESHNA, _in the Bhagavat-Geeta_.


  _Heart cannot think, nor tongue declare,_

Being now in the splendorous lustre of the divine bliss and glory, I
there saw in spirit the choir of the holy angels, the choir of the
prophets and apostles, who, with heavenly tongues and music, sing and
play around the throne of God; yet not in just such corporeal forms or
shapes as are those we _now_ bear and walk about in; no, but in shapes
all spiritual: the holy angels in the shape of a multitude of flames of
fire, the souls of believers in the shape of a multitude of glittering
or luminous sparkles; God's throne in the shape, or under the appearance
of a great splendour.--HANS ENGELBRECHT.

Something analogous to this unendurable presence of Seeva is found amid
the nonsense of Joanna Southcott. Apollyon is there made to say of the
Lord, "thou knowest it is written, he is a consuming fire, and who can
dwell in everlasting burnings? who could abide in devouring flames? Our
backs are not brass, nor our sinews {182} iron, to dwell with God in
heaven."--_Dispute between the Woman and the Powers of Darkness_.

  _Whose cradles from some tree_
  _Unnatural hands suspended._--XXI. p. 92.

I heard a voice crying out under my window; I looked out, and saw a poor
young girl lamenting the unhappy case of her sister. On asking what was
the matter, the reply was, _Boot Laggeeosa_, a demon has seized her.
These unhappy people say _Boot Laggeeosa_, if a child newly born will
not suck; and they expose it to death in a basket, hung on the branch of
a tree. One day, as Mr. Thomas and I were riding out, we saw a basket
hung in a tree, in which an infant had been exposed, the skull of which
remained, {183} the rest having been devoured by ants.--_Periodical
Accounts of the Baptist Missionaries_.

opening its bill when it rains, it catches the drops as they fall from
the clouds.--_Periodical Accounts of the Baptist Missionaries_, vol. ii.
p. 309.


  _The footless fowl of Heaven._--XXI. p. 93.

There is a bird that falls down out of the air dead, and is found
sometimes in the Molucco Islands, that has no feet at all. The bigness
of her body and bill, as likewise the form of them, is much the same as
a swallow's; but the spreading out of her wings and tail has no less
compass than an eagle's. She lives and breeds in the air, comes not near
the earth but for her burial, for the largeness and lightness of her
wings and tail sustain her without lassitude. And the laying of her
eggs, and breeding of her young, is upon the back of the male, which is
made hollow, as also the breast of the female, for the more easy
incubation. Also two strings, like two shoemaker's ends, come from the
hinder parts of the male, wherewith it is conceived that he is fastened
closer to the female, while she hatches her eggs on the hollow of {184}
his back. The dew of heaven is appointed her for food, her region being
too far removed from the approach of flies and such like insects.

This is the entire story and philosophy of this miraculous bird in
_Cardan_, who professes himself to have seen it no less than thrice, and
to have described it accordingly. The contrivances whereof, if the
matter were certainly true, are as evident arguments of a Divine
Providence, as that copper-ring, with the Greek[36] inscription upon
it, was an undeniable monument of the artifice and finger of man.

But that the reproach of over-much credulity may not lie upon _Cardan_
alone, Scaliger, who lay at catch with him to take him tripping wherever
he could, cavils not with any thing in the whole narration but the
bigness of wings and the littleness of the body; which he undertakes to
correct from one of his own which was sent him by _Orvesanus_ from Java.
Nay, he confirms what his antagonist has wrote, partly by history and
partly by reason; affirming, that himself, in his own garden, found two
{185} little birds with membranaceous wings utterly devoid of legs,
their form was near to that of a bat's. Nor is he deterred from the
belief of the perpetual flying of the _Manucodiata_, by the gaping of
the feathers of her wings, which seem thereby less fit to sustain her
body, but further makes the narration probable by what he has observed
in kites hovering in the air, as he saith, for a whole hour together
without flapping of her wings, or changing place. And he has found also
how she may sleep in the air, from the example of fishes, which he has
seen sleeping in the water without sinking themselves to the bottom, and
without changing place, but lying stock still, _pinnulis tantum nescia
quid motiuncule meditantes_, only wagging a little their fins, as
heedlessly and unconcernedly as horses while they are asleep wag their
ears to displace the flies that sit upon them. Wherever Scaliger
admitting that the Menucodiata is perpetually on the wing in the air, he
must of necessity admit also that manner of incubation that Cardan
describes, else how could their generations continue?

Franciscus Hernandeo affirms the same with Cardan expressly in every
thing: As also Eusebius Nierembergius, who is so taken with the story of
this bird, that he could not abstain from celebrating her miraculous
properties in a short but elegant copy of verses; and does {186} after,
though confidently opposed, assert the main matter again in prose.

Such are the sufferages of Cardan, Scaliger, Hernandeo, Nierembergius.
But Aldrovandus rejects that fable of her feeding on the dew of heaven,
and of her incubiture on the back of the male, with much scorn and
indignation. And as for the former, his reasons are no ways
contemptible, he alledging that dew is a body not perfectly enough
mixed, or heterogenial enough for food, nor the hard bill of the bird
made for such easie uses as sipping this soft moisture.

To which I know not what Cardan and the rest would answer, unless this,
that they mean by dew the more unctuous moisture of the air, which as it
may not be alike every where, so these birds may be fitted with a
natural sagacity to find it out where it is. That there is dew in this
sense day and night, (as well as in the morning,) and in all seasons of
the year; and therefore a constant supply of moisture and spirits to
their perpetual flying, which they more copiously imbibe by reason of
their exercise: That the thicker parts of this moisture stick and
convert into flesh, and that the lightness of their feathers is so
great, that their pains in sustaining themselves are not over-much. That
what is homogeneal and simple to our sight is fit enough to be the
rudiments of generation, {187} all animals being generated of a kind of
clear crystalline liquor; and that, therefore, it may be also of
nutrition; that orpine and sea-house-leek are nourished and grow, being
hung in the air, and that dock-weed has its root no deeper than near the
upper parts of the water; and, lastly, that the bills of these birds are
for their better flying, by cutting the way, and for better ornament;
for the rectifying also and composing of their feathers, while they swim
in the air with as much ease as swans do in river.

To his great impatiency against their manner of incubation, they would
happily return this answer: That the way is not ridiculous; but it may
be rather necessary from what Aldrovandus himself not only acknowledges
but contends for, namely, that they have no feet at all. For hence it is
manifest, that they cannot light upon the ground, nor any where rest on
their bellies, and be able to get on wing again, because they cannot
creep out of holes of rocks, as swifts and such like short-footed birds
can, they having no feet at all to creep with. Besides, as Aristotle
well argues concerning the long legs of certain water-fowl, that they
were made so long, because they were to wade in the water and catch
fish, adding that excellent aphorism, τὰ γαρ ὄργανα
πρὸς τὸ ἔργον ἡ φύσις ποιεῖ ἀλλ᾽ ὐ
τὸ ἔργον πρὸς τὰ ὄργανα, so may we rationally
conclude, will they say, that as the long legs of these water-fowl {188}
imply a design of their haunting the water, so want of legs in these
Manucodiatas argue they are never to come down to the earth, because
they can neither stand there nor get off again. And if they never come
on the earth, or any other resting-place, where can their eggs be laid
or hatched but on the back of the male?

Besides that Cardan pleases himself with that Antiphonie in nature, that
as the Ostrich being a bird, yet never flies in the air, and never rests
upon the earth. And as for Aldrovandus, his presumption from the five
several Manucodiatas that he had seen, and in which he could observe no
such figuration of parts as implied a fitness for such a manner of
incubation, Cardan will answer, Myself has seen three, and Scaliger one,
who both agree against you.

However, you see that both Cardan, Aldrovandus, and the rest do jointly
agree in allowing the Manucodiata no feet, as also in furnishing her
with two strings, hanging at the hinder parts of her body, which
Aldrovandus will have to be in the female as well as in the male, though
Cardan's experience reacheth not so far.

But Pighafetta and Clusius will easily end this grand controversy
betwixt Cardan and Aldrovandus, if it be true which they report, and if
they speak of the same kind of Birds of Paradise. For they both affirm
that they {189} have feet a palm long, and that with all confidence
imaginable; but Nierembergius on the contrary affirms, that one that was
an eye witness, and that had taken up one of these birds newly dead,
told him that it had no feet at all. Johnston also gives his suffrage
with Nierembergius in this, though with Aldrovandus he rejects the
manner of their incubation.

But unless they can raise themselves from the ground by the stiffness of
some of the feathers of their wings, or rather by virtue of those
nervous strings which they may have a power to stiffen when they are
alive, by transfusing spirits into them, and making them serve as well
instead of legs to raise them from the ground as to hang upon the boughs
of trees, by a slight thing being able to raise or hold up their
light-feathered bodies in the air, as a small twig will us in the water,
I should rather incline to the testimony of Pighafetta and Clusius than
to the judgment of the rest, and believe those mariners that told him
that the legs are pulled off by them that take them, and extenterate
them and dry them in the sun for either their private use or sale.

Which conclusion would the best solve the credit of Aristotle,
who long since has so peremptorily pronounced ὄτι πτηνὸν μόνον
ὐδὲν ἐσιν ὥσπερ νευσικὸν μόνον ἐσιν ὶχθὸς. That there is not any
bird that only flies as the fish only swims.

{190}

But thus our Bird of Paradise is quite flown and vanished into a figment
or fable. But if any one will condole the loss of so convincing an
argument for a Providence that fits one thing to another, I must take
the freedom to tell him, that, unless he be a greater admirer of novelty
than a searcher into the indissoluble consequences of things, I shall
supply his meditation with what of this nature is as strongly
conclusive, and remind, that it will be his own reproach if he cannot
spy as clear an inference from an ordinary truth as from either an
uncertainty or a fiction. And in this regard, the bringing this doubtful
narration into play may not justly seem to no purpose, it carrying so
serious and castigatory a piece of pleasantry with it.

The manucodiata's living on the dew is no part of the convictiveness of
a Providence in this story: But the being excellently well provided of
wings and feathers, _tanta levitatis supellectile exornata_, as
Nierembergius speaks, being so well furnished with all advantages for
lightness, that it seems harder for her to sink down, as he conceits,
than to be borne up in the air; that a bird thus fitted for that region
should have no legs to stand on the earth, this would be a considerable
indication of a discriminating Providence, that on purpose avoids all
uselessness and superfluities.

{191}

The other remarkable, and it is a notorious one, is the cavity on the
back of the male and in the breast of the female, for incubation; and
the third and last, the use of those strings, as Cardan supposes, for
the better keeping them together in incubiture.

If these considerations of this strange story strike so strongly upon
thee as to convince thee of a Providence, think it humour and not
judgment, if what I put in lieu of them, and is but ordinary, have not
the same force with thee.

For is not the fish's wanting feet, (as we observed before,) she being
sufficiently supplied with fins in so thick an element as the water, as
great an argument for a Providence as so light a bird's wanting feet in
that thinner element of the air, the extream lightness of her furniture
being appropriated to the thinness of that element? And is not the same
Providence seen, and that as conspicuously, in allotting but very short
legs to those birds that are called Apodeo both in Plinie and Aristotle,
upon whom she has bestowed such large and strong wings, and a power of
flying so long and swift, as in giving no legs at all to the
manucodiata, who has still a greater power of wing and lightness of
body?

And as for the cavities on the back of the male and in the breast of the
female, is that design of nature any more {192} certain and plain than
in the genital parts of the male and female in all kinds of animals?
What greater argument of counsel and purpose of fitting one thing for
another can there be than that? And if we should make a more inward
search into the contrivances of these parts in an ordinary hen, and
consider how or by what force an egg of so great a growth and bigness is
transmitted from the ovarium through the infundibulum into the processus
of the uterus, the membranes being go thin and the passage so very
small, to see to the principle of that motion cannot be thought less
than divine.

And if you would compare the protuberant paps of teats in the females of
beasts with that cavity in the breast of the she-manucodiata, whether of
them, think you, is the plainer pledge of a knowing and a designing
Providence?

And, lastly, for the strings that are conceived to hold together the
male and female in their incubiture, what a toy is it, if compared with
those invisible links and ties that engage ordinary birds to sit upon
their eggs, they having no visible allurement to such a tedious
service?--HENRY MORE's _Antidote against Atheism_, book 2. ch. 11.

  _And Brama's region, where the heavenly hours_
  _Weave the vast circle of his age-long day._--XXIII. p. 113.

They who are acquainted with day and night know that the day of Brahma
is as a thousand revolutions of the _Yoogs_, and that his night
extendeth for a thousand more. On the coming of that day all things
proceed from invisibility to visibility; so, on the approach of night,
they are all dissolved away in that which is called invisible. The
universe, even, having existed, is again dissolved; and now again, on
the approach of day, by divine necessity, it is reproduced. That which,
upon the dissolution of all things else, is not destroyed, is superior
and of another nature from that visibility: it is invisible and eternal.
He who is thus called invisible and incorruptible is even he who is
called the Supreme Abode; which men having once obtained, they never
more return to earth: that is my mansion.--KREESHNA, _in the
Bhagavat-Geeta_.

The guess, that Brama and his wife Saraswadi may be Abraham and Sarah,
has more letters in its favour than are usually to be found in such
guesses.--NIECAMP, p. i, c. 10. § 2.

The true cause why there is no idol of Brama (except {194} the head,
which is his share in the Trimourter,) is probably to be found in the
conquest of his sect. A different reason, however, is implied in the
Veeda: "Of Him, it says, whose glory is so great there is no image:--He
is the incomprehensible Being which illumines all, delights all, whence
all proceeded;--that by which they live when born, and that to which all
must return."--MOOR's _Hindu Pantheon_, p. 4.


  _Yamen._--XXII. p. 99.

_Yama_ was a child of the Sun, and thence named _Vaivaswata_; another of
his titles was _Dhermaraja_, or King of Justice; and a third
_Pitripeti_, or Lord of the Patriarchs: but he is chiefly distinguished
as Judge of departed souls; for the Hindus believe, that, when a soul
leaves its body, it immediately repairs to _Yamapur_, or the city of
_Yama_, where it receives a just sentence from him, and thence either
ascends to _Swerga_, or the first Heaven; or is driven down to _Narac_,
the region of serpents; or assumes on earth the form of some animal,
unless its offence had been such, that it ought to be condemned to a
vegetable, or even to a mineral prison.--Sir W. JONES.

There is a story concerning Yamen which will remind the reader, in its
purport, of the fable of Love and Death.

{195}

"A famous penitent, _Morrugandumagarexi_ by name, had, during a long
series of years, served the gods with uncommon and most exemplary piety.
This very virtuous man having no children, was extremely desirous of
having one, and therefore daily besought the god Xiven (or Seeva) to
grant him one. At length the god heard his desire, but, before he
indulged it him, he asked him, whether he would have several children,
who should be long-lived and wicked, or one virtuous and prudent, who
should die in his sixteenth year? The penitent chose the latter: his
wife conceived, and was happily delivered of the promised son, whom they
named Marcandem. The boy, like his father, zealously devoted himself to
the worship of Xiven; but as soon as he had attained his sixteenth year,
the officers of Yhamen, god of death, were sent on the earth, to remove
him from thence.

"Young Marcandem being informed on what errand they were come, told
them, with a resolute air, that he was resolved not to die, and that
they might go back, if they pleased. They returned to their master, and
told him the whole affair. Yhamen immediately mounted his great buffle,
and set out. Being come, he told the youth that he acted very rashly in
refusing to leave the world, and it was unjust in him, for Xiven had
promised him a life only of sixteen years, and the term was expired. But
{196} this reason did not satisfy Marcandem, who persisted in his
resolution not to die; and, fearing lest the god of death should attempt
to take him away by force, he ran to his oratory, and taking the Lingam,
clasped it to his breast. Mean time Yhamen came down from his buffle,
threw a rope about the youth's neck, and held him fast therewith, as
also the Lingam, which Marcandem grasped with all his strength, and was
going to drag them both into hell, when Xiven issued out of the Lingam,
drove back the king of the dead, and gave him so furious a blow, that he
killed him on the spot.

"The god of death being thus slain, mankind multiplied so that the earth
was no longer able to contain them. The gods represented this to Xiven,
and he, at their entreaty, restored Yhamen to life, and to all the power
he had before enjoyed. Yhamen immediately dispatched a herald to all
parts of the world, to summon all the old men. The herald got drunk
before he set out, and, without staying till the fumes of the wine were
dispelled, mounted an elephant, and rode up and down the world, pursuant
to his commission; and, instead of publishing this order, he declared,
that it was the will and pleasure of Yamen, that, from this day forward,
all the leaves, fruits, and flowers, whether ripe or green, should fall
to the ground. This proclamation was no sooner {197} issued than men
began to yield to death: But before Yhamen was killed, only the old were
deprived of life, and now people of all ages are summoned
indiscriminately."--PICART.


  _Two forms inseparable in unity,_
  _Hath Yamen._--XXIII. p. 120.

The _Dharma-Raja_, or king of justice, has two countenances; one is mild
and full of benevolence; those alone who abound with virtue see it. He
holds a court of justice, where are many assistants, among whom are many
just and pious kings: _Chitragupta_ acts as chief secretary. These holy
men determine what is _dharma_ and _adharma_, just and unjust. His
(_Dharma-Raja's_) servant is called _Carmala_: he brings the righteous
on celestial cars, which go of themselves, whenever holy men are to be
brought in, according to the directions of the _Dharma-Raja_, who is the
sovereign of the _Pitris_. This is called his _divine countenance_, and
the righteous alone do see it. His other _countenance_, or _form_, is
called _Yama_; this the wicked alone can see: It has large teeth and a
monstrous body, _Yama_ is the lord of _Patala_; there he orders some to
be beaten, some to be cut to pieces, some to be devoured by monsters,
&c. His servant is called _Cashmala_, who, with ropes round their necks,
drags the wicked over rugged {198} paths, and throws them headlong into
hell. He is unmerciful, and hard is his heart: every body trembles at
the sight of him.--WILFORD. _Asiatic Researches_.


  _Black of aspect, red of eye._--XXIII. p. 120.

Punishment is the Magistrate; Punishment is the Inspirer of Terror;
Punishment is the Defender from Calamity; Punishment is the Guardian of
those that sleep; Punishment, with a black aspect and a red eye, tempts
the guilty.--HALHED's _Gentoo Code_, ch. xxi. sect. 8.


  _Azyoruca._--XXIII. p. 121.

In Patala (or the infernal regions) resides the sovereign Queen of the
Nagas, (large snakes, or dragons:) she is beautiful, and her name is
Asyoruca. There, in a cave, she performed Taparya with such rigorous
austerity, that fire sprang from her body, and formed numerous
agnitiraths (places of sacred fire) in Patala. These fires, forcing
their way through the earth, waters, and mountains, formed various
openings or mouths, called from thence the flaming mouths, or juala
muihi. By Samudr, (Oceanus,) a daughter was born unto her, called
Rama-Devi. She is most beautiful; she is Lacshmi; and her name is
Asyotcarsha, or Asyotcrishta. Like a jewel she remains concealed in the
ocean.--WILFORD. _Asiat. Res_.

  _He came in all his might and majesty._--XXIV. p, 124.

What is this to the coming of Seeva, as given us by Mr. Maurice, from
the Seeva Paurana?

"In the place of the right wheel blazed the Sun, in the place of the
left was the Moon; instead of the brazen nails and bolts, which firmly
held the ponderous wheels, were distributed Bramans on the right hand,
and Reyshees on the left; in lieu of the canopy on the top of the
chariot was overspread the vault of Heaven; the counterpoise of the
wheels was on the east and west, and the four Semordres were instead of
the cushions and bolsters; the four Vedas were placed as the horses of
the chariot, and Saraswaty was for the bell; the piece of wood by which
the horses are driven was the three-lettered Mantra, while Brama himself
was the charioteer, and the Nacshatras and stars were distributed about
it by way of ornaments. Sumaru was in the place of a bow, the serpent
Seschanaga was stationed as the string, Veeshnu instead of an arrow, and
fire was constituted its point. Ganges and other rivers were appointed
its precursors; and the setting out of the chariot, with its appendages
and furniture, one would affirm to be the year of twelve months
gracefully moving forwards.

"When Seeva, with his numerous troops and prodigious {200} army, was
mounted, Brama drove so furiously, that thought itself, which, in its
rapid career, compasses Heaven and Earth, could not keep pace with it.
By the motion of the chariot Heaven and Earth were put into a tremor;
and, as the Earth was not able to bear up under this burthen, the Cow of
the Earth, Kam-deva, took upon itself to support the weight. Seeva went
with intention to destroy Treepoor; and the multitude of Devatas and
Reyshees and Apsaras who waited on his stirrup, opening their mouths, in
transports of joy and praise, exclaimed, Jaya! Jaya! so that Parvati,
not being able to bear his absence, set out to accompany Seeva, and, in
an instant, was up with him; while the light which brightened on his
countenance, on the arrival of Parvati, surpassed all imagination and
description. The Genii of the eight regions, armed with all kinds of
weapons, but particularly with _agnyastra_, or fire-darts, like moving
mountains, advanced in front of the army; and Eendra and other Devetas,
some of them mounted on elephants, some on horses, others on chariots,
or on camels or buffaloes, were stationed on each side, while all the
other order of Devetas, to the amount of some lacs, formed the centre.
The Munietuvaras, with long hair on their heads, like Saniassis, holding
their staves in their hands, danced as they went along; the Syddhyas,
who revolve about {201} the heavens, opening their mouths in praise of
Seeva, rained flowers upon his head; and the vaulted heaven, which is
like an inverted goblet, being appointed in the place of a drum, exalted
his dignity by its majestic resounding."

Throughout the Hindoo fables there is the constant mistake of bulk for
sublimity.


  _By the attribute of Deity_
  _----self-multiplied_
  _The dreadful One appeared on every side._--XXIV. p. 124.

This more than polypus power was once exerted by Krishna, on a curious
occasion.

It happened in _Dwarka_, a splendid city built by _Viswa-karma_, by
command of _Krishna_, on the sea-shore, in the province of _Gazerat_,
that his musical associate, _Nareda_, had no wife or substitute; and he
hinted to his friend the decency of sparing him one from his long
catalogue of ladies. _Krishna_ generously told him to win and wear any
one he chose, not immediately in requisition for himself. _Nareda_
accordingly went wooing to one house, but found his master there; to a
second--he was again forestalled; a third, the same; to a fourth, fifth,
the same: in fine, after the round of sixteen thousand of these
domiciliary visits, he was still forced to sigh and {202} keep single;
for _Krishna_ was in every house, variously employed, and so
domesticated, that each lady congratulated herself on her exclusive and
uninterrupted possession of the ardent deity.--MOOR's _Hindu
Pantheon_, p. 204.

Eight of the chief gods have each their _sacti_, or energy, proceeding
from them, differing from them in sex, but in every other respect
exactly like them, with the same form, the same decorations, the same
weapons, and the same vehicle.--_Asiat. Res_. 8vo, edit. vol. viii. p.
68. 82.

The manner in which this divine power is displayed by Kehama, in his
combat with Yamen, will remind some readers of the Irishman, who brought
in four prisoners, and being asked how he had taken them, replied, he
had surrounded them.


  _The Amreeta,_
  _or_
  _Drink of Immortality._--XXIV. p. 129.

Mr Wilkins has given the genuine history of this liquor, which was
produced by churning the sea with a mountain.

"There is a fair and stately mountain, and its name is _Meroo_, a most
exalted mass of glory, reflecting the sunny {203} rays from the splendid
surface of its gilded horns. It is clothed in gold, and is the
respected haunt of _Dews_ and _Gandharvas_. It is inconceivable, and not
to be encompassed by sinful man; and it is guarded by dreadful serpents.
Many celestial medicinal plants adorn its sides; and it stands, piercing
the heaven with its aspiring summit, a mighty hill, inaccessible even by
the human mind. It is adorned with trees and pleasant streams, and
resoundeth with the delightful songs of various birds.

"The _Soors_, and all the glorious hosts of heaven, having ascended to
the summit of this lofty mountain, sparkling with precious gems, and for
eternal ages raised, were sitting in solemn synod, meditating the
discovery of the _Amreeta_, the Water of Immortality. The _Dew Narayan_
being also there, spoke unto _Brahma_, whilst the _Soors_ were thus
consulting together, and said, 'Let the Ocean, as a pot of milk, be
churned by the united labour of the _Soors_ and _Asoors_; and when the
mighty waters have been stirred up, the _Amreeta_ shall be found. Let
them collect together every medicinal herb, and every precious thing,
and let them stir the Ocean, and they shall discover the _Amreeta_.'

"There is also another mighty mountain, whose name is _Mandar_, and its
rocky summits are like towering {204} clouds. It is clothed in a net of
the entangled tendrils of the twining creeper, and resoundeth with the
harmony of various birds. Innumerable savage beasts infest its borders;
and it is the respected haunt of _Kennars_, _Dews_, and _Apsars_. It
standeth eleven thousand _Yojan_ above the earth, and eleven thousand
more below its surface.

"As the united bands of _Dews_ were unable to remove this mountain, they
went before _Veeshnoo_, who was sitting with _Brahma_, and addressed
them in these words: 'Exert, O masters! your most superior wisdom to
remove the mountain _Mandar_, and employ your utmost power for our
good.'

"_Veeshnoo_ and _Brahma_ having said, 'it shall be according to your
wish,' he with the lotus eye directed the King of Serpents to appear;
and Ananta arose, and was instructed in that work by Brahma, and
commanded by _Narayan_ to perform it. Then _Ananta_, by his power, took up
that king of mountains, together with all its forests and every
inhabitant thereof; and the _Soors_ accompanied him into the presence of
the Ocean, whom they addressed, saying, 'We will stir up thy waters to
obtain the _Amreeta_,' And the Lord of the Waters replied, 'Let me also
have a share, seeing I am to bear the violent agitation that will be
caused by the whirling of the {205} mountain!' Then the _Soors_ and
_Asoors_ spoke unto _Koorna-raj_, the King of the Tortoises, upon the
strand of the Ocean, and said, 'My lord is able to be the supporter of
this mountain.' The Tortoise replied, 'Be it so;' and it was placed upon
his back.

"So the mountain being set upon the back of the Tortoise, _Eendra_ began
to whirl it about as it were a machine. The mountain _Mandar_ served as
a churn, and the serpent _Vasoakee_ for the rope; and thus in former
days did the _Dews_, and _Asoors_, and the _Danoos_, begin to stir up
the waters of the ocean for the discovery of the _Amreeta_.

"The mighty _Asoors_ were employed on the side of the serpent's head,
whilst all the _Soors_ assembled about his tail. _Ananta_, that sovereign
_Dew_, stood near _Narayan_.

"They now pull forth the serpent's head repeatedly, and as often let it
go; whilst there issued from his mouth, thus violently drawing to and
fro by the _Soors_ and _Asoors_, a continual stream of fire and smoke
and wind, which ascending in thick clouds, replete with lightning, it
began to rain down upon the heavenly bands, who were already fatigued
with their labour; whilst a shower of flowers was shaken from the top of
the mountain, covering the heads of all, both _Soors_ and {206}
_Asoors_. In the mean time the roaring of the ocean, whilst violently
agitated with the whirling of the mountain _Mandar_ by the _Soors_ and
_Asoors_, was like the bellowing of a mighty cloud. Thousands of the
various productions of the waters were torn to pieces by the mountain,
and confounded with the briny flood; and every specific being of the
deep, and all the inhabitants of the great abyss which is below the
earth, were annihilated; whilst, from the violent agitation of the
mountain, the forest trees were dashed against each other, and
precipitated from its utmost height, with all the birds thereon; from
whose violent confrication a raging fire was produced, involving the
whole mountain with smoke and flame, as with a dark-blue cloud, and the
lightning's vivid flash. The lion and the retreating elephant are
overtaken by the devouring flames, and every vital being, and every
specific thing, are consumed in the general conflagration.

"The raging flames, thus spreading destruction on all sides, were at
length quenched by a shower of cloud-borne water, poured down by the
immortal Eendra. And now a heterogeneous stream of the concocted juices
of various trees and plants ran down into the briny flood.

"It was from this milk-like stream of juices, produced {207} from those
trees and plants and a mixture of melted gold, that the _Soors_ obtained
their immortality.

"The waters of the Ocean now being assimilated with those juices, were
converted into milk, and from that milk a kind of butter was presently
produced; when the heavenly bands went again into the presence of
_Brahma_, the granter of boons, and addressed him, saying, 'Except
_Narayan_, every other _Soor_ and _Asoor_ is fatigued with his labour,
and still the _Amreeta_ doth not appear; wherefore the churning of the
Ocean is at a stand.' Then _Brahma_ said unto _Narayan_, 'Endue them
with recruited strength, for thou art their support.' And _Narayan_
answered and said, 'I will give fresh vigour to such as co-operate in
the work. Let _Mandar_ be whirled about, and the bed of the ocean be
kept steady.'

"When they heard the words of _Narayan_, they all returned again to the
work, and began to stir about with great force that butter of the ocean,
when there presently arose from out the troubled deep, first the Moon,
with a pleasing countenance, shining with ten thousand beams of gentle
light; next followed _Sree_, the goddess of fortune, whose seat is the
white lily of the waters; then _Soora-Devee_, the goddess of wine, and
the white horse called _Oochisrava_. And after these there was produced
from the unctuous mass the jewel _Kowstoobh_, that glorious {208}
sparkling gem worn by Narayan on his breast; also _Pareejat_, the tree
of plenty, and _Soorabhee_, the cow that granted every heart's desire.

"The moon, _Soora-Devee_, the goddess of _Sree_, and the Horse, as swift
as thought, instantly marched away towards the _Dews_, keeping in the
path of the Sun.

"Then the _Dew Dhanwantaree_, in human shape, came forth, holding in his
hand a white vessel filled with the immortal juice _Amreeta_. When the
_Asoors_ beheld these wondrous things appear, they raised their
tumultuous voices for the _Amreeta_, and each of them clamorously
exclaimed, 'This of right is mine.'

"In the mean time _Travat_, a mighty elephant, arose, now kept by the
god of thunder; and as they continued to churn the ocean more than
enough, that deadly poison issued from its bed, burning like a raging
fire, whose dreadful fumes in a moment spread throughout the world,
confounding the three regions of the universe with the mortal stench,
until _Seev_, at the word of _Brahma_, swallowed the fatal drug, to save
mankind; which, remaining in the throat of that sovereign _Dew_ of magic
form, from that time he hath been called _Neel-Kant_, because his throat
was stained blue.

"When the _Asoors_ beheld this miraculous deed, they {209} became
desperate, and the _Amreeta_ and the goddess _Sree_ became the source of
endless hatred.

"Then _Narayan_ assumed the character and person of _Moheenee Maya_, the
power of enchantment, in a female form of wonderful beauty, and stood
before the _Asoors_, whose minds being fascinated by her presence, and
deprived of reason, they seized the _Amreeta_, and gave it unto her.

"The _Asoors_ now clothe themselves in costly armour, and, seizing their
various weapons, rush on together to attack the _Soors_. In the mean
time _Narayan_, in the female form, having obtained the _Amreeta_ from
the hands of their leader, the hosts of _Soors_, during the tumult and
confusion of the _Asoors_, drank of the living water.

"And it so fell out, that whilst the _Soors_ were quenching their thirst
for immortality, _Rahoo_, an _Asoor_, assumed the form of a _Soor_, and
began to drink also: And the water had but reached his throat, when the
Sun and Moon, in friendship to the _Soors_, discovered the deceit; and
instantly _Narayan_ cut off his head as he was drinking, with his
splendid weapon _Chakra_. And the gigantic head of the _Asoor_, emblem
of a mountain's summit, being thus separated from his body by the
_Chakra's_ edge, bounded into the heavens with a dreadful cry, whilst
his ponderous trunk fell, cleaving the ground asunder, and {210} shaking
the whole earth unto its foundation, with all its islands, rocks, and
forests: And from that time the head of Rahoo resolved an eternal
enmity, and continueth, even unto this day, at times to seize upon the
Sun and Moon.

"Now Narayan, having quitted the female figure he had assumed, began to
disturb the _Asoors_ with sundry celestial weapons: and from that
instant a dreadful battle was commenced, on the ocean's briny strand,
between the _Asoors_ and the _Soors_. Innumerable sharp and missile
weapons were hurled, and thousands of piercing darts and battle-axes
fell on all sides. The _Asoors_ vomit blood from the wounds of the
_Chakra_, and fall upon the ground pierced by the sword, the spear, and
spiked club. Heads, glittering with polished gold, divided by the
_Pattees'_ blade, drop incessantly; and mangled bodies, wallowing in
their gore, lay like fragments of mighty rocks, sparkling with gems and
precious ores. Millions of sighs and groans arise on every side; and the
sun is overcast with blood, as they clash their arms, and wound each
other with their dreadful instruments of destruction.

"Now the battle is fought with the iron-spiked club, and, as they close,
with clenched fist; and the din of war ascendeth to the heavens. They
cry 'Pursue! {211} strike! fell to the ground!' so that a horrid and
tumultuous noise is heard on all sides.

"In the midst of this dreadful hurry and confusion of the fight, _Nar_
and _Narayan_ entered the field together. _Narayan_, beholding a
celestial bow in the hand of _Nar_, it reminded him of his _Chakra_, the
destroyer of the _Asoors_. The faithful weapon, by name _Soodarsan_,
ready at the mind's call, flew down from heaven with direct and
refulgent speed, beautiful, yet terrible to behold: And being arrived,
glowing like the sacrificial flame, and spreading terror around,
_Narayan_, with his right arm formed like the elephantine trunk, hurled
forth the ponderous orb, the speedy messenger and glorious ruin of
hostile towns; who, raging like the final all-destroying fire, shot
bounding with desolating force, killing thousands of the _Asoors_ in his
rapid flight, burning and involving, like the lambent flame, and cutting
down all that would oppose him. Anon he climbeth the heavens, and now
again darteth into the field like a _Peesach_, to feast in blood.

"Now the dauntless _Asoors_ strive, with repeated strength, to crush the
_Soors_ with rocks and mountains, which, hurled in vast numbers into the
heavens, appeared like scattered clouds, and fell, with all the trees
thereon, in millions of fear-exciting torrents, striking {212} violently
against each other with a mighty noise; and in their fall the earth,
with all its fields and forests, is driven from its foundation: they
thunder furiously at each other as they roll along the field, and spend
their strength in mutual conflict.

"Now _Nar_, seeing the _Soors_ overwhelmed with fear, filled up the path
to Heaven with showers of golden-headed arrows, and split the mountain
summits with his unerring shafts; and the _Asoors_ finding themselves
again sore pressed by the _Soors_, precipitately flee; some rush
headlong into the briny waters of the ocean, and others hide themselves
within the bowels of the earth.

"The rage of the glorious _Chakra_, _Soodarsan_, which for a while burnt
like the oil-fed fire, now grew cool, and he retired into the heavens
from whence he came. And the _Soors_ having obtained the victory, the
mountain _Mandar_ was carried back to its former station with great
respect, whilst the waters also retired, filling the firmament and the
heavens with their dreadful roarings.

"The _Soors_ guarded the _Amreeta_ with great care, and rejoiced
exceedingly because of their success. And _Eendra_, with all his
immortal bands, gave the water of life into _Narayan_, to keep it for
their use."--MAHABHARAT.

Amrita, or Immortal, is, according to Sir William {213} Jones, the name
which the mythologists of Tibet apply to a celestial tree, bearing
ambrosial fruit, and adjoining to four vast rocks, from which as many
sacred rivers derive their several streams.
