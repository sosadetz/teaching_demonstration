you speak of your offic in my thought a littl too earli for i do not see whi a mind like your is not capabl of harbour and digest the whole mysteri of law as easili as parson hugh doe pippin which did not hinder him from hi poetic canari were i to studi physic or rather medicin again i feel it would not make the least differ in my poetri when the mind is in it infanc a bia is in realiti a bia but when we have acquir more strength a bia becom no bia everi depart of knowledg we see excel and calcul toward a great wholei am so convinc of thi that i am glad at not have given away my medic book

heat and fever and help by widen specul to eas the burden of the mysteri a thing which i begin to understand a littl and which weigh upon you in the most gloomi and true sentenc in your letter the differ of high sensat with and without knowledg appear to me thi in the latter case we are fall continu ten thousand fathom deep and be blown up again without wing and with all horror of a bareshould creaturein the former case our shoulder are fledg and we go through the same air and space without fear thi is run one rig on the score of abstract benefitwhen we come to human life and the affect it is imposs to know how a parallel of breast and head can be drawn you will forgiv me for thu privat tread out of my depth and take it for tread as schoolboy tread the water it is imposs to know how far knowledg will consol us for the death of a friend and the ill that flesh is heir to with respect to the affect and poetri you must know by a sympathi my thought that way and i daresay these few line will be but a ratif i wrote them on maydayand intend to finish the ode all in good time mother of herm and still youth maia may i sing to thee as thou wast hymn on the shore of baiæ or may i woo thee in earlier sicilian or thi smile seek as they onc were sought in grecian isl by bard who die content on pleasant sward leav great vers unto a littl clan o give me their old vigour and unheard save of the quiet primros and the span of heaven and few ear round by thee my song should die away content as their rich in the simpl worship of a day you may perhap be anxiou to know for fact to what sentenc in your letter i allud you say i fear there is littl chanc of anyth els in thi lifey seem by that to have been go through with a more pain and acut zest the same labyrinth that i havei have come to the same conclus thu far my branch out therefrom have been numer one of them is the consider of wordsworth geniu and as a help in the manner of gold be the meridian line of worldli wealth how he differ from milton and here i have noth but surmis from an uncertainti whether milton appar less anxieti for human proce from hi see further or not than wordsworth and whether wordsworth ha in truth epic passion and martyr himself to the human heart the main region of hi song in regard to hi geniu alonew find what he say true as far as we have experienc and we can judg no further but by larger experiencefor axiom in philosophi are not axiom until they are prove upon our puls we read fine thing but never feel them to the full until we have gone the same step as the authori know thi is not plain you will know exactli my mean when i say that now i shall relish hamlet more than i ever have doneor bettery are sensibl no man can set down veneri as a bestial or joyless thing until he is sick of it and therefor all philosophis on it would be mere word until we are sick we understand not in fine as byron say knowledg is sorrow and i go on to say that sorrow is wisdomand further for aught we

nest or on the wingand to be more explicit and to show you how tall i stand by the giant i will put down a simil of human life as far as i now perceiv it that is to the point to which i say we both have arriv atwelli compar human life to a larg mansion of mani apart two of which i can onli describ the door of the rest be as yet shut upon meth first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless chamber in which we remain as long as we do not thinkw remain there a long while and notwithstand the door of the second chamber remain wide open show a bright appear we care not to hasten to it but are at length impercept impel by the awaken of the think principl within usw no sooner get into the second chamber which i shall call the chamber of maidenthought than we becom intox with the light and the atmospher we see noth but pleasant wonder and think of delay there for ever in delight howev among the effect thi breath is father of is that tremend one of sharpen one vision into the heart and natur of manof convinc one nerv that the world is full of miseri and heartbreak pain sick and oppressionwherebi thi chamber of maiden thought becom gradual darken and at the same time on all side of it mani door are set openbut all darkal lead to dark passagesw see not the balanc of good and evilw are in a mistw are now in that statew feel the burden of the mysteri to thi point wa wordsworth come as far as i can conceiv when he wrote tintern abbey and it seem to me that hi geniu is explor of those dark passag now if we live and go on think we too shall explor themh is a geniu and superior to us in so far as he can more than we make discoveri and shed a light in themher i must think wordsworth is deeper than milton though i think it ha depend more upon the gener and gregari advanc of intellect than individu great of mindfrom the paradis lost and the other work of milton i hope it is not too presum even between ourselv to say that hi philosophi human and divin may be toler understood by one not much advanc in year in hi time englishmen were just emancip from a great superstit and men had got hold of certain point and restingplac in reason which were too newli born to be doubt and too much oppos by the mass of europ not to be thought ether and authent divinewho could gainsay hi idea on virtu vice and chastiti in comu just at the time of the dismiss of a hundr disgrac who would not rest satisfi with hi hint at good and evil in the paradis lost when just free from the inquisit and burn in smithfield the reform produc such immedi and great benefit that protestant wa consid under the immedi eye of heaven and it own remain dogma and superstit then as it were regener constitut those restingplac and seem sure point of reasoningfrom that i have mention milton whatev he may have thought in the sequel appear to have been content with these by hi writingsh did not think into the human heart as wordsworth ha doneyet milton as a philosoph had sure as great power as wordsworthwhat is then to be infer o mani thingsit prove there is realli a grand march of intellectit prove that a mighti provid subdu the mightiest mind to the servic of the time be whether it be in

down stair call her genteel interest and a thousand other pretti thing to which i gave no heed not be partial to day wondersnow all is complet changedthey hate her and from what i hear she is not without faultsof a real kind but she ha other which are more apt to make women of inferior charm hate her she is not a cleopatra but she is at least a charmian she ha a rich eastern look she ha fine eye and fine manner when she come into a room she make an impress the same as the beauti of a leopardess she is too fine and too consciou of herself to repuls ani man who may address herfrom habit she think that noth particular i alway find myself more at eas with such a woman the pictur befor me alway give me a life and anim which i can not possibl feel with anyth inferior i am at such time too

richard woodhous hampstead octob my dear woodhouseyour letter gave me great satisfact more on account of it friendli than ani relish of that matter in it which is account so accept to the genu irritabil the best answer i can give you is in a clerklik manner to make some observ on two princip point which seem to point like indic into the midst of the whole pro and con about geniu and view and achiev and ambit et cæterast as to the poetic charact itself i mean that sort of which if i am anyth i am a member that sort distinguish from the wordsworthian or egotist sublim which is a thing per se and stand alon it is not itselfit ha no selfit is everyth and nothingit ha no characterit enjoy light and shade it live in gusto be it foul or fair high or low rich or poor mean or elevatedit ha as much delight in conceiv an iago as an imogen what shock the virtuou philosoph delight the chameleon poet it doe no harm from it relish of the dark side of thing ani more than from it tast for the bright one becaus they both end in specul a poet is the most unpoet of anyth in exist becaus he ha no identityh is continu in for and fill some other bodi the sunth moonth sea and men and women who are creatur of impuls are poetic and have about them an unchang attribut the poet ha none no identityh is certainli the most unpoet of all god creaturesif then he ha no self and if i am a poet where is the wonder that i should say i would write no more might i not at that veri instant have been cogit on the charact of saturn and op it is a wretch thing to confess but it is a veri fact that not one word i ever utter can be taken for grant as an opinion grow out of my ident naturehow can it when i have no natur when i am in a room with peopl if i ever am free from specul on creation of my own brain then not myself goe home to myself but the ident of everi one in the room begin to press upon me so that i am in a veri littl time annihilatednot onli among men it would be the same in a nurseri of children i know not whether i make myself wholli understood i hope enough so to let you see that no depend is to be place on what i said that day in the d place i will speak of my view and of the life i purpos to myself i am ambiti of do the world some good if i should be spare that may be the work of matur yearsin the interv i will assay to reach to as high a summit in poetri as the nerv bestow upon me will suffer the faint concept i have of poem to come bring the blood frequent into my foreheadal i hope is that i may not lose all interest in human affairsthat the solitari indiffer i feel for applaus even from the finest spirit will not blunt ani acut of vision i may have i do not think it will i feel assur i should write from the mere yearn and fond i have for the beauti even if my night labour should be burnt everi morn and no eye ever shine upon them but even now i am perhap not speak from myself but from some charact in whose soul i now live i am sure howev

that hazlitt ha slander shakspear in say that he had a lean to the arbitrari side of the question hazlitt thu defend himself my word are coriolanu is a storehous of polit commonplac the argument for and against aristocraci and democraci on the privileg of the few and the claim of the mani on liberti and slaveri power and the abus of it peac and war are here veri abli handl with the spirit of a poet and the acut of a philosoph shakspear himself seem to have had a lean to the arbitrari side of the question perhap from some feel of contempt for hi own origin and to have spare no occas of bate the rabbl what he say of them is veri true what he say of their better is also veri true though he dwell less upon it i then proceed to account for thi by show how it is that the caus of the peopl is but littl calcul for a subject for poetri or that the languag of poetri natur fall in with the languag of power i affirm sir that poetri that the imagin gener speak delight in power in strong excit as well as in truth in good in right wherea pure reason and the moral sens approv onli of the true and good i proceed to show that thi gener love or tendenc to immedi excit or theatric effect no matter how produc give a bia to the imagin often consist with the greatest good that in poetri it triumph over principl and bribe the passion to make a sacrific of common human you say that it doe not that there is no such origin sin in poetri that it make no such sacrific or unworthi compromis between poetic effect and the still small voic of reason and how do you prove that there is no such principl give a bia to the imagin and a fals colour to poetri whi by ask in repli to the instanc where thi principl oper and where no other can with much modesti and simplicitybut are these the onli topic that afford delight in poetri etc no but these object do afford delight in poetri and they afford it in proport to their strong and often tragic effect and not in proport to the good produc or their desir in a moral point of view do we read with more pleasur of the ravag of a beast of prey than of the shepherd pipe upon the mountain no but we do read with pleasur of the ravag of a beast of prey and we do so on the principl i have state name from the sens of power abstract from the sens of good and it is the same principl that make us read with admir and reconcil us in fact to the triumphant progress of the conqueror and mighti hunter of mankind who come to stop the shepherd pipe upon the mountain and sweep away hi listen flock do you mean to deni that there is anyth impos to the imagin in power in grandeur in outward show in the accumul of individu wealth and luxuri at the expens of equal justic and the common weal do you deni that there is anyth in the pride pomp and circumst of gloriou war that make ambit virtu in the eye of admir multitud is thi a new theori of the pleasur of the imagin which say that the pleasur of the imagin do not take rise sole in the calcul of the understand is it a paradox of my creat that one murder make a villain million a hero or is it not true that here as in other case the enorm of the evil overpow and make a convert of the imagin by it veri magnitud you contradict my reason becaus you know noth of the question and you think that no one ha a right to understand what you do not my offenc against puriti in the passag allud to which contain the concentr venom of my malign is that i have admit that there are tyrant and slave abroad in the world and you would hush the matter up and pretend that there is no such thing in order that there may be noth els further i have explain the caus the subtl sophistri of the human mind that toler and pamper the evil in order to guard against it approach you would conceal the caus in order to prevent the cure and to leav the proud flesh about the heart to harden and ossifi into one impenetr mass of selfish and hypocrisi that we may not sympathis in the distress of suffer virtu in ani case in which they come in competit with the fictiti want and imput weak of the great you ask are we gratifi by the cruelti of domitian or nero no not wethey were too petti and cowardli to strike the

as itself no more can man be happi in spite the worldli element will prey upon hi natur the common cognomen of thi world among the misguid and superstiti is a vale of tear from which we are to be redeem by a certain arbitrari interposit of god and taken to heavenwhat a littl circumscrib straighten notion call the world if you pleas the vale of soulmak then you will find out the use of the world i am speak now in the highest term for human natur admit it to be immort which i will here take for grant for the purpos of show a thought which ha struck me concern it i say soulmakingsoul as distinguish from an intellig there may be intellig or spark of the divin in millionsbut they are not soul till they acquir ident till each one is person itself intellig are atom of perceptionthey know and they see and they are pure in short they are godhow then are soul to be made how then are these spark which are god to have ident given themso as ever to possess a bliss peculiar to each one individu exist how but by the medium of a world like thi thi point i sincer wish to consid becaus i think it a grander system of salvat than the christian religionor rather it is a system of spiritcreationthi is effect by three grand materi act the one upon the other for a seri of yearsthes three materi are the intelligenceth human heart as distinguish from intellig or mind and the world or element space suit for the proper action of mind and heart on each other for the purpos of form the soul or intellig destin to possess the sens of ident i can scarc express what i but dimli perceiveand yet i think i perceiv itthat you may judg the more clearli i will put it in the most home form possibl i will call the world a school institut for the purpos of teach littl children to readi will call the human heart the horn book use in that schooland i will call the child abl to read the soul made from that school and it horn book do you not see how necessari a world of pain and troubl is to school an intellig and make it a soul a place where the heart must feel and suffer in a thousand divers way not mere is the heart a hornbook it is the mind bibl it is the mind experi it is the text from which the mind or intellig suck it ident as variou as the live of men areso variou becom their soul and thu doe god make individu be soul ident soul of the spark of hi own essenc thi appear to me a faint sketch of a system of salvat which doe not offend our reason and humanityi am convinc that mani difficulti which christian labour under would vanish befor itther is one which even now strike meth salvat of children in them the spark or intellig return to god without ani identityit have had no time to learn of and be alter by the heartor seat of the human passion it is pretti gener suspect that the christian scheme ha been copi from the ancient persian and greek philosoph whi may they not have made thi simpl thing even more simpl for common apprehens by introduc mediat and personag in the same manner as in the heathen mytholog abstract are personifi serious i think it probabl that thi system of soulmak may have been the parent of all the more palpabl and person scheme of redempt among the zoroastrian the christian and the hindoo for as one part of the human speci must have their carv jupit so anoth part must have the palpabl and name mediat and saviour their christ their oroman and their vishnu if what i have said should not be plain enough as i fear it may not be i will put you in the place where i began in thi seri of thoughtsi mean i began by see how man wa form by circumstancesand what are circumst but touchston of hi heart and what are touchston but prove of hi heart but fortifi or alter of hi natur and what is hi alter natur but hi souland what wa hi soul befor it came into the world and had these prove and alter and perfectioningsan intellig without identityand how is thi ident to be made through the medium of the heart and how is the heart to becom thi medium but in a world of circumst there now i think what with poetri and theolog you may thank your star that my pen is not veri longwind yesterday i receiv two letter from your mother and henri which i shall send by young birkbeck with thi friday april brown ha been here rummag up some of my old sinsthat is to say sonnet i do not think you rememb them so i will copi them out as well as

should pluck herself or the ripe plum finger it misti bloom as if a clear lake meddl with itself should cloud it clear with a muddi gloom but the rose leav herself upon the briar for wind to kiss and grate bee to feed and the ripe plum still wear it dim attir the undisturb lake ha crystal space whi then should man teas the world for grace spoil hi salvat by a fierc miscre anoth on fame fame like a

england for two or three centuri subject of great popular interest on the carpet so that howev great the uproar one can scarc propheci ani materi chang in the govern for as loud disturb have agit the countri mani time all civilis countri becom gradual more enlighten and there should be a continu chang for the better look at thi countri at present and rememb it when it wa even thought impiou to doubt the justic of a trial by combat from that time there ha been a gradual chang three great chang have been in progress first for the better next for the wors and a third for the better onc more the first wa the gradual annihil of the tyranni of the nobl when king found it their interest to concili the common peopl elev them and be just to them just when baroni power ceas and befor stand armi were so danger tax were few king were lift by the peopl over the head of their nobl and those peopl held a rod over king the chang for the wors in europ wa again thi the oblig of king to the multitud began to be forgotten custom had made noblemen the humbl servant of king then king turn to the nobl as the adorn of their power the slave of it and from the peopl as creatur continu endeavour to check them then in everi kingdom there wa a long struggl of king to destroy all popular privileg the english were the onli peopl in europ who made a grand kick at thi they were slave to henri viii but were freemen under william iii at the time the french were abject slave under loui xiv the exampl of england and the liber writer of franc and england sow the seed of opposit to thi tyranni and it wa swell in the ground till it burst out in the french revolut that ha had an unlucki termin it put a stop to the rapid progress of free sentiment in england and gave our court hope of turn back to the despot of the eighteenth centuri they have made a handl of thi event in everi way to undermin our freedom they spread a horrid superstit against all innov and improv the present struggl in england of the peopl is to destroy thi superstit what ha rous them to do it is their distress perhap on thi account the present distress of thi nation are a fortun thing though so horrid in their experi you will see i mean that the french revolut put a temporari stop to thi third changeth chang for the betternow it is in progress again and i think it is an effectu one thi is no contest between whig and tori but
