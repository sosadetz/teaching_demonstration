on examin we found on each side of the humid pathway dri land for the sole of the foot at length we arriv at a larg desert dark cavern which the lazzeroni assur us wa the sibyl cave we were suffici disappointedyet we examin it with care as if it blank rocki wall could still bear trace of celesti visit on one side wa a small open whither doe thi lead we ask can we enter herequesto poi nosaid the

there wa no direct passag lead us further but that it wa possibl to climb one side of the cavern to a low arch at top which promis a more easi path from whenc we now discov that thi light proceed with consider difficulti we scrambl up and came to anoth passag with still more of illumin and thi led to anoth ascent like the former after a success of these which our resolut alon permit us to surmount we arriv at a wide cavern with an arch domelik roof an apertur in the midst let in the light of heaven but thi wa overgrown with brambl and underwood which act as a veil obscur the day and give a
