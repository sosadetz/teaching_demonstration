bank glossari poem and song of robert burn prefac robert burn wa born near ayr scotland th of januari he wa the son of william burn or bur at the time of the poet birth a nurseryman on the bank of the doon in ayrshir hi father though alway extrem poor attempt to give hi children a fair educ and robert who wa the eldest went to school for three year in a neighbor villag and later for shorter period to three other school in the vicin but it wa to hi father and to hi own read that he owe the more import part of hi educ and by the time that he had reach manhood he had a good knowledg of english a read knowledg of french and a fairli wide acquaint with the masterpiec of english literatur from the time of shakespear to hi own day in william bur rent on borrow money the farm of mount oliph and in take hi share in the effort to make thi undertak succeed the futur poet seem to have serious overstrain hi physiqu in the famili move to lochlea and burn went to the neighbor town of irvin to learn flaxdress the onli result of thi experi howev wa the format of an acquaint with a dissip sailor whom he afterward blame as the prompter of hi first licenti adventur hi father die in and with hi brother gilbert the poet rent the farm of mossgiel but thi ventur wa as unsuccess as the other he had meantim form an irregular intimaci with jean armour for which he wa censur by the kirksess as a result of hi farm misfortun and the attempt of hi fatherinlaw to overthrow hi irregular marriag with jean he resolv to emigr and in order to rais money for the passag he publish kilmarnock a volum of the poem which he had been compos from time to time for some year thi volum wa unexpectedli success so that instead of sail for the west indi he went up to edinburgh and dure that winter he wa the chief literari celebr of the season an enlarg edit of hi poem wa publish there in and the money deriv from thi enabl him to aid hi brother in mossgiel and to take and stock for himself the farm of ellisland in dumfriesshir hi fame as poet had reconcil the armour to the connect and have now regularli marri jean he brought her to ellisland and onc more tri farm for three year continu illsuccess howev led him in to abandon ellisland and he move to dumfri where he had obtain a posit in the excis but he wa now thoroughli discourag hi work wa mere drudgeri hi tendenc to take hi relax in debaucheri increas the weak of a constitut earli undermin and he die at dumfri in hi thirtyeighth year see burn birthplac the live room in the burn birthplac cottag it is not necessari here to attempt to disentangl or explain away the numer amour in which he wa engag through the greater part of hi life it is evid that burn wa a man of extrem passion natur and fond of convivi and the misfortun of hi lot combin with hi natur tendenc to drive him to frequent excess of selfindulg he wa often remors and he strove pain if intermitt after better thing but the stori of hi life must be admit to be in it extern a pain and somewhat sordid chronicl that it contain howev mani moment of joy and exalt is prove by the poem here print burn poetri fall into two main group english and scottish hi english poem are for the most part inferior specimen of convent eighteenthcenturi vers but in scottish poetri he achiev triumph of a quit extraordinari kind sinc the time of the reform and the union of the crown of england and scotland the scot dialect had larg fallen into disus as a medium for dignifi write shortli befor burn time howev allan ramsay and robert fergusson had been the lead figur in a reviv of the vernacular and burn receiv from them a nation tradit which he succeed in carri to it highest pitch becom therebi to an almost uniqu degre the poet of hi peopl he first show complet masteri of vers in the field of satir in the twa herd holi willi prayer address to the unco guid the holi fair and other he manifest sympathi with the protest of the socal new light parti which had sprung up in opposit to the extrem calvin and intoler of the domin auld licht the fact that burn had person suffer from the disciplin of the kirk probabl ad fire to hi attack but the satir show more than person animu the forc of the invect the keen of the wit and the fervor of the imagin which they display render them an import forc in the theolog liber of scotland the kilmarnock volum contain besid satir a number of poem like the twa dog and the cotter saturday night which are vividli descript of the scot peasant life with which he wa most familiar and a group like puir maili and to a mous which in the tender of their treatment of anim reveal one of the most attract side of burn person mani of hi poem were never print dure hi lifetim the most remark of these be the jolli beggar a piec in which by the intens of hi imagin sympathi and the brillianc of hi techniqu he render a pictur of the lowest dreg of societi in such a way as to rais it into the realm of great poetri but the real nation import of burn is due chiefli to hi song the puritan auster of the centuri follow the reform had discourag secular music like other form of art in scotland and as a result scottish song had becom hopelessli degrad in point both of decenc and literari qualiti from youth burn had been interest in collect the fragment he had heard sung or found print and he came to regard the rescu of thi almost lost nation inherit in the light of a vocat about hi songmak two point are especi noteworthi first that the greater number of hi lyric sprang from actual emot experi second that almost all were compos to old melodi while in edinburgh he undertook to suppli materi for johnson music museum and as few of the tradit song could appear in a respect collect burn found it necessari to make them over sometim he kept a stanza or two sometim onli a line or choru sometim mere the name of the air the rest wa hi own hi method as he ha told us himself wa to becom familiar with the tradit melodi to catch a suggest from some fragment of the old song to fix upon an idea or situat for the new poem then hum or whistl the tune as he went about hi work he wrought out the new vers go into the hous to write them down when the inspir began to flag in thi process is to be found the explan of much of the peculiar qualiti of the song of burn scarc ani known author ha succeed so brilliantli in combin hi work with folk materi or in carri on with such continu of spirit the tradit of popular song for georg thomson collect of scottish air he perform a function similar to that which he had had in the museum and hi poetic activ dure the last eight or nine year of hi life wa chiefli devot to these two public in spite of the fact that he wa constantli in sever financi strait he refus to accept ani recompens for thi work prefer to regard it as a patriot servic and it wa inde a patriot servic of no small magnitud by birth and tempera he wa singularli fit for the task and thi fit is prove by the uniqu extent to which hi product were accept by hi countrymen and have pass into the life and feel of hi race songhandsom nell tunei am a man unmarri footnot the first of my performancesr b onc i lovd a boni lass ay
