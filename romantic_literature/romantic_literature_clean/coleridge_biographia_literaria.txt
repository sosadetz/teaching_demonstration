which had predomin from the last centuri i wa not blind to the merit of thi school yet as from inexperi of the world and consequ want of sympathi with the gener subject of these poem they gave me littl pleasur i doubtless undervalu the kind and with the presumpt of youth withheld from it master the legitim name of poet i saw that the excel of thi kind consist in just and acut observ on men and manner in an artifici state of societi as it matter and substanc and in the logic of wit convey in smooth and strong epigrammat couplet as it form that even when the subject wa address to the fanci or

look for at the end of each second line and the whole wa as it were a sorit or if i may exchang a logic for a grammat metaphor a conjunct disjunct of epigram meantim the matter and diction seem to me character not so much by poetic thought as by thought translat into the languag of poetri on thi last point i had occas to render my own thought gradual more and more plain to myself by frequent amic

put or not put a small capit both in thi and in mani other passag of the same poet whether the word should be personif or mere abstract i mention thi becaus in refer variou line in gray to their origin in shakespear and milton and in the clear percept how complet all the proprieti wa lost in the transfer i wa at that earli period led to a conjectur which mani year afterward wa recal to me from the same thought have been start in convers but far more abli and develop more fulli by mr wordsworthnam that thi style of poetri which i have character abov as translat of prose thought into poetic languag had been kept up by if it did not wholli aris from the custom of write latin vers and the great import attach to these exercis in our public school whatev might have been the case in the fifteenth centuri when the use of the latin tongu wa so gener among learn men that erasmu is said to have forgotten hi nativ languag yet in the present day it is not to be suppos that a youth can think in latin or that he can have ani other relianc on the forc or fit of hi phrase but the author of the writer from whom he ha adopt them consequ he must first prepar hi thought and then pick out from virgil horac ovid or perhap more compendi from hi gradu halv and quarter of line in which to embodi them i never object to a certain degre of disputati in a young man from the age of seventeen to

nor vulgar neither redol of the lamp nor of the kennel such as i will rememb thee instead of the same thought trick up in the ragfair fineri of thi imag on her wing befor my fanci eye shall memori bring i had continu to adduc the metr and diction of the greek poet from homer to theocritu inclus and still more of our elder english poet from chaucer to milton nor wa thi all but as it wa my constant repli to author brought against me from later poet of great name that no author could avail in opposit to truth natur logic and the law of univers grammar actuat too by my former passion for metaphys investig i labour at a solid foundat on which perman to ground my opinion in the compon faculti of the human mind itself and their compar digniti and import accord to the faculti or sourc from which the pleasur given by ani poem or passag wa deriv i estim the merit of such poem or passag as the result of all my read and medit i abstract two critic aphor deem them to compris the condit and criteria of poetic stylefirst that not the poem which we have read but that to which we return with the greatest pleasur possess the genuin power and claim the name of essenti poetrysecondli that whatev line can be translat into other word of the same languag without diminut of their signific either in sens or associ or in ani worthi feel are so far viciou in their diction be it howev observ that i exclud from the list of worthi feel the pleasur deriv from mere novelti in the reader and the desir of excit wonder at hi power in the author oftentim sinc then in pursu french tragedi i have fanci two mark of admir at the end of each line as hieroglyph of the author own admir at hi own clever our genuin admir of a great poet is a continu undercurr of feel it is everywher present but seldom anywher as a separ excit i wa wont boldli to affirm that it would be scarc more difficult to push a stone out from the pyramid with the bare hand than to alter a word or the posit of a word in milton or shakespear in their most import work at least without make the poet say someth els or someth wors than he doe say one great distinct i appear to myself to see plainli between even the characterist fault of our elder poet and the fals beauti of the modern in the former from donn to cowley we find the most fantast outoftheway thought but in the most pure and genuin mother english in the latter the most obviou thought in languag the most fantast and arbitrari our faulti elder poet sacrif the passion and passion flow of poetri to the subtleti of intellect and to the star of wit the modern to the glare and glitter of a perpetu yet broken and heterogen imageri or rather to an amphibi someth made up half of imag and half of abstract mean the one sacrif the heart to the head the other both heart and head to point and draperi the reader must make himself acquaint with the gener style of composit that wa at that time deem poetri in order to understand and account for the effect produc on me by the sonnet the monodi at matlock and the hope of mr bowl for it is peculiar to origin geniu to becom less and less strike in proport to it success in improv the tast and judgment of it contemporari the poem of west inde had the merit of chast and manli diction but they were cold and if i may so express it onli deadcolour while in the best of warton there is a stiff which too often give them the appear of imit from the greek whatev relat therefor of caus or impuls perci collect of ballad may bear to the most popular poem of the present day yet in a more sustain and elev style of the then live poet cowper and bowl were to the best of my knowledg the first who combin natur thought with natur diction the first who reconcil the heart with the head it is true as i have befor mention that from diffid in my own power i for a short time adopt a labori and florid diction which i myself deem if not absolut viciou yet of veri inferior worth gradual howev my practic conform to my better judgment and the composit of my twentyfourth and twentyfifth yearsfor exampl the shorter blank vers poem the line which now form the middl and conclus of the poem entitl the destini of nation and the tragedi of remorsear not more below my present ideal in respect of the gener tissu of the style than those of the latest date their fault were at least a remnant of the former leaven and among the mani who have done me the honour of put my poem in the same class with those of my better the one or two who have pretend to bring exampl of affect simplic from my volum have been abl to adduc but one instanc and that out of a copi of vers half ludicr half splenet which i intend and had myself character as sermoni propiora everi reform howev necessari will by weak mind be carri to an

former and affirm the latter we must bewild ourselv whenev we would pierc into the adyta of causat and all that labori conjectur can do is to fill up the gap of fanci under that despot of the eye the

the oscil a propag itself so as to reproduc the oscil m but the origin impress from m wa essenti differ from the impress a unless therefor differ caus may produc the same effect the vibrat a could never produc the vibrat m and thi therefor could never be the mean by which a and m are associ to understand thi the attent reader need onli be remind that the idea are themselv in hartley system noth more than their appropri configur vibrat it is a mere delus of the fanci to conceiv the preexist of the idea in ani chain of associ as so mani differ colour billiardbal in contact so that when an

constitut the white ball to constitut the red or black or the idea of a circl to constitut the idea of a triangl which is imposs but it may be said that by the sensat from the object a and m the nerv have acquir a disposit to the vibrat a and m and therefor a need onli be repeat in order to reproduc m now we will grant for a moment the possibl of such a disposit in a materi nerv which yet seem scarc less absurd than to say that a weathercock had acquir a habit of turn to the east from the wind have been so long in that quarter for if it be repli that we must take in the circumst of life

a law of matter at least of phaenomena consid as materi at the utmost it is to thought the same as the law of gravit is to locomot in everi voluntari movement we first counteract gravit in order to

the gravit power by an act pure voluntari and then by anoth act voluntari in part we yield to it in order to alight on the spot which we had previous propos to ourselv now let a man watch hi mind while he is compos or to take a still more common case while he is tri to recollect a name and he will find the process complet analog most of my reader will have observ a small waterinsect on the

think there are evid two power at work which rel to each other are activ and passiv and thi is not possibl without an intermedi faculti which is at onc both activ and passiv in philosoph languag we must denomin thi intermedi faculti in all it degre and determin the imagin but in common languag and especi on the subject of poetri we appropri the name to a superior degre of the faculti join to a superior voluntari control over it contemporan then be the common condit of all the law of associ and a compon element in the materia subjecta the part of which are to be associ must need be copres with all noth therefor can be more easi than to pass off on an incauti mind thi constant companion of each for the essenti substanc of all but if we appeal to our own conscious we shall find that even time itself as the caus of a particular act of associ is distinct from contemporan as the condit of all associ see a mackerel it may happen that i immedi think of gooseberri becaus i at the same time ate mackerel with gooseberri as the sauc the first syllabl of the latter word be that which had coexist with the imag of the bird so call i may then think of a goos in the next moment the imag of a swan may aris befor me though i had never seen the two bird togeth in the first two instanc i am consciou that their coexist in time wa the circumst that enabl me to recollect them and equal consciou am i that the latter wa recal to me by the joint oper of like and contrast so it is with caus and effect so too with order so i am abl to distinguish whether it wa proxim in time or continu in space that occas me to recal b on the mention of a they can not be inde separ from contemporan for that would be to separ them from the mind itself the act of conscious is inde ident with time consid in it essenc i mean time per se as contradistinguish from our notion of time for thi is alway blend with the idea of space which as the opposit of time is therefor it measur nevertheless the accid of see two object at the same moment and the accid of see them in the same place are two distinct or distinguish caus and the true practic gener law of associ is thi that whatev make certain part of a total impress more vivid or distinct than the rest will determin the mind to recal these in prefer to other equal link togeth by the common condit of contemporan or what i deem a more appropri and philosoph term of continu but the will itself by confin and intensifi the attent may arbitrarili give vivid or distinct to ani object whatsoev and from henc we may deduc the useless if not the absurd of certain

from de cartess anim machin wa in it common interpret too strang to surviv the inventortoo repugn to our common sens which is not inde entitl to a judici voic in the court of scientif philosophi but whose whisper still exert a strong secret influenc even wolf the admir and illustri systemat of the leibnitzian doctrin content himself with defend the possibl of the idea but doe not adopt it as a

power of multipli attribut by occult qualiti besid it answer no purpos unless inde a difficulti can be solv by multipli it or we can acquir a clearer notion of our soul by be told that we have a

vessel but all the water abov it is clear and transpar the hylozoist onli shake it up and render the whole turbid but it is not either the natur of man or the duti of the philosoph to despair concern

perform what it promis but how ani affect from without can metamorphos itself into percept or will the materialist ha hitherto left not onli as incomprehens as he found it but ha aggrav it into a comprehens absurd for grant that an object from without could act upon the consciou self as on a consubstanti object yet such an affect could onli engend someth homogen with itself motion could onli propag motion matter ha no inward we remov one surfac but to meet with anoth we can but divid a particl into particl and each atom comprehend in itself the properti of the materi univers let ani

of the bell now in our immedi percept it is not the mere power or act of the object but the object itself which is immedi present we might inde attempt to explain thi result by a chain of deduct and conclus but that first the veri faculti of deduc and conclud would equal demand an explan and secondli that there exist in fact no such intermedi by logic notion such as those of caus and effect it is the object itself not the product of a syllog which is present to our conscious or would we explain thi supervent of the object to the sensat by a product faculti set in motion by an impuls still the transit into the percipi of the object itself from which the impuls proceed assum a power that can permeat and wholli possess the soul and like a god by spiritu art be all in all and all in everi part and how came the percipi here and what is becom of the wonder promis matter that wa to perform all these marvel by forc of mere figur weight and motion the most consist proceed of the dogmat materialist is to fall back into the common rank of souland bodyist to affect the mysteri and declar the whole process a revel given and not to be understood which it would be profan to examin too close datur non intelligitur but a revel unconfirm by miracl and a faith not command by the conscienc a philosoph may ventur to pass by without suspect himself of ani irreligi tendenc thu as materi ha been gener taught it is utterli unintellig and owe all it proselyt to the propens so common among men to mistak distinct imag for clear concept and vice versa to reject as inconceiv whatev from it own natur is unimagin but as soon as it becom intellig it ceas to be materi in order to explain think as a materi phaenomenon it is necessari to refin matter into a mere modif of intellig with the twofold function of appear and perceiv even so did priestley in hi controversi with price he strip matter of all it materi properti substitut spiritu power and when we expect to find a bodi behold we had noth

separ from the phaenomenon or imag in my percept i saw that in the natur of thing such proof is imposs and that of all mode of be that are not object of the sens the exist is assum by a logic necess

with spinoza though my whole heart remain with paul and john yet there had dawn upon me even befor i had met with the critiqu of the pure reason a certain guid light if the mere intellect could make no certain discoveri of a holi and intellig first caus it might yet suppli a demonstr that no legitim argument could be drawn from the intellect against it truth and what is thi more than st paul assert that by wisdommor properli translat by the power of reasoningno man ever arriv at the knowledg of god what more than the sublimest and probabl the oldest book on earth ha taught us silver and gold man searcheth out bringeth the ore out of the earth and dark into light but where findeth he wisdom where is the place of understand the abyss crieth it is not in me ocean echoeth back not in me

haud tibi spiro for these term do in truth includ all the difficulti which the human mind can propos for solut take them therefor in mass and unexamin it requir onli a decent apprenticeship in logic to draw forth their content in all form and colour as the professor of legerdemain at our villag fair pull out ribbon after ribbon from their mouth and not more difficult is it to reduc them back again to their differ genera but though thi analysi is highli use in render our knowledg more distinct it doe not realli add to it it doe not increas though it give us a greater masteri over the wealth which we befor possess for forens purpos for all the establish profess of societi thi is suffici but for philosophi in it highest sens as the scienc of ultim truth and therefor scientia scientiarum thi mere analysi of term is prepar onli though as a prepar disciplin indispens still less dare a favour perus be anticip from the proselyt of that compendi philosophi which talk of mind but think of brick and mortar or other imag equal abstract from bodi contriv a theori of spirit by nicknam matter and in a few hour can qualifi it dullest discipl to explain the omn scibil by reduc all thing to impress idea and sensat but it is time to tell the truth though it requir some courag to avow it in an age and countri in which disquisit on all subject not privileg to adopt technic term or scientif symbol must be address to the public i say then that it is neither possibl nor necessari for all men nor for mani to be philosoph there is a philosoph and inasmuch as it is actual by an effort of freedom an artifici conscious which lie beneath or as it were behind the spontan conscious natur to all reflect be as the elder roman distinguish their northern provinc into cisalpin and transalpin so may we divid all the object of human knowledg into those on thi side and those on the other side of the spontan conscious citra et tran conscientiam communem the latter is exclus the domain of pure philosophi which is therefor properli entitl transcendent in order to discrimin it at onc both from mere reflect and represent on the one hand and on the other from those flight of lawless specul which abandon by all distinct conscious becaus transgress the bound and purpos of our intellectu faculti are justli condemn as transcend the first rang of hill that encircl the scanti vale of human life is the horizon for the major of it inhabit on it ridg the common sun is born and depart from them the star rise and touch them they vanish by the mani even thi rang the natur limit and bulwark of the vale is but imperfectli known it higher ascent are too often hidden by mist and cloud from uncultiv swamp which few have courag or curios to penetr to the multitud below these vapour appear now as the dark haunt of terrif agent on which none may intrud with impun and now all aglow with colour not their own they are gaze at as the splendid palac of happi and power but in all age there have been a few who measur and sound the river of the vale at the feet of their furthest inaccess fall have learn that the sourc must be far higher and far inward a few who even in the level stream have detect element which neither the vale itself nor the surround mountain contain or could suppli how and whenc to these thought these strong probabl the ascertain vision the intuit knowledg may final superven can be learnt onli by the fact i might oppos to the question the word with which plotinu suppos natur to answer a similar difficulti should ani one interrog her how she work if gracious she vouchsaf to listen and speak she will repli it behov thee not to disquiet me with interrogatori but to understand in silenc even as i am silent and work without word likewis in the fifth book of the fifth ennead speak of the highest and intuit knowledg as distinguish from the discurs or in the languag of wordsworth the vision and the faculti divin he say it is not law to inquir from whenc it sprang as if it were a thing subject to place and motion for it neither approach hither nor again depart from henc to some other place but it either appear to us or it doe not appear so that we ought not to pursu it with a view of detect it secret sourc but to watch in quiet till it suddenli shine upon us prepar ourselv for the bless spectacl as the eye wait patient for the rise sun they and they onli can acquir the philosoph imagin the sacr power of selfintuit who within themselv can interpret and understand the symbol that the wing of the airsylph are form within the skin of the caterpillar those onli who feel in their own spirit the same instinct which impel the chrysali of the horn fli to leav room in it involucrum for antenna yet to come they know and feel that the potenti work in them even as the actual work on them in short all the organ of sens are frame for a correspond world of sens and we have it all the organ of spirit are frame for a correspond world of spirit though the latter organ are not develop in all alik but they exist in all and their first appear disclos itself in the moral be how els could it be that even worldl not wholli debas will contempl the man of simpl and disinterest good with contradictori feel of piti and respect poor man he is not made for thi world oh herein they utter a propheci of univers fulfil for man must either rise or sink it is the essenti mark of the true philosoph to rest satisfi with no imperfect light as long as the imposs of attain a fuller knowledg ha not been demonstr that the common conscious itself will furnish proof by it own direct that it is connect with mastercurr below the surfac i shall mere assum as a postul pro tempor thi have been grant though but in expect of the argument i can safe deduc from it the equal truth of my former assert that philosophi can not be intellig to all even of the most learn and cultiv class a system the first principl of which it is to render the mind intuit of the spiritu in man ie of that which lie on the other side of our natur conscious must need have a great obscur for those who have never disciplin and strengthen thi ulterior conscious it must in truth be a land of dark a perfect antigoshen for men to whom the noblest treasur of their own be are report onli through the imperfect translat of lifeless and sightless motion perhap in great part through word which are but the shadow of notion even as the notion understand itself is but the shadowi abstract of live and actual truth on the immedi which dwell in everi man and on the origin intuit or absolut affirm of it which is likewis in everi man but doe not in everi man rise into conscious all the certainti of our knowledg depend and thi becom intellig to no man by the ministri of mere word from without the medium by which spirit understand each other is not the surround air but the freedom which they possess in common as the common ether element of their be the tremul reciproc of which propag themselv even to the inmost of the soul where the spirit of a man is not fill with the conscious of freedom were it onli from it restless as of one still struggl in bondag all spiritu intercours is interrupt not onli with other but even with himself no wonder then that he remain incomprehens to himself as well as to other no wonder that in the fear desert of hi conscious he weari himself out with empti word to which no friendli echo answer either from hi own heart or the heart of a fellow be or bewild himself in the pursuit of notion phantom the mere refract from unseen and distant truth through the distort medium of hi own unenliven and stagnant understand to remain unintellig to such a mind exclaim schell on a like occas is honour and a good name befor god and man the histori of philosophi the same writer observ contain instanc of system which for success gener have remain enigmat such he deem the system of leibnitz whom anoth writer rashli i think and invidi extol as the onli philosoph who wa himself deepli convinc of hi own doctrin as hitherto interpret howev they have not produc the effect which leibnitz himself in a most instruct passag describ as the criterion of a true philosophi name that it would at onc explain and collect the fragment of truth scatter through system appar the most incongru the truth say he is diffus more wide than is commonli believ but it is often paint yet often mask and is sometim mutil and sometim ala in close allianc with mischiev error the deeper howev we penetr into the ground of thing the more truth we discov in the doctrin of the greater number of the philosoph sect the want of substanti realiti in the object of the sens accord to the sceptic the harmoni or number the prototyp and idea to which the pythagorean and platonist reduc all thing the one and all of parmenid and plotinu without spinoz the necessari connect of thing accord to the stoic reconcil with the spontan of the other school the vitalphilosophi of the cabalist and hermetist who assum the univers of sensat the substanti form and entelechi of aristotl and the schoolmen togeth with the mechan solut of all particular phaenomena accord to democritu and the recent philosophersal these we shall find unit in one perspect central point which show regular and a coincid of all the part in the veri object which from everi other point of view must appear confus and distort the spirit of sectarian ha been hitherto our fault and the caus of our failur we have imprison our own concept by the line which we have drawn in order to exclud the concept of other jai trouv que la plupart de sect ont raison dan une bonn parti de ce quell avanc mai non pa tant en ce quell nient a system which aim to deduc the memori with all the other function of intellig must of cours place it first posit from beyond the memori and anterior to it otherwis the principl of solut would be itself a part of the problem to be solv such a posit therefor must in the first instanc be demand and the first question will be by what right is it demand on thi account i think it expedi to make some preliminari remark on the introduct of postul in philosophi the word postul is borrow from the scienc of mathemat in geometri the primari construct is not demonstr but postul thi first and most simpl construct in space is the point in motion or the line whether the point is move in one and the same direct or whether it direct is continu chang remain as yet undetermin but if the direct of the point have been determin it is either by a point without it and then there aris the straight line which inclos no space or the direct of the point is not determin by a point without it and then it must flow back again on itself that is there aris a cyclic line which doe enclos a space if the straight line be assum as the posit the cyclic is then the negat of the straight it is a line which at no point strike out into the straight but chang it direct continu but if the primari line be conceiv as undetermin and the straight line as determin throughout then the cyclic is the third compound of both it is at onc undetermin and determin undetermin through ani point without and determin through itself geometri therefor suppli philosophi with the exampl of a primari intuit from which everi scienc that lay claim to evid must take it commenc the mathematician doe not begin with a demonstr proposit but with an intuit a practic idea but here an import distinct present itself philosophi is employ on object of the inner sens and can not like geometri appropri to everi construct a correspond outward intuit nevertheless philosophi if it is to arriv at evid must proceed from the most origin construct and the question then is what is the most origin construct or first product act for the inner sens the answer to thi question depend on the direct which is given to the inner sens but in philosophi the inner sens can not have it direct determin by an outward object to the origin construct of the line i can be compel by a line drawn befor me on the slate or on sand the stroke thu drawn is inde not the line itself but onli the imag or pictur of the line it is not from it that we first learn to know the line but on the contrari we bring thi stroke to the origin line gener by the act of the imagin otherwis we could not defin it as without breadth or thick still howev thi stroke is the sensuou imag of the origin or ideal line and an effici mean to excit everi imagin to the intuit of it it is demand then whether there be found ani mean in philosophi to determin the direct of the inner sens as in mathemat it is determin by it specif imag or outward pictur now the inner sens ha it direct determin for the greater part onli by an act of freedom one man conscious extend onli to the pleasant or unpleas sensat caus in him by extern impress anoth enlarg hi inner sens to a conscious of form and quantiti a third in addit to the imag is consciou of the concept or notion of the thing a fourth attain to a notion of hi notionsh reflect on hi own reflect and thu we may say without improprieti that the one possess more or less inner sens than the other thi more or less betray alreadi that philosophi in it first principl must have a practic or moral as well as a theoret or specul side thi differ in degre doe not exist in the mathemat socrat in plato show that an ignor slave may be brought to understand and of himself to solv the most difficult geometr problem socrat drew the figur for the slave in the sand the discipl of the critic philosophi could likewis as wa inde actual done by la forg and some other follow of de cart repres the origin of our represent in copperpl but no one ha yet attempt it and it would be utterli useless to an esquimaux or new zealand our most popular philosophi would be wholli unintellig the sens the inward organ for it is not yet born in him so is there mani a one among us ye and some who think themselv philosoph too to whom the philosoph organ is entir want to such a man philosophi is a mere play of word and notion like a theori of music to the deaf or like the geometri of light to the blind the connect of the part and their logic depend may be seen and rememb but the whole is groundless and hollow unsustain by live contact unaccompani with ani realiz intuit which exist by and in the act that affirm it exist which is known becaus it is and is becaus it is known the word of plotinu in the assum person of natur hold true of the philosoph energi to theoroun mou theoraema poiei osper oi geometrai theorount graphousin all emon mae graphousa theorousa de uphistantai ai ton somaton grammai with me the act of contempl make the thing contempl as the geometrician contempl describ line correspond but i not describ line but simpli contempl the repres form of thing rise up into exist the postul of philosophi and at the same time the test of philosoph capac is no other than the heavendescend know thyself e coelo descendit gnothi seauton and thi at onc practic and specul for as philosophi is neither a scienc of the reason or understand onli nor mere a scienc of moral but the scienc of be altogeth it primari ground can be neither mere specul nor mere practic but both in one all knowledg rest on the coincid of an object with a subject my reader have been warn in a former chapter that for their conveni as well as the writer the term subject is use by me in it scholast sens as equival to mind or sentient be and as the necessari correl of object or quicquid objicitur menti for we can know that onli which is true and the truth is univers place in the coincid of the thought with the thing of the represent with the object repres now the sum of all that is mere object we will henceforth call natur confin the term to it passiv and materi sens as compris all the phaenomena by which it exist is made known to us on the other hand the sum of all that is subject we may comprehend in the name of the self or intellig both concept are in necessari antithesi intellig is conceiv of as exclus repres natur as exclus repres the one as consciou the other as without conscious now in all act of posit knowledg there is requir a reciproc concurr of both name of the consciou be and of that which is in itself unconsci our problem is to explain thi concurr it possibl and it necess dure the act of knowledg itself the object and subject are so instantli unit that we can not determin to which of the two the prioriti belong there is here no first and no second both are coinstantan and one while i am attempt to explain thi intim coalit i must suppos it dissolv i must necessarili set out from the one to which therefor i give hypothet anteced in order to arriv at the other but as there are but two factor or element in the problem subject and object and as it is left indetermin from which of them i should commenc there are two case equal possibl either the object is taken as the first and then we have to account for the supervent of the subject which coalesc with it the notion of the subject is not contain in the notion of the object on the contrari they mutual exclud each other the subject therefor must superven to the object the concept of natur doe not appar involv the copres of an intellig make an ideal duplic of it that is repres it thi desk for instanc would accord to our natur notion be though there should exist no sentient be to look at it thi then is the problem of natur philosophi it assum the object or unconsci natur as the first and as therefor to explain how intellig can superven to it or how itself can grow into intellig if it should appear that all enlighten naturalist without have distinctli propos the problem to themselv have yet constantli move in the line of it solut it must afford a strong presumpt that the problem itself is found in natur for if all knowledg ha as it were two pole reciproc requir and presuppos all scienc must proceed from the one or the other and must tend toward the opposit as far as the equatori point in which both are reconcil and becom ident the necessari tendenc therefor of all natur philosophi is from natur to intellig and thi and no other is the true ground and occas of the instinct strive to introduc theori into our view of natur phaenomena the highest perfect of natur philosophi would consist in the perfect spiritu of all the law of natur into law of intuit and intellect the phaenomena the materi most wholli disappear and the law alon the formal must remain thenc it come that in natur itself the more the principl of law break forth the more doe the husk drop off the phaenomena themselv becom more spiritu and at length ceas altogeth in our conscious the optic phaenomena are but a geometri the line of which are drawn by light and the materi of thi light itself ha alreadi becom matter of doubt in the appear of magnet all trace of matter is lost and of the phaenomena of gravit which not a few among the most illustri newtonian have declar no otherwis comprehens than as an immedi spiritu influenc there remain noth but it law the execut of which on a vast scale is the mechan of the heavenli motion the theori of natur philosophi would then be complet when all natur wa demonstr to be ident in essenc with that which in it highest known power exist in man as intellig and selfconsci when the heaven and the earth shall declar not onli the power of their maker but the glori and the presenc of their god even as he appear to the great prophet dure the vision of the mount in the skirt of hi divin thi may suffic to show that even natur scienc which commenc with the materi phaenomenon as the realiti and substanc of thing exist doe yet by the necess of theoriz unconsci and as it were instinct end in natur as an intellig and by thi tendenc the scienc of natur becom final natur philosophi the one of the two pole of fundament scienc or the subject is taken as the first and the problem then is how there superven to it a coincid object in the pursuit of these scienc our success in each depend on an auster and faith adher to it own principl with a care separ and exclus of those which appertain to the opposit scienc as the natur philosoph who direct hi view to the object avoid abov all thing the intermixtur of the subject in hi knowledg as for instanc arbitrari supposit or rather suflict occult qualiti spiritu agent and the substitut of final for effici caus so on the other hand the transcendent or intelligenti philosoph is equal anxiou to preclud all interpel of the object into the subject principl of hi scienc as for instanc the assumpt of impress or configur in the brain correspond to miniatur pictur on the retina paint by ray of light from suppos origin which are not the immedi and real object of vision but deduct from it for the purpos of explan thi purif of the mind is effect by an absolut and scientif sceptic to which the mind voluntarili determin itself for the specif purpos of futur certainti de cart who in hi medit himself first at least of the modern gave a beauti exampl of thi voluntari doubt thi selfdetermin indetermin happili express it utter differ from the sceptic of vaniti or irreligion nec tamen in sceptico imitabar qui dubit tantum ut dubit et praeter incertitudinem ipsam nihil quaerunt nam contra totu in eo eram ut aliquid certi reperirem nor is it less distinct in it motiv and final aim than in it proper object which are not as in ordinari sceptic the prejudic of educ and circumst but those origin and innat prejudic which natur herself ha plant in all men and which to all but the philosoph are the first principl of knowledg and the final test of truth now these essenti prejudic are all reduc to the one fundament presumpt that there exist thing without us as thi on the one hand origin neither in ground nor argument and yet on the other hand remain proof against all attempt to remov it by ground or argument naturam furca expella tamen usqu redibit on the one hand lay claim to immedi certainti as a posit at onc indemonstr and irresist and yet on the other hand inasmuch as it refer to someth essenti differ from ourselv nay even in opposit to ourselv leav it inconceiv how it could possibl becom a part of our immedi conscious in other word how that which ex hypothesi is and continu to be extrins and alien to our be should becom a modif of our be the philosoph therefor compel himself to treat thi faith as noth more than a prejudic innat inde and connatur but still a prejudic the other posit which not onli claim but necessit the admiss of it immedi certainti equal for the scientif reason of the philosoph as for the common sens of mankind at larg name i am can not so properli be entitl a prejudic it is groundless inde but then in the veri idea it preclud all ground and separ from the immedi conscious lose it whole sens and import it is groundless but onli becaus it is itself the ground of all other certainti now the appar contradict that the former posit name the exist of thing without us which from it natur can not be immedi certain should be receiv as blindli and as independ of all ground as the exist of our own be the transcendent philosoph can solv onli by the supposit that the former is unconsci involv in the latter that it is not onli coher but ident and one and the same thing with our own immedi self conscious to demonstr thi ident is the offic and object of hi philosophi if it be said that thi is ideal let it be rememb that it is onli so far ideal as it is at the same time and on that veri account the truest and most bind realism for wherein doe the realism of mankind properli consist in the assert that there exist a someth without them what or how or where they know not which occas the object of their percept oh no thi is neither connatur nor univers it is what a few have taught and learn in the school and which the mani repeat without ask themselv concern their own mean the realism common to all mankind is far elder and lie infinit deeper than thi hypothet explan of the origin of our percept an explan skim from the mere surfac of mechan philosophi it is the tabl itself which the man of common sens believ himself to see not the phantom of a tabl from which he may argument deduc the realiti of a tabl which he doe not see if to destroy the realiti of all that we actual behold be ideal what can be more egregi so than the system of modern metaphys which banish us to a land of shadow surround us with apparit and distinguish truth from illus onli by the major of those who dream the same dream i assert that the world wa mad exclaim poor lee and the world said that i wa mad and confound them they outvot me it is to the true and origin realism that i would direct the attent thi believ and requir neither more nor less than the object which it behold or present to itself is the real and veri object in thi sens howev much we may strive against it we are all collect born idealist and therefor and onli therefor are we at the same time realist but of thi the philosoph of the school know noth or despis the faith as the prejudic of the ignor vulgar becaus they live and move in a crowd of phrase and notion from which human natur ha long ago vanish oh ye that rever yourselv and walk humbl with the divin in your own heart ye are worthi of a better philosophi let the dead buri the dead but do you preserv your human natur the depth of which wa never yet fathom by a philosophi made up of notion and mere logic entiti in the third treatis of my logosophia announc at the end of thi volum i shall give deo volent the demonstr and construct of the dynam philosophi scientif arrang it is accord to my convict no other than the system of pythagora and of plato reviv and purifi from impur mixtur doctrina per tot manu tradita tandem in vappam desiit the scienc of arithmet furnish instanc that a rule may be use in practic applic and for the particular purpos may be suffici authent by the result befor it ha itself been fulli demonstr it is enough if onli it be render intellig thi will i trust have been effect in the follow these for those of my reader who are will to accompani me through the follow chapter in which the result will be appli to the deduct of the imagin and with it the principl of product and of genial critic in the fine art thesi i truth is correl to be knowledg without a correspond realiti is no knowledg if we know there must be somewhat known by us to know is in it veri essenc a verb activ thesi ii all truth is either mediat that is deriv from some other truth or truth or immedi and origin the latter is absolut and it formula a a the former is of depend or condit certainti and repres in the formula b a the certainti which adher in a is attribut to b scholium a chain without a stapl from which all the link deriv their stabil or a seri without a first ha been not inaptli allegor as a string of blind men each hold the skirt of the man befor him reach far out of sight but all move without the least deviat in one straight line it would be natur taken for grant that there wa a guid at the head of the file what if it were answer no sir the men are without number and infinit blind suppli the place of sight equal inconceiv is a cycl of equal truth without a common and central principl which prescrib to each it proper sphere in the system of scienc that the absurd doe not so immedi strike us that it doe not seem equal unimagin is owe to a surreptiti act of the imagin which instinct and without our notic the same not onli fill up the interven space and contempl the cycl of b c d e f etc as a continu circl a give to all collect the uniti of their common orbit but likewis suppli by a sort of subintelligitur the one central power which render the movement harmoni and cyclic thesi iii we are to seek therefor for some absolut truth capabl of commun to other posit a certainti which it ha not itself borrow a truth selfground uncondit and known by it own light in short we have to find a somewhat which is simpli becaus it is in order to be such it must be one which is it own predic so far at least that all other nomin predic must be mode and repetit of itself it exist too must be such as to preclud the possibl of requir a caus or anteced without an absurd thesi iv that there can be but one such principl may be prove a priori for were there two or more each must refer to some other by which it equal is affirm consequ neither would be selfestablish as the hypothesi demand and a posteriori it will be prove by the principl itself when it is discov as involv univers anteced in it veri concept scholium if we affirm of a board that it is blue the predic blue is accident and not impli in the subject board if we affirm of a circl that it is equiradi the predic inde is impli in the definit of the subject but the exist of the subject itself is conting and suppos both a caus and a percipi the same reason will appli to the indefinit number of suppos indemonstr truth exempt from the profan approach of philosoph investig by the amiabl beatti and other less eloqu and not more profound inaugur of common sens on the throne of philosophi a fruitless attempt were it onli that it is the twofold function of philosophi to reconcil reason with common sens and to elev common sens into reason thesi v such a principl can not be ani thing or object each thing is what it is in consequ of some other thing an infinit independ thing is no less a contradict than an infinit circl or a sideless triangl besid a thing is that which is capabl of be an object which itself is not the sole percipi but an object is inconceiv without a subject as it antithesi omn perceptum percipientem supponit but neither can the principl be found in a subject as a subject contradistinguish from an object for unicuiqu percipienti aliquid objicitur perceptum it is to be found therefor neither in object nor subject taken separ and consequ as no other third is conceiv it must be found in that which is neither subject nor object exclus but which is the ident of both thesi vi thi principl and so characteris manifest itself in the sum or i am which i shall hereaft indiscrimin express by the word spirit self and selfconsci in thi and in thi alon object and subject be and know are ident each involv and suppos the other in other word it is a subject which becom a subject by the act of construct itself object to itself but which never is an object except for itself and onli so far as by the veri same act it becom a subject it may be describ therefor as a perpetu selfdupl of one and the same power into object and subject which presuppos each other and can exist onli as antithes scholium if a man be ask how he know that he is he can onli answer sum quia sum but if the absolut of thi certainti have been admit he be again ask how he the individu person came to be then in relat to the ground of hi exist not to the ground of hi knowledg of that exist he might repli sum quia deu est or still more philosoph sum quia in deo sum but if we elev our concept to the absolut self the great etern i am then the principl of be and of knowledg of idea and of realiti the ground of exist and the ground of the knowledg of exist are absolut ident sum quia sum i am becaus i affirm myself to be i affirm myself to be becaus i am thesi vii if then i know myself onli through myself it is contradictori to requir ani other predic of self but that of selfconsci onli in the selfconsci of a spirit is there the requir ident of object and of represent for herein consist the essenc of a spirit that it is selfrepres if therefor thi be the one onli immedi truth in the certainti of which the realiti of our collect knowledg is ground it must follow that the spirit in all the object which it view view onli itself if thi could be prove the immedi realiti of all intuit knowledg would be assur it ha been shown that a spirit is that which is it own object yet not origin an object but an absolut subject for which all itself includ may becom an object it must therefor be an act for everi object is as an object dead fix incap in itself of ani action and necessarili finit again the spirit origin the ident of object and subject must in some sens dissolv thi ident in order to be consciou of it fit alter et idem but thi impli an act and it follow therefor that intellig or selfconsci is imposs except by and in a will the selfconsci spirit therefor is a will and freedom must be assum as a ground of philosophi and can never be deduc from it thesi viii whatev in it origin is object is likewis as such necessarili finit therefor sinc the spirit is not origin an object and as the subject exist in antithesi to an object the spirit can not origin be finit but neither can it be a subject without becom an object and as it is origin the ident of both it can be conceiv neither as infinit nor finit exclus but as the most origin union of both in the exist in the reconcil and the recurr of thi contradict consist the process and mysteri of product and life thesi ix thi principium commun essendi et cognoscendi as subsist in a will or primari act of selfdupl is the mediat or indirect principl of everi scienc but it is the immedi and direct principl of the ultim scienc alon ie of transcendent philosophi alon for it must be rememb that all these these refer sole to one of the two polar scienc name to that which commenc with and rigidli confin itself within the subject leav the object as far as it is exclus object to natur philosophi which is it opposit pole in it veri idea therefor as a systemat knowledg of our collect know scientia scientia it involv the necess of some one highest principl of know as at onc the sourc and accompani form in all particular act of intellect and percept thi it ha been shown can be found onli in the act and evolut of selfconsci we are not investig an absolut principium essendi for then i admit mani valid object might be start against our theori but an absolut principium cognoscendi the result of both the scienc or their equatori point would be the principl of a total and undivid philosophi as for prudenti reason i have chosen to anticip in the scholium to thesi vi and the note subjoin in other word philosophi would pass into religion and religion becom inclus of philosophi we begin with the i know myself in order to end with the absolut i am we proceed from the self in order to lose and find all self in god thesi x the transcendent philosoph doe not inquir what ultim ground of our knowledg there may lie out of our know but what is the last in our know itself beyond which we can not pass the principl of our know is sought within the sphere of our know it must be some thing therefor which can itself be known it is assert onli that the act of selfconsci is for us the sourc and principl of all our possibl knowledg whether abstract from us there exist ani thing higher and beyond thi primari selfknow which is for us the form of all our know must be decid by the result that the selfconsci is the fix point to which for us all is mortis and annex need no further proof but that the self conscious may be the modif of a higher form of be perhap of a higher

whole synthesi of our intellig is first form in and through the selfconsci doe not at all concern us as transcendent philosoph for to us selfconsci is not a kind of be but a kind of know and that too the highest and farthest that exist for us it may howev be shown and ha in part alreadi been shown earlier that even when the object is assum as the first we yet can never pass beyond the principl of selfconsci should we attempt it we must be driven back from ground to ground each of which would ceas to be a ground the moment we press on it we must be whirl down the gulf of an infinit seri but thi

effect causa sui subject and object or rather the absolut ident of both but as thi is inconceiv except in a selfconsci it follow that even as natur philosoph we must arriv at the same principl from which as transcendent philosoph we set out that is in a selfconsci in which the principium essendi doe not stand to the principlum cognoscend in the relat of caus to effect but both the one and the

object in our thought thu if a man capit be ten and hi debt eight the subtract will be the same whether we call the capit neg debt or the debt neg capit but in as much as the latter stand practic in refer to the former we of cours repres the sum as it is equal clear that two equal forc act in opposit direct both be finit and each distinguish from the other by it direct onli must neutral or reduc each other to inact now the transcendent philosophi demand first that two forc should be conceiv which counteract each other by their essenti natur not onli not in consequ of the accident direct of each but as prior to all direct nay as the primari forc from which the condit of all possibl direct are deriv and deduc secondli that these forc should be assum to be both alik infinit both alik indestruct the problem will then be to discov the result or product of two such forc as distinguish from the result of those forc which are finit and deriv their differ sole from the circumst of their direct when we have form a scheme or outlin of these two differ kind of forc and of their differ result by the process of discurs reason it will then remain for us to elev the thesi from notion to

no other concept is possibl but that the product must be a tertium aliquid or finit gener consequ thi concept is necessari now thi tertium aliquid can be no other than an interpenetr of the counteract power partak of both thu far had the work been transcrib for the press when i receiv the follow letter from a friend whose practic judgment i have had ampl reason to estim and rever and whose tast and sensibl preclud all the excus which my selflov might possibl have prompt me to set up in plea against the decis of advis of equal good sens but with less tact and feel dear c you ask my opinion concern your chapter on the imagin both as to the impress it made on myself and as to those which i think it will make on the public ie that part of the public who from the titl of the work and from it form a sort of introduct to a volum of poem are like to constitut the great major of your reader as to myself and state in the first place the effect on my understand your opinion and method of argument were not onli so new to me but so directli the revers of all i had ever been accustom to consid as truth that even if i had comprehend your premis suffici to have admit them and had seen the necess of your conclus i should still have been in that state of mind which in your note in chap iv you have so ingeni evolv as the antithesi to that in which a man is when he make a bull in your own word i should have felt as if i had been stand on my head the effect on my feel on the other hand i can not better repres than by suppos myself to have known onli our light airi modern chapel of eas and then for the first time to have been place and left alon in one of our largest gothic cathedr in a gusti moonlight night of autumn now in glimmer and now in gloom often in palpabl dark not without a chilli sensat of terror then suddenli emerg into broad yet visionari light with colour shadow of fantast shape yet all deck with holi insignia and mystic symbol and ever and anon come out full upon pictur and stonework imag of great men with whose name i wa familiar but which look upon me with counten and an express the most dissimilar to all i had been in the habit of connect with those name those whom i had been taught to vener as almost superhuman in magnitud of intellect i found perch in littl fretwork nich as grotesqu dwarf while the grotesqu in my hitherto belief stood guard the high altar with all the charact of apotheosi in short what i had suppos substanc were thin away into shadow while everywher shadow were deepen into substanc if substanc might be calld that shadow seemd for each seemd either yet after all i could not but repeat the line which you had quot from a ms poem of your own in the friend and appli to a work of mr wordsworth though with a few of the word alter an orphic tale inde a tale obscur of high and passion thought to a strang music chant be assur howev that i look forward anxious to your great book on the construct philosophi which you have promis and announc and that i will do my best to understand it onli i will not promis to descend into the dark cave of trophoniu with you there to rub my own eye in order to make the spark and figur flash which i am requir to see so much for myself but as for the public i do not hesit a moment in advis and urg you to withdraw the chapter from the present work and to reserv it for your announc treatis on the logo or commun intellect in man and deiti first becaus imperfectli as i understand the present chapter i see clearli that you have done too much and yet not enough you have been oblig to omit so mani link from the necess of compress that what remain look if i may recur to my former illustr like the fragment of the wind step of an old ruin tower secondli a still stronger argument at least one that i am sure will be more forcibl with you is that your reader will have both right and reason to complain of you thi chapter which can not when it is print amount to so littl as an hundr page will of necess greatli increas the expens of the work and everi reader who like myself is neither prepar nor perhap calcul for the studi of so abstrus a subject so abstrus treat will as i have befor hint be almost entitl to accus you of a sort of imposit on him for who he might truli observ could from your titlepag to wit my literari life and opinion publish too as introductori to a volum of miscellan poem have anticip or even conjectur a long treatis on ideal realism which hold the same relat in abstrus to plotinu as plotinu doe to plato it will be well if alreadi you have not too much of metaphys disquisit in your work though as the larger part of the disquisit is histor it will doubtless be both interest and instruct to mani to whose unprepar mind your specul on the esemplast power would be utterli unintellig be assur if you do publish thi chapter in the present work you will be remind of bishop berkeley siri announc as an essay on tarwat which begin with tar end with the triniti the omn scibil form the interspac i say in the present work in that greater work to which you have devot so mani year and studi so intens and variou it will be in it proper place your prospectu will have describ and announc both it content and their natur and if ani person purchas it who feel no interest in the subject of which it treat they will have themselv onli to blame i could add to these argument one deriv from pecuniari motiv and particularli from the probabl effect on the sale of your present public but they would weigh littl with you compar with the preced besid i have long observ that argument drawn from your own person interest more often act on you as narcot than as stimul and that in money concern you have some small portion of pignatur in your moral idiosyncrasi and like these amiabl creatur must occasion be pull backward from the boat in order to make you enter it all success attend you for if hard think and hard read are merit you have deserv it your affection etc in consequ of thi veri judici letter which produc complet convict on my mind i shall content myself for the present with state the main result of the chapter which i have reserv for that futur public a detail prospectu of which the reader will find at the close of the second volum the imagin then i consid either as primari or secondari the primari imagin i hold to be the live power and prime agent of all human percept and as a repetit in the finit mind of the etern act of creation in the infinit i am the secondari imagin i consid as an echo of the former coexist with the consciou will yet still as ident with the primari in the kind of it agenc and differ onli in degre and in the mode of it oper it dissolv diffus dissip in order to recreat or where thi process is render imposs yet still at

medit and feel mind to seek after them or to notic them when they present themselv in thi idea origin the plan of the lyric ballad in which it wa agre that my endeavour should be direct to person and charact supernatur or at least romant yet so as to transfer from our inward natur a human interest and a semblanc of truth suffici to procur for these shadow of imagin that will suspens of disbelief for the moment which constitut poetic faith mr wordsworth on the other hand wa to propos to himself as hi object to give the charm of novelti to thing of everi day and to excit a feel analog to the

and selfish solicitud we have eye yet see not ear that hear not and heart that neither feel nor understand with thi view i wrote the ancient marin and wa prepar among other poem the dark ladi and the christabel in which i should have more nearli realiz my ideal than i had done in my first attempt but mr wordsworth industri had prove so much more success and the number of hi poem so much greater that my composit instead of form a balanc appear rather an interpol of heterogen matter mr wordsworth ad two or three poem written in hi own charact in the impass lofti and sustain diction which is characterist of hi geniu in thi form the lyric ballad were publish and were present by him as an experi whether subject which from their natur reject the usual ornament and extracolloqui style of poem

howev mistaken it direct might be deem aros the whole longcontinu controversi for from the conjunct of perceiv power with suppos heresi i explain the inveteraci and in some instanc i griev to say the

distinguish from the composit of other poet mere by mean of languag and inan of thought had they inde contain noth more than what is found in the parodi and pretend imit of them they must have sunk at onc a dead weight into the slough of oblivion and have drag the prefac along with them but year after year increas the number of mr wordsworth admir they were found too not in the lower class of the read public but chiefli among young men of strong sensibl and medit mind and their admir inflam perhap in some degre by opposit wa distinguish by it intens i might almost say by it religi fervour these fact and the intellectu energi of the author which wa more or less conscious felt where it wa outwardli and even boister deni meet with sentiment of avers to hi opinion and of alarm at their consequ produc an eddi of critic which would of itself have born up the poem by the violenc with which it whirl them round and round with mani part of thi prefac in the sens attribut to them and which the word undoubtedli seem to author i never concur but on the contrari object to them as erron in principl and as contradictori in appear at least both to other part of the same prefac and to the author own practic in the greater part of the poem themselv mr wordsworth in hi recent collect ha i find degrad thi prefatori disquisit to the end of hi second volum to be read or not at the reader choic but he ha not as far as i can discov announc ani chang in hi poetic creed at all event consid it as the sourc of a controversi in which i have been honour more than i deserv by the frequent conjunct of my name with hi i think it expedi to declar onc for all in what point i coincid with the opinion support in that prefac and in what point i altogeth differ but in order to render myself intellig i must previous in as few word as possibl explain my view first of a poem and secondli of poetri itself in kind and in essenc the offic of philosoph disquisit consist in just distinct while it is the privileg of the philosoph to preserv himself constantli awar that distinct is not divis in order to obtain adequ notion of ani truth we must intellectu separ it distinguish part and thi is the technic process of philosophi but have so done we must then restor them in our concept to the uniti in which they actual coexist and thi is the result of philosophi a poem contain the same element as a prose composit the differ therefor must consist in a differ combin of them in consequ of a differ object be propos accord to the differ of the object will be the differ of the combin it is possibl that the object may be mere to facilit the recollect of ani given fact or observ by artifici arrang and the composit will be a poem mere becaus it is distinguish from prose by metr or by rhyme or by both conjointli in thi the lowest sens a man might attribut the name of a poem to the wellknown enumer of the day in the sever month thirti day hath septemb april june and novemb etc and other of the same class and purpos and as a particular pleasur is found in anticip the recurr of sound and quantiti all composit that have thi charm superad whatev be their content may be entitl poem so much for the superfici form a differ of object and content suppli an addit ground of distinct the immedi purpos may be the commun of truth either of truth absolut and demonstr as in work of scienc or of fact experienc and record as in histori pleasur and that of the highest and most perman kind may result from the attain of the end but it is not itself the immedi end in other work the commun of pleasur may be the immedi purpos and though truth either moral or intellectu ought to be the ultim end yet thi will distinguish the charact of the author not the class to which the work belong blest inde is that state of societi in which the immedi purpos would be baffl by the pervers of the proper ultim end in which no charm of diction or imageri could exempt the bathyllu even of an anacreon or the alexi of virgil from disgust and avers but the commun of pleasur may be the immedi object of a work not metric compos and that object may have been in a high degre attain as in novel and romanc would then the mere superaddit of metr with or without rhyme entitl these to the name of poem the answer is that noth can perman pleas which doe not contain in itself the reason whi it is so and not otherwis if metr be superad all other part must be made conson with it they must be such as to justifi the perpetu and distinct attent to each part which an exact correspond recurr of accent and sound are calcul to excit the final definit then so deduc may be thu word a poem is that speci of composit which is oppos to work of scienc by propos for it immedi object pleasur not truth and from all other specieshav thi object in common with itit is discrimin by propos to itself such delight from the whole as is compat with a distinct gratif from each compon part controversi is not seldom excit in consequ of the disput attach each a differ mean to the same word and in few instanc ha thi been more strike than in disput concern the present subject if a man choos to call everi composit a poem which is rhyme or measur or both i must leav hi opinion uncontrovert the distinct is at least compet to character the writer intent if it were subjoin that the whole is likewis entertain or affect as a tale or as a seri of interest reflect i of cours admit thi as anoth fit ingredi of a poem and an addit merit but if the definit sought for be that of a legitim poem i answer it must be one the part of which mutual support and explain each other all in their proport harmon with and support the purpos and known influenc of metric arrang the philosoph critic of all age coincid with the ultim judgment of all countri in equal deni the prais of a just poem on the one hand to a seri of strike line or distich each of which absorb the whole attent of the reader to itself becom disjoin from it

with due except from the mouth of men in real life a languag which actual constitut the natur convers of men under the influenc of natur feel my object is first that in ani sens thi rule is applic onli to certain class of poetri secondli that even to these class it is not applic except in such a sens as hath never by ani one as far as i know or have read been deni or doubt and lastli that as far as and in that degre in which it is practic it is yet as a rule useless if not injuri and therefor either need not or ought not to be practis the poet inform hi reader that he had gener chosen low and rustic life but not as low and rustic or in order to repeat that pleasur of doubt moral effect which person of elev rank and of superior refin oftentim deriv from a happi imit of the rude unpolish manner and discours of their inferior for the pleasur so deriv may be trace to three excit caus the first is the natur in fact of the thing repres the second is the appar natur of the represent as

consciou feel of hi superior awaken by the contrast present to him even as for the same purpos the king and great baron of yore retain sometim actual clown and fool but more frequent shrewd and witti fellow in that charact these howev were not mr wordsworth object he chose low and rustic life becaus in that condit the essenti passion of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their matur are less under restraint and speak a plainer and more emphat languag becaus in that condit of life our elementari feel coexist in a state of greater simplic and consequ may be more accur contempl and more forcibl commun becaus the manner of rural life germin from those elementari feel and from the necessari charact of rural occup are more easili comprehend and are more durabl and lastli becaus in that condit the passion of men are incorpor with the beauti and perman form of natur now it is clear to me that in the most interest of the poem in which the author is more or less dramat as the brother michael ruth the mad mother and other the person introduc are by no mean taken from low or rustic life in the common accept of those word and it is not less clear that the sentiment and languag as far as they can be conceiv to have been realli transfer from the mind and convers of such person are attribut to caus and circumst not necessarili connect with their occup and abod the thought feel languag and manner of the shepherd farmer in the vale of cumberland and westmoreland as far as they are actual adopt in those poem may be account for from caus which will and do produc the same result in everi state of life whether in town or countri as the two princip i rank that independ which rais a man abov servitud or daili toil for the profit of other yet not abov the necess of industri and a frugal simplic of domest life and the accompani unambiti but solid and religi educ which ha render few book familiar but the bibl and the liturgi or hymn book to thi latter caus inde which is so far accident that it is the bless of particular countri and a particular age not the product of particular place or employ the poet owe the show of probabl that hi personag might

to be improv by a countri life or by countri labour educ or origin sensibl or both must preexist if the chang form and incid of natur are to prove a suffici stimul and where these are not suffici the mind contract and harden by want of stimul and the man becom selfish sensual gross and hard heart let the manag of the poor law in liverpool manchest or bristol be compar with the ordinari dispens of the poor rate in agricultur villag where the farmer are the overs and guardian of the poor if my own experi have not been particularli unfortun as well as that of the mani respect countri clergymen with whom i have convers on the subject the result would engend more than sceptic concern the desir influenc of low and rustic life in and for itself whatev may be conclud on the other side from the stronger local attach and enterpris spirit of the swiss and other mountain appli to a particular mode of pastor life under form of properti that permit and beget manner truli republican not to rustic life in gener or to the absenc of artifici cultiv on the contrari the mountain whose manner have been so often eulog are in gener better educ and greater reader than men of equal rank elsewher but where thi is not the case as among the peasantri of north wale the ancient mountain with all their terror and all their glori are pictur to the blind and music to the deaf i should not have enter so much into detail upon thi passag but here seem to be the point to which all the line of differ converg as to their sourc and centrei mean as far as and in whatev respect my poetic creed doe differ from the doctrin promulg in thi prefac i adopt with full faith the principl of aristotl that poetri as poetri is essenti ideal that it avoid and exclud all accid that it appar individu of rank charact or occup must be repres of a class and that the person of poetri must be cloth with gener attribut with the common attribut of the class not with such as one gift individu might possibl possess but such as from hi situat it is most probabl beforehand that he would possess if my premis are right and my deduct legitim it follow that there can be no poetic medium between the swain of theocritu and those of an imaginari golden age the charact of the vicar and the shepherdmarin in the poem of the brother and that of the shepherd of greenhead ghyll in the michael have all the verisimilitud and repres qualiti that the purpos of poetri can requir they are person of a known and abid class and their manner and sentiment the natur product of circumst common to the class take michael for instanc an old man stout of heart and strong of limb hi bodili frame had been from youth to age of an unusu strength hi mind wa keen intens and frugal apt for all affair and in hi shepherd call he wa prompt and watch more than ordinari men henc he had learn the mean of all wind of blast of everi tone and oftentim when other heed not he heard the south make subterran music like the nois of bagpip on distant highland hill the shepherd at such warn of hi flock bethought him and he to himself would say the wind are now devis work for me and truli at all time the storm that drive the travel to a shelter summon him up to the mountain he had been alon amid the heart of mani thousand mist that came to him and left him on the height so live he until hi eightieth year wa past and grossli that man err who should suppos that the green valley and the stream and rock were thing indiffer to the shepherd thought field where with cheer spirit he had breath the common air the hill which he so oft had climb with vigor step which had impress so mani incid upon hi mind of hardship skill or courag joy or fear which like a book preserv the memori of the dumb anim whom he had save had fed or shelter link to such act so grate in themselv the certainti of honour gain these field these hill which were hi live be even more than hi own bloodwhat could they less had laid strong hold on hi affect were to him a pleasur feel of blind love the pleasur which there is in life itself on the other hand in the poem which are pitch in a lower key as the harri gill and the idiot boy the feel are those of human natur in gener though the poet ha judici laid the scene in the countri in order to place himself in the vicin of interest imag without the necess of ascrib a sentiment percept of their beauti to the person of hi drama in the idiot boy inde the mother charact is not so much the real and nativ product of a situat where the essenti passion of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their matur and speak a plainer and more emphat languag as it is an imperson of an instinct abandon by judgment henc the two follow charg seem to me not wholli groundless at least they are the onli plausibl object which i have heard to that fine poem the one is that the author ha not in the poem itself taken suffici care to preclud from the reader fanci the disgust imag of ordinari morbid idioci which yet it wa by no mean hi intent to repres he wa even by the burr burr burr uncounteract by ani preced descript of the boy beauti assist in recal them the other is that the idioci of the boy is so evenli balanc by the folli of the mother as to present to the gener reader rather a laughabl burlesqu on the blind of anil dotag than an analyt display of matern affect in it ordinari work in the thorn the poet himself acknowledg in a note the necess of an introductori poem in which he should have portray the charact of the person from whom the word of the poem are suppos to proceed a superstiti man moder imagin of slow faculti and deep feel a captain of a small trade vessel for exampl who be past the middl age of life had retir upon an annuiti or small independ incom to some villag or countri town of which he wa not a nativ or in which he had not been accustom to live such men have noth to do becom credul and talk from indol but in a poem still more in a lyric poemand the

discours without repeat the effect of dull and garrul howev thi may be i dare assert that the partsand these form the far larger portion of the wholewhich might as well or still better have proceed from the poet own imagin and have been spoken in hi own charact are those which have given and which will continu to give univers delight and that the passag exclus appropri to the suppos narrat such as the last couplet of the third stanza the seven last line of the tenth and the five follow stanza with the except of the four admir line at the commenc of the fourteenth are felt by mani unprejud

by which the choic of charact wa to be direct not onli a priori from ground of reason but both from the few instanc in which the poet himself need be suppos to have been govern by it and from the

too of these men ha been adopt purifi inde from what appear to be it real defect from all last and ration caus of dislik or disgust becaus such men hourli commun with the best object from which the best part of languag is origin deriv and becaus from their rank in societi and the same and narrow circl of their intercours be less under the action of social vaniti they convey their feel and notion in simpl and unelabor express to thi i repli that a rustic languag purifi from all provinci and gross and so far reconstruct as to be made consist with the rule of grammarwhich are in essenc no other than the law of univers logic appli to psycholog materialswil not differ from the languag of ani other man of common sens howev learn or refin he may be except as far as the notion which the rustic ha to convey are fewer and more indiscrimin thi will becom still clearer if we add the considerationequ import though less obviousthat the rustic from the more imperfect develop of hi faculti and from the lower state of their cultiv aim almost sole to convey insul fact either those of hi scanti experi or hi tradit belief while the educ man chiefli seek to discov and express those connect of thing

thing the sole solut of their mode of exist and in the knowledg of which consist our digniti and our power as littl can i agre with the assert that from the object with which the rustic hourli commun the best part of languag is form for first if to commun with an object impli such an acquaint with it as render it capabl of be discrimin reflect on the distinct knowledg of an uneduc rustic would furnish a veri scanti vocabulari the few thing and mode of action requisit for hi bodili conveni would alon be individu while all the rest of natur would be express by a small number of confus gener term secondli i deni that the word and combin of word deriv from the object with which the rustic is familiar whether with distinct or confus knowledg can be justli said to form the best part of languag it is more than probabl that mani class of the brute creation possess discrimin sound by which they can convey to each other notic of such object as concern their food shelter or safeti yet we hesit to call the aggreg of such sound a languag otherwis than metaphor the best part of human languag properli so call is deriv from reflect on the act of the mind itself it is form by a voluntari

upon themselv and their art in proport as they indulg in arbitrari and caprici habit of express it may be answer that the languag which he ha in view can be attribut to rustic with no greater right than the style of hooker or bacon to tom brown or sir roger lestrang doubtless if what is peculiar to each were omit in each the result must need be the same further that the poet who use an illog

time for recollect or in mere aid of vacanc as in the scanti compani of a countri stage the same player pop backward and forward in order to prevent the appear of empti space in the process of macbeth

of intens and turbul feel in which the passion is greater and of longer endur than to be exhaust or satisfi by a singl represent of the imag or incid excit it such repetit i admit to be a beauti of the highest kind as illustr by mr wordsworth himself from the song of deborah at her feet he bow he fell he lay down at her feet he bow he fell where he bow there he fell down dead judg v chapter xviii languag of metric composit whi and wherein essenti differ from that of proseorigin and element of metreit necessari consequ and the condit therebi impos on the metric writer in the choic of hi

or where can the poet have live and by what rule could he direct hi choic which would not have enabl him to select and arrang hi word by the light of hi own judgment we do not adopt the languag of a class by the mere adopt of such word exclus as that class would use or at least understand but likewis by follow the order in which the word of such men are wont to succeed each other now thi order in the intercours of uneduc men is distinguish from the diction of their superior in knowledg and power by the greater disjunct and separ in the compon part of that whatev it be which they wish to commun there is a want of that prospect of mind that surview which enabl a man to forese the whole of what he is to convey appertain to ani one point and by thi mean so to subordin and arrang the differ part accord to their rel import as to convey it at onc and as an organ whole now i will take the first stanza on which i have chanc to open in the lyric ballad it is one the most simpl and the least peculiar in it languag in distant countri have i been and yet i have not often seen a healthi man a man full grown weep in the public road alon but such a one on english ground and in the broad highway i met along the broad highway he came hi cheek with tear were wet sturdi he seem though he wa sad and in hi arm a lamb he had the word here are doubtless such as are current in all rank of life and of cours not less so in the hamlet and cottag than in the shop manufactori colleg or palac but is thi the order in which the rustic would have place the word i am grievous deceiv if the follow less compact mode of commenc the same tale be not a far more faith copi i have been in a mani part far and near and i dont know that i ever saw befor a man cri by himself in the public road a grown man i mean that wa neither sick nor hurt etc etc but when i turn to the follow stanza in the thorn at all time of the day and night thi wretch woman thither goe and she is known to everi star and everi wind that blow and there besid the thorn she sit when the blue daylight in the sky and when the whirlwind on the hill or frosti air is keen and still and to herself she cri oh miseri oh miseri oh woe is me oh miseri and compar thi with the languag of ordinari men or with that which i can conceiv at all like to proceed in real life from such a narrat as is suppos in the note to the poem compar it either in the success of the imag or of the sentenc i am remind of the sublim prayer and hymn of prais which milton in opposit to an establish liturgi present as a fair specimen of common extemporari devot and such as we might expect to hear from everi selfinspir minist of a conventicl and i reflect with delight how littl a mere theori though of hi own workmanship interfer with the process of genuin imagin in a man of true poetic geniu who possess as mr wordsworth if ever man did most assuredli doe possess the vision and the faculti divin one point then alon remain but that the most import it examin have been inde my chief induc for the preced inquisit there neither is nor can be ani essenti differ between the languag of prose and metric composit such is mr wordsworth assert now prose itself at least in all argument and consecut work differ and ought to differ from the languag of convers even as read ought to differ from talk unless therefor the differ deni be that of the mere word as materi common to all style of write and not of the style itself in the univers admit sens of the term it might be natur presum that there must exist a still greater between the ordonn of poetic composit and that of prose than is expect to distinguish prose from ordinari convers there are not inde exampl want in the histori of literatur of appar paradox that have summon the public wonder as new and startl truth but which on examin have shrunk into tame and harmless truism as the eye of a cat seen in the dark have been mistaken for flame of fire but mr wordsworth is among the last men to whom a delus of thi kind would be attribut by anyon who had enjoy the slightest opportun of understand hi mind and charact where an object ha been anticip by such an author as natur hi answer to it must need be interpret in some sens which either is or ha been or is capabl of be controvert my object then must be to discov some other mean for the term essenti differ in thi place exclus of the indistinct and commun of the word themselv for whether there ought to exist a class of word in the english in ani degre resembl the poetic dialect of the greek and italian is a question of veri subordin import the number of such word would be small inde in our languag and even in the italian and greek they consist not so much of differ word as of slight differ in the form of declin and conjug the same word form doubtless which have been at some period more or less remot the common grammat flexion of some tribe or provinc had been accident appropri to poetri by the gener admir of certain master intellect the first establish light of inspir to whom that dialect happen to be nativ essenc in it primari signif mean the principl of individu the inmost principl of the possibl of ani thing as that particular thing it is equival to the idea of a thing whenev we use the word idea with philosoph precis exist on the other hand is distinguish from essenc by the superinduct of realiti thu we speak of the essenc and essenti properti of a circl but we do not therefor assert that ani thing which realli exist is mathemat circular thu too without ani tautolog we contend for the exist of the suprem be that is for a realiti correspond to the idea there is next a secondari use of the word essenc in which it signifi the point or ground of contradistinct between two modif of the same substanc or subject thu we should be allow to say that the style of architectur of westminst abbey is essenti differ from that of st paul even though both had been built with block cut into the same form and from the same quarri onli in thi latter sens of the term must it have been deni by mr wordsworth for in thi sens alon is it affirm by the gener opinion that the languag of poetri that is the formal construct or architectur of the word and phrase is essenti differ from that of prose now the burden of the proof lie with the oppugn not with the support of the common belief mr wordsworth in consequ assign as the proof of hi posit that not onli the languag of a larg portion of everi good poem even of the most elev charact must necessarili except with refer to the metr in no respect differ from that of good prose but likewis that some of the most interest part of the best poem will be found to be strictli the languag of prose when prose is well written the truth of thi assert might be demonstr by innumer passag from almost all the poetic write even of milton himself he then quot gray sonnet in vain to me the smile morn shine and redden phoebu lift hi golden fire the bird in vain their amor descant join or cheer field resum their green attir these ear ala for other note repin a differ object do these eye requir my lone anguish melt no heart but mine and in my breast the

is equal obviou that except in the rhyme and in the use of the singl word fruitless for fruitlessli which is so far a defect the languag of these line doe in no respect differ from that of prose an idealist defend hi system by the fact that when asleep we often believ ourselv awak wa well answer by hi plain neighbour ah but when awak do we ever believ ourselv asleep thing ident must be convert the preced passag seem to rest on a similar sophism for the question is not whether there may not occur in prose an order of word which would be equal proper in a poem nor whether there are not beauti line and sentenc of frequent occurr in good poem which would be equal becom as well as beauti in good prose for neither the one nor the other ha ever been either deni or doubt by ani one the true question must be whether there are not mode of express a construct and an order of sentenc which are in their fit and natur place in a seriou prose composit but would be disproportion and heterogen in metric poetri and vice versa whether in the languag of a seriou poem there may not be an arrang both of word and sentenc and a use and select of what are call figur of speech both as to their kind their frequenc and their occas which on a subject of equal weight would be viciou and alien in correct and manli prose i contend that in both case thi unfit of each for the place of the other frequent will and ought to exist and first from the origin of metr thi i would trace to the balanc in the mind effect by that spontan effort which strive to hold in check the work of passion it might be easili explain likewis in what manner thi salutari antagon is assist by the veri state which it counteract and how thi balanc of antagonist becam organ into metr in the usual accept of that term by a superven act of the will and judgment conscious and for the foreseen purpos of pleasur assum these principl as the data of our argument we deduc from them two legitim condit which the critic is entitl to expect in everi metric work first that as the element of metr owe their exist to a state of increas excit so the metr itself should be accompani by the natur languag of excit secondli that as these element are form into metr artifici by a voluntari act with the design and for the purpos of blend delight with emot so the trace of present volit should throughout the metric languag be proportion discern now these two condit must be reconcil and co present there must be not onli a partnership but a union an interpenetr of passion and of will of spontan impuls and of voluntari purpos again thi union can be manifest onli in a frequenc of form and figur of speech origin the offspr of passion but now the adopt children of power greater than would be desir or endur where the emot is not voluntarili encourag and kept up for the sake of that pleasur which such emot so temper and master by the will is found capabl of commun it not onli dictat but of itself tend to produc a more frequent employ of picturesqu and vivifi languag than would be natur in ani other case in which there did not exist as there doe in the present a previou and well understood though tacit compact between the poet and hi reader that the latter is entitl to expect and the former bound to suppli thi speci and degre of pleasur excit we may in some measur appli to thi union the answer of polixen in the winter tale to perdita neglect of the streak gilliflow becaus she had heard it said there is an art which in their pied share with great creat natur pol say there be yet natur is made better by no mean but natur make that mean so oer that art which you say add to natur is an art that natur make you see sweet maid we marri a gentler scion to the wildest stock and make conceiv a bark of baser kind by bud of nobler race thi is an art which doe mend naturechang it rather but the art itself is natur secondli i argu from the effect of metr as far as metr act in and for itself it tend to increas the vivac and suscept both of the gener feel and of the attent thi effect it produc by the continu excit of surpris and by the quick reciproc of curios still gratifi and still reexcit which are too slight inde to be at ani one moment object of distinct conscious yet becom consider in their aggreg influenc as a medic atmospher or as wine dure anim convers they act power though themselv unnot where therefor correspond food and appropri matter are not provid for the attent and feel thu rous there must need be a disappoint felt like that of leap in the dark from the last step of a staircas when we had prepar our muscl for a leap of three or four the discuss on the power of metr in the prefac is highli ingeni and touch at all point on truth but i can not find ani statement of it power consid abstractli and separ on the contrari mr wordsworth seem alway to estim metr by the power which it exert dure and as i think in consequ of it combin with other element of poetri thu the previou difficulti is left unansw what the element are with which it must be combin in order to produc it own effect to ani pleasur purpos doubl and trisyl rhyme inde form a lower speci of wit and attend to exclus for their own sake may becom a sourc of momentari amus as in poor smart distich to the welsh squir who had promis him a hare tell me thou son of great cadwallad hast sent the hare or hast thou swallowd her but for ani poetic purpos metr resembl if the apt of the simil may excus it mean yeast worthless or disagre by itself but give vivac and spirit to the liquor with which it is proport combin the refer to the children in the wood by no mean satisfi my judgment we all willingli throw ourselv back for awhil into the feel of our childhood thi ballad therefor we read under such recollect of our own childish feel as would equal endear to us poem which mr wordsworth himself would regard as faulti in the opposit extrem of gaudi and technic ornament befor the invent of print and in a still greater degre befor the introduct of write metr especi allit metr whether allit at the begin of the word as in pierc plouman or at the end as in rhyme possess an independ valu as assist the recollect and consequ the preserv of ani seri of truth or incid but i am not convinc by the collat of fact that the children in the wood owe either it preserv or it popular to it metric form mr marshal repositori afford a number of tale in prose inferior in patho and gener merit some of as old a date and mani as wide popular tom hickathrift jack the giantkil goodi twosho and littl red ridinghood are formid rival and that they have continu in prose can not be fairli explain by the assumpt that the compar mean of their thought and imag preclud even the humblest form of metr the scene of goodi twosho in the church is perfectli suscept of metric narrat and among the thaumata thaumastotata even of the present age i do not recollect a more astonish imag than that of the whole rookeri that flew out of the giant beard scare by the tremend voic with which thi monster answer the challeng of the heroic tom hickathrift if from these we turn to composit univers and independ of all earli associ belov and admir would the maria the monk or the poor man ass of stern be read with more delight or have a better chanc of immort had they without ani chang in the diction been compos in rhyme than in their present state if i am not grossli mistaken the gener repli would be in the neg nay i will confess that in mr wordsworth own volum the anecdot for father simon lee alic fell beggar and the sailor mother notwithstand the beauti which are to be found in each of them where the poet interpos the music of hi own thought would have been more delight to me in prose told and manag as by mr wordsworth they would have been in a moral essay or pedestrian tour metr in itself is simpli a stimul of the attent and therefor excit the question whi is the attent to be thu stimul now the question can not be answer by the pleasur of the metr itself for thi we have shown to be condit and depend on the appropri of the thought and express to which the metric form is superad neither can i conceiv ani other answer that can be ration given short of thi i write in metr becaus i am about to use a languag differ from that of prose besid where the languag is not such how interest soever the reflect are that are capabl of be drawn by a philosoph mind from the thought or incid of the poem the metr itself must often becom feebl take the last three stanza of the sailor mother for instanc if i could for a moment abstract from the effect produc on the author feel as a man by the incid at the time of it real occurr i would dare appeal to hi own judgment whether in the metr itself he found a suffici reason for their be written metric and thu continu she said i had a son who mani a day sail on the sea but he is dead in denmark he wa cast away and i have travel far as hull to see what cloth he

behind as it might be perhap from bode of hi mind he to a fellowlodg care had left it to be watch and fed till he came back again and there i found it when my son wa dead and now god help me for my littl wit i trail it with me sir he took so much delight in it if disproport the emphasi we read these stanza so as to make the rhyme percept even trisyl rhyme could scarc produc an equal sens of odditi and strang as we feel here in find rhyme at all in sentenc so exclus colloqui i would further ask whether but for that visionari state into which the figur of the woman and the suscept of hi own geniu had place the poet imaginationa state which spread it influenc and colour over all that coexist with the excit caus and in which the simplest and the most familiar thing gain a strang power of spread awe around them i would ask the poet whether he would not have felt an abrupt downfal in these vers from the preced stanza the ancient spirit is not dead old time thought i are breath there proud wa i that my countri bred such strength a digniti so fair she beg an alm like one in poor estat i look at her again nor did my pride abat it must not be omit and is besid worthi of notic that those stanza furnish the onli fair instanc that i have been abl to discov in all mr wordsworth write of an actual adopt or true imit of the real and veri languag of low and rustic life freed from provinci thirdli i deduc the posit from all the caus elsewher assign which render metr the proper form of poetri and poetri imperfect and defect without metr metr therefor have been connect with poetri most often and by a peculiar fit whatev els is combin with metr must though it be not itself essenti poetic have nevertheless some properti in common with poetri as an intermedium of affin a sort if i may dare borrow a wellknown phrase from technic chemistri of mordaunt between it and the superad metr now poetri mr wordsworth truli affirm doe alway impli passion which word must be here understood in it most gener sens as an excit state of the feel and faculti and as everi passion ha it proper puls so will it likewis have it characterist mode of express but where there exist that degre of geniu and talent which entitl a writer to aim at the honour of a poet the veri act of poetic composit itself is and is allow to impli and to produc an unusu state of excit which of cours justifi and demand a correspond differ of languag as truli though not perhap in as mark a degre as the excit of love fear rage or jealousi the vivid of the descript or declam in donn or dryden is as much and as often deriv from the forc and fervour of the describ as from the reflect form or incid which constitut their subject and materi the wheel take fire from the mere rapid of their motion to what extent and under what modif thi may be admit to act i shall attempt to defin in an after remark on mr wordsworth repli to thi object or rather on hi object to thi repli as alreadi anticip in hi prefac fourthli and as intim connect with thi if not the same argument in a more gener form i adduc the high spiritu instinct of the human be impel us to seek uniti by harmoni adjust and thu establish the principl that all the part of an organ whole must be assimil to the more import and essenti part thi and the preced argument may be strengthen by the reflect that the composit of a poem is among the imit art and that imit as oppos to copi consist either in the interfus of the same throughout the radic differ or of the differ throughout a base radic the same lastli i appeal to the practic of the best poet of all countri and in all age as author the opinion deduc from all the forego that in everi import of the word essenti which would not here involv a mere truism there may be is and ought to be an essenti differ between the languag of prose and of metric composit in mr wordsworth critic of gray sonnet the reader sympathi with hi prais or blame of the differ part is taken for grant rather perhap too easili he ha not at least attempt to win or compel it by argument analysi in my concept at least the line reject as of no valu do with the except of the two first differ as much and as littl from the languag of common life as those which he ha print in ital as possess genuin excel of the five line thu honour distinguish two of them differ from prose even more wide than the line which either preced or follow in the posit of the word a differ object do these eye requir my lone anguish melt no heart but mine and in my breast the imperfect joy expir but were it otherwis what would thi prove but a truth of which no man ever doubtedvidelicet that there are sentenc which would be equal in their place both in vers and prose assuredli it doe not prove the point which alon requir proof name that there are not passag which would suit the one and not suit the other the first line of thi sonnet is distinguish from the ordinari languag of men by the epithet to morn for we will set asid at present the consider that the particular word smile is hackney and as it involv a sort of personif not quit congruou with the common and materi attribut of shine and doubtless thi adjunct of epithet for the purpos of addit descript where no particular attent is demand for the qualiti of the thing would be notic as give a poetic cast to a man convers should the sportsman exclaim come boy the rosi morn call you up he will be suppos to have some song in hi head but no one suspect thi when he say a wet morn shall not confin us to our bed thi then is either a defect in poetri or it is not whoever should decid in the affirm i would request him to reperus ani one poem of ani confessedli great poet from homer to milton or from aeschylu to shakespear and to strike out in thought i mean everi instanc of thi kind if the number of these fanci erasur did not startl him or if he continu to deem the work improv by their total omiss he must advanc reason of no ordinari strength and evid reason ground in the essenc of human natur otherwis i should not hesit to consid him as a man not so much proof against all author as dead to it the second line and redden phoebu lift hi golden fire ha inde almost as mani fault as word but then it is a bad line not becaus the languag is distinct from that of prose but becaus it convey incongru imag becaus it confound the caus and the effect the real thing with the personifi repres of the thing in short becaus it differ from the languag of good sens that the phoebu is hackney and a schoolboy imag is an accident fault depend on the age in

nor of one age chapter xix continuationconcern the real object which it is probabl mr wordsworth had befor him in hi critic prefaceelucid and applic of thi it might appear from some passag in the former part of mr wordsworth prefac that he meant to confin hi theori of style and the necess of a close accord with the actual languag of men to those particular subject from low and rustic life which by way of experi he had purpos to natur as a new speci in our english poetri but from the train of argument that follow from the refer to milton and from the spirit of hi critiqu on gray sonnet those sentenc appear to have been rather courtesi of modesti than actual limit of hi system yet so groundless doe thi system appear on a close examin and so strang and overwhelm in it consequ that i can not and i do not believ that the poet did ever himself adopt it in the unqualifi sens in which hi express have been understood by other and which inde accord to all the common law of interpret they seem to bear what then did he mean i apprehend that in the clear percept not unaccompani with disgust or contempt of the gaudi affect of a style which pass current with too mani for poetic diction though in truth it had as littl pretens to poetri as to logic or common sens he narrow hi view for the time and feel a justifi prefer for the languag of natur and of good sens even in it humblest and least ornament form he suffer himself to express in term at onc too larg and too exclus hi predilect for a style the most remot possibl from the fals and showi splendour which he wish to explod it is possibl that thi predilect at first mere compar deviat for a time into direct partial but the real object which he had in view wa i doubt not a speci of excel which had been long befor most happili character by the judici and amiabl garv whose work are so justli belov and esteem by the german in hi remark on gellert from which the follow is liter translat the talent that is requir in order to make excel vers is perhap greater than the philosoph is readi to admit or would find it in hi power to acquir the talent to seek onli the apt express of the thought and yet to find at the same time with it the rhyme and the metr gellert possess thi happi gift if ever ani one of our poet possess it and noth perhap contribut more to the great and univers impress which hi fabl made on their first public or conduc more to their continu popular it wa a strang and curiou phaenomenon and such as in germani had been previous unheard of to read vers in which everyth wa express just as one would wish to talk and yet all dignifi attract and interest and all at the same time perfectli correct as to the measur of the syllabl and the rhyme it is certain that poetri when it ha attain thi excel make a far greater impress than prose so much so inde that even the gratif which the veri rhyme afford becom then no longer a contempt or trifl gratif howev novel thi phaenomenon may have been in germani at the time of gellert it is by no mean new nor yet of recent exist in our languag spite of the licenti with which spenser occasion compel the orthographi of hi word into a subservi to hi

without loss or injuri to hi mean but in truth our languag is and from the first dawn of poetri ever ha been particularli rich in composit distinguish by thi excel the final e which is now mute in

as the best but as the onli commend style should have proceed from a poet whose diction next to that of shakespear and milton appear to me of all other the most individu and characterist and let it be rememb too that i am now interpret the controvert passag of mr wordsworth critic prefac by the purpos and object which he may be suppos to have intend rather than by the sens which the word themselv

differ from the principl of the art gener acknowledg i can not here enter into a detail examin of mr wordsworth work but i will attempt to give the main result of my own judgment after an acquaint of mani year and repeat perus and though to appreci the defect of a great mind it is necessari to understand previous it characterist excel yet i have alreadi express myself with suffici ful to preclud most of the ill effect that might aris from my pursu a contrari arrang i will therefor commenc with what i deem the promin defect of hi poem hitherto publish the first characterist though onli occasion defect which i appear to myself to find in these poem is the inconst of the style under thi name i refer to the sudden and unprepar transit from line or sentenc of peculiar felicityat all event strike and originalto a style not onli unimpass but undistinguish he sink too often and too abruptli to that style which i should place in the second divis of languag divid it into the three speci first that which is peculiar to poetri second that which is onli proper in prose and third the neutral or common to both there have been work such as cowley essay on cromwel in which prose and vers are intermix not as in the consol of boetiu or the argeni of barclay by the insert of poem suppos to have been spoken or compos on occas previous relat in prose but the poet pass from one to the other as the natur of the thought or hi own feel dictat yet thi mode of composit doe not satisfi a cultiv tast there is someth unpleas in the be thu oblig to altern state of feel so dissimilar and thi too in a speci of write the pleasur from which is in part deriv from the prepar and previou expect of the reader a portion of that awkward is felt which hang upon the introduct of song in our modern comic opera and to prevent which the judici metastasio as to whose exquisit tast there can be no hesit whatev doubt may be entertain as to hi poetic geniu uniformli place the aria at the end of the scene at the same time that he almost alway rais and impass the style of the recit immedi preced even in real life the differ is great and evid between word use as the arbitrari mark of thought our smooth marketcoin of intercours with the imag and superscript worn out by currenc and those which convey pictur either borrow from one outward object to enliven and particular some other or use allegor to bodi forth the inward state of the person speak or such as are at least the expon of hi peculiar turn and unusu extent of faculti so much so inde that in the social circl of privat life we often find a strike use of the latter put a stop to the gener flow of convers and by the excit aris from concentr attent produc a sort of damp and interrupt for some minut after but in the perus of work of literari art we prepar ourselv for such languag and the busi of the writer like that of a painter whose subject requir unusu splendour and promin is so to rais the lower and neutral tint that what in a differ style would be the command colour are here use as the mean of that gentl degrad requisit in order to produc the effect of a whole where thi is not achiev in a poem the metr mere remind the reader of hi claim in order to disappoint them and where thi defect occur frequent hi feel are altern startl by anticlimax and hyperclimax i refer the reader to the exquisit stanza cite for anoth purpos from the blind highland boy and then annex as be in my opinion instanc of thi disharmoni in style the two follow and one the rarest wa a shell which he poor child had studi well the shell of a green turtl thin and hollowy might sit therein it wa so wide and deep our highland boy oft visit the hous which held thi prize and led by choic or chanc did thither come one day when no one wa at

thi passag is that of the two nobl line in ital with the preced and follow so vol ii page close by a pond upon the further side he stood alon a minut space i guess i watchd him he continu motionless to the pool further margin then i drew he be all the while befor me full in view compar thi with the repetit of the same imag the next stanza but two and still as i drew near with gentl pace besid the littl pond or moorish flood motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud wind when they call and moveth altogeth if it move at all or lastli the second of the three follow stanza

while he wa talk thu the lone place the old man shape and speech all troubl me in my mind eye i seem to see him pace about the weari moor continu wander about alon and silent inde thi fine poem is especi characterist of the author there is scarc a defect or excel in hi write of which it would not present a specimen but it would be unjust not to repeat that thi defect is onli occasion from a care reperus of the two volum of poem i doubt whether the objection passag would amount in the whole to one hundr line not the eighth part of the number of page in the excurs the feel of incongru is seldom excit by the diction of ani passag consid in itself but by the sudden superior of some other passag form the context the second defect i can gener with toler accuraci if the reader will pardon an uncouth and newcoin word there is i should say not seldom a matteroffact in certain poem thi may be divid into first a labori minut and fidel in the represent of object and their posit as they appear to the poet himself secondli the insert of accident circumst in order to the full explan of hi live charact their disposit and action which circumst might be necessari to establish the probabl of a statement in real life where noth is taken for grant by the hearer but appear superflu in poetri where the reader is will to believ for hi own sake to thi actident i object as contraven the

heroic poesi are not unprofit who take away the liberti of a poet and fetter hi feet in the shackl of an historian for whi should a poet doubt in stori to mend the intrigu of fortun by more delight convey of probabl fiction becaus auster historian have enter into bond to truth an oblig which were in poet as foolish and unnecessari as is the bondag of fals martyr who lie in chain for a mistaken

satisfact by half a dozen stroke of hi pencil or the painter with as mani touch of hi brush such descript too often occas in the mind of a reader who is determin to understand hi author a feel of labour not veri dissimilar to that with which he would construct a diagram line by line for a long geometr proposit it seem to be like take the piec of a dissect map out of it box we first look at one part and then at anoth then join and dovetail them and when the success act of attent have been complet there is a retrogress effort of mind to behold it as a whole the poet should paint to the imagin not to the fanci and i know no happier case to exemplifi the distinct between these two faculti masterpiec of the former mode of poetic paint abound in the write of milton for exampl the figtre not that kind for fruit renownd but such as at thi day to indian known in malabar or decan spread her arm branch so broad and long that in the ground the bend twig take root and daughter grow about the

rather than paint or if paint yet such and with such copres of the whole pictur flash at onc upon the eye as the sun paint in a camera obscura but the poet must likewis understand and command what

point of controversi between mr wordsworth and hi objector name on the choic of hi charact i have alreadi declar and i trust justifi my utter dissent from the mode of argument which hi critic have hitherto employ to their question whi did you choos such a charact or a charact from such a rank of lifeth poet might in my opinion fairli retort whi with the concept of my charact did you make wil choic of mean or ludicr associ not furnish by me but suppli from your own sickli and fastidi feel how wa it inde probabl that such argument could have ani weight with an author whose plan whose guid principl and main object it wa to attack and subdu that state of associ which lead us to place the chief valu on those thing on which man differ from man and to forget or disregard the high digniti which belong to human natur the sens and the feel which may be and ought to be found in all rank the feel with which as christian we contempl a mix congreg rise or kneel befor their common maker mr wordsworth would have us entertain at all time as men and as reader and by the excit of thi lofti yet prideless imparti in poetri he might hope to have encourag it continu in real life the prais of good men be hi in real life and i trust even in my imagin i honour a virtuou and wise man without refer to the presenc or absenc of artifici advantag whether in the person of an arm baron a laurel bard or of an old pedlar or still older leechgather the same qualiti of head and heart must claim the same rever and even in poetri i am not consciou that i have ever suffer my feel to be disturb or offend by ani thought or imag which the poet himself ha not present but yet i object nevertheless and for the follow reason first becaus the object in view as an immedi object belong to the moral philosoph and would be pursu not onli more appropri but in my opinion with far greater probabl of success in sermon or moral essay than in an elev poem it seem inde to destroy the main fundament distinct not onli between a poem and prose but even between philosophi and work of fiction inasmuch as it propos truth for it immedi object instead of pleasur now till the bless time shall come when truth itself shall be pleasur and both shall be so unit as to be distinguish in word onli not in feel it will remain the poet offic to proceed upon that state of associ which actual exist as gener instead of attempt first to make it what it ought to be and then to let the pleasur follow but here is unfortun a small hysteronproteron for the commun of pleasur is the introductori mean by which alon the poet must expect to moral hi reader secondli though i were to admit for a moment thi argument to be groundless yet how is the moral effect to be produc by mere attach the name of some low profess to power which are least like and to qualiti which are assuredli not more like to be found in it the poet speak in hi own person may at onc delight and improv us by sentiment which teach us the independ of good of wisdom and even of geniu on the favour of fortun and have made a due rever befor the throne of antonin he may bow with equal awe befor epictetu among hi fellowslav and rejoic in the plain presenc of hi digniti who is not at onc delight and improv when the poet wordsworth himself exclaim oh mani are the poet that are sown by natur men endow with highest gift the vision and the faculti divin yet want the accomplish of vers nor have eer as life advanc been led by circumst to take unto the height the measur of themselv these favour be all but a scatter few live out their time husband that which they possess within and go to the grave unthought of strongest mind are often those of whom the noisi world hear least to use a colloqui phrase such sentiment in such languag do one heart good though i for my part have not the fullest faith in the truth of the observ on the contrari i believ the instanc to be exceedingli rare and should feel almost as strong an object to introduc such a charact in a poetic fiction as a pair of black swan on a lake in a fanci landscap when i think how mani and how much better book than homer or even than herodotu pindar or aeschylu could have read are in the power of almost everi man in a countri where almost everi man is instruct to read and write and how restless how difficultli hidden the power of geniu are and yet find even in situat the most favour accord to mr wordsworth for the format of a pure and poetic languag in situat which ensur familiar with the grandest object of the imagin but one burn among the shepherd of scotland and not a singl poet of humbl life among those of english lake and mountain i conclud that poetic geniu is not onli a veri delic but a veri rare plant but be thi as it may the feel with which i think of chatterton the marvel boy the sleepless soul that perish in hi pride of burn who walkd in glori and in joy behind hi plough upon the mountainsid are wide differ from those with which i should read a poem where the author have occas for the charact of a poet and a philosoph in the fabl of hi narrat had chosen to make him a chimneysweep and then in order to remov all doubt on the subject had invent an account of hi birth parentag and educ with all the strang and fortun accid which had concur in make him at onc poet philosoph and sweep noth but biographi can justifi thi if it be admiss even in a novel it must be one in the manner of de foe that were meant to pass for histori not in the manner of field in the life of moll flander or colonel jack not in a tom jone or even a joseph andrew much less then can it be legitim introduc in a poem the charact of which amid the strongest individu must still remain repres the precept of horac on thi point are ground on the natur both of poetri and of the human mind they are not more peremptori than wise and prudent for in the first place a deviat from them perplex the reader feel and all the circumst which are feign in order to make such accid less improb divid and disquiet hi faith rather than aid and support it spite of all attempt the fiction will appear and unfortun not as fictiti but as fals the reader not onli know that the sentiment and languag are the poet own and hi own too in hi artifici charact as poet but by the fruitless endeavour to make him think the contrari he is not even suffer to forget it the effect is similar to that produc by an epic poet when the fabl and the charact are deriv from scriptur histori as in the messiah of klopstock or in cumberland calvari and not mere suggest by it as in the paradis lost of milton that illus contradistinguish from delus that neg faith which simpli permit the imag present to work by their own forc without either denial or affirm of their real exist by the judgment is render imposs by their immedi neighbourhood to word and fact of known and absolut truth a faith which transcend even histor belief must absolut put out thi mere poetic analogon of faith as the summer sun is said to extinguish our household fire when it shine full upon them what would otherwis have been yield to as pleas fiction is repel as revolt falsehood the effect produc in thi latter case by the solemn belief of the reader is in a less degre brought about in the instanc to which i have been object by the balk attempt of the author to make him believ add to all the

to contain the explan to whom the grave is but a lone bed without the sens or sight of day or the warm light a place of thought where we in wait lie sure it can not be that thi wonderr apostroph is but a comment on the littl poem we are seventhat the whole mean of the passag is reduc to the assert that a child who by the bye at six year old would have been better instruct in most christian famili ha no other notion of death than that of lie in a dark cold place and still i hope not as in a place of thought not the fright notion of lie awak in hi grave the analog between death and sleep is too simpl too natur to render so horrid a belief possibl for children even had they not been in the habit as all christian children are of hear the latter term use to express the former but if the

arriv at ani sens and accord to their common import if you are to receiv from them ani feel of sublim or admir though the instanc of thi defect in mr wordsworth poem are so few that for themselv it

without hi depth of feel and hi imagin power hi sens would want it vital warmth and peculiar and without hi strong sens hi mystic would becom sicklymer fog and dim to these defect which as appear by

therefor feed as the mani direct them or with the mani are greedi after viciou provoc so much for the detractor from wordsworth merit on the other hand much as i might wish for their fuller sympathi i

humbert their proceed in ireland with regard to the committe which they had appoint with the rest of their organ system seem to have given the poet great entertain he then declar hi sanguin belief in nelson victori and anticip it confirm with a keen and triumphant pleasur hi word tone look impli the most vehement antigallican the subject chang to literatur and i inquir in latin concern the histori of german poetri and the elder german poet to my great astonish he confess that he knew veri littl on the subject he had inde occasion read one or two of their elder writer but not so as to enabl him to speak of their merit professor ebel he said would probabl give me everi inform of thi kind the subject had not particularli excit hi curios he then talk of milton and glover and thought glover blank vers superior to milton w and myself express our surpris and my friend gave hi definit and notion of harmoni vers that it consist the english iambic blank vers abov all in the apt arrang of paus and cadenc and the sweep of whole paragraph with mani a wind bout of link sweet long drawn out and not in the even flow much less in the promin of antithet vigour of singl line which were inde injuri to the total effect except where they were introduc for some specif purpos klopstock assent and said that he meant to confin glover superior to singl line he told us that he had read milton in a prose translat when he wa fourteen i understood him thu myself and w interpret klopstock french as i had alreadi constru it he appear to know veri littl of milton or inde of our poet in gener he spoke with great indign of the english prose translat of hi messiah all the translat had been bad veri badbut the english wa no translationther were page on page not in the originaland half the origin wa not to be found in the translat w told him that i intend to translat a few of hi ode as specimen of german lyricsh then said to me in english i wish you would render into english some select passag of the messiah and reveng me of your countryman it wa the liveliest thing which he produc in the whole convers he told us that hi first ode wa fifti year older than hi last i look at him with much emotioni consid him as the vener father of german poetri as a good man as a christian seventyfour year old with leg enorm swollen yet activ live cheer and kind and commun my eye felt as if a tear were swell into them in the portrait of less there wa a toupe periwig which enorm injur the effect of hi physiognomyklopstock wore the same powder and frizzl by the bye old men ought never to wear powderth contrast between a larg snowwhit wig and the colour of an old man skin is disgust and wrinkl in such a neighbourhood appear onli channel for dirt it is an honour to poet and great men that you think of them as part of natur and anyth of trick and fashion wound you in them as much as when you see vener yew clip into miser peacocksth author of the messiah should have worn hi own grey hairhi powder and periwig were to the eye what mr virgil would be to the ear klopstock dwelt much on the superior power which the german languag possess of concentr mean he said he had often translat part of homer and virgil line by line and a german line prove alway suffici for a greek or latin one in english you can not do thi i answer that in english we could commonli render one greek heroic line in a line and a half of our common heroic metr and i conjectur that thi line and a half would be found to contain no more syllabl than one german or greek hexamet he did not understand me and i who wish to hear hi opinion not to correct them wa glad that he did not we now took our leav at the begin of the french revolut klopstock wrote ode of congratul he receiv some honorari present from the french republ a golden crown i believ and like our priestley wa invit to a seat in the legislatur which he declin but when french liberti metamorphos herself into a furi he sent back these present with a palinodia declar hi abhorr of their proceed and sinc then he ha been perhap more than enough an antigallican i mean that in hi just contempt and detest of the crime and folli of the revolutionist he suffer himself to forget that the revolut itself is a process of the divin provid and that as the folli of men is the wisdom of god so are their iniqu instrument of hi good from klopstock hous we walk to the

femal servant and person in the same class of life and all their cap have gold and silver caul it appear like a rich pavement of gold and silver i will conclud thi letter with the mere transcript of note which my friend w made of hi convers with klopstock dure the interview that took place after my departur on these i shall make but one remark at present and that will appear a presumptu one name that klopstock remark on the vener sage of koenigsburg are to my own knowledg injuri and mistaken and so far is it from be true that hi system is now given up that throughout the univers of germani there is not a singl professor who is not either a kantean or a discipl of ficht whose system is built on the kantean and presuppos it truth or lastli who though an antagonist of kant as to hi theoret work ha not embrac wholli or in part hi moral system and adopt part of hi nomenclatur klopstock have wish to see the calvari of cumberland and ask what wa thought of it in england i went to remnant the english booksel where i procur the analyt review in which is contain the review of cumberland calvari i rememb to have read there some specimen of a blank vers translat of the messiah i had mention thi to klopstock and he had a great desir to see them i walk over to hi hous and put the book into hi hand on advert to hi own poem he told me he began the messiah when he wa seventeen he devot three entir year to the plan without compos a singl line he wa greatli at a loss in what manner to execut hi work there were no success specimen of versif in the german languag befor thi time the first three canto he wrote in a speci of measur or numer prose thi though done with much labour and some success wa far from satisfi him he had compos hexamet both latin and greek as a school exercis and there had been also in the german languag attempt in that style of versif these were onli of veri moder meriton day he wa struck with the idea of what could be done in thi wayh kept hi room a whole day even went without hi dinner and found that in the even he had written twentythre hexamet versifi a part of what he had befor written in prose from that time pleas with hi effort he compos no more in prose today he inform me that he had finish hi plan befor he read milton he wa enchant to see an author who befor him had trod the same path thi is a contradict of what he said befor he did not wish to speak of hi poem to ani one till it wa finish but some of hi friend who had seen what he had finish torment him till he had consent to publish a few book in a journal he wa then i believ veri young about twentyf the rest wa print at differ period four book at a time the recept given to the first specimen wa highli flatter he wa nearli thirti year in finish the whole poem but of these thirti year not more than two were employ in the composit he onli compos in favour moment besid he had other occup he valu himself upon the plan of hi ode and accus the modern lyric writer of gross defici in thi respect i laid the same accus against horac he would not hear of itbut waiv the discuss he call rousseau ode to fortun a moral dissert in stanza i spoke of dryden st cecilia but he did not seem familiar with our writer he wish to know the distinct between our dramat and epic blank vers he recommend me to read hi hermann befor i read either the messiah or the ode he flatter himself that some time or other hi dramat poem would be known in england he had not heard of cowper he thought that voss in hi translat of the iliad had done violenc to the idiom of the german and had sacrif it to the greek not rememb suffici that each languag ha it particular spirit and geniu he said less wa the first of their dramat writer i complain of nathan as tediou he said there wa not enough of action in it but that less wa the most chast of their writer he spoke favour of goeth but said that hi sorrow of werter wa hi best work better than ani of hi drama he prefer the first written to the rest of goeth drama schiller robber he found so extravag that he could not read it i spoke of the scene of the set sun he did not know it he said schiller could not live he thought don carlo the best of hi drama but said that the plot wa inextricableit wa evid he knew littl of schiller work inde he said he could not read them buerger he said wa a true poet and would live that schiller on the contrari must soon be forgotten that he gave himself up to the imit of shakespear who often wa extravag but that schiller wa ten thousand time more so he spoke veri slightingli of kotzebu as an immor author in the first place and next as defici in power at vienna said he they are transport with him but we do not reckon the peopl of vienna either the wisest or the wittiest peopl of germani he said wieland wa a charm author and a sovereign master of hi own languag that in thi respect goeth could not be compar to him nor inde could ani bodi els he said that hi fault wa to be fertil to exuber i told him the oberon had just been translat into english he ask me if i wa not delight with the poem i answer that i thought the stori began to flag about the seventh or eighth book and observ that it wa unworthi of a man of geniu to make the interest of a long poem turn entir upon anim gratif he seem at first dispos to excus thi by say that there are differ subject for poetri and that poet are not will to be restrict in their choic i answer that i thought the passion of love as well suit to the purpos of poetri as ani other passion but that it wa a cheap way of pleas to fix the attent of the reader through a long poem on the mere appetit well but said he you see that such poem pleas everi bodi i answer that it wa the provinc of a great poet to rais peopl up to hi own level not to descend to their he agre and confess that on no account whatsoev would he have written a work like the oberon he spoke in raptur of wieland style and point out the passag where retzia is deliv of her child as exquisit beauti i said that i did not perceiv ani veri strike passag but that i made allow for the imperfect of a translat of the theft of wieland he said they were so exquisit manag that the greatest writer might be proud to steal as he did he consid the book and fabl of old romanc writer in the light of the ancient mytholog as a sort of common properti from which a man wa free to take whatev he could make a good use of an englishman had present him with the ode of collin which he had read with pleasur he knew littl or noth of gray except hi elegi written in a countri churchyard he complain of the fool in lear i observ that he seem to give a terribl wild to the distress but still he complain he ask whether it wa not allow that pope had written rhyme poetri with more skill than ani of our writersi said i prefer dryden becaus hi couplet had greater varieti in their movement he thought my reason a good one but ask whether the rhyme of pope were not more exact thi question i understood as appli to the final termin and observ to him that i believ it wa the case but that i thought it wa easi to excus some inaccuraci in the final sound if the gener sweep of the vers wa superior i told him that we were not so exact with regard to the final end of the line as the french he did not seem to know that we made no distinct between masculin and feminin ie singl or doubl rhyme at least he put inquiri to me on thi subject he seem to think that no languag could be so far form as that it might not be enrich by idiom borrow from anoth tongu i said thi wa a veri danger practic and ad that i thought milton had often injur both hi prose and vers by take thi liberti too frequent i recommend to him the prose work of dryden as model of pure and nativ english i wa tread upon tender ground as i have reason to suppos that he ha himself liber indulg in the practic the same day i dine at mr klopstock where i had the pleasur of a third interview with the poet we talk princip about indiffer thing i ask him what he thought of kant he said that hi reput wa much on the declin in germani that for hi own part he wa not surpris to find it so as the work of kant were to him utterli incomprehensiblethat he had often been pester by the kantean but wa rare in the practic of argu with them hi custom wa to produc the book open it and point to a passag and beg they would explain it thi they ordinarili attempt to do by substitut their own idea i do not want i say an explan of your own idea but of the passag which is befor us in thi way i gener bring the disput to an immedi conclus he spoke of wolf as the first metaphysician they had in germani wolf had follow but they could hardli be call a sect and luckili till the appear of kant about fifteen year ago germani had not been pester by ani sect of philosoph whatsoev but that each man had separ pursu hi inquiri uncontrol by the dogma of a master kant had appear ambiti to be the founder of a sect that he had succeed but that the german were now come to their sens again that nicolai and engel had in differ way contribut to disench the nation but abov all the incomprehens of the philosoph and hi philosophi he seem pleas to hear that as yet kant doctrin had not met with mani admir in englanddid not doubt but that we had too much wisdom to be dupe by a writer who set at defianc the common sens and common understand of men we talk of tragedi he seem to rate highli the power of excit tearsi said that noth wa more easi than to delug an audienc that it wa done everi day by the meanest writer i must remind you my friend first that these note are not intend as specimen of klopstock intellectu power or even colloqui prowess to judg of which by an accident convers and thi with stranger and those too foreign would be not onli unreason but calumni secondli i attribut littl other interest to the remark than what is deriv from the celebr of the person who made them lastli if you ask me whether i have read the messiah and what i think of it i answera yet the first four book onli and as to my opinionth reason of which hereaftery may guess it from what i could not help mutter to myself

wa less who first introduc the name and the work of shakespear to the admir of the german and i should not perhap go too far if i add that it wa less who first prove to all think men even to shakespear own countrymen the true natur of hi appar irregular these he demonstr were deviat onli from the accid of the greek tragedi and from such accid as hung a heavi weight on the wing of the greek poet and narrow their flight within the limit of what we may call the heroic opera he prove that in all the essenti of art no less than in the truth of natur the play of shakespear were incompar

concern thi product with more than need asper as a monster not less offens to good tast than to sound moral and in hi latter year hi indign at the unwont popular of the robber seduc him into the contrari extrem viz a studi feebl of interest as far as the interest wa to be deriv from incid and the excit of curios a diction elabor metric the affect of rhyme and the pedantri of the choru but to understand the true charact of the robber and of the countless imit which were it spawn i must inform you or at least call to your recollect that about that time and for some year befor it three of the most popular book in the german languag were the translat of young night thought hervey medit and richardson clarissa harlow now we have onli to combin the bloat style and peculiar rhythm of hervey which is poetic onli on account of it utter unfit for prose and might as appropri be call prosaic from it utter unfit for poetri we have onli i repeat to combin these hervey with the strain thought the figur metaphys and solemn epigram of young on the one hand and with the load sensibl the minut detail the morbid conscious of everi thought and feel in the whole flux and reflux of the mind in short the selfinvolut and dreamlik continu of richardson on the other hand and then to add the horrif incid and mysteri villain genius of supernatur intellect if you will take the author word

wild of shakespear in which the german did but echo the french who again were but the echo of our own critic wa still in vogu and shakespear wa quot as author for the most antishakespearean drama we have inde two poet who wrote as one near the age of shakespear to whom as the worst characterist of their write the coryphaeu of the present drama may challeng the honour of be a poor relat or impoverish descend for if we would charit consent to forget the comic humour the wit the felic of style in other word all the poetri and ninetenth of all the geniu of beaumont and fletcher that which

recognis in thi figur it is enough that such a figur is not ideal and therefor not ideal becaus one of the two factor or element of the ideal is in excess a similar and more power object he would feel toward a set of figur which were mere abstract like those of cipriani and what have been call greek form and face that is outlin drawn accord to a recip these again are not ideal becaus in these the

moral of a moral that ha more than common claim on the notic of a too numer class who are readi to receiv the qualiti of gentlemanli courag and scrupul honour in all the recognis law of honour as the substitut of virtu instead of it ornament thi inde is the moral valu of the play at larg and that which place it at a world distanc from the spirit of modern jacobin the latter introduc to us clumsi copi of these showi instrument qualiti in order to reconcil us to vice and want of principl while the atheista fulminato present an exquisit portraitur of the same qualiti in all their gloss and glow but present them for the sole purpos of display their hollow and in order to put us on our guard by demonstr their utter indiffer to vice and virtu whenev these and the like accomplish are contempl for themselv alon eighteen year ago i observ that the whole secret of the modern jacobin drama which and not the german is it appropri design and of all it popular consist in the confus and subvers of the natur order of thing in their caus and effect name in the excit of surpris by repres the qualiti of liber refin feel and a nice sens of honour those thing rather which pass amongst us for such in person and in class where experi teach us least to expect them and by reward with all the sympathi which are the due of virtu those crimin whom law reason and religion have excommun from our esteem thi of itself would lead me back to bertram or the castl of st aldobrand but in my own mind thi tragedi wa brought into connect with the libertin shadwel adapt of the atheista fulminato to the english stage in the reign of charl the second by the fact that our modern drama is taken in the substanc of it from the first scene of the third act of the libertin but with what palpabl superior of judgment in the origin earth and hell men and spirit are up in arm against don john the two former act of the play have not onli prepar us for the supernatur but accustom us to the prodigi it is therefor neither more nor less than we anticip when the captain exclaim in all the danger i have been such horror i never knew i am quit unman and when the hermit say that he had beheld the ocean in wildest rage yet neer befor saw a storm so dread such horrid flash of lightn and such clap of thunder were never in my remembr and don john burst of startl impieti is equal intellig in it motiv as dramat in it effect but what is there to account for the prodigi of the tempest at bertram shipwreck it is a mere supernatur effect without even a hint of ani supernatur agenc a prodigi without ani circumst mention that is prodigi and a miracl introduc without a ground and end without a result everi event and everi scene of the play might have taken place as well if bertram and hi vessel had been driven in by a common hard gale or from want of provis the first act would have inde lost it greatest and most sonor pictur a scene for the sake of a scene without a word spoken as such therefor a rariti without a preced we must take it and be thank in the opinion of not a few it wa in everi sens of the word the best scene in the play i am quit certain it wa the most innoc and the steadi quiet upright of the flame of the waxcandl which the monk held over the roar billow amid the storm of wind and rain wa realli miracul the sicilian sea coast a convent of monk night a most portent unearthli storm a

most brief and surli answer and after three or four of these halflin courtesi dash off the monk who had save him he exclaim in the true sublim of our modern misanthrop heroism off ye are menther poison in your touch but i must yield for thi what hath left me strengthless so end the three first scene in the next the castl of st aldobrand we find the servant there equal frighten with thi unearthli storm though wherein it differ from other violent storm we are not told except that hugo inform us page piethugo well met doe een thi age bear memori of so terribl a storm hugothey have been

as well concern the particular point in which he knew it dure it continu to differ from those that he had been acquaint with in hi youth we are at length introduc to the ladi imogin who we learn had not rest through the night not on account of the tempest for long ere the storm aros her restless gestur forbad all hope to see her blest with sleep sit at a tabl and look at a portrait she inform

the mani year of their separ there have happen in the differ part of the world a number of such thing even such as in a cours of year alway have and till the millennium doubtless alway will happen somewher or other yet thi passag both in languag and in metr is perhap amongst the best part of the play the ladi love companion and most esteem attend clotilda now enter and explain thi love and

the remark wa not without foundat for the german possess the same unlimit privileg of form compound both with preposit and with epithet as the greek it can express the richest singl greek word in a singl german one and is thu freed from the necess of weak or ungrac paraphras i will content myself with one at present viz the use of the prefix participl ver zer ent and weg thu reissen to rend
