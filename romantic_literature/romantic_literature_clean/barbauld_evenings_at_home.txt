him littl jack said to him papa pray tell us some stori about what you have seen in your voyag i have been vastli entertain while you were abroad with gulliv travel and the adventur of sinbad the sailor and i think as you have gone round and round the world you must have met with thing as wonder as they did—no my dear said the captain i never met with lilliputian or brobdignagian i assur you nor ever saw the black loadston mountain or the valley of diamond but to be sure i have seen a great varieti of peopl and their differ manner and way of live and if it will be ani entertain to you i will tell you some curiou particular of what i observed—pray do papa cri jack and all hi brother and sister so they drew close round him and he began as follows— well then—i wa onc about thi time of the year in a countri where it wa veri cold and the poor inhabit had much ado to keep themselv from starv they were clad partli in the skin of beast made smooth and soft by a particular art but chiefli in garment made from the outward cover of a middles quadrup which they were so cruel as to strip off hi back while he wa aliv they dwelt in habit part of which wa sunk underground the materi were either stone or earth harden by fire and so violent in that countri were the storm of wind and rain that mani of them cover their roof all over with stone the wall of their hous had hole to let in the light but to prevent the cold air and wet from come in they were cover by a sort of transpar stone made artifici of melt sand or flint as wood wa rather scarc i know not what they would have done for fire had they not discov in the bowel of the earth a veri extraordinari kind of stone which when put among burn wood caught fire and flame like a torch dear me said jack what a wonder stone i suppos it wa somewhat like what we call fireston that shine so when we rub them together—i dont think they would burn repli the captain besid these are of a darker colour well—but their diet too wa remark some of them ate fish that had been hung up in the smoke till they were quit dri and hard and along with it they ate either the root of plant or a sort of coars black cake made of powder seed these were the poorer class the richer had a whiter kind of cake which they were fond of daub over with a greasi matter that wa the product of a larg anim among them thi greas they use too in almost all their dish and when fresh it realli wa not unpalat they likewis devour the flesh of mani bird and beast when they could get it and ate the leav and other part of a varieti of veget grow in the countri some absolut raw other various prepar by the aid of fire anoth great articl of food wa the curd of milk press into a hard mass and salt thi had so rank a smell that person of weak stomach often could not bear to come near it for drink they made great use of the water in which certain dri leav had been steep these leav i wa told came from a great distanc they had likewis a method of prepar a liquor of the seed of a grasslik plant steep in water with the addit of a bitter herb and then set to work or ferment i wa prevail upon to tast it and thought it at first nauseou enough but in time i like it pretti well when a larg quantiti of the ingredi is use it becom perfectli intox but what astonish me most wa their use of a liquor so excess hot and pungent that it seem like liquid fire i onc got a mouth of it by mistak take it for water which it resembl in appear but i thought it would instantli have taken away my breath inde peopl are not unfrequ kill by it and yet mani of them will swallow it greedili whenev they can get it thi too is said to be prepar from the seed abovement which are innoc and even salutari in their natur state though made to yield such a pernici juic the strangest custom that i believ prevail in ani nation i found here which wa that some take a mighti pleasur in fill their mouth full of stink smoke and other in thrust a nasti powder up their nostril i should think it would choke them said jack it almost did me answer hi father onli to stand by while they did it—but use it is truli said is second natur i wa glad enough to leav thi cold climat and about half a year after i fell in with a peopl enjoy a delici temperatur of air and a countri full of beauti and verdur the tree and shrub were furnish with a great varieti of fruit which with other veget product constitut a larg part of the food of the inhabit i particularli relish certain berri grow in bunch some white and some red of a veri pleasant sourish tast and so transpar that one might see the seed at their veri centr here were whole field full of extrem odorifer flower which they told me were succeed by pod bear seed that afford good nourish to man and beast a great varieti of bird enliven the grove and wood among which i wa entertain with one that without ani teach spoke almost as articul as a parrot though inde it wa onli a repetit of a singl word the peopl were toler gentl and civil and possess mani of the art of life their dress wa veri variou mani were clad onli in a thin cloth made of the long fibr of the stalk of a plant cultiv for the purpos which they prepar by soak in water and then beat with larg mallet other wore cloth woven from a sort of veget wool grow in pod upon bush but the most singular materi wa a fine glossi stuff use chiefli by the richer class which as i wa credibl inform is manufactur out of the web of caterpillars—a most wonder circumst if we consid the immens number of caterpillar necessari to the product of so larg a quantiti of stuff as i saw use thi peopl are veri fantast in their dress especi the women whose apparel consist of a great number of articl imposs to be describ and strang disguis the natur form of the bodi in some instanc they seem veri cleanli but in other the hottentot can scarc go beyond them particularli in the manag of their hair which is all mat and stiffen with the fat of swine and other anim mix up with powder of variou colour and ingredi like most indian nation they use feather in their headdress one thing surpris me much which wa that they bring up in their hous an anim of the tigerkind with formid teeth and claw which notwithstand it natur feroc is play with and caress by the most timid and delic of their women i am sure i would not play with it said jack whi you might chanc to get an ugli scratch if you did said the captain the languag of thi nation seem veri harsh and unintellig to a foreign yet they convers among one anoth with great eas and quick one of the oddest custom is that which men use on salut each other let the weather be what it will they uncov their head and remain uncov for some time if they mean to be extraordinarili respect whi that like pull off our hat said jack—ah ah papa cri betsi i have found you out you have been tell us of our own countri and what is done at home all thi while—but said jack we dont burn stone or eat greas and powder seed or wear skin and caterpillar web or play with tigers—no said the captain—pray what are coal but stone and is not butter greas and corn seed and leather skin and silk the web of a kind of caterpillar and may we not as well call a cat an anim of the tiger kind as a tiger an anim of the catkind so if you recollect what i have been describ you will find with betsi help that all the other wonder thing i have told you of are matter familiar among ourselv but i meant to show you that a foreign might easili repres everyth as equal strang and wonder among us as we could do with respect to hi countri and also to make you sensibl that we daili call a great mani thing by their name without ever inquir into their natur and properti so that in realiti it is onli their name and not the thing themselv with which we are acquaint the discont squirrel in a pleasant wood on the western side of a ridg of mountain there live a squirrel who had pass two or three year of hi life veri happili at length he began to grow discont and one day fell into the follow soliloquy— what must i spend all my time in thi spot run up and down the same tree gather nut and acorn and doze away month togeth in a hole i see a great mani of the bird who inhabit thi wood rambl about to a distanc wherev their fanci lead them and at the approach of winter set out for some remot countri where they enjoy summer weather all the year round my neighbour cuckoo tell me he is just go and even littl nightingal will soon follow to be sure i have not wing like them but i have leg nimbl enough and if one doe not use them one might as well be a mole or a dormous i dare say i could easili reach to that blue ridg which i see from the top of the tree which no doubt must be a fine place for the sun come directli from it everi morn and it often appear all cover with red and yellow and the finest colour imagin there can be no harm at least in tri for i can soon get back again if i dont like it i am resolv to go and i will set out tomorrow morn when squirrel had taken thi resolut he could not sleep all night for think of it and at peep of day prudent take with him as much provis as he could conveni carri he began hi journey in high spirit he present got to the outsid of the wood and enter upon the open moor that reach to the foot of the hill these he cross befor the sun wa gotten high and then have eaten hi breakfast with an excel appetit he began to ascend it wa heavi toilsom work scrambl up the steep side of the mountain but squirrel wa use to climb so for awhil he proceed expediti often howev wa he oblig to stop and take breath so that it wa a good deal past noon befor he had arriv at the summit of the first cliff here he sat down to eat hi dinner and look back wa wonder pleas with the fine prospect the wood in which he live lay far beneath hi feet and he view with scorn the humbl habit in which he had been born and bred when he look forward howev he wa somewhat discourag to observ that anoth emin rose abov him full as distant as that to which he had alreadi reach and he now began to feel stiff and fatigu howev after a littl rest he set out again though not so briskli as befor the ground wa rug brown and bare and to hi great surpris instead of find it warmer as he got nearer the sun he felt it grow colder and colder he had not travel two hour befor hi strength and spirit were almost spent and he serious thought of give up the point and return befor night should come on while he wa thu deliber with himself cloud began to gather round the mountain and to take away all view of distant object present a storm of mingl snow and hail came down driven by a violent wind which pelt poor squirrel most piti and made him quit unabl to move forward or backward besid he had complet lost hi road and did not know which way to turn toward that despis home which it wa now hi onli desir again to reach the storm last till the approach of night and it wa as much as he could do benumb and weari as he wa to crawl to the hollow of a rock at some distanc which wa the best lodg he could find for the night hi provis were spent so that hungri and shiver he crept into the farthest corner of the cavern and roll himself up with hi bushi tail over hi back he got a littl sleep though disturb by the cold and the shrill whistl of the wind among the stone the morn broke over the distant top of the mountain when squirrel half frozen and famish came out of hi lodg and advanc as well as he could toward the brow of the hill that he might discov which way to take as he wa slowli creep along a hungri kite soar in the air abov descri him and make a stoop carri him off in her talon poor squirrel lose hi sens with the fright wa born away with vast rapid and seem inevit doom to becom food for the kite young one when an eagl who had seen the kite seiz her prey pursu her in order to take it from her and overtak her gave her such a buffet as caus her to drop the squirrel in order to defend herself the poor anim kept fall through the air a long time till at last he alight in the midst of a thick tree the leav and tender bough of which so broke hi fall that though stun and breathless he escap without materi injuri and after lie a while came to himself again but what wa hi pleasur and surpris to find himself in the veri tree which contain hi nest ah said he my dear nativ place and peac home if ever i am again tempt to leav you may i undergo a second time all the miseri and danger from which i have now so wonder escap illustr the mask of natur p even ii on the marten look up my dear said hi papa to littl william at those birdsnest abov the chamberwindow beneath the eav of the hous some you see are just begun—noth but a littl clay stuck against the wall other are half finish and other are quit built—clos and tight—leav noth but a small hole for the bird to come in and go out at what are they said william they are marten nest repli hi father and there you see the owner how busili they fli backward and forward bring clay and dirt in their bill and lay it upon their work form it into shape with their bill and feet the nest are built veri strong and thick like a mud wall and are line with feather to make a soft bed for the young marten are a kind of swallow they feed on fli gnat and other insect and alway build in town and villag about the hous peopl do not molest them for they do good rather than harm and it is veri amus to view their manner and action see how swiftli they skim through the air in pursuit of their prey in the morn they are up by daybreak and twitter about your window while you are asleep in bed and all day long they are upon the wing get food for themselv and their young as soon as they have caught a few fli they hasten to their nest pop into the hole and feed their littl one ill tell you a stori about the great care they take of their young a pair of marten onc built their nest in a porch and when they had young one it happen that one of them climb up to the hole befor he wa fledg fell out and light upon the stone wa kill the old bird perceiv thi accid went and got short bit of strong straw and stuck them with mud like palisad all round the hole of the nest in order to keep the other littl one from tumbl after their poor brother how cun that wa cri william ye said hi father and i can tell you anoth stori of their sagac and also of their disposit to help one anoth a sauci cocksparrow you know what impud rogu they are had got into a marten nest while the owner wa abroad and when he return the sparrow put hi head out of the hole and peck at the marten with open bill as he attempt to enter hi own hous the poor marten wa sadli provok at thi injustic but wa unabl by hi own strength to right himself so he flew away and gather a number of hi companion who all came with bit of clay in their bill with which they plaster up the hole of the nest and kept the sparrow in prison who die miser for want of food and air he wa rightli serv said william so he wa rejoin hi papa well i have more to say about the sagac of these bird in autumn when it begin to be cold weather the other swallow assembl upon the roof of high build and prepar for their departur to a warmer countri for as all the insect here die in the winter they would have noth to live on if they were to stay they take sever short flight in flock round and round in order to tri their strength and then on some fine calm day they set out togeth for a long journey southward over sea and land to a veri distant countri but how do they find their way said william we say answer hi father that they are taught by instinct that is god ha implant in their mind a desir of travel at the season which he know to be proper and ha also given them an impuls to take the right road they steer their cours through the wide air directli to the proper spot sometim howev storm and contrari wind meet them and drive the poor bird about till they are quit spent and fall into the sea unless they happen to meet with a ship on which they can light and rest themselv the swallow from thi countri are suppos to go as far as the middl of africa to spend the winter where the weather is alway warm and insect are to be met with all the year in spring they take anoth long journey back again to these northern countri sometim when we have fine weather veri earli a few of them come too soon for when it chang to frost and snow again the poor creatur are starv for want of food or perish from the cold henc aris the proverb one swallow doe not make a summer but when a great mani of them are come we may be sure that winter is over so that we are alway veri glad to see them again the marten find their way back over a great length of sea and land to the veri same villag and hous where they were bred thi ha been discov by catch some of them and mark them they repair their old nest or build new one and then set about lay egg and hatch their young pretti thing i

repli the other i am inde a sort of stranger for you must know i am but just return from a long journey a journey whither pray and on what account a tour of mere curios i had long felt dissatisfi with know so littl about thi world of our so at length i took a resolut to explor it and i may now boast that i have gone round it utmost extrem and that no consider part of it ha escap my research wonder what a travel you have been and what sight you must have seen whi yes—i have seen more than most ant to be sure but it ha been at the expens of so much toil and danger that i know not whether it wa worth the pain would you oblig me with some account of your adventur willingli i set out then earli one sunshini morn and after cross our territori and the line of plantat by which it is border i came upon a wide open plain where as far as the eye could reach not a singl green thing wa to be descri but the hard soil wa everywher cover with huge stone which made travel equal pain to the eye and the feet as i wa toil onward i heard a rumbl nois behind me which becam louder and louder i look back and with the utmost horror beheld a prodigi roll mountain approach me so fast that it wa imposs to get out of the way i threw myself flat on the ground behind a stone and lay expect noth but present death the mountain soon pass over me and i continu i know not how long in a state of insens when i recov i began to stretch my limb one by one and to my surpris found myself not in the least injur but the stone besid me wa almost buri in the earth by the crash what an escap a wonder one inde i journey on over the desert and at length came to the end of it and enter upon a wide green tract consist chiefli of tall narrow point leav which grew so thick and entangl that it wa with the greatest difficulti i could make my way between them and i should continu have lost my road had i not taken care to keep the sun in view befor me when i had got near the middl of thi region i wa startl with the sight of a huge fourleg monster with a yellow speckl skin which took a fli leap directli over me somewhat farther befor i wa awar i ran upon one of those long round crawl creatur without head tail or leg which we sometim meet with under ground near our settlement as soon as he felt me upon him he drew back into hi hole so swiftli that he wa near draw me in along with him howev i jump off and proceed on my way with much labour i got at last to the end of thi perplex tract and came to an open space like that in which we live in the midst of which grew tree so tall that i could not see to their top be hungri i climb the first i came to in expect of find some fruit but after a weari search i return empti i tri sever other with no better success there were inde leav and flower in plenti but noth of which i could make a meal so that i might have been famish had i not found some sour harsh berri upon the ground on which i made a poor repast while i wa do thi a greater danger than ani of the former befel me one of those twoleg feather creatur which we often see to our cost jump down from a bough and pick up in hi enorm beak the veri berri on which i wa stand luckili he did not swallow it immedi but flew up again with it to the tree and in the meantim i disengag myself and fell from a vast height to the ground but receiv no hurt i cross thi plantat and came to anoth entangl green like the first after i had labour through it i came on a sudden to the side of a vast glitter plain the natur of which i could not possibl guess at i walk along a fallen leaf which lay on the side and come to the farther edg of it i wa greatli surpris to see anoth ant come from below to meet me i advanc to give him a fratern embrac but instead of what i expect i met a cold yield matter in which i should have sunk had i not speedili turn about and caught hold of the leaf by which i drew myself up again and now i found thi great plain to consist of that fluid which sometim fall from the sky and caus so much troubl by fill our hole as i stood consid how to proceed on my journey a gentl breez aros which befor i wa awar carri the leaf i wa upon away from the solid land into thi yield fluid which howev bore it up and me along with it at first i wa greatli alarm and ran round and round my leaf in order to find some way of get back but perceiv thi to be impractic i resign myself to my fate and even began to take some pleasur in the easi motion by which i wa born forward but what new and wonder form of live creatur did i see inhabit thi liquid land bodi of prodigi bulk cover with shine scale of variou colour shot by me with vast rapid and sport a thousand way they had larg head and stare eye tremend wide mouth but no leg and they seem to be carri on by the action of someth like small wing plant on variou part of the bodi and especi at the end of the tail which continu wave about other smaller creatur of a great varieti of extraordinari form were move through the clear fluid or rest upon it surfac and i saw with terror number of them continu seiz and swallow by the larger one beforement when i had got near the middl the smooth surfac of thi plain wa all roughen and move up and down so as to toss about my leaf and nearli overset it i trembl to think what would becom of me should i be thrown amidst all these terribl monster at last howev i got safe to the other side and with joy set my feet on dri land again i ascend a gentl green slope which led to a tall plantat like that i had befor pass through anoth green plain and anoth stoni desert succeed which brought me at length to the opposit boundari of our world enclos by the same immens mound rise to the heaven which limit us on thi side here i fell in with anoth nation of our speci differ littl in way of life from ourselv they invit me to their settlement and entertain me hospit and i accompani them in sever excurs in the neighbourhood there wa a charm fruittre at no great distanc to which we made frequent visit one day as i wa regal delici on the heart of a greengag plum i felt myself on a sudden carri along with great swift till i got into a dark place where a horrid crash threw me upon a soft moist piec of flesh whenc i wa soon driven forth in a torrent of wind and moistur and found myself on the ground all cover with slime i disengag myself with difficulti and look up descri one of those enorm twoleg anim which often shake the ground over our head and put us in terror my new friend now began to hint to me that it wa time to depart for you know we are not fond of natur stranger and lucki inde it wa for me that i receiv the hint when i did for i had but just left the place and wa travel over a neighbour emin when i heard behind me a tremend nois and look back i saw the whole of their settlement blown into the air with a prodigi explos of fire and smoke number of halfburnt bodi togeth with the ruin of their habit were thrown to a vast distanc around and such a suffoc vapour aros that i lay for some time depriv of sens and motion from some of the wretch fugit i learn that the disast wa attribut to subterranean fire burst it way to the surfac the caus of which howev wa suppos to be connect with the machin of that malign twoleg monster from whose jaw i had so narrowli escap who had been observ just befor the explos to pour through the hole lead to the great apart of the settlement a number of black shine grain on my return from thi remot countri i kept along the boundarywal which i knew by observ must at length bring me back to my own home i met with sever wander

learn truth from your disgrac dialogu on thing to be learn between mamma and kitti kitti pray mamma may i leav off work i am tire mamma you have done veri littl my dear you know you were to finish all that hem k but i had rather write now mamma or read or get my french grammar m i know veri well what that mean kitti you had rather do anyth than what i set you about k no mamma but you know i can work veri well alreadi and i have a great mani more thing to learn there miss rich that can not sew half so well as i and she is learn music and draw alreadi besid danc and i dont know how mani other thing she tell me that they hardli work at all in their school m your tongu run at a great rate my dear but in the first place you can not sew veri well for if you could you would not have been so long in do thi littl piec then i hope you will allow that mamma know better what is proper for their littl girl to learn than they do themselv k to be sure mamma but as i suppos i must learn all these thing some time or other i thought you would like to have me begin them soon for i have often heard you say that children can not be set too earli about what is necessari for them to do m that veri true but all thing are not equal necessari to everi one for some that are veri fit for one are scarc proper at all for other k whi mamma m becaus my dear it is the purpos of all educ to fit person for the station in which they are hereaft to live and you know there are veri great differ in that respect both among men and women k are there i thought all ladi live alik m it is usual to call all welleduc women who have no occas to work for their livelihood ladi but if you will think a littl you must see that they live veri differ from each other for their father and husband are in veri differ rank and situat in the world you know k ye i know that some are lord and some are squir and some are clergymen and some are merchant and some are doctor and some are shopkeep m well and do you think the wive and daughter of these person can have just the same thing to do and the same duti to perform you know how i spend my time i have to go to market and provid for the famili to look after the servant to help in take care of you children and in teach you to see that your cloth are in proper condit and assist in make and mend for myself and you and your papa all thi is my necessari duti and besid thi i must go out a visit to keep up our acquaint thi i call partli busi and partli amus then when i am tire and have done all that i think necessari i may amus myself with read or in ani other proper way now a great mani of these employ do not belong to ladi wealthi or mr rich who keep housekeep and gover and servant of all kind to do everyth for them it is veri proper therefor for them to pay more attent to music draw ornament work and ani other eleg manner of pass their time and make themselv agreeabl k and shall i have all the same thing to do mamma that you have m it is imposs my dear to forese what your futur station will be but you have no reason to expect that if you have a famili you will have fewer duti to perform than i have thi is the way of life for which your educ should prepar you and everyth will be use and import for you to learn in proport as it will make you fit for thi k but when i am grown a young ladi shall i not have to visit and go to assembl and play as miss wilson and miss johnson do m it is veri like you may enter into some amus of thi sort but even then you will have sever more seriou employ which will take up a much greater part of your time and if you do not do them properli you will have no right to partak of the other k what will they be mamma m whi dont you think it proper that you should assist me in my household affair a littl as soon as you are abl k o ye mamma i should be veri glad to do that m well consid what talent will be necessari for that purpos will not a good hand at your needl be one of the veri first qualiti k i believ it will m ye and not onli in assist me but in make thing for yourself you know how we admir miss smart ingenu when she wa with us in contriv and make so mani articl of her dress for which she must otherwis have gone to the millin which would have cost a great deal of money k ye she made my pretti bonnet and she made you a veri handsom cap m veri true she wa so clever as not onli to furnish herself with these thing but to oblig her friend with some of her work and i dare say she doe a great deal of plain work also for herself and her mother well then you are convinc of the import of thi busi i hope k ye mamma m read and write are such necessari part of educ that i need not say much to you about them k o no for i love read dearli m i know you do if you can get entertain stori to read but there are mani thing also to be read for instruct which perhap may not be so pleasant at first k but what need is there of so mani book of thi sort m some are to teach you your duti to your maker and your fellowcreatur of which i hope you are sensibl you ought not to be ignor then it is veri right to be acquaint with geographi for you rememb how poor miss blunder wa laugh at for say that if ever she went to franc it should be by land k that wa becaus england is an island and all surround with water wa it not m ye great britain which contain both england and scotland is an island well it is veri use to knew someth of the natur of plant and anim and miner becaus we are alway use some or other of them someth too of the heavenli bodi is veri proper to be known both that we may admir the power and wisdom of god in creat them and that we may not make foolish mistak when their natur and properti are the subject of convers the knowledg of histori too is veri import especi that of our own countri and in short everyth that make part of the discours of ration and welleduc peopl ought in some degre to be studi by everi one who ha proper opportun k ye i like some of those thing veri well but pray mamma what do i learn french for—am i ever to live in franc m probabl not my dear but there are a great mani book written in french that are veri well worth read and it may everi now and then happen that you may be in compani with foreign who can not speak english and as they almost all talk french you may be abl to convers with them in that languag k ye i rememb there wa a gentleman here that came from germani i think and he could hardli speak a word of english but papa and you could talk to him in french and i wish veri much to be abl to understand what you were say for i believ part of it wa about me m it wa well then you see the use of french but i can not say thi is a necessari part of knowledg to young women in gener onli it is well worth acquir if a person ha leisur and opportun i will tell you howev what is quit necessari for one in your station and that is to write a good hand and to cast account well k i should like to write well becaus then i should send letter to my friend when i pleas and it would not be such a scrawl as our maid betti write that i dare say her friend can hardli make it out m she had not the advantag of learn when young for you know she taught herself sinc she came to us which wa a veri sensibl thing of her and i suppos she will improv well but account are almost as necessari as write for how could i cast up all the marketbil and tradesman account and keep my housebook without it k and what is the use of that mamma m it is of use to prevent our be overcharg in anyth and to know exactli how much we spend and whether or not we are exceed our incom and in what articl we ought to be more save without keep account the richest man might soon come to be ruin befor he knew that hi affair were go wrong k but do women alway keep account i thought that wa gener the busi of the men m it is their busi to keep the account belong to their trade or profess or estat but it is the busi of their wive to keep all the household account and a woman almost in ani rank unless perhap some of the highest of all is to blame if she doe not take upon her thi necessari offic i rememb a remark instanc of the benefit which a young ladi deriv from an attent to thi point an emin merchant in london fail for a great sum k what doe that mean mamma m that he owe a great deal more than he could pay hi creditor that is those to whom he wa indebt on examin hi account found great defici which they could not make out for he had kept hi book veri irregularli and had omit to put down mani thing that he had bought and sold they suspect therefor that great wast had been made in the famili expens and they were the more suspici of thi as a daughter who wa a veri genteel young ladi wa hi housekeep hi wife be dead she wa told of thi upon which when the creditor were all met she sent them her housebook for their examin they were all written in a veri fair hand and everi singl articl wa enter with the greatest regular and the sum were all cast up with perfect exact the gentlemen were so highli pleas with the proof of the young ladi abil that they all agre to make her a handsom present out of the effect and one of the richest of them who wa in want of a clever wife soon after paid hi address to her and marri her k that wa veri lucki for i suppos she took care of her poor father when she wa rich but i shall have noth of that sort to do a great while m no but young women should keep their own account of cloth and pocketmoney and other expens as i intend you shall do when you grow up k am i not to learn danc and music and draw too mamma m danc you shall certainli learn pretti soon becaus it is not onli an agreeabl accomplish in itself but is use in form the bodi to eas and eleg in all it motion as to the other two they are mere ornament accomplish which though a woman of middl station may be admir for possess yet she will never be censur for be without the proprieti of attempt to acquir them must depend on natur geniu for them and upon leisur and other accident circumst for some they are too expens and mani are unabl to make such progress in them as will repay the pain of begin it is soon enough howev for us to think about these thing and at ani rate they are not to come in till you have made a veri good profici in what is use and necessari but i see you have now finish what i set you about so you shall take a walk with me into the marketplac where i have two or three thing to buy k shall we not call at the booksel to inquir for those new book that miss reader wa talk about m perhap we may now lay up your work neatli and get on your hat and tippet illustr alfr the great p even vi on the oak—a dialogu tutor—george—harri tutor—com my boy let us sit down awhil under yon shadi tree i dont know how your young leg feel but mine are almost tire geo i am not tire but i am veri hot har and i am hot and veri dri too tut when you have cool yourself you may drink out of that clear brook in the meantim we will read a littl out of a book i have in my pocket they go and sit down at the foot of the tree har what an amaz larg tree how wide it branch spread pray what tree is it geo i can tell you that it is an oak dont you see the acorn tut ye it is an oak—th noblest tree thi countri produc not onli grand and beauti to the sight but of the greatest import from it use har i should like to know someth about it tut veri well then instead of read we will sit and talk about oak georg who knew the oak by it acorns—should you have known it if there had been none geo i dont know i believ not tut observ then in the first place that it bark is veri rug then see in what manner it grow it great arm run out almost horizont from it trunk give the whole tree a sort of round form and make it spread far on everi side it branch are also subject to be crook or kneed by these mark you might guess at an oak even in winter when quit bare of leav but it leav afford a surer mark of distinct sinc they differ a good deal from those of other english tree be neither whole and even at the edg nor yet cut like the teeth of a saw but rather deepli scollop and form into sever round divis their colour is a fine deep green then the fruit— har fruit tut ye all kind of plant have what may properli be call fruit though we are apt to give that name onli to such as are food for man the fruit of a plant is the seed with what contain it thi in the oak is call an acorn which is a kind of nut partli enclos in a cup geo acorncup are veri pretti thing i have made boat of them and set them swim in a basin tut and if you were no bigger than a fairi you might use them for drink cup as those imaginari littl be are said to do pearli drop of dew we drink in acorncup fill to the brink har are acorn good to eat geo no that they are not i have tri and did not like them at all tut in the earli age of man befor he cultiv the earth but live upon such wild product as natur afford we are told that acorn made a consider part of hi food and at thi day they are eaten in spain and greec and in some other of the southern countri of europ but they are sweeter and better flavour than our and are produc by a differ speci of oak the chief use which we make of those which grow in thi countri is to feed hog in those part of england where oakwood are common great herd of swine are kept which are driven into the wood in autumn when the acorn fall and provid for themselv plenti for two or three month thi howev is a small part of the prais of the oak you will be surpris when i tell you that to thi tree our countri owe it chief glori and secur har ay how can that be tut i dont know whether in your read you have ever met with the stori that athen a famou citi in greec consult the oracl how it might best defend itself against it enemi wa advis to trust to wooden wall har wooden wall that odd i should think stonewal better for wooden one might be set on fire tut true but the mean wa that as athen wa a place of great trade and it peopl were skill in maritim affair they ought to trust to their ship well thi is the case with great britain as it is an island it ha no need of wall and fortif while it possess ship to keep all enemi at a distanc now we have the greatest and finest navi in the world by which we both defend ourselv and attack other nation when they insult us and thi is all built of oak geo would no other wood do to build ship tut none nearli so well especi for menofwar for it is the stoutest and strongest wood we have and therefor best fit both to keep sound under water and to bear the blow and shock of the wave and the terribl stroke of cannonbal it is a peculiar excel for thi last purpos that oak is not so liabl to splinter or shiver as other wood so that a ball can pass through it without make a larg hole did you never hear the old song heart of oak are our ship heart of oak are our men c geo no tut it wa made at a time when england wa more success in war than had ever befor been known and our success wa properli attribut chiefli to our fleet the great support of which is the british oak so i hope you will look upon oak with due respect har ye it shall alway be my favourit tree tut had not pope reason when he said in hi windsor forest let india boast her plant nor envi we the weep amber or the balmi tree while by our oak the preciou load are born and realm command which those tree adorn these line refer to it use as well for merchantship as for menofwar and in fact all our ship are for the most part built either of nativ or foreign oak geo are the mast of ship made of oak tut no it would be too heavi besid it would not be easi to find trunk of oak long and straight enough for that purpos they are made of variou sort of fir or pine which grow veri tall and taper geo is oak wood use for anyth besid shipbuild tut o ye it is one of the princip wood of the carpent be employ wherev great strength and durabl are requir it is use for door and window frame and the beam that are laid in wall to strengthen them floor and staircas are sometim made with it and in old hous in the countri which were built when oak wa more plenti than at present almost all the timber about them wa oak it is also occasion use for furnitur as tabl chair drawer and bedstead though mahogani ha now much taken it place for the better sort of good and the lighter and softer wood for the cheaper for the hard of oak render it difficult and expens to work it is still howev the chief materi use in millwork in bridg and water work for wagon and cart bodi for threshingfloor for larg cask and tub and for the last piec of furnitur a man ha occas for what is that do you think georg geo i dont know har a coffin tut so it is har but whi should that be made of such strong wood tut there can be no other reason than that weak attach we are apt to have for our bodi when we are done with them which ha made men in variou countri desir of keep them as long as possibl from decay but i have not yet done with the use of the oak were either of you ever in a tanner yard geo we often go by one at the end of the town but we dare not go in for fear of the great dog tut but he is alway chain in the daytim har ye but he bark so loud and look so fierc that we were afraid he would break hi chain tut i doubt you are a coupl of coward howev i suppos you came near enough to observ great stack of bark in the yard geo o ye there are sever tut those are oakbark and it is use in tan the hide har what doe it do to them tut ill tell you the hide when taken from the anim after be steep in lime and water to get off the hair and greas is put to soak in a liquor made by steep oakbark in water thi liquor is strongli astring or bind and ha the properti of convert skin into leather the chang which the hide thu undergo render it at the same time less liabl to decay and soft and pliabl when dri for raw skin by dri acquir nearli the hard and consist of horn other thing are also tan for the purpos of preserv them as fishingnet and boatsail thi use of the bark of the oak make it a veri valuabl commod and you may see peopl in the wood care strip the oak when cut down and pile up the bark in heap geo i have seen such heap of bark but i thought they were onli to burn tut no they are much too valuabl for that well but i have anoth use of the oak to mention and that is in die har die i wonder what colour it can die tut oak sawdust is a princip ingredi in die fustian by variou mixtur and manag it is made to give them all the differ shade of drab and brown then all the part of the oak like all other astring veget produc a dark blue or black by the addit of ani prepar of iron the bark is sometim use in thi way for die black and did you never see what the boy call an oakappl geo ye i have gather them myself tut do you know what they are geo i thought they were the fruit of the oak tut no i have told you that the acorn are the fruit these are excresc form by an insect geo an insect how can they make such a thing tut it is a sort of fli that ha the power of pierc the outer skin of the oak bough under which it lay it egg the part then swell into a kind of ball and the young insect when hatch eat their way out well thi ball or appl is a pretti strong astring and is sometim use in die black but in the warm countri there is a speci of oak which bear round excresc of the same kind call gall which becom hard and are the strongest astring known they are the princip ingredi in the black die and common ink is made with them togeth with a substanc call green vitriol or coppera which contain iron i have now told you the chief use that i can recollect of the oak and these are so import that whoever drop an acorn into the ground and take proper care of it when it come up may be said to be a benefactor to hi countri besid no sight can be more beauti and majest than a fine oakwood it is an ornament fit for the habit of the first nobleman in the land har i wonder then that all rich gentlemen who have ground enough do not cover it with oak tut mani of them especi of late year have made great plantat of these tree but all soil do not suit them and then there is anoth circumst which prevent mani from be at thi troubl and expens which is the long time an oak take in grow so that no person can reason expect to profit by those of hi own plant an oak of fifti year is greatli short of it full growth and they are scarc arriv at perfect under a centuri howev it is our duti to think of poster as well as ourselv and they who receiv oak from their ancestor ought certainli to furnish other to their successor har then i think that everi one who cut down an oak should be oblig to plant anoth tut veri right—but he should plant two or three for one for fear of accid in their grow i will now repeat to you some vers describ the oak in it state of full growth or rather of begin to decay with the variou anim live upon it—and then we will walk see where yon oak it aw structur rear the massi growth of twice a hundr year survey hi rug trunk with moss oergrown hi lusti arm in rude disord thrown hi fork branch wide at distanc spread and darkn half the sky hi lofti head a

sit down awhil on thi bench and look about us what a charm prospect harri i admir those pleasureground what beauti clump of tree there are in that lawn georg but what a dark gloomi wood that is at the back of the hous tut it is a fir plantat and those tree alway look dismal in the summer when there are so mani finer green to compar them with but the winter is their time for show when other tree are strip of their verdur geo then they are evergreen tut ye most of the fir tribe are evergreen and as they are gener nativ of cold mountain countri they contribut greatli to cheer the wintri landscap geo you were so good when we walk out last to tell us a great deal about oak i thought it one of the prettiest lesson i ever heard i should be glad if you would give us such anoth about fir har so should i too im sure tut with all my heart and i am pleas that you ask me noth is so great an encourag to a tutor as to find hi pupil of their own accord seek after use knowledg geo and i think it is veri use to know such thing as these tut certainli it is well then—you may know the pine or fir tribe in gener at first sight as most of them are of a bluishgreen colour and all have leav consist of a strong narrow point blade which give them somewhat of a stiff appear then all of them bear a hard scali fruit of a longish or conic form har are they what we call firappl tut ye that is one of the name boy give them har we often pick them up under tree and throw them at each other geo i have sometim brought home my pocket full to burn they make a fine clear flame tut well—do you know where the seed lie in them geo no—hav they ani tut yes—at the bottom of everi scale lie two wing seed but when the scale open the seed fall out so that you can seldom find ani in those you pick up har are the seed good for anyth tut there is a kind of pine in the south of europ call the stonepin the kernel of which are eaten and said to be as sweet as an almond and bird pick out the seed of other sort though they are so well defend by the woodi scale har they must have good strong bill then tut of thi tribe of tree a varieti of speci are found in differ countri and are cultiv in thi but the onli kind nativ here is the wildpin or scotchfir of thi there are larg natur forest in the highland of scotland and the princip plantat consist of it it is a hardi sort fit for barren and mountain soil but grow slowli geo pray what are those veri tall tree that grow in two row befor the old hall in our villag tut they are the common or spruce fir a nativ of norway and other northern countri and one of the loftiest of the tribe but observ those tree that grow singli in the ground opposit to us with widespread branch spread downward and trail on the ground thenc gradual lessen till the top of the tree end almost in a point har what beauti tree tut they are the pine call larch nativ of the alp and apennin introduc into thi countri about the middl of the last centuri for the purpos at first of decor our garden and of which extens plantat for timber have sinc been made both in england and scotland these are not properli evergreen as they shed their leav in winter but quickli recov them again then we have besid the weymouth pine which is the tallest speci in america—th silver fir so call from the silveri hue of it foliage—th pinaster—and a tree of ancient fame the cedar of lebanon geo i suppos that is a veri great tree tut it grow to a larg size but is slow in come to it full growth geo are pine and fir veri use tree tut perhap the most so of ani by much the greatest part of the wood at present use among us come from them har what—mor than from the oak tut ye much more almost all the timber use in build hous for floor beam rafter and roof is fir geo doe it all grow in thi countri tut scarc ani of it norway sweden and russia are the countri from which we draw our timber and a vast trade there is in it you have seen timberyard geo o yes—sever tut in them you would observ some veri long thick beam call balk these are whole tree onli strip of the bark and squar you would also see great pile of plank and board of differ length and thick those are call deal and are brought over readi sawn from the countri where they grow they are of differ colour the white are chiefli from the firtre the yellow and red from the pine har i suppos there must be great forest of them in those countri or els they could not send us so much tut ye the mountain of norway are overrun with them enough for the suppli of all europ but on account of their rugged and the want of road it is found imposs to get the tree when fell down to the seacoast unless they grow near some river geo how do they manag then tut they take the opportun when the river are swell with rain or melt snow and tumbl the tree into them when they are carri down to the mouth of the river where they are stop by a kind of pen har i should like to see them swim down the stream tut yes—it would be curiou enough for in some place these torrent roll over rock make steep waterfal down which the tree are carri headlong and do not rise again till they are got to a great distanc and mani of them are broken and torn to piec in the passag geo are these wood use for anyth besid build tut for a varieti of purpos such as box trunk packingcas pale wainscot and the like deal is a veri soft wood easili work light and cheap which make it prefer for so mani use though it is not veri durabl and is veri liabl to split har yes—i know my box is made of deal and the lid is split all to piec with drive nail into it geo are ship ever built with fir tut it wa one of the first wood made use of for naval purpos and in the poet you will find the word pine and fir frequent employ to signifi ship but as navig ha improv the stronger and more durabl wood have gener taken it place howev in the countri where fir is veri plenti larg ship are still built with it for though they last but a short time they cost so littl in proport that the profit of a few voyag is suffici to repay the expens then from the great light of the wood they swim higher in the water and consequ will bear more load most of the larg ship that bring timber from archangel in russia are built of fir as for the mast of ship those i have alreadi told you are all made of fir or pine on account of their straight and light geo are there not some line in milton paradis lost about that tut ye the spear of satan is magnifi by a comparison with a lofti pine hi spear to equal which the tallest pine hewn on norwegian hill to be the mast of some great admir were but a wand har i rememb too that the walkingstaff of the giant polyphem wa a pine tut ay—so homer and ovid tell us and he must have been a giant inde to use such a stick well so much for the wood of these tree but i have more to say about their use har i am glad of it tut all of the tribe contain a juic of a bitterish tast and strong fragrant smell thi in some is so abund as to flow out from incis when it is call turpentin the larch in particular yield a larg quantiti turpentin is one of the substanc call resin it is sticki transpar veri inflamm and will not mix with water but will dissolv in spirit of wine geo what is it use for tut it is use medicin particularli in the composit of plaster and ointment it also is an ingredi in varnish cement and the like an oil distil from turpentin is employ in medicin and is much use by painter for mix up their colour what remain after get thi oil is common resin all these substanc take fire veri easili and burn with a great flame and the wood of the pine ha so much of thi qualiti when dri that it is often use for torch har i know deal shave burn veri briskli geo ye and match are made of bit of deal dip in brimston tut true—and when it wa the custom to burn the bodi of the dead as you read in homer and other old author the pine and pitchtre compos great part of the funer pile har but what are pitchtre doe pitch grow upon tree tut i wa go on to tell you about that tar is a product of the tree of thi kind especi of one speci call the pitchpin the wood is burnt in a sort of oven made in the earth and the resin juic sweat out and acquir a peculiar tast and a black colour from the fire thi is tar tar when boil down to dryness becom pitch geo tar and pitch are chiefli use about ship are they not tut they resist moistur and therefor are of great servic in prevent thing from decay that are expos to wet for thi reason the cabl and other rope of ship are well soak with tar and the side of ship are cover with pitch mix with other ingredi their seam too or the place where the plank join are fill with tow dip in a composit of resin tallow and pitch to keep out the water wood for pale for pile for cover of roof and other purpos of the like natur is often tar over cistern and cask are pitch to prevent leak har but what are sheep tar for after they are shear tut to cure wound and sore in their skin for the like purpos an ointment made with tar is often rub upon children head sever part of the pine are medicin the top and green cone of the sprucefir are ferment with treacl and the liquor call spruceb is much drunk in america particularli for the scurvi geo is it pleasant tut not to those who are unaccustom to it well—i have now finish my lesson so let us walk har shall we go through the ground tut ye and then we will view some of the differ kind of fir and pine more close and i will show you the differ of their leav and cone by which they are distinguish on differ station in life—a dialogu littl salli meanwel had one day been to pay an afternoon visit to miss harriet the daughter of sir thoma pemberton the even prove raini she wa sent home in sir thomass coach and on her return the follow convers pass between her and her mother— mr meanwel well my dear i hope you have had a pleasant visit salli o ye mamma veri pleasant you can not think how mani fine thing i have seen and then it is so charm to ride in a coach mr m i suppos miss harriet show you all her playth salli o ye such fine larg doll so smartli dress as i never saw in my life befor then she ha a babyhous and all sort of furnitur in it and a grotto all made of shell and shine stone and then she show me all her fine cloth for the next ball there a white slip all full of spangl and pink riband you cant think how beauti it look mr m and what did you admir most of all these fine thing salli i dont know—i admir them all and i think i like ride in the coach better than all the rest whi dont we keep a coach and whi have i not such fine cloth and playth as miss harriet mr m becaus we can not afford it my dear your papa is not so rich by a great deal as sir thoma and if we were to lay out our money upon such thing we should not be abl to procur food and raiment and other necessari for you all salli but whi is not papa as rich as sir thoma mr m sir thoma had a larg estat left him by hi father but your papa ha littl but what he gain by hi own industri salli but whi should not papa be as rich as anybodi els i am sure he deserv it as well mr m do you not think that there are a great mani peopl poorer than he that are also veri deserv salli are there mr m ye to be sure dont you know what a number of poor peopl there are all around us who have few of the comfort we enjoy what do you think of ploughman the labour i believ you never saw him idl in your life salli no he is gone to work long befor i am up and he doe not return till almost bedtim unless it be for hi dinner mr m well how do you think hi wife and children live should you like that we should chang place with them salli o no they are so dirti and rag mr m they are inde poor creatur but i am afraid they suffer wors evil than that salli what mamma mr m whi i am afraid they often do not get as much victual as they could eat and then in winter they must be half frozen for want of fire and warm cloth how do you think you could bear all thi salli inde i dont know but i have seen ploughman wife carri great brown loav into the hous and i rememb onc eat some brown bread and milk and i thought it veri good mr m i believ you would not much like it constantli besid they can hardli get enough of that but you seem to know almost as littl of the poor as the young french princess did salli what wa that mamma mr m whi there had been one year so bad a harvest in franc that number of the poor were famish to death thi calam wa so much talk of that it reach the court and wa mention befor the young princess dear me said one of them how silli that wa whi rather than be famish i would eat bread and chees her gover wa then oblig to acquaint her that the greatest part of her father subject scarc ever eat anyth better than black bread all their live and that vast number would now think themselv veri happi to get onli half their usual pittanc of that such wretched as thi wa what the princess had not the least idea of and the account shock her so much that she wa glad to sacrific all her fineri to afford some relief to the suffer of the poor salli but i hope there is nobodi famish in our countri mr m i hope not for we have law by which everi person is entitl to relief from the parish if he is unabl to gain a subsist and were there no law about it i am sure it would be our duti to part with everi superflu rather than let a fellowcreatur perish for want of necessari salli then do you think it wa wrong for miss pemberton to have all those fine thing mr m no my dear if they are suitabl to her fortun and do not consum the money which ought to be employ in more use thing to herself and other salli but whi might she not be content with such thing as i have and give the money that the rest cost to the poor mr m becaus she can afford both to be charit to the poor and also to indulg herself in these pleasur but do you recollect that the children of mr white the baker and mr shape the tailor might just ask the same question about you salli how so mr m are not you as much better dress and as much more plenti suppli with playth than they are as miss harriet is than you salli whi i believ i may for i rememb polli white wa veri glad of one of my old doll and nanci shape cri for such a sash as mine but her mother would not let her have one mr m then you see my dear that there are mani who have fewer thing to be thank for than you have and you may also learn what ought to be the true measur of the expect of children and the indulg of parent salli i dont quit understand you mamma mr m everyth ought to be suit to the station in which we live or are like to live and the want and duti of it your papa and i do not grudg lay out part of our money to promot the innoc pleasur of our children but it would be veri wrong in us to lay out so much on thi account as would oblig us to spare in more necessari articl as in their educ and the common household expens requir in our way of live besid it would be so far from make you happier that it would be do you the greatest injuri salli how could that be mamma mr m if you were now to be dress like miss pemberton dont you think you would be greatli mortifi at be wors dress when you came to be a young woman salli i believ i should mamma for then perhap i might go to assembl and to be sure i should like to be as smart then as at ani time mr m well but it would be still more improp for us to dress you then beyond our circumst becaus your necessari cloth will then cost more you know then if we were now to hire a coach or chair for you to go visit in should you like to leav it off ever afterward but you have no reason to expect that you will be abl to have those indulg when you are a woman and so it is in everyth els the more fine thing and the more gratif you have now the more you will requir hereaft for custom make thing so familiar to us that while we enjoy them less we want them more salli how is that mamma mr m whi dont you think you have enjoy your ride in the coach thi even more than miss harriet should have done salli i suppos i have becaus if miss harriet like it so well she would be alway ride for i know she might have the coach whenev she pleas mr m but if you were both told that you were never to ride in a coach again which would think it the greater hardship you could walk you know as you have alway done befor but she would rather stay at home i believ than expos herself to the cold wind and trudg through the wet and dirt in patten salli i believ so too and now mamma i see that all you have told me is veri right mr m well my dear let it dwell upon your mind so as to make you cheer and content in your station which you see is so much happier than that of mani and mani other children so now we will talk no more on the subject illustr even viii the rookeri there the hoarsevo hungri rook near her stickbuilt nest doth croak wave on the topmost bough these line mr stangrov repeat point up to a rookeri as he wa walk in an avenu of tall tree with hi son franci franci is that a rookeri papa mr stangrov it is do you hear what a caw the bird make fr ye and i see them hop about among the bough pray are not rook the same with crow mr st they are a speci of crow but they differ from the carrion crow and raven in not live upon dead flesh but upon corn and other seed and grass they inde pick up beetl and other insect and worm see what a number of them have light on yonder plough field almost blacken it over fr what are they do mr st search for grub and worm you see the men in the field do not molest them for they do a great deal of servic by destroy grub which if they were suffer to grow to wing insect would do much mischief to the tree and plant fr but do they hurt the corn mr st ye they tear up a good deal of green corn if they are not driven away but upon the whole rook are reckon the farmer friend and they do not choos to have them destroy fr do all rook live in rookeri mr st it is the gener natur of them to associ togeth and build in number on the same or adjoin tree but thi is often in the midst of wood or natur grove howev they have no object to the neighbourhood of man but readili take to a plantat of tall tree though it be close to a hous and thi is commonli call a rookeri they will even fix their habit on tree in the midst of town and i have seen a rookeri in a churchyard in one of the closest part of london fr i think a rookeri is a sort of town itself mr st it is a villag in the air peopl with numer inhabit and noth can be more amus than to view them all in motion fli to and fro and busi in their sever occup the spring is their busiest time earli in the year they begin to repair their nest or build new one fr do they all work togeth or everi one for itself mr st each pair after they have coupl build their own nest and instead of help they are veri apt to steal the materi from one anoth if both bird go out at onc in search of stick they often find at their return the work all destroy and the materi carri off so that one of them gener stay at home to keep watch howev i have met with a stori which show that they are not without some sens of the crimin of thiev there wa in a rookeri a lazi pair of rook who never went out to get stick for themselv but made a practic of watch when their neighbour were abroad and help themselv from their nest they had serv most of the commun in thi manner and by these mean had just finish their own nest when all the other rook in a rage fell upon them at onc pull their nest in piec beat them soundli and drove them from their societi fr that wa veri right—i should have like to have seen it but whi do they live togeth if they do not help one anoth mr st they probabl receiv pleasur from the compani of their own kind as men and variou other creatur do then though they do not assist one anoth in build they are mutual servic in mani way if a larg bird of prey hover about a rookeri for the purpos of carri off ani of the young one they all unit to drive him away when they are feed in a flock sever are place as sentinel upon the tree all round who give the alarm if ani danger approach they often go a long way from home to feed but everi even the whole flock return make a loud caw as they fli as if to direct and call in the straggler the older rook take the lead you may distinguish them by the white of their bill occas by their frequent dig in the ground by which the black feather at the root of the bill are worn off fr do rook alway keep to the same tree mr st ye they are much attach to them and when the tree happen to be cut down they seem greatli distress and keep hover about them as they are fall and will scarc desert them when they lie on the ground fr poor thing i suppos they feel as we should if our town wa burnt down or overthrown by an earthquak mr st no doubt the societi of anim greatli resembl those of men and that of rook is like those of men in a savag state such as the commun of the north american indian it is a sort of leagu for mutual aid and defenc but in which everi one is left to do as he pleas without ani oblig to employ himself for the whole bodi other unit in a manner resembl more civil societi of men thi is the case with the beaver they perform great public work by the unit effort of the whole commun such as dam up stream and construct mound for their habit as these are work of great art and labour some of them must probabl act under the direct of other and be compel to work whether they will or not mani curiou stori are told to thi purpos by those who have observ them in their remotest haunt where they exercis their full sagac fr but are they all true mr st that is more than i can answer for yet what we certainli know of the economi of bee may justifi us in believ extraordinari thing of the sagac of anim the societi of bee goe farther than that of beaver and in some respect beyond most among men themselv they not onli inhabit a common dwell and perform great work in common but they lay up a store of provis which is the properti of the whole commun and is not use except at certain season and under certain regul a beehiv is a true imag of a commonwealth where no member act for himself alon but for the whole bodi fr but there are drone among them who do not work at all mr st ye and at the approach of winter they are driven out of the hive and left to perish with cold and hunger but i have not leisur at present to tell you more about bee you shall one day see them at work in a glass hive in the meantim rememb one thing which appli to all the societi of anim and i wish it did as well to all those of men likewis fr what is that mr st the principl upon which they all associ is to obtain some benefit for the whole bodi not to give particular advantag to a few the ship charl osborn when at home in the holyday had a visit from a schoolfellow who wa just enter as a midshipman on board of a manofwar tom hardi that wa hi name wa a freeheart spirit lad and a favourit among hi companion but he never like hi book and had left school ignor of almost everyth he came there to learn what wa wors he had got a contempt for learn of all kind and wa fond of show it what doe your father mean say he to charl to keep you mope and studi over thing of no use in the world but to plagu folks—whi cant you go into hi majesti servic like me and be made a gentleman of you are old enough and i know you are a lad of spirit thi kind of talk made some impress upon young osborn he becam less attent to the lesson hi father set him and less will to enter into instruct convers thi chang gave hi father much concern but as he knew the caus he thought it best instead of employ direct author to attempt to give a new impress to hi son mind which might counteract the effect of hi companion suggest be acquaint with an east india captain who wa on the point of sail he went with hi son to pay him a farewel visit on board hi ship they were shown all about the vessel and view all the prepar for so long a voyag they saw her weigh anchor and unfurl her sail and they took leav of their friend amid the shout of the seamen and all the bustl of departur charl wa highli delight with thi scene and as they were return could think and talk of noth els it wa easi therefor for hi father to lead him into the follow train of discourse— after charl had been warmli express hi admir of the grand sight of a larg ship complet fit out and get under sail i do not wonder said hi father that you are so much struck with it it is in realiti one of the finest spectacl creat by human skill and the noblest triumph of art over untaught natur near two thousand year ago when juliu cesar came over to thi island he found the nativ in possess of no other kind of vessel than a sort of cano form of wickerwork cover with hide no bigger than a man or two could carri but the largest ship in cesar fleet wa not more superior to these than the indiaman you have been see is to what that wa our savag ancestor ventur onli to paddl along the river and coast or cross small arm of the sea in calm weather and cesar himself would have been alarm to be a few day out of sight of land but the ship we have just left is go by itself to the opposit side of the globe prepar to encount the tempestu wind and mountain wave of the vast southern ocean and to find it way to it destin port though mani week must pass with noth in view but sea and sky now what do you think can be the caus of thi prodigi differ in the power of man at one period and anoth charl wa silent fa is it not that there is a great deal more knowledg in one than in the other ch to be sure it is fa would it not think you be as imposs for ani number of men untaught by their utmost effort to build and navig such a ship as we have seen as to fli through the air ch i suppos it would fa that we may be the more sensibl of thi let us consid how mani art and profess are necessari for thi purpos come—y shall begin to name them and if you forget ani i will put you in mind what is the first ch the shipcarpent i think fa true—what doe he do ch he build the ship fa how is that done ch by fasten the plank and beam togeth fa but do you suppos he can do thi as a common carpent make a box or set of shelv ch i do not know fa do you not think that such a vast bulk requir a good deal of contriv to bring it into shape and fit it for all it purpos ch ye fa some ship you have heard sail quicker than others—som bear storm better—som carri more lading—som draw less water—and so on you do not suppos all these thing are left to chanc ch no fa in order to produc these effect with certainti it is necessari to studi proport veri exactli and to lay down an accur scale by mathemat line and figur after which to build the ship much ha been written upon thi subject and nice calcul have been made of the resist a ship meet with in make way through the water and the best mean of overcom it also of the action of the wind on the sail and their action in push on the ship by mean of the mast all these must be understood by a perfect master of shipbuild ch but i think i know shipbuild who have never had an educ to fit them for understand these thing fa veri like but they have follow by rote the rule laid down by other and as they work mere by imit they can not alter or improv as occas may requir then though common merchantship are trust to such builder yet in construct menofwar and indiamen person of scienc are alway employ the french howev attend to thi matter more than we do and in consequ their ship gener sail better than our ch but need a captain of a ship know all these thing fa it may not be absolut necessari yet occas may frequent aris in which it would be of great advantag for him to be abl to judg and give direct in these matter but suppos the ship built—what come next ch i think she must be rig fa well—who are employ for thi purpos ch mastmak ropemak sailmak and i know not how mani other peopl fa these are all mechan trade and though in carri them on much ingenu ha been appli in the invent of machin and tool yet we will not stop to consid them suppos her then rigged—what next ch she must take in her gun and powder fa stop there and reflect how mani art you have now set to work gunpowd is one of the greatest invent of modern time and what ha given such a superior to civil nation over the barbar an english frigat surround by the cano of all the savag in the world would easili beat them off by mean of her gun and if cesar were to come again to england with hi fleet a batteri of cannon would sink all hi ship and set hi legion a swim in the sea but the make of gunpowd and the cast of cannon are art that requir an exact knowledg of the scienc of chymistri ch what is that fa it comprehend the knowledg of all the properti of metal and miner salt sulphur oil and gum and of the action of fire and water and air upon all substanc and the effect of mix differ thing togeth gunpowd is a mixtur of three thing onli saltpetr or nitr sulphur or brimston and charcoal but who could have thought such a wonder effect would have been produc by it ch wa it not first discov by accid fa ye but it wa by one who wa make chymic experi and mani more experi have been employ to bring it to perfect ch but need a captain know how to make gunpowd and cannon fa it is not necessari though it may often be use to him howev it is quit necessari that he should know how to employ them now the scienc of gunneri and fortif depend entir upon mathemat principl for by these are calcul the direct of a ball through the air the distanc it would reach to and the forc with which it will strike ani thing all engin therefor must be good mathematician ch but i think have heard of gunner be littl better than common men fa true—ther is a way of do that busi as well as mani other by mere practic and an uneduc man may acquir skill in point a cannon as well as in shoot with a common gun but thi is onli in ordinari case and an abler head is requir to direct well—now suppos your ship complet fit out for sea and the wind blow fair how will you navig her ch i would spread the sail and steer by the rudder fa veri well—but how would you find your way to the port you are bound for ch that i can not tell fa nor perhap can i make you exactli comprehend it but i can show you enough to convinc you that it is an affair that requir much knowledg and earli studi in former time when a vessel left the sight of land it wa steer by observ of the sun by day and the moon and star by night the sun you know rise in the east and set in the west and at noon in these part of the world it is exactli south of us these point therefor may be found out when the sun shine the moon and star vari howev their place in the sky may be known by exact observ then there is one star that alway point to the north pole and is therefor call the polestar thi wa of great use in navig and the word polestar is often use by the poet to signifi a sure guid do you recollect the descript in homer odyssey when ulyss sail away by himself from the island of calypso—how he steer by the star ch i think i rememb the line in pope translat fa repeat them then ch place at the helm he sat and markd the sky nor close in sleep hi everwatch eye there viewd the pleiad and the northern team and great orion more effulg beam to which around the axl of the sky the bear revolv point hi golden eye who shine exalt on th ether plain nor bath hi blaze forehead in the main fa veri well they are fine line inde you see then how long ago sailor thought it necessari to studi astronomi but as it frequent happen especi in stormi weather that the star are not to be seen thi method wa subject to great uncertainti which render it danger to undertak distant voyag at length near year sinc a properti wa discov in a miner call the magnet or loadston which remov the difficulti thi wa it polar or qualiti of alway point to the pole of the earth that is due north and south thi it can commun to ani piec of iron so that a needl well rub in a particular manner by a loadston and then balanc upon it centr so as to turn round freeli will alway point to the north with an instrument call a marin compass made of one of these needl and a card mark with all the points—north south east west and the divis between these a ship may be steer to ani part of the globe ch it is a veri easi matter then fa not quit so easi neither in a long voyag cross or contrari wind blow a ship out of her direct cours so that without nice calcul both of the straight track she ha gone and all the deviat from it the sailor would not know where they were nor to what point to steer it is also frequent necessari to take observ as they call it that is to observ with an instrument where the sun place in the sky is at noon by which they can determin the latitud they are in other observ are necessari to determin their longitud what these mean i can show you upon the globe it is enough now to say that by mean of both togeth they can tell the exact spot they are on at ani time and then by consult their map and set their compass they can steer right to the place they want but all thi requir a veri exact knowledg of astronomi the use of the globe mathemat and arithmet which you may suppos is not to be acquir without much studi a great number of curiou instrument have been invent to assist in these oper so that there is scarc ani matter in which so much art and scienc have been employ as in navig and none but a veri learn and civil nation can excel in it ch but how is tom hardi to do for i am pretti sure he doe not understand ani of these thing fa he must learn them if he mean to come to anyth in hi profess he may inde head a pressgang or command a boat crew without them but he will never be fit to take charg of a manofwar or even a merchantship ch howev he need not learn latin and greek fa i can not say inde that a sailor ha occas for those languag but a knowledg of latin make it much easier to acquir all modern languag and i hope you do not think them unnecessari to him ch i did not know they were of much import fa no do you think that one who may probabl visit most countri in europ and their foreign settlement should be abl to convers in no other languag than hi own if the knowledg of languag is not use to him i know not to whom it is so he can hardli do at all without know some and the more the better ch poor tom then i doubt he ha not chosen so well as he think fa i doubt so too here end the convers they soon after reach home and charl did not forget to desir hi father to show him on the globe what longitud and latitud meant thing by their right name charl papa you grow veri lazi last winter you use to tell us stori and now you never tell us ani and we are all got round the fire quit readi to hear you pray dear papa let us have a veri pretti one father with all my heart—what shall it be ch a bloodi murder papa fa a bloodi murder well then—onc upon a time some men dress all alik ch with black crape over their face fa no they had steel cap on—hav cross a dark heath wound cautious along the skirt of a

grow on the other side of the hedg georg whi it is corn—dont you see it is in ear har yes—but it seem too short for corn and the corn we just now pass is not in ear by a great deal geo then i dont know what it is pray sir will you tell us tut i dont wonder you were puzzl about it it is a sort of grass sown for hay and is call ryegrass har but how happen it that it is so veri like corn tut there is no great wonder in that for all corn is realli a kind of grass on the other hand if you were a lilliputian everi speci of grass would appear to you amaz larg corn geo then there is no differ between corn and grass but the size tut none at all har but we eat corn and grass is not good to eat tut it is onli the seed of corn that we eat we leav the stalk and leav for cow and hors now we might eat the seed of grass if they were big enough to be worth gather and some particular kind are in fact eaten in certain countri har but are wheat and barley realli grass tut yes—they are a speci of that great famili of plant which botanist call grass and i will take thi opportun of tell you someth about them go georg and pull us up a root of that ryegrass harri and i will sit down on thi stile till you come to us har here is grass enough all round us tut well then pull up a few root that you see in ear geo here is my grass har and here is mine tut well—spread them all in a handkerchief befor us now look at the root of them all what do you call them geo i think they are what you have told us—fibr root tut right—they consist of a bundl of string then look at their stalks—you will find them joint and hollow like the straw of corn har so they are tut the leav you see of all the kind are veri long and narrow taper to a point at their end those of corn you know are the same har yes—they are so like grass at first that i can never tell the differ tut next observ the ear or head some of these you see are thick and close like those of wheat or barley other are more loos and open like oat the first are gener call spike the second panicl if you examin them close you will find that they all consist of a number of distinct huski bodi which are properli the flower each of which is succeed by a singl seed i dare say you have pick ear of wheat har o yes—i am veri fond of them tut well then—you found that the grain all lay singl contain in a scali husk make a part of the ear or head befor the seed wa form there wa a flower in it place i do not mean a gay finecolour flower but a few scale with thread come out among them each crown with a white tip and soon after the ear of corn appear you will find their flower open and these white tip come out of them thi is the structur of the flower and flower head of everi one of the grass tribe geo but what are the beard of corn tut the beard are bristl or point run out from the end of the husk they are properli call awn most of the grasstrib have someth of these but they are much longer in some kind than in other in barley you know they are veri long and give the whole field a sort of downi or silki appear especi when wave by the wind har are there the same kind of corn and grass in all countri tut no with respect to corn that is in all countri the product of cultiv and differ sort are found best to suit differ climat thu in the northern part of the temper zone oat and rye are chiefli grown in the middl and southern barley and wheat wheat is univers the speci prefer for breadcorn but there are variou kind of it differ from each other in size of grain colour and other qualiti har doe not the best wheat of all grow in england tut by no mean wheat is better suit to the warmer climat and it is onli by great attent and upon particular soil that it is made to succeed well here on the other hand the torrid zone is too hot for wheat and our other grain and they chiefli cultiv rice there and indian corn geo i have seen head of indian corn as thick as my wrist but they do not look at all like our corn tut yes—th seed all grow singl in a sort of chaffi head and the stalk and leav resembl those of the grasstrib but of a gigant size but there are other plant of thi famili which perhap you have not thought of geo what are they tut cane and reeds—from the sugarcan and bamboo of the tropic to the common reed of our ditch of which you make arrow all these have the gener charact of the grass har i know that reed have veri fine featheri head like the top of grass tut they have so and the stalk are compos of mani joint as are also those of the sugarcan and of the common cane which grow in the southern countri of europ and of which fishingrod are often made as well as of the bamboo import hither for walkingstick and appli to mani more import use in the countri of which it is a nativ some of these are veri tall plant but the seed of them are small in proport and not use for food but there is yet anoth kind of grasslik plant common among us geo what is that tut have you not observ in the marsh and on the side of ditch a coars broaderleav sort of grass with larg darkcolour spike thi is sedg in latin carex and there are mani sort of it har what is that good for tut it is eaten by cattl both fresh and dri but is inferior in qualiti to good grass geo what is it that make one kind of grass better than anoth tut there are variou properti which give valu to grass some spread more than other resist frost and drought better yield a greater crop of leav and are therefor better for pasturag and hay the juic of some are more nourish and sweet than those of other in gener howev differ grass are suit to differ soil and by improv soil the qualiti of the grass is improv geo doe grass grow in all countri tut yes—th green turf which natur cover fertil soil of all countri is chiefli compos of grass of variou kind they form therefor the verdant carpet extend over the earth and humbl as they are contribut more to beauti and util than ani other part of the veget creation har what—mor than tree tut ye certainli a land entir cover with tree would be gloomi unwholesom and scarc inhabit wherea the meadow the down and the cornfield afford the most agreeabl prospect to the eye and furnish everi necessari and mani of the luxuri of life give us corn and grass and what shall we want for food har let me see—what should we have there bread and flour for pud geo ay and milk for you know cow live on grass and hay—so there chees and butter and all thing that are made of milk tut and are there not all kind of meat too and poultri and then for drink there are beer and ale which are made from barley for all these we are chiefli indebt to the grass geo then i am sure we are veri much oblig to the grass tut well—let us now walk homeward some time henc you shall make a collect of all the kind of grass and learn to know them from each other a tea lectur tutor—pupil tutor come—th tea is readi lay by your book and let us talk a littl you have assist in teamak a great mani time and yet i dare say you never consid what kind of an oper it wa pupil an oper of cookery—i it not tut you may call it so but it is properli an oper of chymistri pup of chymistri i thought that had been a veri deep sort of a busi tut o—ther are mani thing in common life that belong to the deepest of scienc make tea is the chymic oper call infus which is when a hot liquor is pour upon a substanc in order to extract someth from it the water you see extract from the tealeav their colour tast and flavour pup would not cold water do the same tut it would but more slowli heat assist almost all liquor in their power of extract the virtu of herb and other substanc thu good housew were formerli use to boil their tea in order to get all good from it as complet as possibl the greater heat and agit of boil make it act more power the liquor in which a substanc ha been boil is call a decoct of that substanc pup then we had a decoct of mutton at dinner today tut we had—broth is a decoct and so are gruel and barleywat but when anyth is put to steep in a cold liquor it is call macer the ingredi of which ink is made are macer in all these case you see the whole substanc doe not mix with the liquor but onli part of it the reason is that part of it is solubl in the liquor and part not pup what is the mean of that tut solut is when a solid put into a fluid entir disappear in it leav the liquor clear thu when i throw thi lump of sugar into my tea you see it gradual wast away till it is all gone and then i can tast it in everi singl drop of my tea but the tea is as clear as befor pup salt would do the same tut it would but if i were to throw in a lump of chalk it would lie undissolv at the bottom pup but it would make the water white tut true while it wa stir and then it would be a diffus but while the chalk wa thu mix with the liquor it would lose it transpar and not recov it again till by stand the chalk had all subsid and left the liquor as it wa befor pup how is the cream mix with the tea tut whi that is onli diffus for it take away the transpar of the tea but the particl of cream be finer and lighter than those of chalk it remain longer unit with the liquor howev in time the cream would separ too and rise to the top leav the tea clear now suppos you had a mixtur of sugar salt chalk and tealeav and were to throw it into water either hot or cold what would be the effect pup the sugar and salt would be dissolv and disappear the tealeav would yield their colour and tast the chalk—i do not know what would becom of that tut whi if the mixtur were stir the chalk would be diffus through it and make it turbid or muddi but on stand it would leav it unchang pup then there would remain at bottom the chalk and tealeav tut ye the clear liquor would contain in solut salt sugar and those particl of the tea in which it colour and tast consist the remaind of the tea and the chalk would lie undissolv pup then i suppos tealeav after the tea is made are lighter than at first tut undoubtedli if taken out and dri they would be found to have lost part of their weight and the water would have gain it sometim howev it is an extrem small portion of a substanc which is solubl but it is that in which it most remark qualiti resid thu a small piec of spice will commun a strong flavour to a larg quantiti of liquid with veri littl loss of weight pup will all liquor dissolv the same thing tut by no mean mani dissolv in water that will not in spirit of wine and the contrari and upon thi differ mani curiou matter in the art are found thu spiritvarnish is made of a solut of variou gum or resin in spirit that will not dissolv in water therefor when it ha been laid over ani surfac with a brush and is becom dri the rain or moistur of the air will not affect it thi is the case with the beauti varnish laid upon coach on the other hand the varnish left by gumwat could not be wash off by spirit pup i rememb when i made gumwat upon set the cup in a warm place it all dri away and left the gum just as it wa befor would the same happen if i had sugar or salt dissolv in water tut ye upon expos the solut to warmth it would dri away and you would get back your salt and sugar in a solid state as befor pup but if i were to do so with a cup of tea what should i get tut not tealeav certainli but your question requir a littl previou explan it is the properti of heat to make most thing fli off in vapour which is call evapor or exhal but thi it doe in veri differ degre to differ substanc some are veri easili made to evapor other veri difficultli and other not at all by the most violent fire we can rais fluid in gener are easili evapor but not equal so spirit of wine fli off in vapour much sooner than water so that if you had a mixtur of the two by appli a gentl heat you might drive off almost all the spirit while the greater part of the water would remain water again is more evapor than oil some solid substanc are much dispos to evapor thu smell salt may by a littl heat be entir driven away in the air but in gener solid are more fix than fluid and therefor when a solid is dissolv in a fluid it may commonli be recov again by evapor by thi oper common salt is got from seawat and salt spring both artifici and in hot countri by the natur heat of the sun when the water is no more than is just suffici to dissolv the salt it is call a satur solut and on evapor the water further the salt begin to separ form littl regular mass call crystal sugar may be made in like manner to form crystal and then it is sugarcandi pup but what is a sirup tut that is when so much sugar is dissolv as sensibl to thicken the liquor but not to separ from it well—now to your question about tea on expos it to consider heat those fine particl in which it flavour consist be as volatil or evapor as the water would fli off along with it and when the liquor came to dryness there would be left onli those particl in which it rough and colour consist thi would make what is call an extract of a plant pup what becom of the water that evapor tut it ascend into the air and unit with it but if in it way it be stop by ani cold bodi it is condens that is it return to the state of water again lift up the lid of the teapot and you will find water collect on the insid of it which is condens steam from the hot tea beneath hold a spoon or knife in the way of the steam which burst out of the spout of the teakettl and you will find it immedi cover with drop thi oper of turn a fluid into vapour and then condens it is call distil for thi purpos the vessel in which the liquor is heat is close cover with anoth call the head into which the steam rise and is condens it is then drawn off by mean of a pipe into anoth vessel call the receiv in thi way all sweetscent and aromat liquor are drawn from fragrant veget by mean of water or spirit the fragrant part be veri volatil rise along with the steam of the water or spirit and remain unit with it after it is condens rosewat and spirit of lavend are liquor of thi kind pup then the water collect on the insid of the teapotlid should have the fragranc of the tea tut it should—but unless the tea were fine you could scarc perceiv it pup i think i have heard of make salt water fresh by distil tut ye that is an old discoveri late reviv the salt in seawat be of a fix natur doe not rise with the steam and therefor on condens the steam the water is found to be fresh and thi inde is the method natur employ in rais water by exhal from the ocean which collect in cloud is condens in the cold region of the air and fall down in rain but our tea is done so we will now put an end to our chymic lectur pup but is thi real chymistri tut ye it is pup whi i understand it all without ani difficulti tut i intend you should the kidnapp mr b wa accustom to read in the even to hi young folk some select stori and then ask them in turn what they thought of it from the reflect they made on these occas he wa enabl to form a judgment of their disposit and wa led to throw in remark of hi own by which their heart and understand might be improv one night he read the follow narr from churchil voyages— in some voyag of discoveri made from denmark to greenland the sailor were instruct to seiz some of the nativ by forc or stratagem and bring them away in consequ of these order sever greenland were kidnap and brought to denmark though they were treat there with kind the poor wretch were alway melancholi and were observ frequent to turn their face toward the north and sigh bitterli they made sever attempt to escap by put out to sea in their littl cano which had been brought with them one of them had got as far as thirti leagu from land befor he wa overtaken it wa remark that thi poor man whenev he met a woman with a child in her arm use to utter a deep sigh whenc it wa conjectur that he had left a wife and child behind him they all pine away one after anoth and die miser now edward said he what is your opinion of thi stori ed poor creatur i think it wa barbar to take them from home mr b it wa inde ed have civil nation ani right to behav so to savag mr b i think you may readili answer that question yourself suppos you were a savage—what would be your opinion ed i dare say i should think it veri wrong but can savag think about right and wrong as we do mr b whi not are they not men ed ye but not like civil men sure mr b i know no import differ between ourselv and those peopl we are pleas to call savag but in the degre of knowledg and virtu possess by each and i believ mani individu among the greenland as well as other unpolish peopl exceed in these respect mani among us in the present case i am sure the danish sailor show themselv the greater savag ed but what did they take away the greenland for mr b the pretenc wa that they might be brought to be instruct in a christian countri and then sent back to civil their countrymen ed and wa not that a good thing mr b certainli if it were done by proper mean but to attempt it by an act of violenc and injustic could not be right for they could teach them noth so good as their exampl wa bad and the poor peopl were not like to learn willingli from those who had begun with injur them so cruelli ed i rememb captain cook brought over somebodi from otaheit and poor lee boo wa brought here from the pelew island but i believ they both came of their own accord mr b they did and it is a great proof of the better way of think of modern voyag than former one that they do not consid it as justifi to use violenc even for the suppos benefit of the peopl they visit ed i have read of take possess of a newlydiscov countri by set up the king standard or some such ceremoni though it wa full of inhabit mr b such wa formerli the custom and a more impud mockeri of all right and justic can scarc be conceiv yet thi i am sorri to say is the titl by which european nation claim the greatest part of their foreign settlement ed and might not the nativ drive them out again if they were abl mr b i am sure i do not know whi they might not for forc can never give right now harri tell me what you think of the stori harri i think it veri strang that peopl should want to go back to such a cold dismal place as greenland mr b whi what countri do you love best in the world har england to be sure mr b but england is by no mean the warmest and finest countri here are no grape grow in the field nor orang in the wood and hedg as there are in more southern climat har i should like them veri well to be sure—but then england is my own nativ countri where you and mamma and all my friend live besid it is a veri pleasant countri too mr b as to your first reason you must be sensibl that the greenland can say just the same and the poor fellow who left a wife and children behind must have had the strongest of all tie to make him wish to return do you think i should be easi to be separ from all of you har no and i am sure we should not be easi neither mr b home my dear wherev it is is the spot toward which a good heart is the most strongli drawn then as for the pleasant of a place that all depend upon habit the greenland be accustom to the way of live and all the object of hi own countri could not relish ani other so well he love whalefat and seal as well as you can do pud and beef he thought row hi littl boat amid the boister wave pleasant employ than drive a plough or a cart he fenc himself against the winter cold by warm cloth and the long night of mani week which you would think so gloomi wa to him a season of eas and festiv in hi habit underground it is a veri kind and wise dispens of provid that everi part of the world is render most agreeabl to those who live in it now littl mari what have you to say mari i have onli to say that if they were to offer to carri me away from home i would scratch their eye out mr b well said my girl stand up for yourself let nobodi run away with you—against your will mari that i wont illustr even xi on manufactur father—henri henri my dear father you observ the other day that we had a great mani manufactur in england pray what is a manufactur father a manufactur is someth made by the hand of man it is deriv from two latin word manu the hand and facer to make manufactur are therefor oppos to product which latter are what the bounti of natur spontan afford as fruit corn marbl hen but there is a great deal of troubl with corn you have often made me take notic how much pain it cost the farmer to plough hi ground and put the seed in the earth and keep it clear from weed fa veri true but the farmer doe not make the corn he onli prepar for it a proper soil and situat and remov everi hinder aris from the hard of the ground or the neighbourhood of other plant which might obstruct the secret and wonder process of veget but with the veget itself he ha noth to do it is not hi hand that draw out the slender fibr of the root push up the green stalk and by degre the spiki ear swell the grain and embrown it with that rich ting of tawni russet which inform the husbandman it is time to put in hi sickl all thi oper is perform without hi care or even knowledg hen now then i understand corn is a product and bread is a manufactur fa bread is certainli in strict of speech a manufactur but we do not in gener appli the term to anyth in which the origin materi is so littl chang if we want to speak of bread philosoph we should say it is a prepar of corn hen is sugar a manufactur fa no for the same reason besid which i do not recollect the term be appli to ani articl of food i suppos from an idea that food is of too perish a natur and gener obtain by a process too simpl to deserv the name we say therefor sugarwork oilmil chocolatework we do not say a beermanufactori but a breweri but thi is onli a niceti of languag for properli all those are manufactori if there is much of art and curios in the process hen do we say a manufactori of pictur fa no but for a differ reason a pictur especi if it belong to ani of the higher kind of paint is an effort of geniu a pictur can not be produc by ani given combin of canvass and colour it is the hand inde that execut but the head that work sir joshua reynold could not have gone when he wa engag to paint a pictur and hire workmen the one to draw the eye anoth the nose a third the mouth the whole must be the painter own that particular painter and no other and no one who ha not hi idea can do hi work hi work is therefor nobler of a higher speci hen pray give me an instanc of a manufactur fa the make of watch is a manufactur the silver iron gold or whatev els is use in it are product the materi of the work but it is by the wonder art of man that they are wrought into the numberless wheel and spring of which thi complic machin is compos hen then is there not as much art in make a watch as a pictur doe not the head work fa certainli in the origin invent of watch as much or more than in paint but when onc invent the art of watchmak is capabl of be reduc to a mere mechan labour which may be exercis by ani man of common capac accord to certain precis rule when made familiar to him by practic of thi paint is not capabl hen but my dear father make book sure requir a great deal of think and studi and yet i rememb the other day at dinner a gentleman said that mr pica had manufactur a larg volum in less than a fortnight fa it wa meant to convey a satir remark on hi book becaus it wa compil from other author from whom he had taken a page in one place and a page in anoth so that it wa not produc by the labour of hi brain but of hi hand thu you heard your mother complain that the london cream wa manufactur which wa a point and concis way of say that the cream wa not what it ought to be or what it pretend to be for cream when genuin is a pure product but when mix up and adulter with flour and isinglass and i know not what it becom a manufactur it wa as much as to say art ha been here where it ha no busi where it is not benefici but hurt a great deal of the delicaci of languag depend upon an accur knowledg of the specif mean of singl term and a nice attent to their rel proprieti hen have all nation manufactur fa all that are in ani degre cultiv but it veri often happen that countri natur the poorest have manufactur of the greatest extent and varieti hen whi so fa for the same reason i apprehend that individu who are rich without ani labour of their own are seldom so industri and activ as those who depend upon their own exert thu the spaniard who possess the richest gold and silver mine in the world are in want of mani conveni of life which are enjoy in london and amsterdam hen i can comprehend that i believ if my uncl leger were to find a gold mine under hi warehous he would soon shut up hi shop fa i believ so it is not howev easi to establish manufactur in a veri poor nation they requir scienc and geniu for their invent art and contriv for their execut order peac and union for their flourish they requir too a number of men to combin togeth in an undertak and to prosecut it with the most patient industri they requir therefor law and govern for their protect if you see extens manufactur in ani nation you may be sure it is a civil nation you may be sure properti is accur ascertain and protect they requir great expens for their first establish costli machin for shorten manual labour and money and credit for purchas materi from distant countri there is not a singl manufactur of great britain which doe not requir in some part or other of it process product from the differ part of the globe oil drug varnish quicksilv and the like it requir therefor ship and a friendli intercours with foreign nation to transport commod and exchang product we could not be a manufactur unless we were also a commerci nation they requir time to take root in ani place and their excel often depend upon some nice and delic circumst a peculiar qualiti for instanc in the air or water or some other local circumst not easili ascertain thu i have heard that the irish women spin better than the english becaus the moister temperatur of their climat make their skin more soft and their finger more flexibl thu again we can not die so beauti a scarlet as the french can though with the same drug perhap on account of the superior puriti of the air but though so much is necessari for the perfect of the more curiou and complic manufactur all nation possess those which are subservi to the common conveni of life—th loom and the forg particularli are of the highest antiqu hen ye i rememb hector bid andromach return to her apart and employ herself in weav with her maid and i rememb the shield of achil fa true and you likewis rememb in an earlier period the fine linen of egypt and to go still higher the work of iron and brass is record of tubalcain befor the flood hen which is the most import manufactur or agricultur fa agricultur is the most necessari becaus it is first of all necessari that man should live but almost all the enjoy and comfort of life are produc by manufactur hen whi are we oblig to take so much pain to make ourselv comfort fa to exercis our industri natur provid the materi for man she pour out at hi feet a profus of gem metal die plant ore bark stone gum wax marbl wood root skin earth and miner of all kind she ha likewis given him tool hen i did not know that natur gave us tool fa no what are those two instrument you carri alway about with you so strong and yet so flexibl so nice joint and branch out into five long taper unequ divis ani of which may be contract or stretch out at pleasur the extrem of which have a feel so wonder delic and which are strengthen and defend by horn hen the hand fa ye man is as much superior to the brute in hi outward form by mean of the hand as he is in hi mind by the gift of reason the trunk of the eleph come perhap the nearest to it in it exquisit feel and flexibl it is inde call hi hand in latin and accordingli that anim ha alway been reckon the wisest of brute when natur gave man the hand she said to him exercis your ingenu and work as soon as ever a man rise abov the state of a savag he begin to contriv and to make thing in order to improv hi forlorn condit thu you may rememb thomson repres industri come to the poor shiver wretch and teach him the art of life— taught him to chip the wood and hew the stone till by degre the finish fabric rose tore from hi limb the bloodypollut fur and wrap them in the woolli vestment warm or bright in glossi silk and flow lawn hen it must requir a great deal of knowledg i suppos for so mani curiou work what kind of knowledg is most necessari fa there is not ani which may not be occasion employ but the two scienc which most assist the manufactur are mechan and chymistri the one for build mill work mine and in gener for construct wheel wedg pulley c either to shorten the labour of man by perform it in less time or to perform what the strength of man alon could not accomplish the other in fuse and work ore in die and bleach and extract the virtu of variou substanc for particular use make of soap for instanc is a chymic oper and by chymistri an ingeni gentleman ha late found out a way of bleach a piec of cloth in eightandforti hour which by the common process would have taken up a great mani week you have heard of sir richard arkwright who die late hen ye i have heard he wa at first onli a barber and shave peopl for a penni apiec fa he did so but have a strong turn for mechan he invent or at least perfect a machin by which one pair of hand may do the work of twenti or thirti and as in thi countri everi one is free to rise by merit he acquir the largest fortun in the countri had a great mani hundr of workmen under hi order and had leav given him by the king to put sir befor hi name hen did that do him ani good fa it pleas him i suppos or he would not have accept of it and you will allow i imagin that if titl are use it doe honour to those who bestow them when they are given to such as have made themselv notic for someth use arkwright use to say that if he had time to perfect hi invent he would put a fleec of wool into a box and it should come out broadcloth hen what did he mean by that wa there ani fairi in the box to turn it into broadcloth with her wand fa he wa assist by the onli fairi that ever had the power of transformation—art and industri he meant that he would contriv so mani machin wheel within wheel that the comb card and variou other oper should be perform by mechan almost without the hand of man hen i think if i had not been told i should never have been abl to guess that my coat came off the back of the sheep fa you hardli would but there are manufactur in which the materi is much more chang than in woollen cloth what can be meaner in appear than sand and ash would you imagin anyth beauti could be made out of such a mixtur yet the furnac transform thi into that transpar crystal we call glass than which noth is more sparkl more brilliant more full of lustr it throw about the ray of light as if it had life and motion hen there is a glass shop in london which alway put me in mind of aladdin palac fa it is certain that if a person ignor of the manufactur were to see one of our capit shop he would think all the treasur of golconda were centr there and that everi drop of cutglass wa worth a princ ransom again who would suppos on see the green stalk of a plant that it could be form into a textur so smooth so snowywhit so firm and yet so flexibl as to wrap round the limb and adapt itself to everi movement of the bodi who would guess thi fibrou stalk could be made to float in such light undul fold as in our lawn and cambric not less fine we presum than that transpar draperi which the roman call ventu textili woven wind hen i wonder how anybodi can spin such fine thread fa their finger must have the touch of a spider that as pope say feel at each thread and live along the line and inde you recollect that arachn wa a spinster lace is a still finer product from flax and is one of those in which the origin materi is most improv how mani time the price of a pound of flax do you think that flax will be worth when made into lace hen a great mani time i suppos fa flax at the best hand is bought at fourteen penc a pound they make lace at valencienn in french flander of ten guinea a yard—i believ inde higher—but we will say ten guinea thi yard of lace will weigh probabl more than half an ounc what is the valu of half an ounc of flax hen it come to one farth and three quarter of a farth fa right now tell me how mani time the origin valu the lace is worth hen prodigi it is worth time as much as the flax it is made of fa yet there is anoth materi that is still more improv than flax hen what can that be fa iron the price of pigiron is ten shill a hundr weight thi is not quit one farth for two ounc now you have seen some of the beauti cutsteel that look like diamond hen ye i have seen buckl and pin and watchchain fa then you can form an idea of it but you have onli seen the most common sort there wa a chain made at woodstock in oxford shire and sent to franc which weigh onli two ounc and cost l calcul how mani time that had increas it valu hen amaz it wa worth time the valu of the iron it wa made of fa that is what manufactur can do here man is a kind of creator and like the great creator he may pleas himself with hi work and say it is good in the lastment manufactur too that of steel the english have the honour of excel all the world hen what are the chief manufactur of england fa we have at present a greater varieti than i can pretend to enumer but our stapl manufactur is woollen cloth england abound in fine pastur and extens down which feed great number of sheep henc our wool ha alway been a valuabl articl of trade but we did not alway know how to work it we use to sell it to the flemish or lombard who wrought it into cloth till in the year edward the third invit some flemish weaver over to teach us the art but there wa not much made in england till the reign of henri the seventh manchest and birmingham are town which have arisen to great consequ from small begin almost within the memori of old men now live the first for cotton and muslin good the second for cutleri and hardwar in which we at thi moment excel all europ of late year too carpet beauti as fine tapestri have been fabric in thi countri our clock and watch are greatli esteem the earthenwar plate and dish which we all use in common and the eleg set for the teatabl ornament with music instrument which we admir in our visit yesterday belong to a veri extens manufactori the seat of which is at burslem in staffordshir the princip potteri there belong to one person an excel chymist and a man of great tast he in conjunct with anoth man of tast who is sinc dead ha made our clay more valuabl than the finest porcelain of china he ha mould it into all the form of grace and beauti that are to be met with in the preciou remain of the greek and etruscan artist in the more common articl he ha pencil it with the most eleg design shape it into shell and leav twist it into wickerwork and trail the ductil foliag round the light basket he ha fill our cabinet and chimneypiec with urn lamp and vase on which are lightli trace with the purest simplic the fine form and float draperi of herculaneum in short he ha given to our hous a classic air and ha made everi saloon and everi diningroom school of tast i should add that there is a great demand abroad for thi eleg manufactur the emperess of russia ha some magnific servic of it and the other day one wa sent to the king of spain intend as a present from him to the archbishop of toledo which cost a thousand pound some morn you shall go through the room in the london warehous hen i should like veri much to see manufactur now you have told me some curiou thing about them fa you will do well there is much more entertain to a cultiv mind in see a pin made than in mani a fashion divers which young peopl half ruin themselv to attend in the meantim i will give you some account of one of the most eleg of them which is paper hen pray do my dear father fa it shall be left for anoth even howev for it is now late goodnight illustr the two robber p even xii a lesson in the art of distinguish father come hither charl what is that you see graze in the meadow befor you charl it is a hors fa whose hors is it ch i do not know i never saw it befor fa how do you know it is a hors if you never saw it befor ch becaus it is like other hors fa are all hors alik then ch ye fa if they are alik how do you know one hors from anoth ch they are not quit alik fa but they are so much alik that you can easili distinguish a hors from a cow ch ye inde fa or from a cabbag ch a hors from a cabbag ye sure i can fa veri well then let us see if you can tell how a hors differ from a cabbag ch veri easili a hors is aliv fa true and how is everi thing call which is aliv ch i believ all thing that are aliv are call anim fa right but can you tell me what a hors and a cabbag are alik in ch noth i believ fa ye there is one thing in which the slenderest moss that grow upon the wall is like the greatest man or the highest angel ch becaus god made them fa ye and how do you call everyth that is made ch a creatur fa a hors then is a creatur but also a live creatur that is to say an anim ch and a cabbag is a dead creatur that is the differ fa not so neither noth is dead that ha never been aliv ch what must i call it then if it is neither dead nor aliv fa an inanim creatur there is the anim and inanim creation plant stone metal are of the latter class hors belong to the former ch but the garden told me some of my cabbag were dead and some were aliv fa veri true plant have a veget life a principl of growth and decay thi is common to them with all organ bodi but they have not sensat at least we do not know they have—they have not life therefor in the sens in which anim enjoy it ch a hors is call an anim then fa ye but a salmon is an anim and so is a sparrow how will you distinguish a hors from these ch a salmon live in the water and swim a sparrow fli and live in the air fa i think a salmon could not walk on the ground even if it could live out of the water ch no inde it ha no leg fa and a bird can not gallop like a hors ch no it hop upon it two slender leg fa how mani leg ha a hors ch four fa and an ox ch four likewis fa and a camel ch four still fa do you know ani anim which live upon the earth that have not four leg ch i think not they have all four leg except worm and insect and such thing fa you rememb i suppos what an anim is call that ha four leg you have it in your littl book ch a quadrup fa a hors then is a quadrup by thi we distinguish him from bird fish and insect ch and from men fa true but if you had been talk about bird you would not have found it so easi to distinguish them ch how so a man is not at all like a bird fa yet an ancient philosoph could find no way to distinguish them but by call man a twoleg anim without feather ch i think he wa veri silli they are not at all alik though they have both two leg fa anoth ancient philosoph call diogen wa of your opinion he strip a cock of hi feather and turn him into the school where plato that wa hi name wa teach and said here is plato man for you ch i wish i had been there i should have laugh veri much fa probabl befor we laugh at other howev let us see what we can do ourselv we have not yet found anyth which will distinguish a hors from an eleph or from a norway rat ch oh that is easi enough an eleph is veri larg and a rat is veri small a hors is neither larg nor small fa befor we go ani farther look what is settl on the skirt of your coat ch it is a butterfli what a prodigi larg one i never saw such a one befor fa is it larger than a rat think you ch no that it is not fa yet you call the butterfli larg and you call the rat small ch it is veri larg for a butterfli fa it is so you see therefor that larg and small are rel term ch i do not well understand that phrase fa it mean that they have no precis and determin signif in themselv but are appli differ accord to the other idea which you join with them and the differ posit in which you view them thi butterfli therefor is larg compar with those of it own speci and small compar with mani other speci of anim besid there is no circumst which vari more than the size of individu if you were to give an idea of a hors from it size you would certainli say it wa much bigger than a dog yet if you take the smallest shetland hors and the largest irish greyhound you will find them veri much upon a par size therefor is not a circumst by which you can accur distinguish one anim from anoth nor yet is colour ch no there are black hors and bay and white and pie fa but you have not seen that varieti of colour in a hare for instanc ch no a hare is alway brown fa yet if you were to depend upon that circumst you would not convey the idea of a hare to a mountain or an inhabit of siberia for he see them white as snow we must therefor find out some circumst that do not chang like size and colour and i may add shape though they are not so obviou nor perhap so strike look at the feet of quadrup are they all alik ch no some have long taper claw and some have thick clumsi feet without claw fa the thick feet are horni are they not ch ye i recollect they are call hoof fa and the feet that are not cover with horn and are divid into claw are call digit from digitu a finger becaus they are part like finger here then we have one grand divis of quadrup into hoof and digit of which divis is the hors ch he is hoof fa there are a great mani differ kind of hors did you ever know one that wa not hoof ch no never fa do you think we run ani hazard of a stranger tell us sir hors are hoof inde in your countri but in mine which is in a differ climat and where we feed them differ they have claw ch no i dare say not fa then we have got someth to our purpos a circumst easili mark which alway belong to the anim under everi variat of situat or treatment but an ox is hoof and so is a sheep we must distinguish still farther you have often stood by i suppos while the smith wa shoe a hors what kind of a hoof ha he ch it is round and all in one piec fa and is that of an ox so ch no it is divid fa a hors then is not onli hoof but wholehoof now how mani quadrup do you think there are in the world that are wholehoof ch inde i do not know fa there are among all anim that we are acquaint with either in thi countri or in ani other onli the hors the ass and the zebra which is a speci of the wild ass now therefor you see we have nearli accomplish our purpos we have onli to distinguish him from the ass ch that is easili done i believ i should be sorri if ani bodi could mistak my littl hors for an ass fa it is not so easi howev as you imagin the eye readili distinguish them by the air and gener appear but naturalist have been rather puzzl to fix upon ani specif differ which may serv the purpos of a definit some have therefor fix upon the ear other on the mane and tail what kind of ear ha an ass ch oh veri long clumsi ear ass ear are alway laugh at fa and the hors ch the hors ha small ear nice turn and upright fa and the mane is there no differ there ch the hors ha a fine long flow mane the ass ha hardli ani fa and the tail is it not fuller of hair in the hors than in the ass ch ye the ass ha onli a few long hair at the end of the tail but the hors ha a long bushi tail when it is not cut fa which by the way it is a piti it ever should now then observ what particular we have got a hors is an anim of the quadrup kind wholehoof with short erect ear a flow mane and a tail cover in everi part with long hair now is there ani other anim think you in the world that answer these particular ch i do not know thi doe not tell us a great deal about him fa and yet it tell us enough to distinguish him from all the differ tribe of the creation which we are acquaint with in ani part of the earth do you know now what we have been make ch what fa a definit it is the busi of a definit to distinguish precis the thing defin from ani other thing and to do it in as few term as possibl it object is to separ the subject of definit first from those with which it ha onli a gener resembl then from those which agre with it in a greater varieti of particular and so on till by constantli throw out all which have not the qualiti we have taken notic of we come at length to the individu or the speci we wish to ascertain it is a kind of chase and resembl the manner of hunt in some countri where they first enclos a larg circl with their dog net and hors and then by degre draw their toil closer and closer drive their game befor them till it is at length brought into so narrow a compass that the sportsmen have noth to do but to knock down their prey ch just as we have been hunt thi hors till at last we held him fast by hi ear and tail fa i should observ to you that in the definit naturalist give of a hors it is gener mention that he ha six cut teeth in each jaw becaus thi circumst of the teeth ha been found a veri conveni one for character larg class but as it is not absolut necessari here i have omit it a definit be the most perfect the fewer particular you make use of provid you can say with certainti from those particular the object so character must be thi and no other whatev ch but papa if i had never seen a hors i should not know what kind of anim it wa by thi definit fa let us hear then how you would give me an idea of a hors ch i would say it wa a fine larg pranc creatur with slender leg and an arch neck and a sleek smooth skin and a tail that sweep the ground and that he snort and neigh veri loud and toss hi head and run as swift as the wind fa i think you learn some vers upon the hors in your last lesson repeat them ch the wanton courser thu with rein unbound break from hi stall and beat the trembl ground pamperd and proud he seek the wont tide and lave in height of blood hi shine side hi head now freed he toss to the sky hi mane dishevelld oer hi shoulder fli he snuff the femal in the distant plain and spring exult to hi field again—pop homer fa you have said veri well but thi is not a definit it is a descript ch what is the differ fa a descript is intend to give you a live pictur of an object as if you saw it it ought to be veri full a definit give no pictur to those who have not seen it it rather tell you what it subject is not than what it is by give you such clear specif mark that it shall not be possibl to confound it with anyth els and henc it is of the greatest use in throw thing into class we have a great mani beauti descript from ancient author so loos word that we can not certainli tell what anim are meant by them wherea if they had given us definit three line would have ascertain their mean ch i like a descript best papa fa perhap so i believ i should have done the same at your age rememb howev that noth is more use than to learn to form idea with precis and to express them with accuraci i have not given you a definit to teach you what a hors is but to teach you to think the phenix and dove a phenix who had long inhabit the solitari desert of arabia onc flew so near the habit of men as to meet with a tame dove who wa sit on her nest with wing expand and fondli brood over her young one while she expect her mate who wa forag abroad to procur them food the phenix with a kind of insult compass said to her poor bird how much i piti thee confin to a singl spot and sunk in domest care thou art continu employ either in lay egg or provid for thi brood and thou exhausteth thi life and strength in perpetu a feebl and defenceless race as to myself i live exempt from toil care and misfortun i feed upon noth less preciou than rich gum and spice i fli through the trackless region of the air and when i am seen by men am gaze at with curios and astonish i have no one to control my rang no one to provid for and when i have fulfil my five centuri of life and seen the revolut of age i rather vanish than die and a successor without my care spring up from my ash i am an imag of the great sun whom i ador and glori in be like him singl and alon and have no like the dove repli o phenix i piti thee much more than thou affectest to piti me what pleasur canst thou enjoy who livest forlorn and solitari in a trackless and unpeopl desert who hast no mate to caress thee no young one to excit thi tender and reward thi care no kindr no societi among thi fellow not long life onli but immort itself would be a curs if it were to be bestow on such uncomfort term for my part i know that my life will be short and therefor i employ it in rais a numer poster and in open my heart to all the sweet of domest happi i am belov by my partner i am dear to man and shall leav mark behind me that i have live as to the sun to whom thou hast presum to compar thyself that gloriou be is so total differ from and so infinit superior to all the creatur upon earth that it doe not becom us to liken ourselv to him or to determin upon the manner of hi exist one obviou differ howev thou mayest remark that the sun though alon by hi prolif heat produc all thing and though he shine so high abov our head give us reason everi moment to bless hi beam wherea thou swell with imaginari great dreamest away a long period of exist equal void of comfort and of use the manufactur of paper father i will now as i promis give you an account of the eleg and use manufactur of paper the basi of which is itself a manufactur thi delic and beauti substanc is made from the meanest and most disgust materi from old rag which have pass from one poor person to anoth and have perhap at length drop in tatter from the child of the beggar these are care pick up from dunghil or bought from servant by jew who make it their busi to go about and collect them they sell them to the ragmerch who give them from two penc to four penc a pound accord to their qualiti and he when he ha got a suffici quantiti dispos of them to the owner of the papermil he give them first to women to sort and pick agreeabl to their differ degre of fine they also with a knife cut out care all the seam which they throw into a basket for other purpos they then put them into the dustingengin a larg circular wire siev where they receiv some degre of cleans the rag are then convey to the mill here they were formerli beat to piec with vast hammer which rose and fell continu with a most tremend nois that wa heard at a great distanc but now they put the rag into a larg trough or cistern into which a pipe of clear spring water is constantli flow in thi cistern is place a cylind about two feet long set thick round with row of iron spike stand as near as they can to one anoth without touch at the bottom of the trough there are correspond row of spike the cylind is made to whirl round with inconceiv rapid and with these iron teeth rend and tear the cloth in everi possibl direct till by the assist of the water which continu flow through the cistern it is thoroughli mastic and reduc to a fine pulp and by the same process all it impur are cleans away and it is restor to it origin white thi process take about six hour to improv the colour they then put in a littl smalt which give it a bluish cast which all paper ha more or less the french paper ha less of it than our thi fine pulp is next put into a copper of warm water it is the substanc of paper but the form must now be given it for thi purpos they use a mould it is made of wire strong one way and cross with finer thi mould they just dip horizont into the copper and take it out again it ha a littl wooden frame on the edg by mean of which it retain as much of the pulp as is want for the thick of the sheet and the water run off through the interstic of the wire anoth man instantli receiv it open the frame and turn out the thin sheet which ha now shape but not consist upon soft felt which is place on the ground to receiv it on that is place anoth piec of felt and then anoth sheet of paper and so on till they have made a pile of forti or fifti they are then press with a larg screwpress move by a long lever which forcibl squeez the water out of them and give them immedi consist there is still howev a great deal to be done the felt are taken off and thrown on one side and the paper on the other whenc it is dexter taken up with an instrument in the form of a t three sheet at a time and hung on line to dri there it hang for a week or ten day which likewis further whiten it and ani knot and rough it may have are pick off care by the women it is then size size is a kind of glue and without thi prepar the paper would not bear ink it would run and blot as you see it doe on gray paper the sheet are just dip into the size and taken out again the exact degre of size is a matter of niceti which can onli be known by experi they are then hung up again to dri and when dri taken to the finishingroom where they are examin anew press in the drypress which give them their last gloss and smooth count up into quir made up into ream and sent to the station from whom we have it after he ha fold it again and cut the edg some too he make to shine like satin by hotpress it or gloss it with hot plate the whole process of papermak take about three week har it is a veri curiou process inde i shall almost scrupl for the futur to blacken a sheet of paper with a careless scrawl now i know how much pain it cost to make it so white and beauti fa it is true that there is hardli anyth we use with so much wast and profus as thi manufactur we should think ourselv confin in the use of it if we might not tear dispers and destroy it in a thousand way so that it is realli astonish whenc linen enough can be procur to answer so vast a demand as to the coars brown paper of which an astonish quantiti is use by everi shopkeep in packag c these are made chiefli of oakum that is old hempen rope a fine paper is made in china of silk har i have heard late of woven paper pray what is that they can not weav paper sure fa your question is veri natur in order to answer it i must desir you to take a sheet of common paper and hold it up against the light do not you see mark in it har i see a great mani white line run along lengthwis like rib and smaller that cross them i see too letter and the figur of a crown fa these are all the mark of the wire the thick of the wire prevent so much of the pulp lie upon the sheet in those place consequ wherev the wire are the paper is thinner and you see the light through more readili which give that appear of white line the letter too are work in the wire and are the maker name now to prevent these line which take off from the beauti of the paper particularli of drawingpap there have been late use mould of brass wire exceed fine of equal thick and woven or lattic one within anoth the mark therefor of these are easili press out so as to be hardli visibl if you look at thi sheet you will see it is quit smooth har it is so fa i should mention to you that there is a discoveri veri late made by which they can make paper equal to ani in white of the coarsest brown rag and even of die cotton which they have till now been oblig to throw by for inferior purpos har that is like what you told me befor of bleach cloth in a few hour fa it is inde found upon the same discoveri the paper made of these brown rag is likewis more valuabl from be veri tough and strong almost like parchment har when wa the make of paper found out fa it is a disput point but probabl in the fourteenth centuri the invent ha been of almost equal consequ to literatur with that of print itself and show how the art and scienc like children of the same famili mutual assist and bring forward each other the two robber scene—alexand the great in hi tent guard a man with a fierc counten chain and fetter brought befor him alex what art thou the thracian robber of whose exploit i have heard so much rob i am a thracian and a soldier a a soldier—a thief a plunder an assassin the pest of the countri could honour thi courag but i must detest and punish thi crime

done it a leav me—tak off hi chain and use him well exit robber are we then so much alike—alexand to a robber—let me reflect illustr even xiii the council of quadrup among the larg branch of an age oak which grew in the midst of a thick wood live onc upon a time a wildcat in that tree she wa born and brought up and had nurs mani litter of kitten her mother and her grandmoth had live there befor her inde i believ that as long as the oak had been an oak thi famili of wildcat had made it their home one day as she wa couch among some bush near the foot of her tree watch her opportun to spring upon ani poor littl bird who might happen to alight within her reach she heard a great rustl in the thicket and present two men push their way through and stood befor her thi part of the forest wa so tangl and wild and so far from ani human habit that it wa a rare thing to see men there and the cat wonder veri much whi they came so she lay quit still in her hidingplac watch them and listen to hear what they should say she soon discov that they were woodcutt for each wa arm with an axe which he carri upon hi shoulder present one said to hi fellow is it all to be cut down—al the whole forest answer the other and the ground is to be plough up and sown with corn but the largest tree are to be fell first—if that be the case said the first we can not begin better than with thi nobl oak befor us and i will put a mark on it that we may know it again so say he pull out a piec of chalk and made a larg white cross on the bark of the poor cat own tree next week ad he we will lay the axe to the root and he walk on whistl with great unconcern the unfortun cat lay a long time on the ground half dead with grief and terror and unabl to move a limb at length after utter sever cri so loud and shrill that the whole forest seem to ring again she start up and ran like one distract to spread the dismal news among her neighbour of the wood the first creatur that she met wa the stag he had just start up from hi lair amid the thickest cover and stood listen readi to bound away on the first appear of danger wa it you neighbour puss cri he who set up that fright yell which i heard i almost thought the hound and hunter were upon me—but what is the matter—matt enough answer the cat wors than either hound or hunter the forest is to be cut down and she told him her sad stori the forest cut down bray out the poor stag while the tear ran in larg drop down hi hairi face and what is to becom of me and you and all our neighbour man ha alway been my enemi but thi is a stroke of cruelti which i did not expect even from him is there no help no remedy—i will fight for my tree cri the cat as long as teeth and claw hold good and you with your great horn may sure defend your own thicket but thi man is a terribl creatur and he ha so mani crafti trick that i know nobodi except the fox who is at all a match for him suppos we run and ask hi advic with all my heart said the stag and they march away togeth in search of him the fox had hi abod near the skirt of the forest in the middl of a dri bank thickli cover with bush and brambl hi hole wa burrow deep into the earth and cunningli contriv with sever open on differ side by which he might make hi escap in case of danger the cat put her head in at one of the entranc and call to him to come out but it wa not till he had care peep about and thoroughli satisfi himself that all wa safe that cun reynard ventur to trust himself abroad in great distress the stag relat the caus of their come i have heard someth of thi matter befor repli the fox but you are too condescend to come and ask the advic of a simpl creatur like myself who never yet knew what polici or artific meant and— here the cat and the stag eagerli interrupt him and with one voic began to compliment him on the sagac and wisdom for which all the world gave him credit declar that their whole hope and consol rest on hi counsel well return the fox sinc you will have it so though i blush to utter my poor thought befor beast so much my superior i will ventur with all humil to suggest that a gener meet be immedi summon of all the anim of the forest in order that we may take our measur in concert and after hear the opinion of all an excel propos cri the stag an excel propos echo the cat but who shall we send to call them all together—i would go to them myself repli the fox but it is possibl that some of the smaller anim might doubt the innoc of my intent and refus to come for i have been a much calumni creatur the same thing might happen with you neighbour puss the squirrel and the mous especi true cri the cat they would perhap be take some idl notion into their head and as to my lord the stag rejoin reynard he is a beast of far too exalt a rank for such an offic stay there is my worthi friend the hedgehog suppos we send him a littl slow of foot to be sure and not wonder bright but a plain honest creatur as ani that live well spoken of throughout the forest and the enemi of no one except inde of the fli and the beetl but we do not call the insect to council of course—of cours rejoin the cat but what shall we say to the reptiles—whi as to my neighbour the viper return the fox i own i am inclin to think favour of him whatev some may whisper to hi disadvantag hi temper inde may be none of the mildest but he know how to make himself respect and i think we must by no mean leav him out and if he is admit in common civil hi cousin the snake must be invit also—and what say you to the toad the frog and the newt ask the stag poor creatur said the fox with a sneer your lordship is certainli veri condescend to rememb the exist of be so inferior they sit in our council truli howev i would by no mean give offenc at a time like thi even to the meanest—they may be permit to hear the debat provid they do not presum to speak among their better the fox now call in a somewhat imperi tone to the hedgehog to come forth at the sound of hi voic the littl creatur rous himself with some difficulti from hi morn nap and hastili unrol himself and clear hi prickli coat from the grass and dead leav that stuck in it and ad not a littl to hi rude slovenli appear he crept out from hi hole under the root of a tree and inquir with much humil what mr reynard want with him the fox explain in few word the alarm occurr of the morn and thu proceed to give the hedgehog hi orders— you are to summon all our good neighbour to meet thi even an hour befor sunset under the great yewtre that stand by itself near the centr of the wood pleas to attend and i will name them to you in their order that you may make no mistak first you turn down into yonder dingl and there just beyond the old poplar which is blown up by the root and lie across the way look veri sharp and in a snug shelter nook you will spi a hole run down into the steep bank at the bottom of it you will find the badger beg him to come without fail except the present compani there is no anim in the forest of greater size and consequ nor whom i respect more a littl lower down on the veri brink of the stream live my cousin the polecat—a damp situat i should think but they say he sometim amus himself with fish he is a sharp fellow we must by all mean have him at our council the weasel come next and you will find him in a hollow tree not far off if the squirrel be not frolick as usual among the bough of the larg beech in which he ha hi nest nut are now ripe and you must look for him in the hazelcops on the left if i do not mistak you will also find the dormous lodg under the root of that larg oak hard by which is so full of acorn and the woodmous is hi nextdoor neighbour you must then turn off toward the edg of the forest and search among the fernbrak till you find the hare she sit close in her form all day assur her that we are extrem desir of her compani and if she or ani other of our good neighbour should make the smallest scrupl of meet puss or myself be sure to mention that my lord the stag pass hi word for their safeti both come and return the snake will probabl be sun himself on the grass a littl lower down and in the dri part of the wood abov if you look narrowli you will spi the viper lurk among the dead leav and now you may be gone the hedgehog trudg off with hi commiss in the even everi one of the anim made hi appear under the yewtre except the littl lazi dormous who had just open hi eye when the hedgehog deliv hi messag then turn himself round fallen asleep again and forgotten the whole matter as undoubt lord of the forest the stag took the upper place puss seat herself on hi right and reynard on hi left the other place themselv in due order below the stag open the busi of the day by call upon the cat to relat what she had that morn seen and heard immedi the afflict creatur yell out her dismal tale end with a long and melancholi mew which wa echo by everi anim present in hi own note the stag bray the fox howl the polecat and weasel cri the badger and squirrel growl the snake and viper hiss the hare scream and the mous squeak when the din of these discord nois had a littl subsid my friend said the stag lament are in vain let us now consid what is to be done shall we look on in tame submiss to see our nativ wood level with the earth and ourselv turn out upon the wide world to seek for food and shelter wherev we may find them or shall we not rather all join to defend it with such weapon as natur ha given us let the cat speak first i am for open war cri puss these teeth and these talon were not bestow upon me for noth and as she spoke she unsheath a set of claw at sight of which the mous and the squirrel trembl all over the first man who attack my tree shall feel them in hi eye i will defend my nativ home as long as i have breath in my bodi who is of the same mind reynard let us hear your opinion said the stag i beg to speak last said the crafti fox perhap i have not yet made up my opinion for my part growl out the badger thrust forward hi clumsi person as he spoke i am not so cun as some folk i speak my mind and care for nobodi and i have onli thi to say—that i never attack first but i have strong teeth and a tough hide and if anybodi attempt to turn me out of my den whether man dog or ani other beast i shall tri to make him repent it it wa observ that the badger as he spoke threw a sullen look at the fox which plainli show that he had not forgotten the knavish trick by which reynard had onc contriv to turn him out of a hole which he had dug with the labour of hi own claw and to keep possess of it for himself the viper now glide forward in easi curv and coil himself up and dart out hi fork tongu in a threaten attitud man said he is my enemi and i am hi let him set foot in my dominion if he dare i have a venom in my fang which will soon teach him that my anger is not to be despis i murmur out the snake have no venom to boast i am an innoc and defenceless creatur and i own that so far from attempt to resist the invad i shall quickli retreat from hi approach natur in her bounti ha endu me with the power of swim and when i can no longer find a shelter beneath these quiet shade i shall plung into the stream which bound our domain and seek a safer retreat among the tall weed which flourish on it farther shore as for me feebli scream out the hare as she limp forth stare around her with a look of affright all the world must be awar how weak and timid a creatur i am it ha been said that i have mani friend but i have never yet found a protector and cruel and power enemi lie in wait for my harmless life on everi side what will becom of me i know not probabl some evil end await me but i shall use these nimbl leg my onli hope of safeti to bear me far away from the dread sight of man the sprightli squirrel came forward with a bound i have teeth cri he veri abl to crack a nut and claw by which i can cling fast enough to a bough but how am i to contend against the mighti power of man he would twist off my poor littl head befor i could draw one drop of blood from hi finger it is true that i can live onli in tree and one might as well die fight as pine away with miseri and hunger but i have better thing in view than either from the summit of my beech i have often observ at some distanc on the farther side of the river a group of nobl chestnut grow in a park which would suppli me both with food and lodg i have also discov a spot where two tree on opposit side of the stream stretch forth their arm and nearli meet above—i have made up my mind to the adventur one bold leap will bear me safe i hope to the farther shore and the new and beauti countri that lie beyond it i believ squeak a small shrill voic which wa found to proceed from the mous that my servic would be of small import in a war against mankind and i do not offer them to say the truth i find myself on second thought not greatli concern in thi affair if i lose my nut and acorn by the fall of the tree i shall get wheat barley and oat in exchang which are not wors eat and i can lodg full as well in the middl of a cornrick as under the root of a tree—everi one for himself in thi world our littl friend is much in the right cri the weasel i realli believ that we shall find vastli comfort lodg about barn and farmhous and the veri thought of a poultryyard make my mouth water for such an exchang i should not object to give up my quarter in the wood tomorrow—nor i i protest exclaim the polecat hen egg are not bad thing and how delici to fatten on the blood of turkey gees and chicken a forest is not absolut necessari to me i can hide myself well enough in a hedg or under a ditchbank reynard said the stag all have spoken now but you and we are impati for your opinion the fox aros cast hi eye on the ground with an air of great modesti and after paus a few moment as if to gain courag to speak he thu began grace wave hi long bushi tail as he spoke—whil i listen to the warlik eloqu of the cat to the indign harangu of the viper and to the resolut speech of my worthi friend the badger i like them felt myself inspir with the valiant resolut to die in defenc of our nativ wood and in open war with man but when i afterward began to consid the weak of our lesser brethren the small of our number and the wonder power and resourc of man i wa induc to chang my opinion we can not hope for victori whi should we throw away our live the viper in spite of hi courag and hi venom would be caught by the neck in a cleft stick and put inglori to death veri like befor he had been abl to inflict a singl bite the badger is a favourit object of the cruelti of man he would set upon him hi whole troop of dog hate brute who are alway join in leagu with him against their fellow beasts—and though my worthi friend would fight like a hero and kill or maim sever of them he would at length be torn in piec of what avail would be the teeth and claw of the cat against that thunder and lightn by which man ha the art of kill from afar she would be brought down from her highest bough pierc through the head or the heart befor she could even see that enemi whose eye she threaten to tear out with her talon even you yourself my lord stag would assuredli fall by the teeth of those detest hound after you had gore three or four of the pack i therefor propos more cautiou measur not far off is a wide unfrequ common where the badger may dig himself a den and remain at peac and where the viper may glide undisturb among the heath and gors i have scarc given a thought to the humbl concern of my insignific self but perhap i too may find some cover in that neglect tract which abound also in wild rabbit for you my lord stag you have onli to swim the stream to find yourself like the squirrel in a nobl park where man himself would be proud to becom your protector and own you for the noblest ornament of hi domain and whi should not puss offer her servic to hunt the mice and rat at some snug farmhous in the neighbourhood i interrupt puss set up her back and swell in sudden anger i becom a fawn menial in the dwell of man like those miser littl foreign who have sometim appear in my sight and whom i am asham to own for cat no i am a beast of prey a free nativ of the english wood and such i will live and die man may hunt me down he may destroy my whole race as he ha alreadi hunt down and destroy the bear and the wolf anim much my superior in size and in strength but i disdain to becom hi household servant or to skulk like some of vermin breed about hi outhous and poultryyard pick up a base live by theft and rapin and you reynard crafti knave as you are do you think i do not see through your trick and your pretenc you too like the weasel and polecat have an eye on the poultryyard and the sheepfold you live by man though he hate you and endeavour to destroy you and you care not what becom of the live or liberti of nobler anim but i will reach your eye at least and teach you what it is to provok me so say she flew at him in a furi her first attack brought him to the ground and he wa almost blind befor he could strike a blow in hi own defenc the polecat and weasel think their turn would come next slunk away the hare and the smaller anim follow their exampl even the stag himself wa seiz with a panic and fled the badger alon stood and look on with great composur at the distress of reynard at length the fox see puss almost out of breath made a desper effort and broke loos from her clutch with hi usual cun he ran toward the river well know that the cat would not wet her feet he plung into the water befor she could overtak him and swim with some difficulti to the opposit side threw himself on the bank half dead with pain and fright puss return to her tree disappoint and sullen and thu unprofit end the council of quadrup tit for tat—a tale a law there is of ancient fame by natur self in everi land implant lex talioni is it latin name but if an english term we want give your next neighbour but a pat hell give you back as good and tell you—tit for tat thi tit for tat it seem not men alon but eleph for legal justic own in proof of thi a stori i shall tell ye import from the famou town of delhi a mighti eleph that swelld the state of aurengzeb the great one day wa taken by hi driver to drink and cool him in the river the driver on hi neck wa seat and as he rode along by some acquaint in the throng with a ripe cocoanut wa treat a cocoanut a pretti fruit enough but guard by a shell both hard and tough the fellow tri and tri and tri work and sweat pish and fret to find out it insid and pick the kernel for hi eat at length quit out of patienc grown wholl reach me up he cri a stone to break thi plaguy shell but stay ive here a solid bone may do perhap as well so half in earnest half in jest he bangd it on the forehead of hi beast an eleph they say ha human feel and full as well as we he know the differ between word and blow between horseplay and civil deal use him but well hell do hi best and serv you faith and truli but insult unprovok he cant digest he studi oer them and repay them duli to make my head an anvil thought the creatur wa never certainli the will of natur so master mine you may repent then shake hi broad ear away he went the driver took him to the water and thought no more about the matter but eleph within hi memori hid it he felt the wrong—th other onli did it a week or two elaps one marketday again the beast and driver took their way through row of shop and booth they passd with eatabl and trinket store till to a gardner stall they came at last where cocoanut lay pile upon the board— ha thought the eleph ti now my turn to show thi method of nutbreak my friend abov will like to learn though at the cost of a headach then in hi curl trunk he took a heap and wave it oer hi neck a sudden sweep and on the hapless driver sconc he laid a blow so hard and full that crackd the nut at onc but with them crackd hi scull young folk wheneer you feel inclin to rompish sport and freedom rough bear tit for tat in mind nor give an eleph a cuff to be repaid in kind on wine and spirit georg and harri accompani by their tutor went one day to pay a visit to a neighbour gentleman their father friend they were veri kindli receiv and shown all about the garden and pleasureground but noth took their fanci so much as an extens graperi hung round with bunch of variou kind fulli ripe and almost too big for the vine to support they were liber treat with the fruit and carri away some bunch to eat as they walk dure their return as they were pick their grape georg said to the tutor a thought is just come into my head sir wine you know is call the juic of the grape but wine is hot and intox peopl that drink much of it now we have had a good deal of grapejuic thi morn and yet i do not feel heat nor doe it seem at all to have got into our head what is the reason of thi tut the reason is that grapejuic is not wine though wine is made from it geo pray how is it made then tut i will tell you for it is a matter worth know the juic press from the grape call must is at first a sweet wateri liquor with a littl tart but with no strength or spirit after it ha stood awhil it begin to grow thick and muddi it move up and down and throw scum and bubbl of air to the surfac thi is call work or ferment it continu in thi state for some time more or less accord to the quantiti of the juic and the temperatur of the weather and then gradual settl again becom clearer than at first it ha now lost it sweet flat tast and acquir a brisk and pungenc with a heat and intox properti that is it ha becom wine thi natur process is call the vinou ferment and mani liquor besid grapejuic are capabl of undergo it geo i have heard of the work of beer and ale is that of the same kind tut it is and beer and ale may properli be call barleywin for you know they are clear brisk and intox in the same manner cider is applewin and mead is honeywin and you have heard of raisinwin and currantwin and a great mani other har ye there is elderwin and cowslipwin and orangewin geo will everyth of that sort make wine tut all veget juic that are sweet are capabl of ferment and of produc a liquor of a vinou natur but if they have littl sweet the liquor is proport weak and poor and is apt to becom sour or vapid har but barley is not sweet tut barley as it come from the ear is not but befor it is use for brew it is made into malt and then it is sensibl sweet you know what malt is har i have seen heap of it in the malthous but i do not know how it is made tut barley is made malt by put it in heap and wet it when it becom hot and swell and would sprout out just as if it were sown unless it were then dri in a kiln by thi oper it acquir a sweet tast you have drunk sweetwort har ye tut well thi is made by steep malt in hot water the water extract and dissolv all the sweet or sugari part of the malt it then becom like a natur sweet juic geo would not sugar and water then make wine tut it would and the wine made in england of our common fruit and flower have all a good deal of sugar in them cowslip flower for exampl give littl more than the flavour to the wine name from them and it is the sugar ad to them which properli make the wine geo but none of these wine are so good as grapewin tut no the grape from the rich and abund of it juic is the fruit univers prefer for make wine where it come to perfect which it seldom doe in our climat except by mean of artifici heat geo i suppos then grape are finest in the hottest countri tut not so neither they are properli a fruit of the temper zone and do not grow well between the tropic and in veri hot countri it is scarc possibl to make wine of ani kind to keep for they ferment so strongli as to turn sour almost immedi geo i think i have read of palmwin on the coast of guinea tut ye a sweet juic flow abundantli from incis in certain speci of the palm which ferment immedi and make a veri pleasant sort of weak wine but it must be drunk the same day it is made for on the next it is as sour as vinegar geo what is vinegar—i it not sour wine tut everyth that make wine will make vinegar also and the stronger the wine the stronger the vinegar the vinou ferment must be first brought on but it need not produc perfect wine for when the intent is to make vinegar the liquor is kept still warm and it goe on without stop to anoth kind of ferment call the acet the product of which is vinegar geo i have heard of alegar i suppos that is vinegar made of ale tut it is—but as ale is not so strong as wine the vinegar made from it is not so sharp or perfect but housew make good vinegar with sugar and water har will vinegar make peopl drunk if they take too much of it tut no the wine lose it intox qualiti as well as it tast on turn to vinegar geo what are spiritu liquors—hav they not someth to do with wine tut ye they consist of the spiritu or intox part of wine separ from the rest you may rememb that on talk of distil i told you that it wa the rais of a liquor in steam or vapour and condens it again and that some liquor were more easili turn to vapour than other and were therefor call more volatil or evapor now wine is a mix or compound liquor of which the greater part is water but what heat and intox is vinou spirit thi spirit be much more volatil than water on the applic of a gentl heat fli off in vapour and may be collect by itself in distil vessels—and thu are made spiritu liquor geo will everyth that you call wine yield spirit tut ye everyth that ha undergon the vinou ferment thu in england a great deal of malt spirit is made from a kind of wort brought into ferment and then set directli to distil without first make ale or beer of it gin is a spiritu liquor also got from corn and flavour with junip berri even potato carrot and turnip may be made to afford spirit by first ferment their juic in the west indi rum is distil from the dreg of the sugarcan wash out by water and ferment but brandi is distil from the ferment juic of the grape and is made in the wine countri geo is spirit of wine differ from spiritu liquor tut it is the strongest part of them got by distil over again for all these still contain a good deal of water along with a pure spirit which may be separ by a gentler heat than wa use at first but in order to procur thi as strong and pure as possibl it must be distil sever time over alway leav some of the wateri part behind when perfectli pure it is the same whatev spiritu liquor it is got from har my mamma ha littl bottl of lavend water what is that tut it is a spirit of wine flavour with lavend flower and it may in like manner be flavour with mani other fragrant thing sinc their odorifer part is volatil and will rise in vapour along with the spirit har will not spirit of wine burn violent geo that it will i can tell you and so will rum and brandi for you know it wa set on fire when we made snapdragon tut all spiritu liquor are highli inflamm and the more so the purer they are one way of tri the puriti of spirit is to see if it will burn all away without leav ani moistur behind then it is much lighter than water and that afford anoth way of judg of it strength a hollow ivori ball is set to swim in it and the deeper it sink down the lighter and therefor the more spiritu is the liquor geo i have heard much of the mischief done by spiritu liquors—pray what good do they do tut the use and abus of wine and spirit is a veri copiou subject and there is scarc ani gift of human art the gener effect of which are more dubiou you know what wine is said to be given for in the bibl geo to make glad the heart of man tut right and noth ha such an immedi effect in inspir vigour of bodi and mind as wine it banish sorrow and care recruit from fatigu enliven the fanci inflam the courag and perform a hundr fine thing of which i could bring you abund proof from the poet the physician too speak almost as much in it favour both in diet and medicin but it realli good effect are onli when use in moder and it unfortun is one of those thing which man can hardli be brought to use moder excess in wine bring on effect the veri contrari to it benefit it stupifi and enfeebl the mind and fill the bodi with incur diseas and thi it doe even when use without intox but a drunken man lose for the time everi distinct of a reason creatur and becom wors than a brute beast on thi account mahomet entir forbad it use to hi follow and to thi day it is not publicli drunk in ani of the countri that receiv the mohammedan religion har wa not that right tut i think not if we were entir to renounc everi thing that may be misus we should have scarc ani enjoy left and it is a proper exercis of our strength of mind to use good thing with moder when we have it in our power to do otherwis geo but spiritu liquor are not good at all are they tut they have so littl good and so much bad in them that i confess i wish their common use could be abolish altogeth they are gener taken by the lowest class of peopl for the express purpos of intox and they are much sooner prejudici to the health than wine and inde when drunk unmix are no better than slow poison geo spirit of wine is use though for sever things—i it not tut ye and i would have all spirit kept in the hand of chymist and artist who know how to employ them use spirit of wine will dissolv mani thing that water will not apothecari use them in draw tinctur and artist in prepar colour and make varnish they are likewis veri power preserv from corrupt you may have seen serpent and insect brought from abroad in vial full of spirit geo i have har and i know of anoth use of spirit tut what is that har to burn in lamp my grandmamma ha a teakettl with a lamp under it to keep the water hot and she burn spirit in it tut so she doe well—so much for the use of these liquor geo but you have said noth about ale and beer are they wholesom tut ye in moder but they are sadli abus too and rob mani men of their health as well as their money and sens geo small beer doe no harm howev tut no—and we will indulg in a good draught of it when we get home har i like water better tut then drink it by all mean he that is satisfi with water ha one want the less and may defi thirst in thi countri at least illustr the trial p even xiv the boy without a geniu mr wiseman the schoolmast at the end of the summervac receiv a new scholar with the follow letter— sir—thi will be deliv to you by my son samuel whom i beg leav to commit to your care hope that by your wellknown skill and attent you will be abl to make someth of him which i am sorri to say none of hi master have hitherto done he is now eleven and yet can do noth but read hi mothertongu and that but indiffer we sent him at seven to a grammarschool in our neighbourhood but hi master soon found that hi geniu wa not turn to learn languag he wa then put to write but he set about it so awkwardli that he made noth of it he wa tri at account but it appear that he had no geniu for that either he could do noth in geographi for want of memori in short if he ha ani geniu at all it doe not yet show itself but i trust to your experi in case of thi natur to discov what he is fit for and to instruct him accordingli i beg to be favour shortli with your opinion about him and remain sir your most obedi servant humphrey acr when mr wiseman had read thi letter he shook hi head and said to hi assistant—a pretti subject they have sent us here a lad that ha a great geniu for noth at all but perhap my friend mr acr expect that a boy should show a geniu for a thing befor he know anyth about it—no uncommon error let us see howev what the youth look like i suppos he is a human creatur at least master samuel acr wa now call in he came hang down hi head and look as if he wa go to be flog come hither my dear said mr wiseman stand by me and do not be afraid nobodi will hurt you how old are you eleven last may sir a wellgrown boy of your age inde you love play i dare say ye sir what are you a good hand at marbl pretti good sir and can spin a top and drive a hoop i suppos ye sir then you have the full use of your hand and finger ye sir can you write samuel i learn a littl sir but i left it off again and whi so becaus i could not make the letter no whi how do you think other boy do—hav they more finger than you no sir are you not abl to hold a pen as well as a marbl samuel wa silent let me look at your hand samuel held out both hi paw like a danc bear i see noth to hinder you from write as well as ani boy in the school you can read i suppos ye sir tell me then what is written over the schoolroom door samuel with some hesit read— whatev man ha done man may do pray how did you learn to read—wa it not by take pain ye sir well—tak more pain will enabl you to read better do you know anyth of the latin grammar no sir have you never learn it i tri sir but i could not get it by heart whi you can say some thing by heart i dare say you can tell me the name of the day of the week in their order ye sir i know them and the month in the year perhap ye sir and you could probabl repeat the name of your brother and sister and all your father servant and half the peopl in the villag besid i believ i could sir well—and is hic hæc hoc more difficult to rememb than these samuel wa silent have you learn anyth of account i went into addit sir but i did not go on with it whi so i could not do it sir how mani marbl can you buy for a penni twelv new one sir and how mani for two penc twentyfour and how mani for a halfpenni six if you were to have a penni a day what would that make in a week seven penc but if you paid two penc out of that what would you have left samuel studi a while and then said five penc right whi here you have been practis the four great rule of arithmetic—addit subtract multipl and divis learn account is no more than thi well samuel i shall see what you are fit for i shall set you about noth but what you are abl to do but observ you must do it we have no i cant here now go among your schoolfellow samuel went away glad that hi examin wa over and with more confid in hi power than he had felt befor the next day he began busi a boy less than himself wa call out to set him a copi of letter and anoth wa appoint to hear him in grammar he read a few sentenc in english that he could perfectli understand to the master himself thu by go on steadili and slowli he made a sensibl progress he had alreadi join hi letter got all the declens perfectli and half the multipl tabl when mr wiseman thought it time to answer hi father letter which he did as follows— sir i now think it right to give you some inform concern your son you perhap expect it sooner but i alway wish to avoid hasti judgment you mention in your letter that it had not yet been discov which way hi geniu point if by geniu you meant such a decid bent of mind to ani one pursuit as will lead to excel with littl or no labour or instruct i must say that i have not met with such a qualiti in more than three or four boy in my life and your son is certainli not among the number but if you mean onli the abil to do some of those thing which the greater part of mankind can do when properli taught i can affirm that i find in him no peculiar defici and whether you choos to bring him up to trade or to some practic profess i see no reason to doubt that he may in time becom suffici qualifi for it it is my favourit maxim sir that everyth most valuabl in thi life may gener be acquir by take pain for it your son ha alreadi lost much time in the fruitless expect of find out what he would take up of hi own accord believ me sir few boy will take up anyth of their own accord but a top or a marbl i will take care while he is with me that he lose no more time thi way but is employ about thing that are fit for him not doubt that we shall find him fit for them i am sir your c solon wiseman though the doctrin of thi letter did not perfectli agre with mr acress notion yet be convinc that mr wiseman wa more like to make someth of hi son than ani of hi former preceptor he continu him at hi school for some year and had the satisfact to find him go on in a steadi cours of gradual improv in due time a profess wa chosen for him which seem to suit hi temper and talent but for which he had no particular turn have never thought at all about it he made a respect figur in it and went through the world with credit and use though without a geniu half a crown worth valentin wa in hi thirteenth year and a scholar in one of our great school he wa a welldispos boy but could not help envi a littl some of hi companion who had a larger allow of money than himself he ventur in a letter to sound hi father on the subject not directli ask for a particular sum but mention that mani of the boy in hi class had half a crown a week for pocketmoney hi father who did not choos to compli with hi wish for variou reason nor yet to refus him in a mortifi manner wrote an answer the chief purpos of which wa to make him sensibl what sort of a sum half a crown a week wa and to how mani more import use it might be put than to provid a schoolboy with thing absolut superflu to him it is calcul said he that a grown man may be kept in health and fit for labour upon a pound and a half of good bread a day suppos the valu of thi to be two penc halfpenni and add a penni for a quart of milk which will greatli improv hi diet half a crown will keep him eight or nine day in thi manner a common labour wage in our countri are seven shill per week and if you add somewhat extraordinari for harvest work thi will not make it amount to three halfcrown on an averag the year round suppos hi wife and children to earn anoth halfcrown for thi ten shill per week he will maintain himself hi wife and half a dozen children in food lodg cloth and fuel a halfcrown then may be reckon the full weekli mainten of two human creatur in everi thing necessari where potato are much cultiv two bushel weigh eighti pound a piec may be purchas for half a crown here are one hundr and sixti pound of solid food of which allow for the wast in dress you may reckon two pound and a half suffici for the sole daili nourish of one person at thi rate nine peopl might be fed a week for half a crown poorli inde but so as mani thousand are fed with the addit of a littl salt or buttermilk if the father of a numer famili were out of work or the mother lyingin a parish would think half a crown a week a veri ampl assist to them mani of the cottag round us would receiv with great thank a sixpenni loaf per week and reckon it a veri materi addit to their children bread for half a crown therefor you might purchase—th weekli bless of five poor famili porter is a sort of luxuri to a poor man but not a useless one sinc it will stand in the place of some solid food and enabl him to work with better heart you could treat a hardwork man with a pint a day of thi liquor for twelv day with half a crown mani a cottag in the countri inhabit by a larg famili is let for forti shill a year half a crown a week would pay the full rent of three such cottag and allow somewhat over for repair the usual price for school at a dameschool in a villag is two penc a week you might therefor get fifteen children instruct in read and the girl in sew for half a crown weekli but even in a town you might get them taught read write and account and so fit for ani common trade for five shill a quarter and therefor half a crown a week would keep six children at such a school and provid them with book besid all these are way in which half a crown a week might be made to do a great deal of good to other i shall now just mention one or two way of lay it out with advantag to yourself i know you are veri fond of colour plate of plant and other object of natur histori there are now sever work of thi sort publish in monthli number as the botan magazin the english botani the flora rustica and the naturalist magazin now half a crown a week would reach the purchas of the best of these the same sum laid out in the old bookshop in london would buy you more classic and pretti edit too in one year than you could read in five now i do not grudg lay out half a crown a week upon you but when so mani good thing for yourself and other may be done with it i am unwil you should squander it away like your schoolfellow in tart and trinket trial of a complaint made against sundri person for break the window of dorothi care widow and dealer in gingerbread the court be seat there appear in person the widow dorothi care to make a complaint against henri luckless and other person or person

brought back to my hous when jack knew him at onc to be master harri luckless so i told him i would complain of him the next day and i hope your worship will make him pay the damag and i think he deserv a good whip into the bargain for injur a poor widow woman footnot thi wa meant as a sequel of that veri pleas and ingeni littl work entitl juvenil trial in which a court of justic is suppos to

ask him what he had to say for himself luckless appear with hi face a good deal scratch and look veri ruefulli after make hi bow and sob two or three time he said— my lord i am as innoc of thi matter as ani boy in the school and i am sure i have suffer enough about it alreadi my lord billi thompson and i were play in the lane near mr care hous when we heard the window crash and directli after she came run out toward us upon thi billi ran away and i ran too think i might bear the blame but after run a littl way i stumbl over someth that lay in the road and befor i could get up again she overtook me and caught me by the hair and began lug and cuf me i told her it wa not i that broke her window but it did not signifi so she drag me to the light lug and scratch me all the while and then

with much solemn thu address the assembly— gentlemen—thi busi i confess give me much dissatisfact a poor woman ha been insult and injur in her properti appar without provoc and though she ha not been abl to convict the offend it can not be doubt that she as well as the world in gener will imput the crime to some of our societi though i am in my own mind convinc that in her passion she charg an innoc person yet the circumst of the top is a strong suspicion inde almost a proof that the perpetr of thi unmanli mischief wa one of our bodi the owner of the top ha justli observ that it have been hi properti is no certain proof against him sinc therefor in the present defect of evid the whole school must remain burden with the discredit of thi action and share in the guilt of it i think fit in the first place to decre that restitut shall be made to the suffer out of the public chest and next that a court of inquiri be institut for the express purpos of search thoroughli into thi affair with power to examin all person upon honour who are thought like to be abl to throw light upon it i hope gentlemen these measur meet with your concurr the whole court bow to the judg and express their entir satisfact with hi determin it wa then order that the public treasur should go to the widow care hous ani pay her the sum of one shill make at the same time a handsom apolog in the name of the school and six person were taken by lot out of the juri to compos the court of inquiri which wa to sit in the even the court then adjourn on the meet of the court of inquiri the first thing propos by the presid wa that the person who usual play with master riot should be sent for accordingli tom frisk and bob loiter were summon when the presid ask them upon their honour if they knew the top to have been riot they said they did they were then ask whether they rememb when riot had it in hi possess frisk he had it the day befor yesterday and split a top of mine with it loiter ye and then as he wa make a stroke at mine the peg flew out presid what did he then do with it fr he put it into hi pocket and said as it wa a strong top he would have it mend pre then he did not throw it away or give it to ani bodi loit no he pocket it up and we saw no more of it pre do you know of ani quarrel he had with widow care fr ye a day or two befor he went to her shop for some ginger bread but as he alreadi owe her sixpenc she would not let him have ani till he had paid hi debt pre how did he take the disappoint fr he said he would be reveng on her pre are you sure he use such word fr ye loiter heard him as well as myself loit i did sir pre do either of you know ani more of thi affair both no sir pre you may go the presid now observ that these wit had done a great deal in establish proof against riot for it wa now pretti certain that no one but himself could have been in possess of the top at the time the crime wa commit and also it appear that he had declar a malici intent against the woman which it wa highli probabl he would put into execution—a the court were debat about the next step to be taken they were acquaint that jack the widow son wa wait at the schooldoor for admiss and a person be sent out for him riot wa found threaten the boy and bid him go home about hi busi the boy howev wa convey safe into the room when he thu address himself to the president— jack sir and pleas your worship as i wa look about thi morn for stick in the hedg over against our hous i found thi buckl so i thought to myself sure thi must belong to the rascal that broke our window so i have brought it to see if anybodi in the school would own it pre on which side of the hedg did you find it jack on the other side from our hous in the close pre let us see it gentlemen thi is so smart a buckl that i am sure i rememb it at onc and so i dare say you all do all it is riot pre ha anybodi observ riot shoe today one boy ye he ha got them tie with string pre veri well gentlemen we have noth more to do than to draw up an account of all the evid we have heard and lay it befor hi lordship jack you may go home jack pray sir let somebodi go with me for i am afraid of riot who ha just been threaten me at the door pre master bold will pleas to go along with the boy the minut of the court were then drawn up and the presid took them to the judg chamber after the judg had perus them he order an endict to be drawn up against peter riot for that he meanli clandestin and with malic aforethought had broken three pane in the window of widow care with a certain instrument call a top wherebi he had commit an atroci injuri on an innoc person and had brought a disgrac upon the societi to which he belong at the same time he sent an offic to inform master riot that hi trial would come on next morn riot who wa with some of hi gay companion affect to treat the matter with great indiffer and even to make a jest of it howev in the morn he thought it best to endeavour to make it up and accordingli when the court wa assembl he sent one of hi friend with a shill say that he would not troubl them with ani further inquiri but would pay the sum that had been issu out of the public stock on the receipt of thi messag the judg rose with much sever in hi counten and observ that by such a contemptu behaviour toward the court the crimin had greatli ad to hi offenc he order two offic with their stave immedi to go and bring in riot and to use forc if he should resist them the culprit think it best to submit wa present led in between the two offic when be place at the bar the judg thu address him— i am sorri sir that ani member of thi societi can be so littl sensibl of the natur of a crime and so littl acquaint with the principl of a court of justic as you have shown yourself to be by the propos you took the improp liberti of send to us if you meant it as a confess of your guilt you certainli ought to have wait to receiv from us the penalti we thought proper to inflict and not to have imagin that an offer of the mere payment of damag would satisfi the claim of justic against you if you had onli broken the window by accid and of your own accord offer restitut noth less than the full damag could have been accept but you now stand charg with have done thi mischief meanli secretli and malici and therebi have ad a great deal of crimin intent to the act can you then think that a court like thi design to watch over the moral as well as protect the properti of our commun can so slightli pass over such aggrav offenc you can claim no merit from confess the crime now that you know so much evid will appear against you and if you choos still to plead not guilti you are at liberti to do it and we will proceed immedi to the trial without take ani advantag of the confess impli by your offer of payment riot stood silent for some time and then beg to be allow to consult with hi friend what wa best for him to do thi wa agre to and he wa permit to retir though under guard of an offic after a short absenc he return with more humil in hi look and said that he plead guilti and threw himself on the merci of the court the judg then made a speech of some length for the purpos of convinc the prison as well as the bystand of the enorm of the crime he then pronounc the follow sentence— you peter riot are herebi sentenc to pay the sum of half a crown to the public treasuri as a satisfact for the mischief you have done and your attempt to conceal it you are to repair to the hous of widow care accompani by such wit as we shall appoint and there have first paid her the sum you owe her you shall ask her pardon for the insult you offer her you shall likewis tomorrow after school stand up in your place and befor all the scholar ask pardon for the disgrac you have been the mean of bring upon the societi and in particular you shall apologis to master luckless for the disagre circumst you were the mean of bring him into till all thi is compli with you shall not presum to come into the playground or join in ani of the divers of the school and all person are herebi admonish not to keep your compani till thi is done riot wa then dismiss to hi room and in the afternoon he wa taken to the widow who wa pleas to receiv hi submiss gracious and at the same time to apologis for her own improp treatment of master luckless to whom she sent a present of a nice ball by way of amend thu end thi import busi illustr on man p even xv the legumin plant tutor—george—harri georg what a delight smell harri charm it is sweeter than mr essenc shop tutor do you know whenc it come geo oh—it is from the beanfield on the other side of the hedg i suppos tut it is thi is the month in which bean are in blossom see the stalk are full of their black and white flower har i see pea in blossom too on the other side of the field geo you told us some time ago of grass and corn flower but they make a poor figur compar to these tut they do the glori of a cornfield is when it is ripe but pea and bean look veri shabbili at that time but suppos we take a closer view of these blossom go you georg and bring me a beanplant and you harri a pea they go and bring them tut now let us sit down and compar them do you think these flower much alik har oh no—veri littl geo yes—a good deal tut a littl and a good deal how can that be come let us see in the first place they do not much resembl each other in size or colour geo no—but i think they do in shape tut true they are both irregular flower and have the same distribut of part they are of the kind call papilionac from papilio the latin word for a butterfli which insect they are thought to resembl geo the pea doe a littl but not much tut some do much more than these well—you see first a broad leaf stand upright but somewhat bent back thi is name the standard on each side are two narrow call the wing the under side of the flower is form of a hollow part resembl a boat thi is call a keel geo it is veri like a boat inde tut in some kind howev it is divid in the middl and so is like a boat split in two all these part have claw which unit to form a tube set in a calyx or flowercup thi tube you observ is longer in the bean than in the pea and the proport of the other part are somewhat differ but the part themselv are found in both har so they are i think them alik now tut that is the consequ of examin close now let us strip off all the leav of thi beanflow but the keel what do you think thi boat contain geo it must be those littl thing you told us are in all flower har the chive and pistil tut right i will draw down the keel gentli and you shall see them har how curiou tut here are a number of chive join in their bodi so as to make a round tube or cylind through which come out a crook thread which is the pistil i will now with a pin slit thi cylind what do you see within it geo somewhat like a littl pod tut true—and to show you that it is a pod i will open it and you shall see the seed within it har what tini thing is thi then what make the beanpod afterward tut it is when the blossom drop thi seedvessel grow bigger and bigger and at length harden as the seed grow ripe becom black and shrivel and would burst and shed the seed if they were not gather geo i have seen sever burst pod of our sweetpea under the wall with noth left in them tut and it is common for the field pea and bean to lose a great part of the seed while they are get in har at the bottom of thi peastalk there are some pod set alreadi tut open one you see that the pod is compos of two shell and that all the seed are fasten to one side of the pod but altern to each shell geo is it the same in bean tut ye and in all other pod of the papilionac flower well—thi is the gener structur of a veri numer and use class of plant call the legumin or pod of these in thi countri the greater part are herbac with some shrub in the warm climat there are also tall tree mani of the legumin plant afford excel nourish for man and beast and their pod have the name of puls geo i have read of person live on puls but i did not know what it meant befor tut it is frequent mention as part of the diet of abstemi person of thi kind we eat pea bean and kidney or french bean of all which there are a varieti of sort cultiv other nation eat lentil and lupin which are of thi class with sever other har i rememb our lupin in the garden have flower of thi kind with pod grow in cluster we onli cultiv them for the colour and smell tut but other nation eat them then all the kind of clover or trefoil which are so use in feed cattl belong to thi tribe as do likewis vetch sanfoin and lucern which are use for the same purpos these princip compos what are usual though improperli call in agricultur artifici grass geo clover flower are as sweet as bean but do they bear pod tut ye veri short one with one or two seed in each but there is a kind call nonsuch with a veri small yellow flower that ha a curiou twist pod like a snailshel mani of the legumin plant are weak and can not support themselv henc they are furnish with tendril by mean of which they clasp neighbour plant and run up them you know the gardenpea do so on the stick which are set in the row with them some kind of vetch run in thi manner up the hedg which they decor with their long bunch of blue or purpl flower tare which are some of the slenderest of the famili do much mischief among corn by twine round it and choke it har what are they good for then tut they are weed or noxiou plant with respect to us but doubtless they have their use in the creation some of our papilionac plant howev are abl enough to shift for themselv for gors or furz is of the number geo what that prickli bush all cover over with yellow flower that overrun our common tut then there is broom a plant as big but without thorn and with larger flower thi is as frequent as furz in some place har i know it grow in abund in the broomfield tut it doe but the name of field and place from it is a proof that it is not so common as the other geo we have some bush of white broom in the shrubberi and some tree of spanish broom tut true you have also a small tree which flower earli and bear a great mani pendent branch of yellow blossom that look peculiarli beauti when intermix with the purpl lilac har i know it—laburnum tut right thi is one of our class of plant too then there is a larg tree with delic littl leav protect by long thorn and bear bunch of white papilionac flower geo i know which you mean but i can not tell the name tut it is the bastardacacia or locusttre a nativ of america thu you see we have trace thi class of plant through all size from the trefoil that cover the turf to a larg tree i should not howev forget two other the licoric and the tamarind the licoric with the sweet root of which you are well acquaint grow in the warmer countri especi spain but is cultiv in some part of england especi at pomfret in yorkshir the tamarind is a larg spread tree grow in the west indi and valu for it shade as well as for the cool acid pulp of it pod which are preserv with sugar and sent over to us har i know them veri well tut well—do you think now you shall both be abl to discov a papilionac flower when you meet with it again geo i believ i shall if they are all like these we have been examin tut they have all the same part though various proport what are these geo there is the standard and two wing har and the keel tut right—th keel sometim cleft into two and then it is an irregular fiveleav flower the chive are gener ten of which one stand apart from the rest the pistil singl and end in a pod anoth circumst common to most of thi tribe is that their leav are wing or pinnat that is have leaflet set opposit each other upon a middl rib you see thi structur in these beanleav but in the clover there are onli two opposit leaflet and one termin whenc their name of trefoil or threeleaf what we call a club on card is properli a cloverleaf and the french call it trefl which mean the same geo i think thi tribe of plant almost as use as the grass tut they perhap come the next in util but their seed such as bean and pea are not quit such good nourish as corn and bread can not be made of them geo but clover is better than grass for cattl tut it is more fatten and make cow yield plenti of fine milk well—let us march on man charl you gave me the definit of a hors some time ago—pray sir how is a man defin father that is worth inquir let us consid then he must either stand by himself or be rank among the quadrup for there are no other twoleg anim but bird which he certainli doe not resembl ch but how can he be made a quadrup fa by set him to crawl on the ground in which case he will as much resembl a baboon as a baboon set on hi hindleg doe a man in realiti there is littl differ between the arm of a man and the foreleg of a quadrup and in all other circumst of intern and extern structur they are evid form upon the same model ch i suppos then we must call him a digit quadrup that gener goe upon it hind leg fa a naturalist could not reckon him otherwis and accordingli linnæu ha place him in the same divis with ape macoco and bat ch ape macoco and bat fa yes—they have all four cut teeth in the upper jaw and teat on the breast how do your like your relat ch not at all fa then we will get rid of them by appli to the other part of human nature—th mind man is an anim possess of reason and the onli one thi therefor is enough to defin him ch i have often heard that man is a ration creatur and i have a notion what that mean but i should like to have an exact definit of reason fa reason is the faculti by which we compar idea and draw conclus a man walk in the wood of an unknown countri find a bow he compar it in hi mind with other bow and form the conclus that it must have been made by man and that therefor the countri is probabl inhabit he discov a hut see in it halfburnt wood and find that the ash are not quit cold he conclud therefor with certainti not onli that there are inhabit but that they can not be far distant no other anim could do thi ch but would not a dog who had been use to live with men run into such a hut and expect to find peopl in it fa he probabl would—and thi i acknowledg is veri like reason for he may be suppos to compar in hi mind the hut he ha live in with that he see and to conclud that as there were men in the first there are in the last but how littl a way doe thi carri him he find no men there and he is unabl by ani mark to form ani judgment how long they have been absent or what sort of peopl they were still less doe he form ani plan of conduct in consequ of hi discoveri ch then is not the differ onli that man ha much reason and brute littl fa if we adher to the mere word of the definit of reason i believ thi must be admit but in the exercis of it the superior of the human faculti is so great that man is in mani point absolut distinguish from brute in the first place he ha the use of speech which no other anim ha attain ch can not mani anim make themselv understood by one anoth by their cri fa they can make known a few of their common want and desir but they can not discours or commun idea store up in the memori it is thi faculti which make man an improv be the wisdom and experi acquir by one individu be thu transmit to other and so on in an endless seri of progress there is no reason to suppos that the dog of the present day are more know than those which live a thousand year ago but the men of thi age are much better acquaint with numberless art and scienc than their remot ancestor sinc by the use of speech and of write which is speech address to the eye everi age add it own discoveri to all former one thi knowledg of the past likewis give man a great insight into the futur shakspear excel defin man by say that he is a creatur made with larg discours look befor and after ch anim must sure know someth of the futur when they lay up a store of provis for the winter fa no—it is pretti certain that thi is not the case for they will do it as much the first year of their live as ani other young bee turn out of their hive as soon as they have swarm and got a habit begin lay up honey though they can not possibl forese the use they shall have for it there are a vast number of action of thi kind in anim which are direct to a use end but an end which the anim know noth of and thi is what we call instinct and properli distinguish from reason man ha less of it than almost ani other anim becaus he want it less anoth point of essenti differ is that man is the onli anim that make use of instrument in ani of hi action he is a toolmak and machinemak anim by mean of thi faculti alon he is everi where lord of the creation and ha equal triumph over the subtleti of the cun the swift of the fleet and the forc of the strong he is the onli anim that ha found out the use of fire a most import acquisit ch i have read of some larg ape that will come and sit round a fire in the wood when men have left it but have not the sens to keep it in by throw on stick fa still less then could they light a fire in consequ of thi discoveri man cook hi food which no other anim doe he alon fenc against the cold by cloth as well as by fire he alon cultiv the earth and keep live anim for futur use ch but have not there been wild men bred in the wood that could do none of these thing fa some instanc of thi kind are record and they are not to be wonder at for man wa meant to be a gregari anim or one live in societi in which alon hi faculti have full scope and especi hi power of improv by the use of speech these poor solitari creatur brought up with the brute were in a state entir unnatur to them a solitari bee ant or beaver would have none of the skill and sagac of those anim in their proper social condit societi sharpen all the faculti and give idea and view which never could have been entertain by an individu ch but some men that live in societi seem to be littl abov the brute at least when compar with other men what is a hottentot in comparison with one of us fa the differ inde is great but we agre in the most essenti charact of man and perhap the advantag is not all on our side the hottentot cultiv the earth and rear cattl he not onli herd with hi fellow but he ha institut some sort of govern for the protect of the weak against the strong he ha a notion of right and wrong and is sensibl of the necess of control present appetit and passion for the sake of a futur good he ha therefor moral he is possess of weapon tool cloth and furnitur of hi own make in agil of bodi and the knowledg of variou circumst rel to the natur of anim he surpass us hi inferior lie in those thing in which mani of the lowest class among us are equal inferior to the instruct ch but hottentot have no notion of a god or a futur state fa i am not certain how far that is fact but ala how mani among us have no knowledg at all on these subject or onli some vagu notion full of absurd and superstit peopl far advanc in civil have held the grossest error on these subject which are onli to be correct by the seriou applic of reason or by a direct revel from heaven ch you said man wa an improv creature—but have not mani nation been a long time in a savag state without improv fa man is alway capabl of improv but he may exist a long time in societi without actual improv beyond a certain point there is littl improv among nation who have not the art of write for tradit is not capabl of preserv veri accur or extens knowledg and mani art and scienc after flourish greatli have been entir lost in countri which have been overrun by barbar and illiter nation then there is a principl which i might have mention as one of those that distinguish man from brute but it as much distinguish some men from other thi is curios or the love of knowledg for it own sake most savag have littl or noth of thi but without it we should want one of the chief induc to exert our faculti it is curios that impel us to search into the properti of everi part of natur to tri all sort of experi to visit distant region and even to examin the appear and motion of the heavenli bodi everi fact thu discov lead to other fact and there is no limit to be set to thi progress the time may come when what we now know may seem as much ignor to futur age as the knowledg

it wherebi they have been enabl to command the rest of the world the countri in which the art and scienc most flourish at present are the northern and middl part of europ and also north america which

have got there bring me one of the dandelion head and let us see if we can make no other use of it har here is a veri full one tut do you know what these feather as you call them are geo i believ they belong to the seed tut they do and they are worth examin look at thi singl one through my magnifi glass you observ the seed at the bottom like the point of a dart from it spring a slender hairi shaft crown by a veri eleg spread plume you see it is a complet arrow of natur manufactur geo how exact har what a beauti thing tut i am sure you see the use of it at onc geo it is to set the seed a fli with the wind har and i suppos they sow themselv where they light tut they do thi is one of natur contriv for dissemin or that scatter of the seed of plant which make them reach all the place proper for their growth i dare say you have observ other plant furnish with the same wing or feather seed har o yes—ther are groundsel and ragwort and thistl geo in a windi day i have seen the air all full of thistledown tut veri like and for that reason you never saw a newmad bank of earth or a heap of dung in the field but it wa present cover with thistl these and the other plant that have been name belong to a veri extens class which it is worth while be acquaint with they are call the compoundflow plant geo will you be so good as to give us a lectur about them tut with all my heart get me a dandelion in flower a thistlehead and a daisy—if you can not find a common daisi one of the great oxey daisi in the corn will do as well geo and har here they are tut veri well all these are compound flower for if you will examin them narrowli you will perceiv that they consist of a number of littl flower or floret enclos in a common cup which cup is made of a number of scale lie on each other like the tile of a hous geo i see it tut the floret are not all alik in shape in the dandelion you will observ that they consist of a tube from which at it upper end proce a sort of strapshap tongu or fillet in the thistl they are tubular or funnelshap throughout in the daisi the centr one which form the disk as it is call are tubular while those in the circumfer have a broad strap on one side which altogeth compos the ray of the flower whenc thi sort are call radiat now take the glass and examin the floret singli can you discern their chive and pointal geo i can tut you may remark that there are five chive to each the tip of which unit into a tube through which the pointal pass have it summit doubl and curl back har i can just make it out with the glass but hardli with the nake eye tut it is from thi circumst of the tip of the chive grow togeth that linnæu ha taken hi distinct of the whole class and he ha name it syngenesia from two greek word have that signif you will further observ that all these floret stand upon a stool or receptacl at the bottom of the flower which is the cushion left on the dandelionstalk after the seed are blown away into thi the seed are slightli stuck which are one apiec to everi perfect or fertil floret thi is the gener structur of the compound flower har are all their seed feather tut not all these of the daisi are not but in a great mani speci they are har i should have thought these were a veri use class of plant by the pain natur ha taken to spread them if you had not told us that thistl and ragwort and groundsel were some of them tut and if you do not confin your idea of use to what is servic to man but extend it to the whole creation you may safe conclud from their abund that they must be highli use in the gener economi of natur in fact no plant feed a greater number of insect and none are more import to the small bird to whom they furnish food by their seed and a fine warm down for line their nest on the approach of

agreeabl scent and their shape is not the most pleas but they have often gay colour and make a figur in the garden when other thing are over well—thi is most that i recollect worth notic of the compoundflow plant they are a difficult class to make out botan though pretti easili known from each other by sight i will take care to point out to you the princip of them that we meet with in our walk and you must get acquaint with them on presenc of mind mr f one day have occas to be blood sent for a surgeon as soon as he enter the room her young daughter eliza start up and wa hastili go away when her mother call her back mr f eliza do not go i want you to stay by me eliz dear mamma i can never bear to see you blood mr f whi not what harm will it do you eliz o dear i can not look at blood besid i can not bear to see you hurt mamma mr f oh if i can bear to feel it sure you may to see it but come—y must stay and we will talk about it afterward eliza then pale and trembl stood by her mother and saw the whole oper she could not help howev turn her head away when the incis wa made and the first flow of blood made her start and shudder when all wa over and the surgeon gone mr f began mr f well eliza what do you think of the mighti matter now would it not have been veri foolish to have run away from it eliz o mamma how frighten i wa when he took out hi lancet did it not hurt you a great deal mr f no veri littl and if it had it wa to do me good you know eliz but whi should i stay to see it i could do you no good mr f perhap not but it will do you good to be accustom to such sight eliz whi mamma mr f becaus instanc are everi day happen in which it is our duti to assist fellowcreatur in circumst of pain and distress and if we were to indulg a reluct to come near to them on those occas we should never acquir either the knowledg or the presenc of mind necessari for the purpos eliz but if i had been told how to help peopl in such case could not i do it without be use to see them mr f no we have all natur a horror at everyth which is the caus of pain and danger to ourselv or other and noth but habit can give most of us the presenc of mind necessari to enabl us in such occurr to employ our knowledg to the best advantag eliz what is presenc of mind mamma mr f it is that steadi possess of ourselv in case of alarm that prevent us from be flurri and frighten you have heard the express of have all our wit about us that is the effect of presenc of mind and a most inestim qualiti it is for without it we are full as like to run into danger as to avoid it do you not rememb hear of your cousin mari cap take fire from a candl eliz o yes—veri well mr f well—th maid as soon as she saw it set up a great scream and ran out of the room and mari might have been burnt to death for ani assist she could give her eliz how foolish that wa mr f yes—th girl had not the least presenc of mind and the consequ wa depriv her of all recollect and make her entir useless but as soon as your aunt came up she took the right method for prevent the mischief the cap wa too much on fire to be pull off so she whip a quilt from the bed and flung it round mari head and thu stifl the flame eliz mari wa a good deal scorch though mr f yes—but it wa veri well that it wa no wors if the maid howev had act with ani sens at first no harm would have been done except burn the cap i rememb a much more fatal exampl of the want of presenc of mind the mistress of a famili wa awaken by flame burst through the wainscot into her chamber she flew to the staircas and in her confus instead of go upstair to call her children who slept togeth in the nurseri overhead and who might all have escap by the top of the hous she ran down and with much danger made way through the fire into the street when she had got thither the thought of her poor children rush into her mind but it wa too late the stair had caught fire so that nobodi could get near them and they were burnt in their bed eliz what a sad thing mr f sad inde now i will tell you of a differ conduct a ladi wa awaken by the crackl of fire and saw it shine under her chamberdoor her husband would have immedi open the door but she prevent him sinc the smoke and flame would then have burst in upon them the children with a maid slept in a room open out of their she went and awaken them and tie togeth the sheet and blanket she sent down the maid from the window first and then let down the children one by one to her last of all she descend herself a few minut after the floor fell in and all the hous wa in flame eliz what a happi escap mr f yes—and with what cool recollect of mind it wa manag for mother to love their children and be will to run ani hazard for them is common but in weak mind that veri love is apt to prevent exert in the time of danger i knew a ladi who had a fine littl boy sit in her lap he put a whole plum into hi mouth which slip into hi throat and choke him the poor fellow turn black and struggl violent and the mother wa so frighten that instead of put her finger in hi throat and pull out the plum which might easili have been done she laid him on the floor and ran to call for assist but the maid who came up were as much flurri as she and the child die befor anyth effectu wa done to reliev him eliz how unhappi she must have been about it mr f ye it threw her into an ill which had like to have cost her her life anoth ladi see her littl boy climb up a high ladder set up a violent scream that frighten the child so that he fell down and wa much hurt wherea if she had possess command enough over herself to speak to him gentli he might have got down safe eliz dear mamma what is that run down your arm—o it is blood mr f yes—mi arm bleed again i have stir it too soon eliz dear what shall i do mr f dont frighten yourself i shall stop the blood by press on the orific with my finger in the meantim do you ring the bell eliza rings—a servant come mr f betti my arm bleed can you tie it up again betti i believ i can madam she take off the bandag and put on anoth eliz i hope it is stop now mr f it is betti ha done it veri well you see she went about it with composur thi accid put me in mind of anoth stori which is veri well worth hear a man onc reap in the field cut hi arm dread with hi sickl and divid an arteri eliz what is that mamma mr f it is one of the canal or pipe through which the blood from the heart run like water in a pipe brought from a reservoir when one of these is cut it bleed veri violent and the onli way to stop it is to make a pressur between the wound place and the heart in order to intercept the cours of the blood toward it well—thi poor man bled profus and the peopl about him both men and women were so stupifi with fright that some ran one way some anoth and some stood stock still in short he would have soon bled to death had not a brisk stoutheart wench who came up slip off her garter and bound it tight abov the wound by which mean the bleed wa stop till proper help could be procur eliz what a clever wench but how did she know what to do mr f she had perhap heard it as you have done now and so probabl had some of the other but they had not presenc of mind enough to put it into practic it is a much greater trial of courag howev when the danger press upon ourselv as well as other suppos a furiou bull wa to come upon you in the midst of a field you could not possibl escap him by run and attempt it would destroy your onli chanc of safeti eliz what would that be mr f i have a stori for that too the mother of that mr day who wrote sandford and merton wa distinguish as he also wa for courag and presenc of mind when a young woman she wa one day walk in the field with a companion when they perceiv a bull come to them roar and toss about hi head in the most tremend manner eliz o how i should have scream mr f i dare say you would and so did her companion but she bid her walk away behind her as gentli as she could while she herself stop short and face the bull eye him with a determin counten the bull when he had come near stop also paw the ground and roar few anim will attack a man who steadili wait for him in a while she drew back some step still face the bull the bull follow she stop and then he stop in thi manner she made good her retreat to the stile over which her companion had befor got she then turn and sprung over it and got clear out of danger eliz that wa brave done inde but i think veri few women could have done as much mr f such a degre of cool resolut to be sure is not common but i have read of a ladi in the east indi who show at least as much she wa sit out of door with a parti of pleasur when they were awar of a huge tiger that had crept through a hedg near them and wa just readi to make hi fatal spring they were struck with the utmost constern but she with an umbrella in her hand turn to the tiger and suddenli spread it full in hi face thi unusu assault so terrifi the beast that take a prodigi leap he sprung over the fenc and plung out of sight into the neighbour thicket eliz well—that wa the boldest thing i ever heard of but is it possibl mamma to make one self courag mr f courag my dear is of two kind one the gift of natur the other of reason and habit men have natur more courag than women that is they are less affect by danger it make a less impress upon them and doe not flutter their spirit so much thi is owe to the differ of their bodili constitut and from the same caus some men and some women are more courag than other but the other kind of courag may in some measur be acquir by everi one reason teach us to face smaller danger in order to avoid greater and even to undergo the greatest when our duti requir it habit make us less affect by particular danger which have often come in our way a sailor doe not feel the danger of a storm so much as a landsman but if he wa mount upon a spirit hors in a foxchas he would probabl be the most timor man in compani the courag of women is chiefli tri in domest danger they are attend on the sick and die and they must qualifi themselv to go through mani scene of terror in these situat which would alarm the stoutestheart man who wa not accustom to them eliz i have heard that women gener bear pain and ill better than men mr f they do so becaus they are more use to them both in themselv and other eliz i think i should not be afraid again to see anybodi blood mr f i hope not it wa for that purpos i made you stand by me and i would have you alway forc yourself to look on and give assist in case of thi kind howev pain it may at first be to you that you may as soon as possibl gain that presenc of mind which aris from habit eliz but would that make me like to be blood myself mr f not to like it but to lose all foolish fear about it and submit calmli to it when good for you but i hope you have sens enough to do that alreadi illustr whi an appl fall p even xvii phaeton junior or the gig demolish ye

driver all from jehu first essay whi an appl fall papa said luci i have been read today that sir isaac newton wa led to make some of hi great discoveri by see an appl fall from a tree what wa there extraordinari in that papa there wa noth extraordinari but it happen to catch hi attent and set him to think luci and what did he think about pa he thought by what mean the appl wa brought to the ground lu whi i could have told him that—becaus the stalk gave way and there wa noth to support it pa and what then lu whi then it must fall you know pa but whi must it fall—that is the point lu becaus it could not help it pa but whi could it not help it lu i dont know—that is an odd question becaus there wa noth to keep it up pa suppos there wa not—do it follow that it must come to the ground lu ye sure pa is an appl anim or inanim lu inanim to be sure pa and can inanim thing move of themselv lu no—i think not—but the appl fall becaus it is forc to fall pa right some forc out of itself act upon it otherwis it would remain for ever where it wa notwithstand it were loosen from the tree lu would it pa undoubtedli for there onli two way in which it could be move by it own power of motion or the power of someth els move it now the first you acknowledg it ha not the caus of it motion must therefor be the second and what that is wa the subject of the philosoph inquiri lu but everyth fall to the ground as well as an appl when there is noth to keep it up pa true—ther must therefor be a univers caus of thi tendenc to fall lu and what is it pa whi if thing out of the earth can not move themselv to it there can be no other caus of their come togeth than that the earth pull them lu but the earth is no more anim than they are so how can it pull pa well object thi will bring us to the point sir isaac newton after deep medit discov that there wa a law in natur call attract by virtu of which everi particl of matter that is everyth of which the world is compos draw toward it everi other particl of matter with a forc proport to it size and distanc lay two marbl on the tabl they have a tendenc to come togeth and if there were noth els in the world they would come togeth but they are also attract by the tabl by the ground and by everyth besid in the room and these differ attract pull against each other now the globe of the earth is a prodigi mass of matter to which noth near it can bear ani comparison it draw therefor with mighti forc everyth within it reach which is the caus of their fall and thi is call the gravit of bodi or what give them weight when i lift anyth i act contrari to thi forc for which reason it seem heavi to me and the heavier the more matter it contain sinc that increas the attract of the earth for it do you understand thi lu i think i do it is like a loadston draw a needl pa ye that is an attract but of a particular kind onli take place between the magnet and iron but gravit or the attract of the earth act upon everyth alik lu then it is pull you and me at thi moment pa it is lu but whi do not we stick to the ground then pa becaus as we are aliv we have a power of selfmot which can to a certain degre overcom the attract of the earth but the reason you can not jump a mile high as well as a foot is thi attract which limit the forc of your jump and bring you down again after that forc is spent lu i think then i begin to understand what i have heard of peopl live on the other side of the world i believ they are call antipod who have their feet turn toward our and their head in the air i use to wonder how it could be that they did not fall off but i suppos the earth pull them to it pa veri true and whither should they fall what have they over their head lu i dont know sky i suppos pa they have thi earth is a vast ball hung in the air and continu spin round and that is the caus whi the sun and star seem to rise and set at noon we have the sun over our head when the antipod have the star over their and at midnight the star are over our head and the sun over their so whither should they fall to more than we—to the star or the sun lu but we are up and they are down pa what is up but from the earth and toward the sky their feet touch the earth and their head point to the sky as well as our and we are under their feet as much as they are under our if a hole were dug quit through the earth what would you see through it lu sky with the sun or the star and now i see the whole matter plainli but pray what support the earth in the air pa whi whither should it go lu i dont know—i suppos where there wa most to draw it i have heard that the sun is a great mani time bigger than the earth would it not go to that pa you have thought veri justli on the matter i perceiv but i shall take anoth opportun of show you how thi is and whi the earth doe not fall into the sun of which i confess there seem to be some danger meanwhil think how far the fall of an appl ha carri us lu to the antipod and i know not where pa you may see thenc what use may be made of the commonest fact by a think mind natur and education—a fabl natur and educ were one day walk togeth through a nurseri of tree see say natur how straight and fine those fir grow—that is my do but as to those oak they are all crook and stunt that my good sister is your fault you have plant them too close and not prune them properly—nay sister said educ i am sure i have taken all possibl pain about them but you gave me bad acorn so how should they ever make fine tree the disput grew warm and at length instead of blame one anoth for neglig

what anim are made for pray papa said sophia after she had been a long time teas with the fli that buzz about her ear and settl on her nose and forehead as she sat at work—pray what were fli made for for some good i dare say repli her papa sop but i think they do a great deal more harm than good for i am sure they plagu me sadli and in the kitchen they are so troublesom that the maid can hardli do their work for them pa fli eat up mani thing that would otherwis corrupt and becom loathsom and they serv for food to bird spider and mani other anim sop but we could clean away everyth that wa offens without their help and as to their serv for food i have seen whole heap of them lie dead in a window without seem to have done good to anyth pa well then suppos a fli capabl of think would he not be equal puzzl to find out what men were good for thi great twoleg monster he might say instead of help us to live devour more food at a meal than would serv a whole legion of fli then he kill us by hundr when we come within hi reach and i see him destroy and torment all other anim too and when he die he is nail up in a box and put a great way under ground as if he grudg do ani more good after hi death than when aliv now what would you answer to such a reason fli sop i would tell him he wa veri impertin for talk so of hi better for that he and all other creatur were made for the use of man and not man for their pa but would you tell him true you have just been say that you could not find out of what use fli were to us wherea when they suck our blood there is no doubt that we are of use to them sop it is that which puzzl me pa there are mani other anim which we call noxiou and which are so far from be use to us that we take all possibl pain to get rid of them more than that there are vast track of the earth where few or no men inhabit which are yet full of beast bird insect and all live thing these certainli do not exist there for hi use alon on the contrari they often keep man away sop then what are they made for pa they are made to be happi it is a manifest purpos of the creator to give be to as much life as possibl for life is enjoy to all creatur in health and in possess of their faculti man surpass other anim in hi power of enjoy and he ha prospect in a futur state which they do not share with him but the creator equal desir the happi of all hi creatur and look down with as much benign upon these fli that are sport around us as upon ourselv sop then we ought not to kill them if they are ever so troublesom pa i do not say that we have a right to make a reason use of all anim for our advantag and also to free ourselv from such as are hurt to us so far our superior over them may fairli extend but we should never abus them for our mere amus nor take away their live wantonli nay a good naturedman will rather undergo a littl inconveni than take away from a creatur all that it possess an infant may destroy life but all the king upon earth can not restor it i rememb read of a goodtemp old gentleman that have been a long time plagu with a great fli that buzz about hi face all dinnertim at length after mani effort caught it instead of crush it to death he held it care in hi hand and open the window go said he—get thee gone poor creatur i wont hurt a hair of thi head sure the world is wide enough for thee and me sop i should have love that man pa one of our poet ha written some veri pretti line to a fli that came to partak with him of hi wine they begin— busi curiou thirsti fli drink with me and drink as i welcom freeli to my cup couldst thou sip and sip it up sop how pretti i think they will almost make me love fli but pray papa do not anim destroy one anoth pa they do inde the greatest part of them onli live by the destruct of life there is a perpetu warfar go on in which the stronger prey upon the weaker and in their turn are the prey of those which are a degre stronger than themselv even the innoc sheep with everi mouth of grass destroy hundr of small insect in the air we breath and the water we drink we give death to thousand of invis creatur sop but is not that veri strang if they were creat to live and be happi whi should they be destroy so fast pa they are destroy no faster than other are produc and if they enjoy life while it last they have had a good bargain by make anim the food of anim provid ha fill up everi chink as it were of exist you see these swarm of fli dure all the hot weather they are continu come forth from the state of egg and maggot and as soon as they get the use of wing they roam about and fill everi place in search of food meantim they are give susten to the whole race of spider they maintain all the swallow tribe and contribut greatli to the support of mani other small bird and even afford mani a delic morsel to the fish their own number howev seem scarc diminish and vast multitud live on till the cold weather come and put an end to them were noth to touch them they would probabl becom so numer as to starv each other as it is they are full of enjoy themselv and afford life and enjoy to other creatur which in their turn suppli the want of other sop it is no chariti then to tear a spider web in piec in order to set the fli at liberti pa none at all—no more than it would be to demolish the trap of a poor indian hunter who depend upon them for hi dinner they both act as natur direct them shall i tell you a stori sop o yes—pray do pa as a vener bramin who had never in hi day eaten anyth but rice fruit and milk and held it the greatest of crime to shed the blood of anyth that had life wa one day medit on the bank of the gang he saw a littl bird on the ground pick up ant as fast as he could swallow murder wretch cri he what score of live are sacrif to one glutton meal of thine present a sparrowhawk pounc down seiz him in hi claw and flew off with him the bramin wa at first inclin to triumph over the littl bird but on hear hi cri he could not help piti him poor thing said he thou art fallen into the clutch of a tyrant a stronger tyrant howev took up the matter for a falcon in mid air dart on the sparrowhawk struck him to the ground with the bird lifeless in hi talon tyrant against tyrant thought the bramin is well enough the falcon had not finish tear hi prey when a lynx steal from behind a rock on which he wa perch sprung upon him and have strangl him bore him to the edg of a neighbour thicket and began to suck hi blood the bramin wa attent view thi new display of retribut justic when a sudden roar shook the air and a huge tiger rush from the thicket came like thunder on the lynx the bramin wa near enough to hear the crush bone and wa make off in great terror when he met an english soldier arm with hi musket he point eagerli to the place where the tiger wa make hi bloodi repast the soldier level hi gun and laid the tiger dead brave fellow exclaim the bramin i am veri hungri said the soldier can you give me a beefsteak i see you have plenti of cow here—horr cri the bramin what i kill the sacr cow of brama—then kill the next tiger yourself said the soldier true heroism you have read my edmund the stori of achil and alexand and charl of sweden and have i doubt not admir the high courag which seem to set them abov all sensat of fear and render them capabl of the most extraordinari action the world call these men hero but befor we give them that nobl appel let us consid what were the motiv which anim them to act and suffer as they did the first wa a feroci savag govern by the passion of anger and reveng in gratifi which he disregard all impuls of duti and human the second wa intox with the love of glory—swollen with absurd pride—and enslav by dissolut pleasur and in pursuit of these object he reckon the blood of million as of no account the third wa unfeel obstin and tyrann and prefer ruin hi countri and sacrif all hi faith follow to the humili of give up ani of hi mad project self you see wa the spring of all their conduct and a selfish man can never be a hero i will give you two exampl of genuin heroism one shown in act the other in suffer and these shall be true stori which is perhap more than can be said of half that is record of achil and alexand you have probabl heard someth of mr howard the reform of prison to whom a monument is erect in st paul church hi whole life almost wa heroism for he confront all sort of danger with the sole view of reliev the miseri of hi fellowcreatur when he began to examin the state of prison scarc ani in the countri were free from a veri fatal and infecti distemp call the jail fever wherev he heard of it he made a point of see the poor suffer and often went down into their dungeon when the keeper themselv would not accompani him he travel sever time over almost the whole of europ and even into asia in order to gain knowledg of the state of prison and hospit and point out mean for lessen the calam that prevail in them he even went into countri where the plagu wa that he might learn the best method of treat that terribl contagi diseas and he voluntarili expos himself to perform a strict quarantin as one suspect of have the infect of the plagu onli that he might be thoroughli acquaint with the method use for prevent he at length die of a fever caught in attend on the sick on the border of crim tartari honour and admir by all europ after have greatli contribut to enlighten hi own and mani other countri with respect to some of the most import object of human such wa howard the good as great a hero in preserv mankind as some of the fals hero abov mention were in destroy them my second hero is a much humbler but not less genuin one there wa a journeyman bricklay in thi town—an abl workman but a veri drunken idl fellow who spent at the alehous almost all he earn and left hi wife and children to shift for themselv as they could thi is unfortun a common case and of all the tyranni and cruelti exercis in the world i believ that of bad husband and father is by much the most frequent and the worst the famili might have starv but for hi eldest son whom from a child the father brought up to help him in hi work and who wa so industri and attent that be now at the age of thirteen or fourteen he wa abl to earn pretti good wage everi farth of which that he could keep out of hi father hand he brought to hi mother and when hi brute of a father came home drunk curs and swear and in such an ill humour that hi mother and the rest of the children durst not come near him for fear of a beat thi good lad tom wa hi name kept near him to pacifi him and get him quietli to bed hi mother therefor justli look upon tom as the support of the famili and love him dearli it chanc that one day tom in climb up a high ladder with a load of mortar on hi head miss hi hold and fell down to the bottom on a heap of brick and rubbish the bystand ran up to him and found him all bloodi and with hi thigh broken and bent quit under him they rais him up and sprinkl water on hi face to recov him from a swoon into which he had fallen as soon as he could speak look round with a lament tone he cri o what will becom of my poor mother he wa carri home i wa present while the surgeon set hi thigh hi mother wa hang over him half distract dont cri mother said he i shall get well again in time not a word more or a groan escap him while the oper last tom wa a rag boy that could not read or write—yet tom ha alway stood on my list of hero illustr the femal choic p even xix on metal part georg and harri with their tutor one day in their walk were driven by the rain to take shelter in a blacksmith shop and the shower last some time the boy in order to amus themselv began to examin the thing around them the great bellow first attract their notic and they admir the roar it made and the expedit with which it rais the fire to a heat too intens for them to look at they were surpris at the dexter with which the smith fashion a bar of iron into a horsesho first heat it then hammer it well on the anvil cut off a proper length bend it round turn up the end and lastli punch the nailhol they watch the whole process of fit it to the hors foot and fasten it on and it had becom fair some minut befor they show a desir to leav the shop and proceed on their walk i should never have thought say georg begin the convers that such a hard thing as iron could have been so easili manag nor i neither said harri tut it wa manag you saw by the help of fire the fire made it soft and flexibl so that the smith could easili hammer it and cut it and bend it to the shape he want and then dip it in the water made it hard again geo are all other metal manag in the same manner tut they are all work by the help of fire in some way or other either in melt them or make them soft geo there are a good mani sort of metal are there not tut ye sever and if you have a mind i will tell you about them and their use geo pray do sir har ye i should like to hear it of all thing tut well then first let us consid what a metal is do you think you should know one from a stone geo a stone—y i could not mistak a piec of lead or iron for a stone tut how would you distinguish it geo a metal is bright and shine tut true—brilli is one of their qualiti but glass and crystal are veri bright too har but one may see through glass and not through a piec of metal tut right metal are brilliant but opaqu or not transpar the thinnest plate of metal that can be made will keep out the light as effectu as a stonewal geo metal are veri heavi too tut true they are the heaviest bodi in natur for the lightest metal is nearli twice as heavi as the heaviest stone well what els geo whi they will bear beat with a hammer which a stone would not without fli in piec tut ye that properti of extend or spread under the hammer is call malleabl and anoth like it is that of bear to be drawn out into a wire which is call ductil metal have both these and much of their use depend upon them geo metal will melt too har what will iron melt tut ye all metal will melt though some requir greater heat than other the properti of melt is call fusibl do you know anyth more about them geo no except that they come out of the ground i believ tut that is properli ad for it is thi circumst which make them rank among fossil or miner to sum up their charact then a metal is a brilliant opaqu heavi malleabl ductil and fusibl miner geo i think i can hardli rememb all that tut the name may slip your memori but you can not see metal at all use without be sensibl of the thing geo but what are ore i rememb see a heap of iron ore which men were break with hammer and it look onli like stone tut the ore of a metal is the state in which it is gener met with in the earth when it is so mix with stoni and other matter as not to show it proper qualiti as a metal har how do peopl know it then tut by experi it wa probabl accid that in the earli age discov that certain fossil by the forc of fire might be made to yield a metal the experi wa repeat on other fossil so that in length of time all the differ metal were found out and all the differ form in which they lie conceal in the ground the knowledg of thi is call mineralog and a veri import scienc it is geo ye i suppos so for metal are veri valuabl thing our next neighbour mr stirl i have heard get a great deal of money everi year from hi mine in wale tut he doe the miner rich of some countri are much superior to that of their product abov ground and the revenu of mani king are in great part deriv from their mine har i suppos they must be gold and silver mine tat those to be sure are the most valuabl if the metal are found in toler abund but do you know whi they are so har becaus money is made of gold and silver tut that is a princip reason no doubt but these metal have intrins properti that make them highli valuabl els probabl they would not have been chosen in so mani countri to make money of in the first place gold and silver are both perfect metal that is indestruct in the fire other metal if kept a consider time in the fire chang by degre into an earthi scali matter call an oxid you have melt lead i dare say geo ye often tut have you not then perceiv a drossi film collect upon it surfac after it had kept melt a while geo ye tut that is an oxid and in time the whole lead would chang to such a substanc you may see too when you have heat the poker redhot some scale separ from it which are brittl har ye the kitchen poker is almost burnt away by put into the fire tut well—al metal undergo these chang except gold and silver but these if kept ever so long in the hottest fire sustain no loss or chang they are therefor call perfect metal gold ha sever other remark properti it is the heaviest of all metal har what is it heavier than lead tut yes—about half as heavi again it is between nineteen and twenti time as heavi as an equal bulk of water thi great weight is a readi mean of discov counterfeit gold coin from genuin for as gold must be adulter with someth much lighter than itself a fals coin if of the same weight with the true will be sensibl bigger gold too is the most ductil of all metal you have seen goldleaf geo ye i bought a book of it onc tut goldleaf is made by beat a plate of gold place between piec of skin with heavi hammer till it is spread out to the utmost degre of thin and so great is it capac for be extend that a singl grain of the metal which would be scarc bigger than a larg pin head is beaten out to a surfac of fifti squar inch geo that is wonder inde but i know goldleaf must be veri thin for it will almost float upon the air tut by draw gold out to a wire it may be still farther extend gold wire as it is call is made with silver overlaid with a small proport of gold and they are drawn out togeth in the wire commonli use for lace and embroideri and the like a grain of gold is made complet to cover a length of three hundr and fiftytwo feet and when it is stretch still farther by flat it will reach four hundr and one feet geo prodigi what a vast way a guinea might be drawn out then tut ye the gold of a guinea at that rate would reach abov nine mile and a half thi properti in gold of be capabl of extens to so extraordinari a degre is owe to it great tenac or cohes of particl which is such that you can scarc break a piec of gold wire by twist it har then it would make veri good wire for hang bell tut it would but such bellhang would come rather too dear anoth valuabl qualiti of gold is it fine colour you know scarc anyth make a more splendid appear than gild and a peculiar advantag of it is that gold is not liabl to rust or tarnish as other metal are it will keep it colour fresh for a great mani year in a pure and clear air har i rememb the vane of the churchsteepl wa newgilt two year ago and it look as well as at first tut thi properti of not rust would render gold veri use for a varieti of purpos if it were more common it would make excel cook utensil waterpip mathemat instrument clockwork and the like geo but is not gold soft i have seen piec of gold bent doubl tut ye it is next in soft to lead and therefor when it is made into coin or use for ani common purpos it is mix with a small proport of some other metal in order to harden it thi is call it alloy our gold coin ha one twelfth of alloy which is copper geo how beauti new gold coin is tut yes—scarc ani metal take a stamp or impress better and it is capabl of a veri fine polish geo what countri yield the most gold tut south america the east indi and the coast of africa europ afford but littl yet a moder quantiti is got everi year from hungari geo i have heard of river roll sand of gold is there ani truth in that tut the poet as usual have exagger the matter howev there are variou stream in differ part of the world the sand of which contain particl of gold and some of them in such quantiti as to be worth the search har how doe the gold come there tut it is wash down along with the soil from mountain by the torrent which are the sourc of river some person say that all sand contain gold but i would not advis you to take the pain to search for it in our common sand for in more sens than one gold may be bought too dear har but what a fine thing it would be to find a gold mine on one estat tut perhap not so fine as you may imagin for mani a one doe not pay the cost of work a coalpit would probabl be a better thing who do you think are the greatest goldfind in europ har i dont know tut the gipsi in hungari a number of halfstarv halfnak wretch of that commun employ themselv in wash and pick the sand of some mountainstream in that countri which contain gold from which they obtain just profit enough to keep bodi and soul togeth wherea did they employ themselv in agricultur or manufactur they might have got a comfort subsist gold almost all the world over is first got by slave and it make slave of those who possess much of it geo for my part i will be content with a silver mine har but we have none of those in england have we tut we have no silver mine properli so call but silver is procur in some of our lead mine there are howev valuabl silver mine in variou part of europ but the richest of all are in peru in south america geo are not the famou mine of potosi there tut they are shall i now tell you some of the properti of silver geo by all mean tut it is anoth perfect metal it is also as littl liabl to rust as gold though inde it readili get tarnish har ye i know our footman is often oblig to clean our plate befor it is use tut plate howev is not made of pure silver ani more than silver coin and silver utensil of all kind copper is mix with it as with gold to harden it and that make it more liabl to tarnish geo bright silver i think is almost as beauti as gold tut it is the most beauti of the white metal and is capabl of a veri fine polish and thi togeth with it rariti make it use for a great varieti of ornament purpos then it is nearli as ductil and malleabl as gold geo i have had silverleaf and it seem as thin as goldleaf tut it is nearli so that is use for silver as goldleaf is for gild it is common too to cover metal with a thin coat of silver which is call plate har the child saucepan is silver over on the insid what is that for tut to prevent the victual from get ani taint from the metal of the saucepan for silver is not capabl of be corrod or dissolv by ani of the liquid use for food as iron and copper are har and that is the reason i suppos that fruitkniv are made of silver tut it is but the soft of the metal make them bear a veri poor edg geo doe silver melt easili tut silver and gold both melt more difficultli than lead not till they are abov a common red heat as to the weight of silver it is nearli one half less than that of gold be onli eleven time as heavi as water har is quicksilv a kind of silver tut it take it name from silver be veri like it in colour but in realiti it is a veri differ thing and one of the most singular of the metal kind geo it is not malleabl i am sure tut no not when it is quick or fluid as it alway is in our climat but a veri great degre of cold make it solid and then it is malleabl like other metal geo i have heard of kill quicksilv pray what doe that mean tut it mean destroy it properti of run about by mix it with someth els thu if quicksilv be well rub with fat or oil or gum it unit with them lose all it metal appear or fluiditi it also unit readili with gold and silver and sever other metal into a kind of shine past which is call an amalgam thi is one of the way of gild or silver a thing your button are gilt by mean of an amalgam geo how is that done tut the shell of the button which are made of copper are shaken in a hat with a lump of amalgam of gold and quicksilv till they are all cover over with it they are then put into a sort of fryingpan and held over the fire the quicksilv be veri volatil in it natur fli off in the form of a smoke or vapour when it is heat leav the gold behind it spread over the surfac of the button thu mani dozen are gilt at onc with the greatest eas geo what a clever way i should like vastli to see it done tut you may see it ani day at birmingham if you happen to be there as well as a great mani other curiou oper on metal geo what a weight quicksilv is i rememb take up a bottl of it and i had like to have drop it again it wa so much heavier than i expect tut ye it is one of the heaviest of the metals—about fifteen time as heavi as water geo is not mercuri a name for quicksilv i have heard them talk of the mercuri rise and fall in the weatherglass tut it is you perhap may have heard too of mercuri medicin which are those made of quicksilv prepar in one manner or anoth geo what are they good for tut for a great varieti of complaint your brother took some late for the worm and they are often given for breakingsout on the skin and for sore and swell but they have one remark effect when taken in a consider quantiti which is to loosen the teeth and caus a great spit thi is call saliv har i use to think quicksilv wa poison tut when it is in it common state of run quicksilv it gener doe neither good nor harm but it may be prepar so as to be a veri violent medicin or even a poison geo is it use for anyth els tut yes—for a varieti of purpos in the art which i can not now veri well explain to you but you will perhap be surpris to hear that one of the finest red paint is made from quicksilv geo a red paint—which is that tut vermilion or cinnabar which is a particular mixtur of sulphur with quicksilv har is quicksilv found in thi countri tut no the greatest quantiti come from spain istria and south america it is a consider object of commerc and bear a high valu though much inferior to silver well so much for metal at present we will talk of the rest on some futur opportun fli and swim how i wish i could fli cri robert as he wa gaze after hi pigeon that were exercis themselv in a morn flight how fine it must be to soar to such a height and to dash through the air with so swift a motion i doubt not said hi father that the pigeon have great pleasur in it but we have our pleasur too and it is idl to indulg long for thing quit out of our power robert but do you think it imposs for men to learn to fli father i do—for i see they are not furnish by natur with organ requisit for the purpos rob might not artifici wing be contriv such as dædalu is said to have use fa possibl they might but the difficulti would be to put them in motion rob whi could not a man move them if they were fasten to hi shoulder as well as a bird fa becaus he ha got arm to move which the bird ha not the same organ which in quadrup are employ to move the foreleg and in man the arm are use by bird in the motion of the wing nay muscl or bundl of flesh that move the wing are proport much larger and stronger than those bestow upon our arm so that it is imposs form as we are that we should use wing were they made and fasten on with ever so much art rob but angel and cupid and such thing are paint with wing and i think they look veri natur fa to you they may appear so but an anatomist see them at onc to be monster which could not realli exist rob god might have creat wing men howev if he had pleas fa no doubt but they could not have had the same shape that men have now they would have been differ creatur such as it wa not in hi plan to make but you that long to fly—consid if you have made use of all the faculti alreadi given you you want to subdu the element of air—what can you do with that of water can you swim rob no not yet fa your companion johnson i think can swim veri well rob ye fa reflect then on the differ betwixt him and you a boat overset with you both in a deep stream you plump at onc to the bottom and infal lose your life he rise like a cork dart away with the greatest eas and reach the side in perfect safeti both of you pursu by a bull come to the side of a river he jump in and cross it you are drown if you attempt it and toss by the bull if you do not what an advantag he ha over you yet you are furnish with exactli the same bodili power that he is how is thi

neglect to acquir an art at onc agreeabl and use the roman use to say by way of proverb of a blockhead he can neither read nor swim you may rememb how cesar wa save at alexandria by throw himself into the sea and swim with one hand while he held up hi commentari with the other rob i should like veri well to swim and i have often tri but i alway pop under water and that daunt me fa and it is that fear which prevent you from succeed rob but is it as natur for man to swim as for other creatur i have heard that the young of all other anim swim the first time they are thrown into the water fa they do—they are without fear in our climat the water is gener cold and is earli made an object of terror but in the hot countri where bath is one of the greatest pleasur young children swim so earli and well that i should suppos they take to it almost natur rob i am resolv to learn and will ask johnson to take me with him to the river fa do but let him find you a safe place to begin at i dont want you howev to proceed so cautious as sir nichola gimcrack did rob how wa that fa he spread himself out on a larg tabl and place befor him a basin of water with a frog in it he struck with hi arm and leg as he observ the anim do rob and did that teach him fa yes—to swim on dri land but he never ventur himself in the water rob shall i get cork or bladder fa no learn to depend on your own power it is a good lesson in other thing as well as in swim learn to swim with cork is like learn to constru latin with a translat on the other side it save some pain at first but the busi is not done half so effectu the femal choice—a tale a young girl have fatigu herself one hot day with run about the garden sat herself down in a pleasant arbour where she present fell asleep dure her slumber two femal

is pleasur life and good humour come then my dear let me put thi dress on you which will make you quit enchant and away away with me melissa felt a strong inclin to compli with the call of thi invit nymph but first she thought it would be prudent at least to ask her name my name said she is dissip the other femal then advanc she wa cloth in a close habit of brown stuff simpli reliev with white she wore her smooth hair under a plain cap her whole person wa perfectli neat and clean her look wa seriou but satisfi and her air wa staid and compos she held in one hand a distaff on the opposit arm hung a workbasket and the girdl round her waist wa garnish with scissor knit needl reel and other implement of femal labour a bunch of key hung at her side she thu accost the sleep girl— melissa i am the geniu who have ever been the friend and companion of your mother and i now offer my protect to you i have no allur to tempt you with like those of my gay rival instead of spend all your time in

she turn away with horror and gave her hand unreluctantli to her sober and sincer companion illustr eye and no eye p even xx on metal part ii tutor—george—harri tutor well—hav you forgotten what i told you about metal the other day georg o no harri i am sure i have not tut what metal were they that we talk about geo gold silver and quicksilv tut suppos then we go on to the rest geo pray do har ye by all mean tut veri well you know copper i dont doubt geo o ye tut what colour do you call it geo i think it is a sort of reddish brown tut true sometim howev it is of a bright red like sealingwax it is not a veri heavi metal be not quit nine time the weight of water it is veri ductil bear to be roll or hammer out to a veri thin plate and also to be drawn out to a fine wire har i rememb see a penni that had been roll out to a long riband geo ye and i have seen half a dozen men at a time with great hammer beat out a piec of copper at the brazier tut copper requir a veri consider heat to melt it and by long exposur to the fire it may be burnt or calcin for like all we are now to speak of it is an imperfect metal har and it rust veri easili doe it not tut it doe for all acid dissolv or corrod it so do salt of everi kind whenc even air and common water in a short time act upon it for they are never free from somewhat of a salin natur geo is not verdigri the rust of copper tut it is a rust produc by the acid of grape but everi rust of copper is of a blue or green colour as well as verdigri har and are they all poison too tut they are all so in some degre produc violent sick and pain in the bowel they are all too extrem nauseou to the tast and the metal itself when heat tast and smell veri disagre har whi is it use then so much in cook brew and the like tut becaus it is a veri conveni metal for make vessel especi larg one as it is easili work and is suffici strong though hammer thin and bear the fire well and if vessel of it are kept quit clean and the liquor not suffer to stand long in them when cold there is no danger in their use but copper vessel for cook are gener line on the insid with tin geo what els is copper use for tut a varieti of thing sheet of copper are sometim use to cover build and of late a great quantiti is consum in sheath ship that is in cover all the part under water the purpos of which is to protect the timber from the worm and also to make the ship sail faster by mean of the smooth and therefor less obstruct which the copper offer to the water as the ship is forc through it by the action of the wind on the sail har money is made of copper too tut it is for it take an impress in coin veri well and it valu is a proper proport below silver for a price for the cheapest commod in some poor countri they have littl other than copper coin anoth great use of copper is as an ingredi in mix metal such as bellmet cannonmet and particularli brass har but brass is yellow tut true it is convert to that colour by mean of anoth metal substanc name zinc or spelter the natur colour of which is white a kind of brown stone call calamin is an ore of zinc by fill a pot with layer of powder calamin and charcoal place altern with copper and appli a pretti strong heat the zinc is driven in vapour out of the calamin and penetr the copper chang it into brass geo what is the use of turn copper into brass tut it gain a fine goldlik colour and becom harder more easi to melt and less liabl to rust henc it is prefer for a varieti of utensil ornament and use brass doe not bear hammer well but is gener cast into the shape want and then turn in a lath and polish well—thes are the princip thing i have to say about copper har but where doe it come from tut copper is found in mani countri the isl of great britain yield abund especi in wale and cornwal in anglesey is a whole hill call pari mountain consist of copperor from which immens quantiti are dug everi year now for iron har ay that is the most use of all the metal tut i think it is and it is likewis the most common for there are few countri in the world possess hill and rock where it is not met with more or less iron is the hardest of metal the most elast or springi veri tenaci or difficult to break the most difficultli fusibl and one of the lightest be onli seven or eight time as heavi as water geo you say it is difficult to break but i snap the blade of a penknif the other day by onli bend it a littl and my mother is continu break her needl tut properli object but the qualiti of iron differ extrem accord to the method of prepar it there are forg iron cast iron and steel which are veri differ from each other iron when first melt from it ore ha littl malleabl and the vessel and other implement that are made of it in that state by cast into mould are easili broken it acquir tough and malleabl by forg which is done by beat it when redhot with heavi hammer till it becom ductil and flexibl steel again is made by heat small bar of iron with charcoal bone and horn shave or other inflamm matter by which it acquir a finer grain and more compact textur and becom harder and more elast steel may be render either veri flexibl or brittl by differ manner of temper which is perform by heat and then quench it in water geo all cut instrument are made of steel are they not tut ye and the veri fineedg one are gener temper brittl as razor penkniv and surgeon instrument but swordblad are made flexibl and the best of them will bend doubl without break or becom crook the steel of which spring are made ha the highest possibl degre of elast given it a watchspr is one of the most perfect exampl of thi kind steel for ornament is made extrem hard and closegrain so as to bear an exquisit polish common hammer iron is chiefli use for work of strength as horsesho bar bolt and the like it will bend but not straighten itself again as you may see in the kitchen poker cast iron is use for pot and caldron cannon cannonbal grate pillar and mani other purpos in which hard without flexibl is want geo what a vast varieti of use thi metal is put to tut ye i know not when i should have done if i were tell you of all har then i think it is realli more valuabl than gold though it is so much cheaper tut that wa the opinion of the wise solon when he observ to the rich king crœsu who wa show him hi treasur he who possess more iron will soon be master of all thi gold har i suppos he meant weapon and armour tut he did but there are mani nobler use for these metal and few circumst denot the progress of the art in a countri more than have attain the full use of iron without which scarc ani manufactur or machineri can be brought to perfect from the difficulti of melt it out of the ore mani nation have been longer in discov it than some of the other metal the greek in homer time seem to have employ copper or brass for their weapon much more than iron and the mexican and peruvian who possess gold and silver were unacquaint with iron when the spaniard invad them geo iron is veri subject to rust howev tut it is so and that is one of it worst properti everi liquor and even a moist air corrod it but the rust of iron is not pernici on the contrari it is a veri use medicin geo i have heard of steel drop and steel file given for medicin tut ye iron is given in a varieti of form and the properti of them all is to strengthen the constitut mani spring are made medicin by the iron that they dissolv in the bowel of the earth these are call chalyb water and they may be known by their inki tast and the rustcolour sediment they leav in their cours har may we drink such water if we meet with it tut ye it will do you no harm at least there is one other properti of iron well worth know and that is that it is the onli thing attract by the magnet or loadston geo i had a magnet onc that would take up needl and key but it seem a bar of iron itself tut true the real loadston which is a particular ore of iron can commun it virtu to a piec of iron by rub it nay a bar of iron itself in length of time by be place in a particular posit will acquir the same properti geo is all the iron use in england produc there tut by no mean their extens manufactur requir a great import of iron much is brought from norway russia and sweden and the swedish is reckon particularli excel well now to anoth metal i dare say you can tell me a good deal about lead har i know sever thing about it it is veri heavi and soft and easili melt tut true these are some of it distinguish properti it weight is between eleven and twelv time that of water it colour is a dull bluish white and from thi livid hue as well as it be total void of spring or elast it ha acquir a sort of charact of dul and sluggish thu we say of a stupid man that he ha a leaden disposit geo lead is veri malleabl i think tut ye it may be beaten out into a pretti thin leaf but it will not bear draw into fine wire it is not onli veri fusibl but veri readili oxid by heat chang into a powder or a scali matter which may be made to take all colour by the fire from yellow to deep red you have seen red lead geo ye tut that is oxid of lead expos for a consider time to a strong flame lead may even be chang into glass by a moder heat and there is a good deal of it in our finest glass geo what is white lead tut it is lead corrod by the steam of vinegar lead in variou form is much use by painter it oxid dissolv in oil and are employ for the purpos of thicken paint and make it dri all lead paint howev are unwholesom as long as they continu to smell and the fume of lead when melt are likewis pernici thi is the caus whi painter and plumber are so subject to variou diseas particularli violent colic and palsi the whitelead manufactur is so hurt to the health that the workmen in a veri short time are apt to lose the use of their limb and be otherwis sever indispos geo i wonder then that anybodi will work in it tut ignor and high wage are suffici to induc them but it is to be lament that in a great mani manufactur the health and live of individu are sacrif to the conveni and profit of the commun lead too when dissolv as it may be in all sour liquor is a slow poison and the more danger as it give no disagre tast a salt of lead made with vinegar is so sweet as to be call the sugar of lead it ha been too common to put thi or some other prepar of lead into sour wine in order to cure them and much mischief ha been done by thi practic geo if lead is poison is it not wrong to make waterpip and cistern of it tut thi ha been object to but it doe not appear that water can dissolv ani of the lead nor doe it readili rust in the air and henc it is much use to cover build with as well as to line spout and watercours for these purpos the lead is cast into sheet which are easili cut and hammer into ani shape har bullet and shot too are made of lead tut they are and in thi way they are ten time more destruct than as a poison geo i think lead seem to be more use than ani metal except iron tut it is and the plenti of it in our countri is a great benefit to us both for domest use and as an articl that bring in much profit by export geo where are our princip lead mine tut they are much scatter about the west of england produc some in cornwal devonshir and somersetshir wale afford a larg quantiti derbyshir ha long been note for it lead mine and so have northumberland and durham and there are consider one in the southern part of scotland now do you recollect anoth metal to be spoken about geo tin tut true tin resembl lead in colour but ha a more silveri white it is soft and flexibl like lead but is distinguish by the crackl nois it make on be bent it melt as easili as lead and also is readili oxid by keep it in the fire it is the lightest of the metal be onli seven time as heavi as water it may be beaten into a thin leaf but not drawn out to wire geo is tin of much use tut it is not often use by itself but veri frequent in conjunct with other metal as tin is littl liabl to rust or to be corrod by common liquor it is employ for a line or coat of vessel made of copper or iron the saucepan and kettl in the kitchen you know are all tin geo ye how is it done tut by melt the tin and spread it upon the surfac of the copper which is first heat in order to make the tin adher geo but what are the vessel made at the tinman are they not all tin tut no tin ware as it is properli call is made of thin iron plate coat over with tin by dip them into a vessel full of melt tin these plate are afterward cut and bent to proper shape and the join are solder togeth with a mixtur of tin and other metal anoth similar use of tin is in what is call the silver of pin geo what—i not that real silver tut no the pin which are made of brass wire after be point and head are boil in hot water in which graintin is put along with tartar which is a crust that collect on the insid of wine cask the tartar dissolv some of the tin and make it adher to the surfac of the pin and thu thousand are cover in an instant har that is as clever as what you told us of the gild of button tut it is anoth purpos for which great quantiti of tin use to be employ wa the make of pewter the best pewter consist chiefli of tin with a small mixtur of other metal to harden it and the london pewter wa brought to such perfect as to look almost as well as silver geo i can just rememb a long row of pewter plate at my grandmoth tut you may in her time all the plate and dish for the tabl were made of pewter and a handsom rang of pewter shelv wa thought a capit ornament for a kitchen at present thi trade is almost come to noth through the use of earthenwar and china and pewter is employ for littl but the worm of still and barber basin and porterpot but a good deal is still export tin is likewis an ingredi in other mix metal for variou purpos but on the whole less of it is use than of the other common metal geo is not england more famou for tin than ani other countri i have read of the phoenician trade here for it in veri earli time tut they did and tin is still a veri valuabl articl of export from england much of it is sent as far as china the tin mine are chiefli in cornwal england and i believ they are the most product of ani in europ veri fine tin is also got in the peninsula of malacca in the east indi well—w have now gone through the metal geo but you said noth about a kind of metal call zinc tut that is one of anoth class of miner substanc call semimet these resembl metal in everi qualiti but ductil of which they are almost wholli destitut and for want of it they can seldom be use in the art except when join with metal geo are there mani of them tut ye sever but we will not talk of them till i have taken some opportun of show them to you for probabl you may never have seen ani of them now tri to repeat the name of all the metal to me in the order of their weight har there is first gold geo then quicksilv lead silver har copper iron tin tut veri right now i must tell you of an old fanci that chymist have had of christen these metal by the name of the heavenli bodi they have call gold sol or the sun geo that is suitabl enough to it colour and bright har then silver should be the moon for i have heard moonlight call of a silveri hue tut true and they have name it so it is luna quicksilv is mercuri so name probabl from it great propens to danc and jump about for mercuri you know wa veri nimbl geo yes—h had wing to hi heel tut copper is venu geo venu sure it is scarc beauti enough for that tut but they had dispos of the most beauti one befor iron is mar har that is right enough becaus sword are made of iron tut true then tin is jupit and lead saturn i suppos onli to make out the number yet the dul of lead might be thought to agre with that planet which is most remot from the sun these name childish as they may seem are worth rememb sinc chymist and physician still appli them to mani prepar of the variou metal you will probabl often hear of martial lunar mercuri and saturnin and you may now know what they mean geo i think the knowledg of metal seem more use than all you have told us about plant tut i dont know that mani nation make no use at all of metal but there are none which do not owe a great part of their subsist to veget howev without inquir what part of natur knowledg are most use you may be assur of thi that all are use in some degre or other and there are few thing that give one man greater superior over anoth than the extent and accuraci of hi knowledg in these particular one person pass all hi life upon the earth a stranger to it while anoth find himself at home everywher eye and no eye or the art of see well robert where have you been walk thi afternoon said mr andrew to one of hi pupil at the close of a holyday robert i have been sir to broomheath and so round by the windmil upon campmount and home through the meadow by the riversid mr andrew well that a pleasant round rob i thought it veri dull sir i scarc met with a singl person i had rather by half have gone along the turnpikeroad mr an whi if see men and hors is your object you would inde be better entertain on the highroad but did you see william rob we set out togeth but he lag behind in the lane so i walk on and left him mr an that wa a piti he would have been compani for you rob o he is so tediou alway stop to look at thi thing and that i had rather walk alon i dare say he is not got home yet mr an here he come well william where have you been william o sir the pleasantest walk i went all over broomheath and so up to the mill at the top of the hill and then down among the green meadow by the side of the river mr an whi that is just the round robert ha been take and he complain of it dul and prefer the highroad will i wonder at that i am sure i hardli took a step that did not delight me and i have brought my handkerchief full of curios home mr an suppos then you give us some account of what amus you so much i fanci it will be as new to robert as to me will i will sir the lane lead to the heath you know is close and sandi so i did not mind it much but made the best of my way howev i spi a curiou thing enough in the hedg it wa an old crabtre out of which grew a great bunch of someth green quit differ from the tree itself here is a branch of it mr an ah thi is mistleto a plant of great fame for the use made of it by the druid of old in their religi rite and incant it bear a veri slimi white berri of which birdlim may be made whenc it latin name of viscu it is one of those plant which do not grow in the ground by a root of their own but fix themselv upon other plant whenc they have been humor style parasit as be hangerson or depend it wa the mistleto of the oak that the druid particularli honour will a littl farther on i saw a green woodpeck fli to a tree and run up the trunk like a cat mr an that wa to seek for insect in the bark on which they live they bore hole with their strong bill for that purpos and do much damag to the tree by it will what beauti bird they are mr an ye they have been call from their colour and size the english parrot will when i got upon the open heath how charm it wa the air seem so fresh and the prospect on everi side so free and unbound then it wa all cover with gay flower mani of which i had never observ befor there were at least three kind of heath i have got them in my handkerchief here and gors and broom and bellflow and mani other of all colour that i will beg you present to tell me the name of mr an that i will readili will i saw too sever bird that were new to me there wa a pretti grayish one of the size of a lark that wa hop about some great stone and when he flew he show a great deal of white abov hi tail mr an that wa a wheatear they are reckon veri delici bird to eat and frequent the open down in sussex and some other counti in great number will there wa a flock of lapw upon a marshi part of the heath that amus me much as i came near them some of them kept fli round and round just over my head and cri pewit so distinctli one might almost fanci they spoke i thought i should have caught one of them for he flew as if one of hi wing wa broken and often tumbl close to the ground but as i came near he alway made a shift to get away mr an ha ha you were fine taken in then thi wa all an artific of the bird to entic you away from it nest for they build upon the bare ground and their nest would easili be observ did they not draw off the attent of intrud by their loud cri and counterfeit lame will i wish i had known that for he led me a long chase often over shoe in water howev it wa the caus of my fall in with an old man and a boy who were cut and pile up turf for fuel and i had a good deal of talk with them about the manner of prepar the turf and the price it sell at they gave me too a creatur i never saw before—a young viper which they had just kill togeth with it dam i have seen sever common snake but thi is thicker in proport and of a darker colour than they are mr an true viper frequent those turfi boggi ground pretti much and i have known sever turfcutt bitten by them will they are veri venom are they not mr an enough so to make their wound pain and danger though they seldom prove fatal will well—i then took my cours up to the windmil on the mount i climb up the step of the mill in order to get a better view of the countri round what an extens prospect i count fifteen churchsteepl and i saw sever gentlemen hous peep out from the midst of green wood and plantat and i could trace the wind of the river all along the low ground till it wa lost behind a ridg of hill but ill tell you what i mean to do sir if you will give me leav mr an what is that will i will go again and take with me cari countymap by which i shall probabl be abl to make out most of the place mr an you shall have it and i will go with you and take my pocket spyingglass will i shall be veri glad of that well a thought struck me that as the hill is call campmount there might probabl be some remain of ditch and mound with which i have read that camp were surround and i realli believ i discov someth of that sort run round one side of the mount mr an veri like you might i know antiquari have describ such remain as exist there which some suppos to be roman other danish we will examin them farther when we go will from the hill i went straight down to the meadow below and walk on the side of a brook that run into the river it wa all border with reed and flag and tall tower plant quit differ from those i had seen on the heath as i wa get down the bank to reach one of them i heard someth plung into the water near me it wa a larg waterrat and i saw it swim over to the other side and go into it hole there were a great mani larg dragonfli all about the stream i caught one of the finest and have got him here in a leaf but how i long to catch a bird that i saw hover over the water and everi now and then dart down into it it wa all over a mixtur of the most beauti green and blue with some orang colour it wa somewhat less than a thrush and had a larg head and bill and a short tail mr an i can tell you what that bird was—a kingfish the celebr halcyon of the ancient about which so mani tale are told it live on fish which it catch in the manner you saw it build in hole in the bank and is a shi retir bird never to be seen far from the stream where it inhabit will i must tri to get anoth sight of him for i never saw a bird that pleas me so much well—i follow thi littl brook till it enter the river and then took the path that run along the bank on the opposit side i observ sever littl bird run along the shore and make a pipe nois they were brown and white and about as big as a snipe mr an i suppos they were sandpip one of the numer famili of bird that get their live by wade among the shallow and pick up worm and insect will there were a great mani swallow too sport upon the surfac of the water that entertain me with their motion sometim they dash into the stream sometim they pursu one anoth so quick that the eye could scarc follow them in one place where a high steep sandbank rose directli abov the river i observ mani of them go in and out of hole with which the bank wa bore full mr an those were sandmarten the smallest of our speci of swallow they are of a mousecolour abov and white beneath they make their nest and bring up their young in these hole which run a great depth and by their situat are secur from all plunder will a littl farther i saw a man in a boat who wa catch eel in an odd way he had a long pole with broad iron prong at the end just like neptun trident onli there were five instead of three thi he push straight down among the mud in the deepest part of the river and fetch up the eel stick between the prong mr an i have seen thi method it is call spear of eel will while i wa look at him a heron came fli over my head with hi larg flag wing he lit at the next turn of the river and i crept softli behind the bank to watch hi motion he had wade into the water as far as hi long leg would carri him and wa stand with hi neck drawn in look intent on the stream present he dart hi long bill as quick as lightn into the water and drew out a fish which he swallow i saw him catch anoth in the same manner he then took alarm at some nois i made and flew away slowli to a wood at some distanc where he settl mr an probabl hi nest wa there for heron build upon the loftiest tree they can find and sometim in societi togeth like rook formerli when these bird were valu for the amus of hawk mani gentlemen had their heronri and a few are still remain will i think they are the largest wild bird we have mr an they are of a great length and spread of wing but their bodi are compar small will i then turn homeward across the meadow where i stop a while to look at a larg flock of starl which kept fli about at no great distanc i could not tell at first what to make of them for they rose all togeth from the ground as thick as a swarm of bee and form themselv into a kind of black cloud hover over the field after have a short round they settl again and present rose again in the same manner i dare say there were hundr of them mr an perhap so for in the fenni countri their flock are so numer as to break down whole acr of reed by settl on them thi disposit of starl to fli in close swarm wa remark even by homer who compar the foe fli from one of hi hero to a cloud of stare retir dismay at the approach of the hawk will after i had left the meadow i cross the cornfield in the way to our hous and pass by a deep marlpit look into it i saw in one of the side a cluster of what i took to be shell and upon go down i pick up a clod of marl which wa quit full of them but how seashel could get there i can not imagin mr an i do not wonder at your surpris sinc mani philosoph have been much perplex to account for the same appear it is not uncommon to find great quantiti of shell and relic of marin anim even in the bowel of high mountain veri remot from the sea they are certainli proof that the earth wa onc in a veri differ state from what it is at present but in what manner and how long ago these chang took place can onli be guess at will i got to the high field next our hous just as the sun wa set and i stood look at it till it wa quit lost what a gloriou sight the cloud were ting purpl and crimson and yellow of all shade and hue and the clear sky vari from blue to a fine green at the horizon but how larg the sun appear just as it set i think it seem twice as big as when it is overhead mr an it doe so and you may probabl have observ the same appar enlarg of the moon at it rise will i have but pray what is the reason of thi mr an it is an optic decept depend upon principl which i can not well explain to you till you know more of that branch of scienc but what a number of new idea thi afternoon walk ha afford you i do not wonder that you found it amus it ha been veri instruct too did you see noth of all these sight robert rob i saw some of them but i did not take particular notic of them mr an whi not rob i dont know i did not care about them and i made the best of my way home mr an that would have been right if you had been sent with a messag but as you onli walk for amus it would have been wiser to have sought out as mani sourc of it as possibl but so it is—on man walk through the world with hi eye open and anoth with them shut and upon thi differ depend all the superior of knowledg the one acquir abov the other i have known sailor who had been in all the quarter of the world and could tell you noth but the sign of the tipplinghous they frequent in differ port and the price and qualiti of the liquor on the other hand a franklin could not cross the channel without make some observ use to mankind while mani a vacant thoughtless youth is whirl throughout europ without gain a singl idea worth cross a street for the observ eye and inquir mind find matter of improv and delight in everi rambl in town or countri do you then william continu to make use of your eye and you robert learn that eye were given you to use illustr umbellifer plant p even xxi whi the earth move round the sun papa—luci papa you rememb luci that i explain to you some time ago what wa the caus that thing fell to the ground luci o ye it wa becaus the ground drew them to it pa true that is a consequ of the univers law in natur that bodi attract each other in proport to their bulk so a veri small thing in the neighbourhood of a veri larg one alway tend to go to it if not prevent by some or other power well—you know i told you that the sun wa a ball a vast mani time bigger than the ball we inhabit call the earth upon which you properli ask how then it happen that the earth did not fall into the sun lu and whi doe it not pa that i am go to explain to you you have seen your brother whirl round an ivori ball tie to the end of a string which he held in hi hand lu ye and i have done it myself too pa well then—you felt that the ball wa continu pull as if it tri to make it escap lu ye and one my brother wa swing did make it escap and flew through the sash pa it did so that wa a lesson in the centrifug motion or that power by which a bodi thu whirl continu endeavour to fli off from the centr round which it move thi is owe to the forc or impuls you give it at set out as if you were go to throw it away from you the string by which you hold it on the contrari is the power which keep the ball toward the centr call the centripet power thu you see there are two power act upon the ball at the same time one to make it fli off the other to hold it in and the consequ is that it move directli accord to neither but between both that is round and round thi it continu to do while you swing it properli but if the string break or slip off away fli the ball on the other hand if you ceas to give it the whirl forc it fall toward your hand lu i understand all thi pa i will give you anoth instanc of thi doubl forc act at the same time do not you rememb see some curiou feat of horsemanship lu ye pa one of them wa that a man stand with one leg upon the saddl and ride full speed threw up ball into the air and catch them as they fell lu i rememb it veri well pa perhap you would have expect these ball to have fallen behind him as he wa go at such a rate lu so i did pa but you saw that they fell into hi hand as directli as if he had been stand quit still that wa becaus at the instant he threw them up they receiv the motion of the hors straight forward as well as the upright motion that he gave them so that they made a slant line through the air and came down in the same place they would have reach if he had held them in hi hand all the while lu that is veri curiou inde pa in the same manner you may have observ in ride in a carriag that if you throw anyth out of the window it fall directli opposit just as if the carriag wa stand still and is not left behind you lu i will tri that the next time i ride in one pa you are then to imagin the sun to be a mighti mass of matter mani thousand time bigger than our earth place in the centr quiet and unmov you are to conceiv our earth as soon as creat launch with vast forc in a straight line as if it were a bowl on a green it would have flown off in thi line for ever through the boundless region of space had it not at the same instant receiv a pull from the sun by it attract by the wonder skill of the creator these two forc were made exactli to counterbal each other so that just as much as the earth from the origin motion given to it tend to fli forward just so much the sun draw it to the centr and the consequ is that it take a cours between the two which is a circl round and round the sun lu but if the earth wa set a roll like a bowl upon a green i should think it would stop of itself as the bowl doe pa the bowl stop becaus it is continu rub against the ground which check it motion but the ball of the earth move in empti space where there is noth to stop it lu but if i throw a ball through the air it will not go on for ever but it will come down to the ground pa that is becaus the forc with which you can throw it is much less than the forc by which it is drawn to the earth but there is anoth reason too which is the resist of the air thi space all round us and over us is not empti space it is quit full of a thin transpar fluid call air lu is it pa ye if you move your hand quickli through it you will find someth resist you though in a slight degre and the wind you well know is capabl of press against anyth with almost irresist forc and yet wind is noth but a quantiti of air put into violent motion everyth then that move through the air is continu oblig to push some of thi fluid out of the way by which mean it is constantli lose part of it motion lu then the earth would do the same pa no for it move in empti space lu what doe it not move through the air pa the earth doe not move through the air but carri the air along with it all the air is contain in what is call the atmospher which you may compar to a kind of mist or fog cling all round to the ball of the earth and reach a certain distanc abov it which ha been calcul at abov fortyf mile lu that is abov the cloud then pa ye all the cloud are within the atmospher for they are support by the air well—thi atmospher roll about along with the earth as if it were a part of it and move with it through the sky which is a vast field of empti space in thi immens space are all the star and planet which have also their sever motion there is noth to stop them and therefor they continu go on by mean of the forc that the creator ha origin impress upon them lu do not some of the star move round the sun as well as our earth pa ye those that are call planet these are all subject to the same law of motion with our earth they are attract by the sun as their centr and form along with the earth that assemblag of world which is call the solar system lu is the moon one of them pa the moon is call a secondari planet becaus it immedi connexion is with our earth round which it roll as we do round the sun it howev accompani our earth on it journey round the sun but i will tell you more about it motion and about the other planet and star anoth time it is enough at present if you thoroughli understand what i have been describ lu i think i do the umbellifer plant tutor—george—harri harri what plant is that man gather under the hedg georg i dont know but the boy call the stalk hex and blow through them har i have seen them but i want to know the plant geo will you pleas to tell us sir what it is tutor it is hemlock geo hemlock is poison is it not tut ye in some degre and it is also a medicin that man is gather it for the apothecari har i should like to know it tut well then—go and bring one harri fetch it geo i think i have seen a great mani of thi sort tut perhap you may but there are mani other kind of plant extrem like it it is one of a larg famili call the umbellifer which contain both food physic and poison it will be worth while for you to know someth about them so let us examin thi hemlock close you see thi tall hollow stalk which divid into sever branch from each of which spring spoke or rundl as they are call of flowerstalk you see they are like ray from a circl or the spoke of a wheel har or like the stick of an umbrella tut true and they are call umbel which ha the same deriv if you pursu one of these rundl or umbel you will find that each stick or spoke termin in anoth set of smaller stalk each of which bear a singl small flower geo they are small one inde tut but if you look sharpli i dare say your eye are good enough to distinguish that they are divid into five leav and furnish with five chive and two pistil in the middl har i can see them geo and so can i tut the pistil are succeed by a sort of fruit which is a twinse join in the middl as you may see in thi rundl that is past flower here i divid one of them into two geo would each of these grow tut ye well thi is the structur of the flower part of the umbellifer tribe now for the leaf pluck one har is thi one leaf or mani tut it is properli one but it is cut and divid into mani portion from thi midrib spring smaller leav set opposit each other and from the rib of each of these proceed other which themselv are also divid these are call doubli or trebli pinnat leav and most of the umbellifer plant but not all have leav of thi kind har it is like a parsleyleaf tut true—and parsley is one of the same tribe and hemlock and other are sometim mistaken for it geo how curious the stalk of thi hemlock is spot tut ye that is one of the mark by which it is known it is also distinguish by it peculiar smell and by other circumst which you can onli understand when you have compar a number of the tribe i will now tell you about some other the name of which you are probabl acquaint with in the first place there are carrot and parsnip har carrot and parsnips—they are not poison i am sure geo i rememb now that carrot have such a leaf as thi tut they have it is the root of these you know that are eaten but we eat the leav of parsley and fennel which are of the same class celeri is anoth the stalk of which are chiefli use made white by trench up the earth about them the stalk of angelica are use differ har i know how—candi tut ye then there are mani of which the seed are use there is caraway har what the seed that are put into cake and comfit tut ye they are warm and pungent to the tast and so are the seed of mani other of the umbellifer plant as coriand fennel wild carrot angelica anis cummin and dill all these are employ in food or medicin and are good in warm or strengthen the stomach har those are pleasant medicin enough tut they are but you will not say the same of some other of the class which are note medicin too such as the plant yield asafœtida and sever more from which what are call the fetid gum are produc geo asafœtida—that nasti stuff i know doe it grow here tut no and most of the sweet seed i befor mention come from abroad too now i will tell you of some of the poison har hemlock is one that we know alreadi tut ye then there is anoth kind that grow in the water and is more poison call waterhemlock anoth is a larg plant grow in ditch with leav extrem like celeri call hemlockdropwort anoth common in drier situat and distinguish by leav less divid than most of the class is cowparsnip or madnep of some of these the leav of other the root is most poison their effect are to make the head giddi bring on stupid or delirium and caus violent sick the athenian use to put crimin to death by make them drink the juic of a kind of hemlock grow in that countri as you may read in the life of that excel philosoph socrat who wa kill in that manner har what wa he kill for tut becaus he wa wiser and better than hi fellowcitizen among us it is onli by accid that mischief is done by these plant i rememb a melancholi instanc of a poor boy who in rambl about the field with hi littl brother and sister chanc to meet with a root of hemlockdropwort it look so white and nice that he wa tempt to eat a good deal of it the other children also ate some but not so much when they got home they were all taken veri ill the eldest boy who had eaten most die in great agoni the other recov after suffer a great deal geo is there ani way of prevent their bad effect tut the best way is to clear the stomach as soon as possibl by a strong vomit and larg draught of warm water after that vinegar is use in remov the disord of the head har but are the root sweet and pleasant that peopl should be tempt to eat them tut sever of them are there is a small plant of the tribe the root of which is much sought after by boy who dig for it with their knive it is round and call earthnut or pignut geo but that not poison i suppos tut no but it is not veri wholesom i believ howev that the root of the most poison becom innoc by boil i have heard that boil hemlock root are as good as carrot geo i think i should not like to eat them howev but pray whi should there be ani poison at all tut what we call poison are onli hurt to particular anim they are the proper food of other and no doubt do more good than hurt in the creation most of the thing that are poison to us in larg quantiti are use medicin in small one and we have reason bestow upon us to guard us against mischief other anim in gener refus by instinct what would prove hurt to them you see beneath yonder hedg a great crop of tall flourish plant with white flower they are of the umbellifer famili and are call wild cice or cowwe the latter name is given them becaus the cow will not touch them though the pastur be ever so bare har would they poison them tut perhap they would at least they are not proper food for them we will go and examin them and i will show you how they differ from hemlock for which they are sometim mistaken geo i should like to get some of these plant and dri them tut you shall and write down the name of them all and learn to know the innoc from the hurt geo that will be veri use tut it will rememb now the gener charact of the umbellifer plant the flowerstalk are divid into spoke or umbel which are again divid into other each of them termin by a small fiveleav flower have five chive and two pistil succeed by a twinse their leav are gener fine divid you will soon know them after have examin two or three of the tribe rememb too that they are a suspici race and not to be made free with till you are well acquaint with them humbl life or the cottag mr everard and charl walk in the field mr everard well charl you seem to be in deep medit pray what are you think about charl i wa think sir how happi it is for us that we are not in the place of that poor weaver whose cottag we just pass by mr ev it is veri right to be sensibl of all the advantag that provid ha bestow upon us in thi world and i commend you for reflect on them with gratitud but what particular circumst of comparison between our condit and hi struck you most just now ch o almost everyth i could not bear to live in such a poor hous with a cold clay floor and half the window stop with paper then how poorli he and hi children are dress and i dare say they must live as poorli too mr ev these thing would be grievou enough to you i do not doubt becaus you have been accustom to a veri differ way of live but if they are healthi and content i dont know that we have much more to boast of i believ the man is abl to procur wholesom food for hi famili and cloth and fire enough to keep them from suffer from the cold and natur want littl more ch but what a rag barefoot fellow the boy at the door wa mr ev he was—but did you observ hi ruddi cheek and hi stout leg and the smile grin upon hi counten it is my opinion he would beat you in run though he is half the head less and i dare say he never cri becaus he did not know what to do with himself in hi life ch but sir you have often told me that the mind is the noblest part of man and these poor creatur i am sure can have no opportun to improv their mind they must be as ignor as the brute almost mr ev whi so do you think there is no knowledg to be got but from book or that a weaver can not teach hi children right from wrong ch not if he ha never learn himself mr ev true—but i hope the countri we live in is not so unfriendli to a poor man as to afford him no opportun of learn hi duti to god and hi neighbour and as to other point of knowledg necess and common observ will teach him a good deal but come—let us go and pay him a visit for i doubt you hardli think them human creatur they enter the

the limekiln do nt you see it just by har o ye i do but what is to be done to them there geo whi they are to be burnt into lime do nt you know that har but what is lime and what are it use geo i can tell you one they lay it on the field for manur do nt you rememb we saw a number of littl heap of it that we took for sheep at a distanc and wonder they did not move howev i believ we had better ask our tutor about it will you pleas sir to tell us someth about lime tutor willingli but suppos as we talk about all sort of metal some time ago i should now give you a lectur about stone and earth of all kind which are equal valuabl and much more common than metal geo pray do sir har i shall be veri glad to hear it tut well then in the first place the ground we tread upon to as great a depth as it ha been dug consist for the most part of matter of variou appear and hard call by the gener name of earth in common languag inde onli the soft and powderi substanc are so name while the hard and solid are call stone or rock but chymist use the same term for all as in fact earth is onli crumbl stone and stone onli consolid earth har what—ha the mould of my garden ever been stone tut the black earth or mould which cover the surfac wherev plant grow consist mostli of part of rot veget such as stalk leav and root mix with sand or loos clay but thi onli reach a littl way and beneath it you alway come to a bed of gravel or clay or stone of some kind now these earth and stone are distinguish into sever speci but princip into three the properti of which make them use to man for veri differ purpos and are therefor veri well worth know as you began with ask me about lime i shall first mention that class of earth from which it is obtain these have deriv their name of calcar from thi veri circumst calx be lime in latin and lime is got from them all in the same way by burn them in a strong fire there are mani kind of calcar earth one of them is marbl you know what that is geo o ye our parlour chimneypiec and hearth are marbl har and so are the monument in the church tut true there are variou kind of it white black yellow gray mottl and vein with differ colour but all of them are hard and heavi stone admit a fine polish on which account they are much use in ornament work geo i think statu are made of it tut ye and where it is plenti column and portico and sometim whole build marbl is the luxuri of architectur har where doe marbl come from tut from a great mani countri great britain produc some but mostli of inferior kind what we use chiefli come from itali the greek island yield some fine sort that of paro is of ancient fame for white and puriti and the finest antiqu statu have been made of parian marbl har i suppos black marbl will not burn into white lime tut ye it will a violent heat will expel most of the colour matter of marbl and make them white chalk is anoth kind of calcar earth thi is of a much softer consist than marbl be easili cut with a knife and mark thing on which it is rub it is found in great bed in the earth and in some part of england whole hill are compos of it geo are chalk and white the same tut white is made of the finer and purer particl of chalk wash out from the rest and then dri in lump thi you know is quit soft and crumbl there are besid a great varieti of stone in the earth harder than chalk but softer than marbl which will burn to lime and are therefor call limeston these differ much in colour and other properti and accordingli furnish lime of differ qualiti whole ridg of mountain in variou part are compos of limeston and it is found plenti in most of the hilli counti of england to the great advantag of the inhabit geo will not oystershel burn into lime i think i have heard of oystershel lime tut they will and thi is anoth sourc of calcar earth the shell of all anim both land and sea as oyster mussel cockl crab lobster snail and the like and also eggshel of all kind consist of thi earth and so doe coral which is form by insect under the sea and is veri abund in some countri vast quantiti of shell are often found deep in the earth in the midst of chalk and limeston bed whenc some have suppos that all calcar earth is origin an anim product har but where could anim enough ever have live to make mountain of their shell tut that inde i can not answer but there are suffici proof that our world must long have exist in a veri differ state from the present well—but besid these purer calcar earth it is veri frequent found mingl in differ proport with other earth thu marl which is so much use in manur land and of which there are a great mani kind consist of calcar earth unit with clay and sand and the more of thi earth it contain the richer manur it gener make geo is there ani way of discov it when it is mix in thi manner with other thing tut yes—ther is an easi and sure method of discov the smallest portion of it all the varieti of calcar earth that i have mention have the properti of dissolv in acid and effervesc with them that is they bubbl and hiss when acid are pour upon them you may readili tri thi at ani time with a piec of chalk or an oystershel geo i will pour some vinegar upon an oystershel as soon as i get home but now i think of it i have often done so in eat oyster and i never observ it to hiss or bubbl tut vinegar is not an acid strong enough to act upon a thing so solid as a shell but sulphur and muriat acid will do it at onc and person who examin the natur of fossil alway travel with a bottl of one of these acid by way of a test of calcar earth your vinegar will answer with chalk or white thi properti of dissolv in acid and what is call neutral them or take away their sour ha caus mani of the calcar earth to be use in medicin you know that sometim our food turn veri sour upon the stomach and occas the pain call heartburn and other uneasi symptom in these case it is common to give chalk or powder shell or other thing of thi kind which afford relief by neutral the acid geo i suppos then magnesia is someth of thi sort for i have often seen it given to my littl sister when they said her stomach wa out of order tut it is but though magnesia ha some properti in common with calcar earth it possess other that are peculiar to itself geo pray what are the other use of these earth tut such of them as are hard stone as the marbl and mani of the limeston are use for the same purpos as other stone but their great use is in the form of lime which is a substanc of mani curiou properti that i will now explain to you when fresh burnt it is call quicklim on account of the heat and life as it were which it possess have you ever seen a lump put into water geo ye i have tut were you not much surpris to see it swell and crack to piec with a hiss nois and a great smoke and heat geo i wa inde but what is the caus of this—how can cold water occas so much heat tut i will tell you the strong heat to which calcar earth is expos in make it lime expel all the water it contain for all earth as well as almost everyth els natur contain water and also a quantiti of a peculiar kind of air which wa unit with it if water be now ad to thi quicklim it is drunk in again with such rapid as to crack and break the lime to piec at the same time a great heat is occas by the water combin with the lime and thi make itself sensibl by it effect burn all the thing that it touch and turn part of the water to steam thi oper is call slack of lime the water in which lime is slack dissolv a part of it and acquir a veri pungent harsh tast thi is use in medicin under the name of limewat if instead of soak quicklim in water it is expos for sometim to the air it attract moistur slowli and by degre fail to powder without much heat or disturb but whether lime be slack in water or air it doe not at first return to the state in which it wa befor sinc it still remain depriv of it air and on that account is still pungent and caustic at length howev it recov thi also from the atmospher and is then mild calcar earth as at first now it is upon some of these circumst that the util of lime depend in the first place it burn and corrod qualiti make it use to the tanner in loosen all the hair from the hide and destroy the flesh and fat that adher to them and so in variou other trade it is use as a great cleanser and purifi har i have a thought come into my head when it is laid upon the ground i suppos it use must be to burn up the weed tut true—that is part of it use geo but it must burn up the good grass and corn too tut properli object but the case is that the farmer doe not sow hi seed till the lime is render mild by exposur to the air and weather and is well mix with the soil and even then it is reckon a hot and forc manur chiefli fit for cold and wet land the princip use of lime howev is as an ingredi in mortar thi you know is the cement by which brick and stone are held togeth in build it is made of fresh slack lime and a proport of sand well mix togeth and when use for plaster wall some chop hair is put into it the lime bind with the other ingredi and in length of time the mortar if well made becom as hard or harder than stone itself geo i have heard of the mortar in veri old build be harder and stronger than ani made at present tut that is onli on account of it age burn lime and make mortar are as well understood now as ever but in order to have it excel the lime should be of a good qualiti and thoroughli burnt some sort of lime have the properti of make mortar which will harden under water whenc it is much valu for bridg lock wharf and the like geo pray is not plaster of pari a kind of lime i know it will becom hard by onli mix water with it for i have use it to make cast of tut the powder you call plaster of pari is made of an earth name gypsum of which there are sever kind alabast is a stone of thi sort and hard enough to be use like marbl the gypseou earth are of the calcar kind but they have natur a portion of acid unit with them whenc they will not effervesc on have acid pour on them but they are distinguish by the properti that after be calcin or burnt in the fire and reduc to powder they will set into a solid bodi by the addit of water alon thi make them veri use for ornament plaster that are to receiv a form or impress such as the stucco for the ceil of room well—w have said enough about calcar earth now to anoth class the argillac geo i think i know what those are argilla is latin for clay tut true and they are also call clayey earth in gener these earth are of a soft textur and a sort of greasi feel but they are peculiarli distinguish by the properti of becom sticki on be temper with water so that they may be drawn out and work into form like a past have you ever when you were a littl boy made a clayhous geo ye i have tut then you well know the manner in which clay is temper and work for thi purpos har yes—and i rememb help to make littl pot and mug of clay tut then you imit the potter trade for all utensil of earthenwar are made of clay either pure or mix thi is one of the oldest art among mankind and one of the most use they furnish materi for build too for brick and tile are made of these earth but in order to be fit for these purpos it is necessari that clay should not onli be soft and ductil while it is form but capabl of be harden afterward and thi it is by the assist of fire potterywar and brick are burnt with a strong heat in kiln by which they acquir a hard equal to that of the hardest stone geo i think i have heard of brick be bake by the sun heat alon in veri hot countri tut true and they may serv for build in climat where rain scarc ever fall but heavi shower would wash them away fire seem to chang the natur of clay for after they have undergon it oper they becom incap of return of themselv to a soft and ductil state you might steep brickdust or pound pot in water ever so long without make it hold togeth in the least geo i suppos there are mani kind of clay tut there are argillac earth differ greatli from each other in colour puriti and other qualiti some are perfectli white as that of which tobaccopip are made other are blue brown yellow and in short of all hue which they owe to mixtur of decay veget substanc or metal those which burn red contain a portion of iron no clay are found perfectli pure but they are mix with more or less of other earth the common brickclay contain a larg proport of sand which often make them crumbl and perish in gener the finest earthenwar is made of the purest and whitest clay but other matter are mix in order to harden and strengthen them thu porcelain or china is made with a clayey earth mix with a stone of vitrifi natur that is which may be melt into glass and the fine potteri call queen ware is a mixtur of tobaccopip clay and flint burnt and powder common stone ware is a coars mixtur of thi sort some speci of potteri are made with mixtur of burnt and unburnt clay the former i told you befor be incap of becom soft again with water like a natur clay har are clay of no other use than to make potteri of tut ye the richest soil are those which have a proport of clay and marl which i have alreadi mention as a manur gener contain a good deal of it then clay ha the properti of absorb oil or greas whenc some kind of it are use like soap for clean cloth the substanc call fuller earth is a mix earth of the argillac kind and it use in take out the oil which natur adher to wool is so great that it ha been one caus of the superior of our woollen cloth har then i suppos it is found in england tut ye there are pit of the best kind of it near woburn in bedfordshir and nutfield in surrey england the differ kind of slate too are stone of the argillac class and veri use one for cover hous and other purpos har are write slate like the slate use for cover hous tut ye but their superior black and smooth make them show better the mark of the pencil geo you have mention someth of sand and flint but you have not told us what sort of earth they are tut i reserv that till i spoke of the third great class of earth thi is the silic class so name from silex which is latin for a flintston they have also been call vitrifi earth becaus they are the princip ingredi in glass name in latin vitrum geo i have heard of flintglass tut yes—but neither flint nor ani other of the kind will make glass even by the strongest heat without some addit but thi we will speak of byandbi i shall now tell you the princip properti of these earth they are all veri hard and will strike fire with steel when in a mass larg enough for the stroke they mostli run into particular shape with sharp angl and point and have a certain degre of transpar which ha made them also be call crystallin earth they do not in the least soften with water like clay nor are they affect by acid nor do they burn to lime like the calcar earth as to the differ kind of them flint ha alreadi been mention it is a veri common product in some part and is gener met with in pebbl or round lump form pebbl in gravelb and often almost entir cover the surfac of plough field har but do they not hinder the corn from grow tut the corn to be sure can not take root upon them but i believ it ha been found that the protect they afford to the young plant which grow under them is more than equal to the harm they do by take up room flint are also frequent found imbed in chalk under the ground those use in the staffordshir potteri chiefli come from the chalkpit near gravesend so much for flint you have seen white pebbl which are semitranspar and when broken resembl white sugarcandi they are common on the seashor and bed of river har o ye we call them fireston when they are rub togeth in the dark they send out great flash of light and have a particular smell tut true the proper name of these is quartz it is found in larg quantiti in the earth and the ore of metal are often imbed in it sometim it is perfectli transpar and then it is call crystal some of these crystal shoot into exact mathemat figur and becaus mani salt do the same and are also transpar they are call the crystal of such or such a salt geo is not fine glass call crystal too tut it is call so by way of simil thu we say of a thing it is as clear as a crystal but the onli true crystal is an earth of the kind i have been describ well now we come to sand for thi is properli onli quartz in a powderi state if you examin the grain of sand singli or look at them with a magnifi glass you will find them all either entir or partli transpar and in some of the white shine sand the grain are all littl bright crystal har but most sand is broken or yellowish tut that is owe to some mixtur gener of the metal kind i believ i onc told you that all sand were suppos to contain a small portion of gold it is more certain that mani of them contain iron geo but what could have brought thi quartz and crystal into powder so as to have produc all the sand in the world tut that is not veri easi to determin on the seashor howev the incess roll of the pebbl by the wave is enough in time to grind them to powder and there is reason to believ that the greatest part of what is now dri land wa onc sea which may account for the vast bed of sand met with inland geo i have seen some stone so soft that one might crumbl it between one finger and then it seem to turn to sand tut there are sever of thi kind more or less solid which are chiefli compos of sand conglutin by some natur cement such are call sandston or freeston and are use for variou purpos in build make grindston and the like accord to their hard har pray what are the common pebbl that the street are pave with i am sure they strike fire enough with hors shoe tut they are stone of the silic kind either pure or mix with other earth one of the hardest and best for thi purpos is call granit which is of variou kind and colour but alway consist of grain of differ silic stone cement togeth the street of london are pave with granit brought from scotland in some other stone these bit of differ earth dispers through the cement are so larg as to look like plum in a pud whenc they have obtain the name of puddingston geo i think there is a kind of stone that you have not yet mentioned—preci stone tut these too are mostli silic but some even of the hardest and most valuabl are argillac in their natur though possess none of the extern properti of clay the opaqu and halftranspar preciou stone such as jasper agat cornelian and lapi lazuli are engrav upon for sealston the more beauti and transpar one as rubi emerald sapphir topaz which go by the name of gem are gener onli cut and polish and worn in ring ear necklac and the like geo diamond no doubt is one of them har so it ha commonli been reckon and the purest of all but late experi have shown that though it is the hardest bodi in natur it may be total dispers into vapour by a strong fire so that mineralogist will now hardli allow it to be a stone at all but class it among inflamm substanc the preciou stone abovement owe their colour chiefli to some metal mixtur they are in gener extrem hard so as to cut glass and one anoth but diamond will cut all the rest geo but are they not exceedingli rare tut ye and in thi rariti consist the greatest part of their valu they are inde beauti object but the figur they make in proport to their expens is so veri small that their high price may be reckon one of the princip folli among mankind what proport can there possibl be between the real worth of a glitter stone as big as a hazelnut and a magnific hous and garden or a larg tract of countri cover with nobl wood and rich meadow and cornfield and as to the mere glitter a larg lustr of cut glass ha an infinit greater effect on the eye than all the jewel of a foreign princ geo will you pleas to tell us how glass is made tut willingli the base of it is as i said befor some earth of the silic class those commonli use are flint and sand flint is first burnt or calcin which make it quit white like enamel and it is then powder thi is the materi sometim use for some veri white glass but sand is that commonli prefer as be alreadi in a powderi form the white crystallin sand are use for fine glass the brown or yellow for the common sort as these earth will not melt of themselv the addit in make glass is somewhat that promot their fusion variou thing will do thi but what is gener use is an alkalin salt obtain from the ash of burnt veget of thi there are sever kind as potash pearlash barilla and kelp the salt is mix with the sand in a certain proport and the mixtur then expos in earthen pot to a violent heat till it is thoroughli melt the mass is then cool till it is nearli of the consist of dough and in thi state it is fashion by blow and the use of shear and other instrument you must see thi done some time for it is one of the most curiou and pleas of all manufactur and it is not possibl to form an idea of the eas and dexter with which glass is wrought without an actual view har i should like veri much to see it inde geo where is glass made in thi countri tut in mani place some of the finest in london but the coarser kind gener where coal are cheap as at newcastl and it neighbourhood in lancashir at stourbridg bristol and in south wale i should have told you howev that in our finest and most brilliant glass a quantiti of the oxid of lead is put which vitrifi with the other ingredi and give the glass more firm and densiti the blue yellow and red glass are colour with the oxid of other metal as to the common green glass it is made with an alkali that ha a good deal of calcar earth remain with the ash of the plant but to understand all the differ circumst of glassmak one must have a thorough knowledg of chymistri geo i think make of glass is one of the finest invent of human skill tut it is perhap not of that capit import that some other art possess but it ha been a great addit to the comfort and pleasur of life in mani way noth make such clean and agreeabl vessel as glass which ha the qualiti of not be corrod by ani kind of liquor as well as that of show it content by it transpar henc it is greatli prefer to the most preciou metal for drink out of and for the same reason it is prefer to everi other materi for chymic utensil where the heat to be employ is not strong enough to melt it har then glass window tut ay that is a veri materi comfort in a climat like our where we so often wish to let in the light and keep out the cold wind and rain what could be more gloomi than to sit in the dark or with no other light than came in through small hole cover with oil paper or bladder unabl to see anyth pass without door yet thi must have been the case with the most sumptuou palac befor the invent of windowglass which wa a good deal later than that of bottl and drinkingglass har i think lookingglass are veri beauti tut they are inde veri eleg piec of furnitur and veri costli too the art of cast glass into larg plate big enough to reach almost from the bottom to the top of a room is but late introduc into thi countri from franc but the most splendid and brilliant manner of employ glass is in lustr and chandeli hung around with drop cut so as to reflect the light with all the colour of the rainbow some of the shop in london fill with these articl appear to realiz all the wonder of an enchant palac in the arabian night entertain geo but are not spectacl and spyingglass more use than all these tut i did not mean to pass them over i assur you by the curiou invent of optic glass of variou kind not onli the natur defect of the sight have been remedi and old age ha been in some measur lighten of one of it calam but the sens of see ha been wonder extend the telescop ha brought distant object within our view while the microscop ha given us a clear survey of near object too minut for our unassist eye by mean of both some of the brightest discoveri of the modern time have been made so that glass ha prove not less admir in promot scienc than in contribut to splendour and conveni well—i dont know that i have anyth more at present to say rel to the class of earth we have gone through the princip circumst belong to their three great divis the calcar argillac and silic you will rememb howev that most of the earth and stone offer by natur are not in ani one of these kind perfectli pure but contain a mixtur of one or both the other there is not a pebbl that you can pick up which would not exercis the skill of a mineralogist fulli to ascertain it properti and the materi of it composit so inexhaust is natur illustr the nativ villag p even xxiii show and use or the two present one morn lord richmor come down to breakfast wa welcom with the tide that hi favourit mare miss slim had brought a foal and also that a sheass kept for hi ladi use as a milker had drop a young one hi lordship smile at the inequ of the present natur had made him as for the foal said he to the groom that you know ha been long promis to my neighbour mr scamper for young balaam you may dispos of him as you pleas the groom thank hi lordship and said he would then give him to isaac the woodman in due time miss slim foal which wa the son of a note racer wa taken to squir scamper who receiv him with great delight and out of compliment to the donor name him young peer he wa brought up with at least as much care and tender as the squir own children—kept in a warm stabl fed with the best of corn and hay duli dress and regularli exercis as he grew up he gave token of great beauti hi colour wa bright bay with a white star on hi forehead hi coat wa fine and shone like silk and everi point about him seem to promis perfect of shape and make everybodi admir him as the completest colt that could be seen so fine a creatur could not be destin to ani use employ after he had pass hi third year he wa sent to newmarket to be train for the turf and a groom wa appoint to the care of him alon hi master who could not well afford the expens save part of it by turn off a domest tutor whom he kept for the educ of hi son and wa content with send them to the curat of the parish at four year old young peer start for a subscript purs and came in second out of a number of competitor soon after he won a countri plate and fill hi master with joy and triumph the squir now turn all hi attent to the turf made match bet high and wa at first toler success at length have ventur all the money he could rais upon one grand match young peer ran on the wrong side of the post wa distanc and the squir ruin meantim young balaam went into isaac possess where he had a veri differ train he wa left to pick up hi live as he could in the lane and common and on the coldest day in winter he had no other shelter than the leesid of the cottag out of which he wa often glad to pluck the thatch for a subsist as soon as ever he wa abl to bear a rider isaac children got upon him sometim two or three at onc and if he did not go to their mind a broomstick or bunch of furz wa freeli appli to hi hide nevertheless he grew up as the children themselv did strong and healthi and though he wa rather bare on the rib hi shape wa good and hi limb vigor it wa not long befor hi master thought of put him to some use so take him to the wood he fasten a load of fagot on hi back and sent him with hi son tom to the next town tom sold the fagot and mount upon balaam rode him home as isaac could get plenti of fagot and chip he found it a profit trade to send them for daili sale upon balaam back have a littl garden which from the barren of the soil yield him noth of valu he bethought him of load balaam back from town with dung for manur though all he could bring at onc wa contain in two small pannier yet thi in time amount to enough to mend the soil of hi whole garden so that he grew veri good cabbag and potato to the great relief of hi famili isaac be now sensibl of the valu of hi ass began to treat him with more attent he got a small stack of rushi hay for hi winter fodder and with hi own hand built him a littl shed of bough and mud in order to

made a reput figur isaac took in more land from the wast so that by degre he becam a littl farmer and kept a hors and cart a cow and two or three pig thi made him quit a rich man but he had alway the gratitud to imput hi prosper to the good servic of balaam the groom present while the squir curs young peer as the caus of hi ruin and mani a time wish that hi lordship had kept hi dainti gift to himself the cruciformflow plant tutor—george—harri georg how rich yon field look with it yellow flower i wonder what they can be tutor suppos you go and see if you can find it out and bring a stalk of the flower with you geo return i know now—they are turnip tut i thought you could make it out when you came near them these turnip are left to seed which is the reason whi you see them run to flower commonli they are pull up sooner harri i should not have thought a turnip had so sweet a flower geo i think i have smelt other like them pray sir what class of plant do they belong to tut to a veri numer one with which it is worth your while to get acquaint let us sit down and examin them the petal you observ consist of four flat leav set opposit to each other or crosswis from thi circumst the flower have been call cruciform as most plant with flower of thi kind bear their seed in pod they have likewis been call the siliquos plant siliqua be the latin for a pod geo but the papilionac flower bear pod too tut true and therefor the name is not a good one now pull off the petal one by one you see they are fasten by long claw within the flower cup now count the chive har there are six geo but they are not all of the same length—two are much shorter than the rest tut well observ it is from thi that linnæu ha form a particular class for the whole tribe which he call tetradynamia a word impli four power or the power of four as if the four longer chive were more perfect and efficaci than the two shorter which howev we do not know to be the case thi superior length of four chive is conspicu in most plant of thi tribe but not in all they have howev other resembl which are suffici to constitut them a natur famili and accordingli all botanist have made them such the flower as i have said have in all of them four petal place crosswis the calyx also consist of four oblong and hollow leav there is a singl pistil stand upon a seedbud which turn either into a long pod or a short round one call a pouch and henc are form the two great branch of the famili the pod and the pouch the seedvessel ha two valv or extern open with a partit between the seed are small and roundish attach altern to both sutur or join of the valv do you observ all these circumst geo and har we do tut you shall examin them more minut in a larger plant of the kind further almost all these plant have somewhat of a bite tast and also a disagre smell in their leav especi when decay a turnipfield you know smell but indiffer and cabbag which is one of thi class is apt to be remark offens har ye there is noth wors than rotten cabbageleav geo and the veri water in which they are boil is enough to scent a whole hous tut the flower howev of almost all the famili are fragrant and some remark so what do you think of wallflow and stock har what are they of thi kind tut yes—and so is candytuft and rocket har then they are not to be despis tut no—and especi as not one of the whole class i believ is poison but on the contrari mani of them afford good food for man and beast shall i tell you about the princip of them geo pray do sir tut the pungenc of tast which so mani of them possess ha caus them to be use for salad herb thu we have cress watercress and mustard to which might be ad mani more which grow wild as ladysmock wildrocket hedgemustard and jackbythehedg or saucealon mustard you know is also greatli use for it seed the powder or flower of which made into a sort of past with salt and water is eaten with mani kind of meat rapese are veri similar to them and from both an oil is press out of the mild or tasteless kind as it is likewis from colese anoth product of thi class scurvygrass which is a pungent plant of thi famili grow by the seasid ha obtain it name from be a remedi for the scurvi then there is horseradish with the root of which i am sure you are well acquaint as a companion to roast beef common radish too is a plant of thi kind which ha a good deal of pungenc one sort of it ha a root like a turnip which bring it near in qualiti to the turnip itself thi last plant though afford a sweet and mild nutriment ha natur a degre of pungenc and rank geo that i suppos is the reason whi turnipi milk and butter have such a strong tast tut it is har then whi do they feed cow with it tut in thi case as in mani other qualiti is sacrif to quantiti but the better use of the turnip to the farmer is to fatten sheep and cattl by it assist he is enabl to keep mani more of these anim than he could find grass or hay for and the cultur of turnip prepar hi land for grain as well or better than could be done by let it lie quit fallow turnip husbandri as it is call is one of the capit modern improv of agricultur geo i think i have heard that norfolk is famou for it tut it is so that counti abound in light sandi land which are peculiarli suitabl to turnip but they are now grown in mani part of england besid well—but we must say someth more about cabbag an articl of food of veri long stand the origin speci of thi is a seasid plant but cultiv ha produc a great number of varieti well known in our garden as white and red cabbag kale colewort brocoli borecol and cauliflow har but the flower of cauliflow doe not seem at all like that of cabbag or turnip tut the white head call it flower is not properli so but consist of a cluster of imperfect bud if they are left to grow for seed they throw out some spike of yellow flower like common cabbag brocoli head are of the same kind as to the head of white or red cabbag it consist of a vast number of leav close round each other by which the innermost are prevent from expand and remain white on account of the exclus of the light and air thi part you know is most valu for food in some countri they cut cabbagehead into quarter and make them undergo a kind of acid ferment after which they are salt and preserv for winter food under the name of sourkrout geo cattl too are sometim fed with cabbag i believ tut ye and larg field of them are cultiv for that purpos they succeed best in stiff clayey soil where they sometim grow to an enorm big they are given to milch kine as well as to fatten cattl geo do not they give a bad tast to the milk tut they are apt to do so unless great care is taken to pick off all the decay leav colewort which are a smaller sort of cabbag are sometim grown for feed sheep and cattl i think i have now mention most of the use plant of thi famili which you see are numer and import they both yield beef and mutton and the sauc to them but mani of the speci are troublesom weed you see how yonder corn is overrun with yellow flower geo ye they are as thick as if they had been sown tut they are of thi famili and call charlock or wild mustard or corn kale which inde are not all exactli the same thing though nearli resembl these produc such plenti of seed that it is veri difficult to clear a field of them if onc they are suffer to grow till the seed ripen an extrem common weed in garden and by roadsid is shepherdspurs which is a veri good specimen of the pouchbear plant of thi tribe it seedvessel be exactli the figur of a heart ladysmock is often so abund a weed in wet meadow as to make them all over white with their flower some call thi plant cuckooflow becaus it flower is about the same time with the first appear of that bird in spring geo i rememb some pretti line in a song about spring in which ladysmock is mentioned— when daisi pie and violet blue and ladysmock all silver white and cuckoobud of yellow hue do paint the meadow with delight tut they are shakspear you see he give the name of cuckoobud to some other flower a yellow one which appear at the same season but still earlier than thi time wall and hedgebank are enliven by a veri small white flower call whitlowgrass which is one of the tribe har is it easi to distinguish the plant of thi famili from one anoth tut not veri easi for the gener similar of the flower is so great that littl distinct can be drawn from them the mark of the speci are chiefli taken from the form and manner of growth of the seedvessel and we will examin some of them by the descript in a book of botani there is one veri remark seedvessel which probabl you have observ in the garden it is a perfectli round larg flat pouch which after it ha shed it seed remain on the stalk and look like a thin white bladder the plant bear it is commonli call honesti har o i know it veri well it is put into winter flowerpot tut true so much then for the tetradynam or cruciformflow plant you can not well mistak them for ani other class if you remark the six chive four of them gener but not alway longer than the two other the singl pistil chang either into a long pod or a round pouch contain the seed the four opposit petal of the flower and four leav of the calyx you may safe make a salad of the young leav wherev you find them the worst they can do to you is to bite your tongu the nativ village—a drama scene—a scatter

landlord bet my dear fanny—daught i may now call you—you can not think how much i feel oblig to you thom but who is so much oblig as i am fan do you not all deserv everyth from me john well who could have thought when i went to help up the wagon that it would have brought so much good luck to us bet a good deed is never lost they say fan it shall be the busi of my life to prove that thi ha not been lost on emblem pray papa said cecilia what is an emblem i have met with the word in my lesson today and i do not quit understand it an emblem my dear repli he is a visibl imag of an invis thing cecilia a visibl imag of—i can hardli comprehend— pa well i will explain it more at length there are certain notion that we form in our mind without the help of our eye or ani of our sens thu virtu vice honour disgrac time death and the like are not sensibl object but idea of the understand cec yes—w can not feel them or see them but we can think about them pa true now it sometim happen that we wish to repres one of these in a visibl form that is to offer someth to the sight that shall rais a similar notion in the mind of the behold in order to do thi we must take some action or circumst belong to it capabl of be express by paint or sculptur and thi is call a type or emblem cec but how can thi be done pa i will tell you by an exampl you know the sessionshous where trial are held it would be easi to write over the door in order to distinguish it thi is the sessionshous but it is a more ingeni and eleg way of point it out to place upon the build a figur repres the purpos for which it wa erect name to distribut justic for thi end the notion of justic is to be personifi that is chang from an idea of the understand into one of the sight a human figur is therefor made distinguish by token which bear a relat to the charact of that virtu justic care weigh both side of a caus she is therefor repres as hold a pair of scale it is her offic to punish crime she therefor bear a sword thi is then an emblemat figur and the sword and scale are emblem cec i understand thi veri well but whi is she blindfold pa to denot her impartiality—that she decid onli from the merit of the case and not from a view of the parti cec how can she weigh anyth though when her eye are blind pa well object these are two inconsist emblem each proper in itself but when use togeth make a contradictori action an artist of judgment will therefor drop one of them and accordingli the best modern figur of justic have the balanc and sword without the bandag over the eye cec is there not the same fault in make cupid blindfold and yet put a bow and arrow into hi hand pa there is it is a gross absurd and not countenanc by the ancient descript of cupid who is repres as the surest of all archer cec i have a figur of death in my fablebook i suppos that is emblemat pa certainli or you could not know that it meant death how is it repres cec he is noth but bone and he hold a scyth in one hand and an hourglass in the other pa well—how do you interpret these emblem cec i suppos he is all bone becaus noth but bone are left after a dead bodi ha lain long in the grave pa true thi howev is not so properli an emblem as the real and visibl effect of death but the scyth cec is not that becaus death mow down everyth pa it is no instrument could so properli repres the widewast sway of death which sweep down the race of anim like flower fall under the hand of the mower it is a simil use in the scriptur cec the hourglass i suppos is to show peopl their time is come pa right in the hourglass that death hold all the sand is run out from the upper to the lower part have you never observ upon a monument an old figur with wing and a scyth and with hi head bald all but a singl lock befor cec o yes—and i have been told it is time pa well—and what do you make of it whi is he old cec o becaus he ha last a long while pa and whi ha he wing cec becaus time is swift and fli away pa what doe hi scyth mean cec i suppos it is becaus he destroy and cut down everyth like death pa true i think howev a weapon rather slower in oper as a pickax would have been more suitabl to the gradual action of time but what is hi singl lock of hair for cec i have been think and can not make it out pa i thought that would puzzl you it relat to time as give opportun for do anyth it is to be seiz as it present itself or it will escap and can not be recov thu the proverb say take time by the forelock well—now you understand what emblem are cec ye i think i do i suppos the paint sugarloav over the grocer shop and the mortar over the apothecari are emblem too pa not so properli they are onli the pictur of thing which are themselv the object of sight as the real sugarloaf in the shop of the grocer and the real mortar in that of the apothecari howev an implement belong to a particular rank or profess is commonli use as an emblem to point out the man exercis that rank or profess thu a crown is consid as an emblem of a king a sword or spear of a soldier an anchor of a sailor and the like cec i rememb captain heartwel when he came to see us had the figur of an anchor on all hi button pa he had that wa the emblem or badg of hi belong to the navi cec but you told me that an emblem wa a visibl sign of an invis thing yet a seacaptain is not an invis thing pa he is not invis as a man but hi profess is invis cec i do not well understand that pa profess is a qualiti belong equal to a number of individu howev differ they may be in extern form and appear it may be ad or taken away without ani visibl chang thu if captain heartwel were to give up hi commiss he would appear to you the same man as befor it is plain therefor that what in that case he had lost name hi profess wa a thing invis it is one of those idea of the understand which i befor mention to you as differ from a sensibl idea cec i comprehend it now pa i have got here a few emblemat pictur suppos you tri whether you can find out their mean cec o yes—i shall like that veri well pa here is a man stand on the summit of a steep cliff and go to ascend a ladder which he ha plant against a cloud cec let me see—that must be ambit i think pa how do you explain it cec he is got veri high alreadi but he want to be still higher so he ventur up the ladder though it is onli support by a cloud and hang over a precipic pa veri right here is now anoth man hoodwink who is cross a rage torrent upon steppingston cec then he will certainli fall in i suppos he is one that run into danger without consid whither he is go pa ye and you may call him foolhardi do you see thi hand come out of a black cloud and put an extinguish upon a lamp cec i do if that lamp be the lamp of life the hand that extinguish it must be death pa veri just here is an old halfruin build support by prop and the figur of time is saw through one of the prop cec that must be old age sure pa it is the next is a man lean upon a break crutch cec i dont well know what to make of that pa it is intend for instabl howev it might also stand for fals confid here is a man pore over a sundial with a candl in hi hand cec i am at a loss for that too pa consider—a sundial is onli made to tell the hour by the light of the sun cec then thi man must know noth about it pa true and hi name is therefor ignor here is a walkingstick the lower part of which is set in the water and it appear crook what doe that denot cec is the stick realli crook pa no but it is the properti of water to give that appear cec then it must signifi decept pa it doe i dare say you will at onc know thi fellow who is run as fast as hi leg will carri him and look back at hi shadow cec he must be fear or terror i fanci pa ye you may call him which you pleas but who is thi sower that scatter seed in the ground cec let me consid i think there is a parabl in the bibl about seed sown and it therefor signifi someth like instruct pa true but it may also repres hope for no one sow without hope to reap the fruit what do you think of thi candl held befor a mirror in which it figur is exactli reflect cec i do not know what it mean pa it repres truth the essenc of which consist in the fidel with which object are receiv and reflect back by our mind the object is here a lumin one to show the clear and bright of truth here is next an upright column the perfect straight of which is shown by a plumblin hang from it summit and exactli parallel to the side of the column cec i suppos that must repres upright pa yes—or in other word rectitud the strength and stabil of the pillar alon denot the secur produc by thi virtu you see here a woman disentangl and reel off a veri perplex skein of thread cec she must have a great deal of patienc pa true she is patienc herself the brood hen sit besid her is anoth emblem of the same qualiti that aid the interpret who do you think thi pleas femal is that look with such kind upon the droop plant she is water cec that must be chariti i believ pa it is or you may call her benign which is nearli the same thing here is a ladi sit demur with one finger on her lip while she hold a bridl in her other hand cec the finger on the lip i suppos denot silenc the bridl must mean confin i should almost fanci her to be a schoolmistress pa ha ha i hope inde mani schoolmistress are endu with her spirit for she is prudenc or discret well—w are now got to the end of our pictur and upon the whole you have interpret them veri prettili cec but i have one question to ask you papa in these pictur and other that i have seen of the same sort almost all the good qualiti are repres in the form of women what is the reason of that pa it is certainli a compliment my dear either to your sex person or mind the inventor either chose the figur of a femal to cloth each agreeabl qualiti in becaus he thought that the most agreeabl form and therefor best suit it or he meant to impli that the femal charact is realli the most virtuou and amiabl i rather believ that the first wa hi intent but i shall not object to your take it in the light of the second cec but is it true—i it true pa whi i can give you veri good author for the prefer of the femal sex in a moral view one ledyard a great travel who had walk through almost all the countri of europ and at last die in an expedit to explor the intern part of africa gave a most decis and pleas testimoni in favour of the superior charact of women whether savag or civil i wa so much pleas with it that i put great part of it into vers and if it will not make you vain i will give you a copi of

the follow relation— the and in south america are the highest ridg of mountain in the known world there is a road over them on which about halfway between the summit and the foot is a hous of entertain where it is common for travel in their ascent and descent to meet the differ of their feel upon the same spot is veri remark those who are descend the mountain are melt with heat so that they can scarc bear ani cloth upon them while those who are ascend shiver with cold and wrap themselv up in the warmest garment they have how strang thi is cri william what can be the reason of it it is repli hi father a strike instanc of the power of habit over the bodi the cold is so intens on the top of these mountain that it is as much as travel can do to keep themselv from be frozen to death their bodi therefor becom so habitu to the sensat of cold that everi diminut of it as they descend seem to them a degre of actual heat and when they are got halfway down they feel as if they were quit in a sultri climat on the other hand the valley at the foot of the mountain are so excess hot that the bodi becom relax and sensibl to the slightest degre of cold so that when a travel ascend from them toward the hill the middl region appear quit inclement from their cold and doe the same thing rejoin william alway happen in cross high mountain it doe return hi father in a degre proport to their height and the time taken in cross them inde a short time is suffici to produc similar effect let one boy have been play at roll snowbal and anoth have been roast himself befor a great fire and let them meet in the porch of the house—if you ask them how they feel i will answer for it you will find them as differ in their account as the travel on the and but thi is onli one exampl of the oper of a univers principl belong to human natur for the power of habit is the same thing whatev be the circumst which call it forth whether relat to the mind or the bodi you may consid the stori you have been read as a sort of simil or parabl the central station on the mountain may be compar to middl life with what differ feel is thi regard by those who bask in the sunshin of opul and those who shrink under the cold blast of penuri suppos the wealthi duke our neighbour were suddenli oblig to descend to our level and live as we do—to part with all hi carriag sell hi coachhors and hunter quit hi nobl seat with it fine park and garden dismiss all hi train of servant except two or three and take a hous like our what a dread fall it would seem to him how wretch it would probabl make him and how much would he be piti by the world on the other hand suppos the labour who live in the next cottag were unexpectedli to fall heir to an estat of a few hundr a year and in consequ to get around him all the comfort and conveni that we possess—a commodi hous to inhabit good cloth to wear plenti of wholesom food and fire servant to do all the drudgeri of the famili and the like—how all hi acquaint would congratul him and what a paradis would he seem to himself to be got into yet he and the duke and ourselv are equal men made liabl by natur to the same desir and necess and perhap all equal strong in constitut and equal capabl of support hardship is not thi fulli as wonder a differ in feel as that on cross the and inde it is said william and the caus of it must be exactli the same—th influenc of habit i think so of what import then must it be toward a happi life to regul our habit so that in the possibl chang of thi world we may be more like to be gainer than loser but how can thi be done would it be right for the duke to live like us or us like the labour certainli not but to appli the case to person of our middl condit i would have us use our advantag in such a frugal manner as to make them as littl as possibl essenti to our happi should fortun sink us to a lower station for as to the chanc of rise to a higher there is no need to prepar our habit for that—w should readili enough accommod our feel to such a chang to be pleas and satisfi with simpl food to accustom ourselv not to shrink from the inclem of the seasons—to avoid indol and take delight in some use employ of the mind or bodi to do as much as we can for ourselv and not expect to be wait upon on everi small occasion—thes are the habit which will make us in some measur independ of fortun and secur us a moder degre of enjoy under everi chang short of absolut want i will tell you a stori to thi purpos a london merchant had two son jame and richard jame from a boy accustom himself to everi indulg in hi power and when he grew up wa quit a fine gentleman he dress expens frequent public divers kept hi hunter at a liveri stabl and wa a member of sever convivi club at home it wa almost a footman sole busi to wait on him he would have thought it greatli beneath him to buckl hi own shoe and if he want anyth at the other end of the room he would ring the bell and bring the servant up two pair of stair rather than rise from hi chair to fetch it he did a littl busi in the countinghous on forenoon but devot all hi time after dinner to indol and amus richard wa a differ charact he wa plain in hi appear and domest in hi way of life he gave as littl troubl as possibl and would have been asham to ask assist in do what he could easili do for himself he wa assidu in busi and employ hi leisur hour chiefli in read and acquir use knowledg both were still young and unsettl when their father die leav behind him a veri trifl properti as the young men had not capit suffici to follow the same line of mercantil busi in which he had been engag they were oblig to look out for a new plan of mainten and a great reduct of expens wa the first thing requisit thi wa a sever stroke to jame who found himself at onc cut off from all the pleasur and indulg to which he wa so habitu that he thought life of no valu without them he grew melancholi and deject hazard all hi littl properti in lotteri ticket and wa quit beggar still unabl to think of retriev himself by industri and frugal he accept a commiss in a newrais regiment order for the west indi where soon after hi arriv he caught a fever and die richard in the meantim whose comfort were littl impair by hi chang of situat preserv hi cheer and found no difficulti in accommod himself to hi fortun he engag himself as a clerk in a hous hi father had been connect with and live as frugal as possibl upon hi salari it furnish him with decent board lodg and cloth which wa all he requir and hi hour of leisur were nearli as mani as befor a book or a sober friend alway suffic to procur him an agreeabl even he gradual rose in the confid of hi employ who increas from time to time hi salari and emolu everi increas wa a sourc of gratif to him becaus he wa abl to enjoy pleasur which howev habit had not made necessari to hi comfort in process of time he wa enabl to settl for himself and pass through life in the enjoy of that modest compet which best suit hi disposit the cost of a war you may rememb oswald said mr b to hi son that i gave you some time ago a notion of the price of a victori to the poor soul engag in it i shall not soon forget it i assur you sir repli oswald father veri well i mean now to give you some idea of the cost of a war to the peopl among whom it is carri on thi may serv to abat someth of the admir with which historian are to apt to inspir us for great warrior and conqueror you have heard i doubt not of loui the fourteenth king of franc oswald oh ye fa he wa entitl by hi subject loui le grand and wa compar by them to the cesar and alexand of antiqu and with some justic as to the extent of hi power and the use he made of it he wa the most potent princ of hi time command mighti and victori armi and enlarg the limit of hi hereditari dominion loui wa not natur a hardheart man but have been taught from hi cradl that everyth ought to give way to the interest of hi glori and that thi glori consist in domin over hi neighbour and make conquest he grew to be insens to all the miseri brought on hi own and other peopl in pursuit of thi nobl design as he thought it moreov he wa plung in dissolut pleasur and the delight of pomp and splendour from hi youth and he wa ever surround by a tribe of abject flatter who made him believ that he had a full right in all case to do as he pleas conquest abroad and pleasur at home were therefor the chief busi of hi life one even hi minist louvoi came to him and said sire it is absolut necessari to make a desert of the palatin thi is a countri in germani on the bank of the rhine one of the most popul and bestcultiv district in that empir fill with town and villag and industri inhabit i should be sorri to do it repli the king for you know how much odium we acquir throughout europ when a part of it wa laid wast sometim ago under marshal turenn it can not be help sire return louvoi all the damag he did ha been repair and the countri is as flourish as ever if we leav it in it present state it will afford quarter to your majesti enemi and endang your conquest it must be entir ruined—th good of the servic will not permit it to be otherwis well then answer loui if it must be so you are to give order accordingli so say he left the cabinet and went to assist a magnific festiv given in honour of hi favourit mistress by a princ of the blood the pitiless louvoi lost no time but despatch a courier that veri night with posit order to the french gener in the palatin to carri fire and desol through the whole country—not to leav a hous or a tree standing—and to expel all the inhabit it wa the midst of a rigor winter os o horribl but sure the gener would not obey such order fa what a gener disobey the command of hi sovereign—that would be contrari to everi maxim of the trade right and wrong are no consider to a militari man he is onli to do as he is bid the french gener who were upon the spot and must see with their own eye all that wa done probabl felt somewhat like men on the occas but the sacrific to their duti as soldier wa so much the greater the command were peremptori and they were obey to a tittl town and villag were burnt to the ground vineyard and orchard were cut down and root up sheep and cattl were kill all the fair work of age were destroy in a moment and the smile face of cultur wa turn to a dreari wast the poor inhabit were driven from their warm and comfort habit into the open field to confront all the inclem of the season their furnitur wa burnt or pillag and noth wa left them but the cloth on their back and the few necessari they could carri with them the road were cover with trembl fugit go they knew not whither shiver with cold and pinch with hunger here an old man drop with fatigu lay down to die—ther a woman with a newborn infant sunk perish on the snow while her husband hung over them in all the horror of despair os o what a scene poor creatur what becam of them at last fa such of them as did not perish on the road got to the neighbour town where they were receiv with all the hospit that such calamit time would afford but they were beggar for life meantim their countri for mani a leagu round display no other sight than that of black smoke ruin in the midst of silenc and desol os i hope howev that such thing do not often happen in war fa not often perhap to the same extent but in some degre they must take place in everi war a villag which would afford a favour post to the enemi is alway burnt without hesit a countri which can no longer be maintain is clear of all it provis and forag befor it is abandon lest the enemi should have the advantag of them and the poor inhabit are left to subsist as they can crop of corn are trampl down by armi in their march or devour while green as fodder for their hors pillag robberi and murder are alway go on in the outskirt of the bestdisciplin camp then consid what must happen in everi sieg on the first approach of the enemi all the build in the suburb of a town are demolish and all the tree in garden and public walk are cut down lest they should afford shelter to the besieg as the sieg goe on bomb hot ball and cannonshot are continu fli about by which the greatest part of a town is ruin or laid in ash and mani of the innoc peopl kill or maim if the resist is obstin famin and pestil are sure to take place and if the garrison hold out to the last and the town is taken by storm it is gener given up to be pillag by the enrag and licenti soldieri it would be easi to bring too mani exampl of cruelti exercis upon a conquer countri even in veri late time when war is said to be carri on with so much human but inde how can it be otherwis the art of war is essenti that of destruct and it is imposs there should be a mild and merci way of murder and ruin one fellowcreatur soldier as men are often human but war must ever be cruel though homer ha fill hi iliad with the exploit of fight hero yet he make jupit address mar the god of war in term of the utmost abhorrence— of all the god who tread the spangl sky thou most unjust most odiou in our eye in human discord is thi dire delight the wast of slaughter and the rage of fight no bound no law thi fieri temper quells—pop os sure as war is so bad a thing there might be some way of prevent it fa ala i fear mankind have been too long accustom to it and it is too agreeabl to their bad passion easili to be laid asid whatev miseri it may bring upon them but in the meantim let us correct our own idea of the matter and no longer lavish admir upon such a pest of the human race as a conqueror how brilliant soever hi qualiti may be nor ever think that a profess which bind a man to be the servil instrument of cruelti and injustic is an honour call illustr the gain of a loss p even xxviii great men i will show you a great man said mr c one day to hi son at the time the duke of bridgewat canal wa make he accordingli took him to a place where sever workmen were employ in rais a prodigi mound on the top of which the canal wa to be carri across a deep valley in the midst of them wa a veri plaindress man awkward in hi gestur uncouth in hi appear and rather heavi in hi

great mr brindley what cri arthur in surpris is that a great man mr c ye a veri great man whi are you surpris ar i dont know but i should have expect a great man to have look veri differ mr c it matter littl how a man look if he can perform great thing that person without ani advantag of educ ha becom by the forc of hi own geniu the first engin of the age he is do thing that were never done or even thought of in thi countri befor he pierc hill make bridg over valley and aqueduct across navig river and in short is like to chang the whole face of the countri and to introduc improv the valu of which can not be calcul when at a loss how to bring about ani of hi design he doe not go to other peopl for assist but he consult the wonder faculti of hi own mind and find a way to overcom hi difficulti he look like a rustic it is true but he ha a soul of the first order such as is not grant to one out of million of the human race ar but are all men of extraordinari abil properli great men mr c the word ha been various use but i would call everi one a great man who doe great thing by mean of hi own power great abil are often employ about trifl or indol wast without ani consider exert at all to make a great man the object pursu should be larg and import and vigour and persever should be employ in the pursuit ar all the great men i rememb to have read about were king or gener or prime

what a great man wa suppos we now talk a littl about wise men with all my heart sir repli arthur mr c a wise man then is he who pursu the best end by the properest mean but as thi definit may be rather too abstract to give you a clear comprehens of the thing i shall open it to you by exampl what do you think is the best end a man can pursu in life ar i suppos to make himself happi mr c true and as we are so constitut that we can not be happi ourselv without make other happi the best end of live is to produc as much gener happi as lie in our power ar but that is good is it not mr c it is and therefor wisdom includ good the wise man alway intend what is good and employ skill or judgment in attain it if he were to pursu the best thing weakli he could not be wise ani more than if he were to pursu bad or indiffer thing judici one of the wisest men i know is our neighbour mr freeland ar what the justic mr c ye few men have succeed more perfectli in secur their own happi and promot that of those around them born to a compet estat he earli settl upon it and began to improv it he reduc all hi expens within hi incom and indulg no tast that could lead him into excess of ani kind at the

the confid of the poor and the goodwil of both ar but i have heard some peopl reckon old harpi as wise a man as he mr c it is a great abus of word to call harpi a wise man he is of anoth species—a cun man—who is to a wise man what an ape is to a human creature—a bad and contempt resembl ar he is veri clever though is he not mr c harpi ha a good natur understand a clear head and a cool temper but hi onli end in life ha been to rais a fortun by base and dishonest mean be thoroughli acquaint with all the trick and artific of the law he employ hi knowledg to take undu advantag of all who intrust him

deceiv himself the most and ha prove himself as much a fool in the end he ha pursu as a knave in the mean ar are not men of great learn and knowledg wise men mr c they are so if that knowledg and learn are employ to make them happier and more use but it too often happen that their specul are of a kind neither benefici to themselv nor to other and they often neglect to regul their temper while they improv their understand some men of great learn have been the most arrog and quarrelsom of mortal and as foolish and absurd in their conduct as the most untaught of their speci ar but are not a philosoph and a wise man the same thing mr c a philosoph is properli a lover of wisdom and if he search after it with a right disposit he will probabl find it often than other men but he must practis as well as know in order to be truli wise ar i have read of the seven wise men of greec what were they mr c they were men distinguish for their knowledg and talent and some of them for their virtu too but wiser than them all wa socrat whose chief prais it wa that he turn philosophi from vain and fruitless disput to the regul of life and manner and that he wa himself a great exampl of the wisdom he taught ar have we had ani person late veri remark for wisdom mr c in my opinion few wiser men have ever exist than the late dr franklin the american from the low station of journeymanprint to the elev one of ambassador plenipotentiari from hi countri to the court of franc he alway distinguish himself by sagac in discov and good sens in practis what wa most benefici to himself and other he wa a great natur philosoph and made some veri brilliant discoveri but it wa ever hi favourit purpos to turn everyth to use and to extract some practic advantag from hi specul he thoroughli understood common life and all that conduc to it comfort and he ha left behind him treasur of domest wisdom superior perhap to ani of the boast maxim of antiqu he never let slip ani opportun of improv hi

captain that it is no wors for though i much disapprov of improp match yet young girl may fall into still greater evil and where there is no crime there can be no irrepar disgrac but who wa the man and what did my brother say to it—whi sir i can not say but it wa partli my father own fault for he took a sort of like to the young man who wa a drawingmast employ in the famili and would not forbid him the hous after we had inform him of the danger of an attach between amelia and him so when it wa too late he fell into a violent passion about it which had no other effect than to drive the girl directli into her lover arm they marri and soon fell into difficulti my father of cours would do noth for them and when he die he not onli disinherit her but made us promis no longer to look upon her

the southern lu i see them pa now the sun which illumin all the part of thi globe by turn as they roll round befor it shine directli upon the equat but dart it ray aslant toward the pole and thi is the caus of the great heat perceiv in the middl region of the earth and of it gradual diminut as you proceed from them on either side toward the extrem to use a familiar illustr it is like a piec of

here is the mighti empir of china swarm with peopl to such a degre that notwithstand it size and fertil the inhabit are oblig to exert the greatest industri to procur the necessari of life nearli in a line with it are the mogul empir the kingdom of persia and the turkish dominion in asia all warm climat abound in product of use and beauti and inhabit by numer and civil peopl here stretch out the great peninsula of arabia for the most part a dri and desert land overspread with burn sand onli to be cross by the patient camel wild and feroci tribe of men wander over it chiefli support by their herd and flock and by the trade of robberi which they exercis on all travel that fall in their way a tract somewhat similar though in a colder climat is the vast countri of tartari stretch like a belt from east to west across the middl of asia over the immens plain and desert of which a number of independ tribe continu roam fix their moveabl habit in one part or anoth accord as they afford pasturag to their herd of cattl and hors these men have for mani age live in the same simpl state unacquaint as well with the art as the vice of civil nation lu well i think it must be a veri pleasant life to rambl about from place to place and chang one abod accord to the season pa the tartar think so for the worst wish they can find for man is that he may live in a hous and work like a russian now look at europ see what a small figur it make on the surfac of the globe as to size and yet it ha for mani age held the first place in knowledg activ civil and all the qualiti that elev man among hi fellow for thi it is much indebt to that temperatur of climat which call forth all the faculti of man in order to render life comfort yet afford enough of the beauti of natur to warm the heart and exalt the imagin men here earn their bread with the sweat of their brow natur doe not drop her fruit into their mouth but offer them as the price of labour human want are mani cloth food lodg are all object of much care and contriv but the human power fulli exert are equal to the demand and nowher are enjoy so variou and multipli what the land doe not yield itself it inhabit by their activ industri procur from the remotest part of the globe when we drink tea we sweeten the infus of a chines herb with the juic of a west indian cane and your common dress is compos of materi collect from the equat to the frigid zone european render all countri and climat familiar to them and everywher they assum a superior over the less enlighten or less industri nativ lu then europ for me after all but is not america as good pa that part of north america which ha been settl by european is onli anoth europ in manner and civil but the origin inhabit of that extens countri were bold and hardi barbarian and mani of them continu so to thi day so much for the temper zone which contain the prime of mankind they differ extrem howev in govern law custom and religion the christian religion ha the credit of reckon among it votari all the civil peopl of europ and america the mahometan possess all the nearer part of asia and the north of africa but china japan and most of the circumjac countri profess differ form of pagan the east in gener is enslav to despot but the nobler west enjoy in most of it state more or less of freedom as to the frigid zone it few inhabit can but just sustain a life littl better than that of the brute their faculti are benumb by the climat their chief employ is the fisheri or the chase by which they procur their food the tend of herd of raindeer in some part vari their occup and diet they pass their long winter in hole dug underground where they doze out most of their time in stupid repos lu i wonder ani peopl should stay in such miser place pa yet none of the inhabit of the globe seem more attach to their countri and way of life nor do they inde want power to render their situat toler comfort their cano and fish and hunt tackl are made with great ingenu and their cloth is admir adapt to fenc against the rigour of cold they are not without some amus to cheer the gloom of their condit but they are abjectli superstiti and given to fear and melancholi lu if i had my choic i would rather go to a warmer than a colder countri pa perhap the warmer countri are pleasant but there are few advantag which are not balanc by some inconveni and it is the truest wisdom to be content with our lot and endeavour to make the best of it one great lesson howev i wish you to deriv from thi globelectur you see that no part of the world is void of our human brethren who amid all the divers of charact and condit are yet all men fill the station in which their creator ha place them we are too apt to look at the differ of mankind and to undervalu all those who do not agre with us in matter that we think of high import but who are we—and what caus have we to think ourselv right and all other wrong can we imagin that hundr of million of our speci in other part of the world are left destitut of what is essenti to their wellb while a favour few like ourselv are the onli one who possess it have all a common natur we must necessarili agre in more thing than we differ in the

enter with hi whole soul into the career of improvement—wa first and last of all the scholar in the designingroom—and devot to practic at home those hour which the other youth pass in amus it wa long befor he could pleas himself with ani of the attempt and he wa continu repeat over them ala how far distant is thi from guidotto at length howev he had the satisfact of becom sensibl of progress and

or the shipwreck it wa a dread storm the wind blow full on the seashor roll tremend wave on the beach while the halfsunk rock at the entranc of the bay were envelop in a mist of white foam a ship appear in the of drive impetu under her bare pole to land now tilt aloft on the surg wave now plung into the interven hollow present she rush among the rock and there struck the billow beat over her deck and climb up her shatter rig merci merci exclaim an ancient solitari as he view from the cliff the dismal scene it wa in vain the ship fell on her side and wa seen no more soon howev a small dark object appear come from the rock toward the shore at first dimli descri through the foam then quit plain as it rode on the summit of a wave then for a time total lost it approach and show itself to be a boat with men in it row for their live the solitari hasten down to the beach and in all the agon vicissitud of hope and fear watch it advanc at length after the most immin hazard the boat wa thrown violent on the shore and the drip halfdead marin crawl out on dri land heaven be prais cri the solitari what a providenti escap and he led the poor men to hi cell where kindl a good fire and bring out hi littl store of provis he restor them to health and spirit and are you six men the onli one saved—that we are answer one of them threescor and fifteen men women and children were in the ship when she struck you may think what a clamour and confus there were women cling to their husband neck and children hang about their cloth all shriek cri and pray there wa no time to be lost we got out the smallboat in a twinkling—jump in without stay for our captain who wa fool enough to be mind the passengers—cut the rope and push away just time enough to be clear of the ship as she went down and here we are all aliv and merri an oath conclud hi speech the solitari wa shock and could not help secretli wish that it had pleas provid to have save some of the innoc passeng rather than these reprob the sailor have got what they could depart scarc thank their benefactor and march up the countri night came on they descri a light at some distanc and made up to it it proceed from the window of a goodlook hous surround with a farmyard and garden they knock at the door and in a supplic tone made known their distress and beg relief they were admit and treat with compass and hospit in the hous were the mistress her children and womenserv an old man and a boy the master wa abroad the sailor sit round the kitchen fire whisper to each other that here wa an opportun of make a booti that would ampli compens for the loss of cloth and wage they settl their plan and on the old man come with log to the fire one of them broke hi scull with the poker and laid him dead anoth took up a knife which had been brought with the loaf and chees and run after the boy who wa make hi escap out of the hous stab him to the heart the rest lock the door and after tie all the women and children began to ransack the hous one of the children continu to make loud exclam a fellow went and strangl it they had nearli finish pack up such of the most valuabl thing as they could carri off when the master of the hous came home he wa a smuggler as well as a farmer and had just return from an expedit leav hi companion with their good at a neighbour publichous surpris at find the door lock and see light move about in the chamber he suspect someth amiss and upon listen he heard strang voic and saw some of the sailor through the window he hasten back to hi companion and brought them with him just as the robber open the door and were come out with their pillag have first set fire to the hous in order to conceal what they had done the smuggler and hi friend let fli their blunderbuss in the midst of them and then rush forward seiz the survivor and secur them perceiv flame in the hous they ran and extinguish them the villain were next day led to prison amid the curs of the neighbourhood the good solitari on hear of the event at first exclaim what a wonder interfer of provid to punish guilt and protect innoc paus awhil he ad yet had provid thought fit to have drown these sailor in their passag from the ship where they left so mani better peopl to perish the live of three innoc person would have been save and these wretch would have die without such accumul guilt and ignomini on the other hand had the master of the hous been at home instead of follow a lawless and desper trade he would perhap have perish with all hi famili and the villain have escap with their booti what am i to think of all thi thu pensiv and perplex he laid him down to rest and after some time spent in gloomi reflect fell asleep in hi dream he fanci himself seat on the top of a high mountain where he wa accost by a vener figur in a long white garment who ask him the caus of the melancholi express on hi counten it is said he becaus i am unabl to reconcil the decre of provid with my idea of wisdom and justice—that repli the stranger is probabl becaus thi notion of provid are narrow and erron thou seekest it in particular event and dost not rais thi survey to the great whole everi occurr in the univers is providenti becaus it is the consequ of those law which divin wisdom ha establish as most product of the gener good but to select individu fact as more direct by the hand of provid than other becaus we think we see a particular good purpos answer by them is an infal inlet to error and superstit follow me to the edg of the cliff he seem to follow now look down said the stranger and tell me what thou seest i see repli the solitari a hawk dart amid a flock of small bird one of which he ha caught while the other escape—and canst thou think rejoin the stranger that the singl bird made a prey of by the hawk lie under ani particular doom of provid or that those who fli away are more the object of divin favour than it hawk by natur were made to feed upon live prey and were endow with strength and swift to enabl them to overtak and master it thu life is sacrif to the support of life but to thi destruct limit are set the small bird are much more numer and prolif than the bird of prey and though they can not resist hi forc they have dexter and nimbl of flight suffici in gener to elud hi pursuit it is in thi balanc that the wisdom of provid is seen and what can be a greater proof of it than that both speci the destroy and hi prey have subsist togeth from their first creation now look again and tell me what thou seest i see said the solitari a thick black cloud gather in the sky i hear the thunder roll from side to side of the vault of heaven i behold the red lightn dart from the bosom of dark now it ha fallen on a state tree and shatter it to piec strike to the ground an ox shelter at it foot now it fall again in the midst of a flock of timor sheep and sever of them are left on the plain—and see the shepherd himself lie extend by their side now it strike a lofti spire and at the same time set in a blaze an humbl cottag beneath it is an aw and terribl sight it is so return the stranger but what dost thou conclud from it dost thou not know that from the genial heat which give life to plant and anim and ripen the fruit of the earth proce thi electr fire which ascend to the cloud and charg them beyond what they are abl to contain is launch again in burn bolt to the earth must it leav it direct cours to strike the tree rather than the dome of worship or to spend it furi on the herd rather than the herdsman million and million of live creatur have owe their birth to thi activ element and shall we think it strang if a few meet their death from it thu the mountain torrent that rush down to fertil the plain in it cours may sweep away the work of human industri and man himself with them but could it benefit be purchas at anoth price all thi said the solitari i toler comprehend but may i presum to ask whenc have proceed the moral evil of the pain scene of yesterday what good end is answer by make man the scourg of man and preserv the guilti at the cost of the innoc that too repli the vener stranger is a consequ of the same wise law of provid if it wa right to make man a creatur of habit and render those thing easi to him with which he is most familiar the sailor of cours must be better abl to shift for himself in a shipwreck than the passeng while that selflov which is essenti to the preserv of life must in gener caus him to consult hi own safeti befor that of other the same forc of habit in a way of life full of peril and hardship must conduc to form a rough bold and unfeel charact thi under the direct of principl will make a brave man without it a robber and a murder in the latter case human law step in to remov the evil which they have not been abl to prevent wicked meet with the fate which sooner or later alway await it and innoc though it occasion suffer is prove in the end to be the surest path to happi but resum the solitari can it be said that the lot of innoc is alway prefer to that of guilt in thi world if it can not repli the other thinkest thou that the almighti is unabl to make retribut in a futur world dismiss then from thi mind the care of singl event secur that the great whole is order for the best expect not a particular interposit of heaven becaus such an interposit would seem to thee
