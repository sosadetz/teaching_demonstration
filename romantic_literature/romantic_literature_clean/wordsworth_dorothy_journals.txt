cover with wood we pass some fine tree and paus under the shade of one close by an old mansion that seem from it neglect state to be inhabit by farmer but i must say that mani of the gentlemen hous which we have pass in scotland have an air of neglect and even of desol it wa a beech in the full glori of complet and perfect growth veri tall with one thick stem mount to a consider height which wa split into four thigh as coleridg afterward call them each in size a fine tree pass anoth mansion now tenant by a schoolmast mani boy play upon the lawn i can not take leav of the countri which we

have been built to stamp a charact of insol pride on hi own huge mansion of drumlanrigg which is full in view on the opposit side of the nith thi mansion is inde veri larg but to us it appear like a gather togeth of littl thing the roof is broken into a hundr piec cupola etc in the shape of caster conjuror ball cup and the like the situat would be nobl if the wood had been left stand but they have been cut down not long ago and the hill abov and below the hous are quit bare about a mile and a half from drumlanrigg is a turnpik gate at the top of a hill we left our car with the man and turn asid into a field where we look down upon the nith which run far below in a deep and rocki channel the bank woodi the view pleasant down the river toward thornhil an open countrycorn field pastur and scatter tree return to the turnpik hous a cold spot upon a common black cattl feed close to the door our road led us down the hill to the side of the nith and we travel along it bank for some mile

or heathi abov we were to have given our hors meal and water at a publichous in one of the hamlet we pass through but miss the hous for as is common in scotland it wa without a signboard travel on still besid the nith till we came to a turnpik hous which stood rather high on the hillsid and from the door we look a long way up and down the river the air coldish the wind strong we ask the turnpik man to let us have some meal and water he had no meal but luckili we had part of a feed of corn brought from keswick and he procur some hay at a neighbour hous in the meantim i went into the hous where wa an old man with a grey plaid over hi shoulder read a newspap on the shelf lay a volum of the scotch encyclopædia a histori of england and some other book the old man wa a caller by the way the man of the hous came back and we began to talk he wa veri intellig had travel all over england scotland and ireland as a gentleman servant and now live alon in that lonesom place he said he wa

or drink in the hous but oat bread and cheeseth chees wa made with the addit of seedsand some skim milk he gave us of hi bread and chees and milk which prove to be sour we had yet ten or eleven mile to travel and no food with us william lay under the wind in a cornfield below the hous be not well enough to partak of the milk and bread coleridg gave our host a pamphlet the crisi of the sugar coloni he wa well acquaint with burnss poem there wa a polit and a manli freedom in thi man manner which pleas me veri much he told us that he had serv a gentleman a captain in the armyh did not know

himself wa veri fond of eat of the spoilunusu with true heartandsoul sportsmen the man gave us an account of hi farm where he had live which wa so cheap and pleasant that we thought we should have like to have had it ourselv soon after leav the turnpik hous we turn up a hill to the right the road for a littl way veri steep bare hill with sheep after ascend a littl while we heard the murmur of a stream far below us and saw it flow downward on our left toward the nith and befor us between steep green hill come along a wind valley the simplic of the prospect impress us veri much there wa a singl cottag by the brook side the dell wa not heathi but it wa imposs not to think of peter bell highland girl we now felt inde that we were in scotland there wa a natur peculiar in thi place in the scene of the nith it had not been the same as england but yet not simpl nake scotland the road led us down the hill and now there wa no room in the vale but for the river and the road we had sometim the stream to the right sometim to the left the hill were pastor but we did not see mani sheep green smooth turf on the left no fern on the right the heathplant grew in abund of the most exquisit colour it cover a whole hillsid or it wa in stream and patch we travel along the vale without appear to ascend for some mile all the reach were beauti in exquisit proport the hill seem veri high from be so near to us it might have seem a valley which natur had kept to herself for pensiv thought and tender feel but that we were remind at everi turn of the road of someth beyond by the coalcart which were travel toward us though these cart broke in upon the tranquil of the glen they ad much to the picturesqu effect of the differ view which inde want noth though perfectli bare houseless and treeless after some time our road took us upward toward the end of the valley now the steep were heathi all around just as we began to climb the hill we saw three boy who came down the cleft of a brow on our left one carri a fishingrod and the hat of all were braid with honeysuckl they ran after one anoth as wanton as the wind i can not express what a charact of beauti those few honeysuckl in the hat of the three boy gave to the place what bower could they have come from we walk up the hill met two welldress travel the woman barefoot our littl lad befor they had gone far were join by some halfdozen of their companion all without shoe and stock they told us they live at wanlockhead the villag abov point to the top of the hill they went to school and learn latin virgil and some of them greek homer but when coleridg began to inquir further off they ran poor thing i suppos afraid of be examin when after a steep ascent we had reach the top of the hill we saw a villag about half a mile befor us on the side of anoth hill which rose up abov the spot where we were after a descent a sort of valley or hollow noth grew upon thi ground or the hill abov or below but heather yet round about the villagewhich consist of a great number of hut all alik and all thatch with a few larger slate hous among them and a singl modernbuilt one of a consider sizewer a hundr patch of cultiv ground potato oat hay and grass we were struck with the sight of haycock fasten down with apron sheet piec of sackinga we suppos to prevent the wind from blow them away we afterward found that thi practic wa veri gener in scotland everi cottag seem to have it littl plot of ground fenc by a ridg of earth thi plot contain two or three differ divis kail potato oat hay the hous all stand in line or never far apart the cultiv ground wa all togeth also and made a veri strang appear with it mani green among the dark brown hill neither tree nor shrub grow yet the grass and the potato look greener than elsewher owe to the bare of the neighbour hill it wa inde a wild and singular spotto use a woman illustr like a collect of patchwork made of piec as they might have chanc to have been cut by the mantuamak onli just smooth to fit each other the differ sort of produc be in such a multitud of plot and those so small and of such irregular shape add to the strang of the villag itself that we had been climb upward though gentli for mani mile and for the last mile and a half up a steep ascent and did not know of ani villag till we saw the boy who had come out to play the air wa veri cold and one could not help think what it must be in winter when those hill now red brown should have their three month cover of snow the villag as we guess is inhabit by miner the mine belong to the duke of queensberri the road to the villag down which the lad scamper away wa straight forward i must mention that we met just after we had part from them anoth littl fellow about six year old carri a bundl over hi shoulder he seem poor and half starv and wa scratch hi finger which were cover with the itch he wa a miner son and live at wanlockhead did not go to school but thi wa probabl on account of hi youth i mention him becaus he seem to be a proof that there wa poverti and wretched among these peopl though we saw no other symptom of it and afterward we met score of the inhabit of thi same villag our road turn to the right and we saw at the distanc of less than a mile a tall upright build of grey stone with sever men stand upon the roof as if they were look out over battlement it stood beyond the villag upon higher ground as if presid over ita kind of enchant castl which it might have been a place where don quixot would have glori in when we drew nearer we saw come out of the side of the build a larg machin or lever in appear like a great forgehamm as we suppos for rais water out of the mine it heav upward onc in half a minut with a slow motion and seem to rest to take breath at the bottom it motion be accompani with a sound between a groan and jike there would have been someth in thi object veri strike in ani place as it wa imposs not to invest the machin with some faculti of intellect it seem to have made the first step from brute matter to life and purpos show it progress by great power william made a remark to thi effect and coleridg observ that it wa like a giant with one idea at all event the object produc a strike effect in that place where everyth wa in unison with itparticularli the build itself which wa turretshap and with the figur upon it resembl much one of the fortress in the wooden cut of bunyan holi war after ascend a consider way we began to descend again and now we met a team of hors drag an immens tree to the lead mine to repair or add to the build and present after we came to a cart with anoth larg tree and one hors left in it right in the middl of the highway we were a littl out of humour think we must wait till the team came back there were men and boy without number all stare at us after a littl consult they set their shoulder to the cart and with a good heav all at onc they move it and we pass along these peopl were decent dress and their manner decent there wa no hoot or impud laughter leadhil anoth mine villag wa the place of our destin for the night and soon after we had pass the cart we came in sight of it thi villag and the mine belong to lord hopetoun it ha more stone hous than wanlockhead one larg old mansion and a consider number of old treesbeech i believ the tree told of the cold of the climat they were more brown than greenfar browner than the ripe grass of the littl haygarth here as at wanlockhead were haycock haystack potatob and kailgarth in everi possibl varieti of shape but i suppos from the irregular of the ground it look far less artificialinde i should think that a painter might make sever beauti pictur in thi villag it straggl down both side of a mountain glen as i have said there is a larg mansion there is also a stone build that look like a school and the hous are singl or in cluster or row as it may chanc we pass a decentlook inn the hopetoun arm but the hous of mr otto a widow had been recommend to us with high encomium we did not then understand scotch inn and were not quit satisfi at first with our accommod but all thing were smooth over by degre we had a fire light in our dirti parlour tea came after a reason wait and the fire with the gentl aid of twilight burnish up the room into cheer comfort coleridg wa weari but william and i walk out after tea we talk with one of the miner who inform us that the build which we had suppos to be a school wa a librari belong to the villag he said they had got a book into it a few week ago which had cost thirti pound and that they had all sort of book what have you shakespear ye we have that and we found on further inquiri that they had a larg librari of long stand that lord hopetoun had subscrib liber to it and that gentlemen who came with him were in the habit of make larger or smaller donat each man who had the benefit of it paid a small sum monthlyi think about fourpenc the man we talk with spoke much of the comfort and quiet in which they live one among anoth he made use of a notic express say that they were veri peaceabl peopl consid they live so much undergroundwag were about thirti pound a year they had land for potato warm hous plenti of coal and onli six hour work each day so that they had leisur for read if they chose he said the place wa healthi that the inhabit live to a great age and inde we saw no appear of illhealth in their counten but it is not common for peopl work in lead mine to be healthi and i have sinc heard that it is not a healthi place howev thi may be they are unwil to allow it for the landladi the next morn when i said to her you have a cold climat repli ay but it is varra halesom we inquir of the man respect the larg mansion he told us that it wa built as we might see in the form of an h and belong to the hopetoun and they took their titl from thenc and that part of it wa use as a chapel we went close to it and were a good deal amus with the build itself stand forth in bold contradict of the stori which i daresay everi man of leadhil tell and everi man believ that it is in the shape of an h it is but half an h and one must be veri accommod to allow it even so much for the leg are far too short footnot there is some mistak here the hopetoun titl wa not taken from ani place in the leadhil much less from the hous shape like an hj c s we visit the buryingground a plot of land not veri small crowd with grave and upright graveston overlook the villag and the dell it wa now the close in of even women and children were gather in the linen for the night which wa bleach by the burnsideth grave overgrown with grass such as by industri cultur had been rais up about the hous but there were bunch of heather here and there and with the bluebel that grew among the grass the small plot of ground had a beauti and wild appear william left me and i went to a shop to purchas some thread the woman had none that suit me but she would send a wee lad to the other shop in the meantim i sat with the mother and wa much pleas with her manner and convers she had an excel fire and her cottag though veri small look comfort and cleanli but rememb i saw it onli by firelight she confirm what the man had told us of the quiet manner in which they live and inde her hous and firesid seem to need noth to make it a cheer happi spot but health and good humour there wa a bookish a certain formal in thi woman languag which wa veri remark she had a dark complexion dark eye and wore a veri white cap much over her face which gave her the look of a french woman and inde afterward the women on the road frequent remind us of french women partli from the extrem white cap of the elder women and still more perhap from a certain gaieti and partycolour appear in their dress in gener white bedgown are veri common and you rare meet a young girl with either hat or cap they buckl up their hair often in a grace manner i return to the inn and went into the kitchen to speak with the landladi she had made a hundr hesit when i told her we want three bed at last she confess she had three bed and show me into a parlour which look damp and cold but she assur me in a tone that show she wa unwil to be question further that all her bed were well air i sat a while by the kitchen fire with the landladi and began to talk to her but much as i had heard in her praisefor the shopkeep had told me she wa a varra discreet womani can not say that her manner pleas me much but her servant made amend for she wa as pleasant and cheer a lass as wa ever seen and when we ask her to do anyth she answer oh ye with a merri smile and almost ran to get us what we want she wa about sixteen year old wore shoe and stock and had her hair tuck up with a comb the servant at brownhil wa a coarselook wench barefoot and bareleg i examin the kitchen round about it wa crowd with furnitur drawer cupboard dishcov pictur pan and pot arrang without order except that the plate were on shelv and the dishcov hung in row these were veri clean but floor passag staircas everyth els dirti there were two bed in recess in the wall abov one of them i notic a shelf with some booksit made me think of chaucer clerk of oxenford liever had he at hi bed head twenti book cloth in black and red they were bake oatbread which they cut into quarter and halfbak over the fire and halftoast befor it there wa a suspici about mr otto almost like illnatur she wa veri jealou of ani inquiri that might appear to be made with the faintest idea of a comparison between leadhil and ani other place except the advantag wa evid on the side of leadhil we had nice honey to breakfast when readi to depart we learn that we might have seen the librari which we had not thought of till it wa too late and we were veri sorri to go away without see it saturday august thleft leadhil at nine oclock regret much that we could not stay anoth day that we might have made more minut inquiri respect the manner of live of the miner and been abl to form an estim from our own observ of the degre of knowledg health and comfort that there wa among them the air wa keen and cold we might have suppos it to be three month later in the season and two hour earlier in the day the landladi had not light us a fire so i wa oblig to get myself toast in the kitchen and when we set off i put on both grey cloak and spencer our road carri us down the valley and we soon lost sight of leadhil for the valley made a turn almost immedi and we saw two mile perhap befor us the glen slope somewhat rapidlyheathi bare no hut or hous pass by a shepherd who wa sit upon the ground read with the book on hi knee screen from the wind by hi plaid while a flock of sheep were feed near him among the rush and coars grassfor as we descend we came among land where grass grew with the heather travel through sever reach of the glen which somewhat resembl the valley of menock on the other side of wanlockhead but it wa not near so beauti the form of the mountain did not melt so exquisit into each other and there wa a cold and if i may so speak a want of simplic in the surfac of the earth the heather wa poor not cover a whole hillsid not in luxuri stream and bed intervein with rich verdur but patchi and stunt with here and there coars grass and rush but we soon came in sight of a spot that impress us veri much at the lower end of thi new reach of the vale wa a decay tree besid a decay cottag the vale spread out into a level area which wa one larg field without fenc and without divis of a dull yellow colour the vale seem to partak of the desol of the cottag and to particip in it decay and yet the spot wa in it natur so dreari that one would rather have wonder how it ever came to be tenant by man than lament that it wa left to wast and solitud yet the encircl hill were so exquisit form that it wa imposs to conceiv anyth more love than thi place would have been if the valley and hillsid had been interspers with tree cottag green field and hedgerow but all wa desol the one larg field which fill up the area of the valley appear as i have said in decay and seem to retain the memori of it connexion with man in some way analog to the ruin build for it wa as much of a field as mr king best pastur scatter over with hi fattest cattl we went on look befor us the place lose noth of it hold upon our mind when we discov a woman sit right in the middl of the field alon wrap up in a grey cloak or plaid she sat motionless all the time we look at her which might be nearli half an hour we could not conceiv whi she sat there for there were neither sheep nor cattl in the field her appear wa veri melancholi in the meantim our road carri us nearer to the cottag though we were cross over the hill to the left leav the valley below us and we perceiv that a part of the build wa inhabit and that what we had suppos to be one blast tree wa eight tree four of which were entir blast the other partli so and round about the place wa a littl potato and cabbag garth fenc with earth no doubt that woman had been an inhabit of the cottag howev thi might be there wa so much obscur and uncertainti about her and her figur agre so well with the desol of the place that we were indebt to the chanc of her be there for some of the most interest feel that we had ever had from natur object connect with man in dreari solitari we had been advis to go along the new road which would have carri us down the vale but we met some travel who recommend us to climb the hill and go by the villag of crawfordjohn as be much nearer we had a long hill and after have reach the top steep and bad road so we continu to walk for a consider way the air wa cold and clearth sky blue we walk cheer along in the sunshin each of us alon onli william had the charg of the hors and car so he sometim took a ride which did but poorli recompens him for the troubl of drive i never travel with more cheer spirit than thi day our road wa along the side of a high moor i can alway walk over a moor with a light foot i seem to be drawn more close to natur in such place than anywher els or rather i feel more strongli the power of natur over me and am better satisfi with myself for be abl to find enjoy in what unfortun to mani person is either dismal or insipid thi moor howev wa more than commonli interest we could see a long way and on everi side of us were larger or smaller tract of cultiv land some were extens farm yet in so larg a wast they did but look small with farmhous barn etc other like littl cottag with enough to feed a cow and suppli the famili with veget in look at these farm we had alway one feel whi did the plough stop there whi might not they as well have carri it twice as far there were no hedgerow near the farm and veri few tree as we were pass along we saw an old man the first we had seen in a highland bonnet walk with a staff at a veri slow pace by the edg of one of the moorland cornfield he wore a grey plaid and a dog wa by hi side there wa a scriptur solemn in thi man figur a sober simplic which wa most impress scotland is the countri abov all other that i have seen in which a man of imagin may carv out hi own pleasur there are so mani inhabit solitud and the employ of the peopl are so immedi connect with the place where you find them and their dress so simpl so much alik yet from their be fold garment admit of an endless varieti and fall often so grace after some time we descend toward a broad vale pass one farmhous shelter by fir tree with a burn close to it children play linen bleach the vale wa open pastur and cornfield unfenc the land poor the villag of crawfordjohn on the slope of a hill a long way befor us to the left ask about our road of a man who wa drive a cart he told us to go through the villag then along some field and we should come to a herd hous by the burn side the highway wa right through the vale unfenc on either side the peopl of the villag who were make hay all stare at us and our carriag we inquir the road of a middleag man dress in a shabbi black coat at work in one of the hay field he look like the minist of the place and when he spoke we felt assur that he wa so for he wa not spare of hard word which howev he use with great proprieti and he spoke like one who had been accustom to dictat our car want mend in the wheel and we ask him if there wa a blacksmith in the villag ye he repli but when we show him the wheel he told william that he might mend it himself without a blacksmith and he would put him in the way so he fetch hammer and nail and gave hi direct which william obey and repair the damag entir to hi own satisfact and the priest who did not offer to lend ani assist himself not as if he would not have been will in case of need but as if it were more natur for him to dictat and becaus he thought it more fit that william should do it himself he spoke much about the proprieti of everi man lend all the assist in hi power to travel and with some ostent of selfprais here i observ a honeysuckl and some flower grow in a garden the first i had seen in scotland it is a pretti cheerfullook villag but must be veri cold in winter it stand on a hillsid and the vale itself is veri high ground unshelt by tree left the villag behind us and our road led through arabl ground for a consider way on which were grow veri good crop of corn and potato our friend accompani us to show us the way and coleridg and he had a scientif convers concern the use and properti of lime and other manur he seem to be a wellinform man somewhat pedant in hi manner but thi might be onli the differ between scotch and english footnot probabl the rev john aird minist of the parish j c s soon after he had part from us we came upon a stoni rough road over a black moor and present to the herd hous by the burn side we could hardli cross the burn dryshod over which wa the onli road to the cottag in england there would have been steppingston or a bridg but the scotch need not be afraid of wet their bare feet the hut had it littl kailgarth fenc with earth there wa no other enclosurebut the common heathi with coars grass travel along the common for some mile befor we join the great road from longtown to glasgowsaw on the bare hillsid at a distanc sometim a solitari farm now and then a plantat and one veri larg wood with an appear of richer ground abov but it wa so veri high we could not think it possibl have descend consider the common wa no longer of a peatmossi brown heath colour but grass with rush wa it chief produc there wa sometim a solitari hut no enclosur except the kailgarth and sheep pastur in flock with shepherdboy tend them i rememb one boy in particular he had no hat on and onli had a grey plaid wrap about him it is noth to describ but on a bare moor alon with hi sheep stand as he did in utter quiet and silenc there wa someth uncommonli impress in hi appear a solemn which recal to our mind the old man in the cornfield we pass mani peopl who were mow or rake the grass of the common it wa littl better than rush but they did not mow straight forward onli here and there where it wa the best in such a place haycock had an uncommon appear to us after a long descent we came to some plantat which were not far from dougla mill the countri for some time had been grow into cultiv and now it wa a wide vale with larg tract of corn tree in clump no hedgerow which alway make a countri look bare and unlov for my part i wa better pleas with the desert place we had left behind though no doubt the inhabit of thi place think it a varra bonni spot for the scotch are alway pleas with their own abod be it what it may and afterward at edinburgh when we were talk with a booksel of our travel he observ that it wa a fine countri near dougla mill dougla mill is a singl hous a larg inn be one of the regular stage between longtown and glasgow and therefor a fair specimen of the best of the countri inn of scotland as soon as our car stop at the door we felt the differ at an english inn of thi size a waiter or the master or mistress would have been at the door immedi but we remain some time befor anybodi came then a barefoot lass made her appear but she onli look at us and went away the mistress a remark handsom woman show us into a larg parlour we order muttonchop and i finish my letter to mari write on the same windowledg on which william had written to me two year befor after dinner william and i sat by a littl millrac in the garden we had left leadhil and wanlockhead far abov us and now were come into a warmer climat but there wa no rich in the face of the countri the shrub look cold and poor and yet there were some veri fine tree within a littl distanc of dougla mill so that the reason perhap whi the few low shrub and tree which were grow in the garden seem to be so unluxuri might be that there be no hedgerow the gener appear of the countri wa nake and i could not help see the same cold where perhap it did not exist in itself to ani great degre for the corn crop are abund and i should think the soil is not bad while we were sit at the door two of the landladi children came out the elder a boy about six year old wa run away from hi littl brother in petticoat the ostler call out sandi tak your wee brither wi you anoth voic from the window sawni dinna leav your wee brither the mother then came alexand tak your wee brother by the hand alexand obey and the two went off in peac togeth we were charg eightpenc for hay at thi inn anoth symptom of our be in scotland left dougla mill at about three oclock travel through an open corn countri the tract of corn larg and unenclos we often pass women or children who were watch a singl cow while it fed upon the slip of grass between the corn william ask a strong woman about thirti year of age who look like the mistress of a familyi suppos move by some sentiment of compass for her be so employedif the cow would eat the corn if it were left to itself she smile at hi simplic it is inde a melancholi thing to see a fullgrown woman thu wait as it were bodi and soul devot to the poor beast yet even thi is better than work in a manufactori the day through we came to a moorish tract saw befor us the hill of loch lomond ben lomond and anoth distinct each by itself not far from the roadsid were some bench place in row in the middl of a larg field with a sort of cover shed like a sentrybox but much more like those box which the italian puppetshowmen in london use we guess that it wa a pulpit or tent for preach and were told that a sect met there occasion who held that toler wa unscriptur and would have all religion but their own extermin i have forgotten what name the man gave to thi sect we could not learn that it differ in ani other respect from the church of scotland travel for some mile along the open countri which wa all without hedgerow sometim arabl sometim moorish and often whole tract cover with grunsel there wa one field which one might have believ had been sown with grunsel it wa so regularli cover with ita larg squar field upon a slope it boundari mark to our eye onli by the termin of the bright yellow contigu to it were other field of the same size and shape one of clover the other of potato all equal regular crop the odd of thi appear the grunsel be uncommonli luxuri and the field as yellow as gold made william laugh coleridg wa melancholi upon it observ that there wa land enough wast to rear a healthi child footnot ragweedj c s we left behind us consider to the right a singl high mountain i have forgotten it name we had had it long in view saw befor us the river clyde it cours at right angl to our road which now made a turn run parallel with the river the town of lanerk in sight long befor we came to it i wa somewhat disappoint with the first view of the clyde the bank though swell and vari had a poverti in their appear chiefli from the want of wood and hedgerow cross the river and ascend toward lanerk which stand upon a hill when we were within about a mile of the town william part from coleridg and me to go to the celebr waterfal coleridg did not attempt to drive the hors but led him all the way we inquir for the best inn and were told that the new inn wa the best but that they had veri genteel apart at the black bull and made less charg and the black bull wa at the entranc of the town so we thought we would stop there as the hors wa obstin and weari but when we came to the black bull we had no wish to enter the apart for it seem the abod of dirt and poverti yet it wa a larg build the town show a sort of french face and would have done much more had it not been for the true british ting of coalsmok the door and window dirti the shop dull the women too seem to be veri dirti in their dress the town itself is not ugli the hous are of grey stone the street not veri narrow and the marketplac decent the new inn is a handsom old stone build formerli a gentleman hous we were conduct into a parlour where peopl had been drink the tabl were unwip chair in disord the floor dirti and the smell of liquor wa most offens we were tire howev and rejoic in our tea footnot tintoj c s the even sun wa now send a gloriou light through the street which ran from west to east the hous were of a fire red and the face of the peopl as they walk westward were almost like a blacksmith when he is at work by night i long to be out and meet with william that we might see the fall befor the day wa gone poor coleridg wa unwel and could not go i inquir my road and a littl girl told me she would go with me to the porter lodg where i might be admit i wa griev to hear that the fall of the clyde were shut up in a gentleman ground and to be view onli by mean of lock and key much howev as the pure feel with which one would desir to visit such place is disturb by useless impertin or even unnecessari interfer with natur yet when i wa there the next morn i seem to feel it a less disagre thing than in smaller and more delic spot if i may use the phrase my guid a sensibl littl girl answer my inquiri veri prettili she wa eight year old read in the collect a book which all the scotch children whom i have question read in i found it wa a collect of hymn she could repeat sever of dr watt we pass through a great part of the town then turn down a steep hill and came in view of a long rang of cotton mill the largest and loftiest i had ever seen climb upward again our road lead us along the top of the left bank of the river both bank veri steep and richli wood the girl left me at the porter lodg have ask after william i wa told that no person had been there or could enter but by the gate the night wa come on therefor i did not ventur to go in as i had no hope of meet william i had a delici walk alon through the wood the sound of the water wa veri solemn and even the cotton mill in the fade light of even had somewhat of the majesti and still of the natur object it wa nearli dark when i reach the inn i found coleridg sit by a good fire which alway make an inn room look comfort in a few minut william arriv he had heard of me at the gate and follow as quickli as he could shout after me he wa pale and exceedingli tire footnot new lanark robert owen millsj c s after he had left us he had taken a wrong road and while look about to set himself right had met with a barefoot boy who said he would go with him the littl fellow carri him by a wild path to the upper of the fall the boniton linn and come down unexpectedli upon it he wa exceedingli affect by the solemn grandeur of the place thi fall is not much admir or spoken of by travel you have never a full breast view of it it doe not make a complet selfsatisfi place an abod of it own as a perfect waterfal seem to me to do but the river down which you look through a long vista of steep and ruinlik rock the roar of the waterfal and the solemn even light must have been most impress one of the rock on the near bank even in broad daylight as we saw it the next morn is exactli like the fractur arch of an abbey with the light and shadow of even upon it the resembl must have been much more strike william guid wa a pretti boy and he wa exceedingli pleas with him just as they were quit the waterfal william mind be full of the majesti of the scene the littl fellow point to the top of a rock there a fine slaebush there ay said william but there are no slae upon it which wa true enough but i suppos the child rememb the slae of anoth summer though as he said he wa but half seven year old name six and a half he conduct william to the other fall and as they were go along a narrow path they came to a small cavern where william lost him and look about saw hi pretti figur in a sort of natur nich fit for a statu from which the boy jump out laugh delight with the success of hi trick william told us a great deal about him while he sat by the fire and of the pleasur of hi walk often repeat i wish you had been with me have no chang he gave the boy sixpenc which wa certainli if he had form ani expect at all far beyond them but he receiv it with the utmost indiffer without ani remark of surpris or pleasur most like he did not know how mani halfpenc he could get for it and twopenc would have pleas him more my littl girl wa delight with the sixpenc i gave her and said she would buy a book with it on monday morn what a differ between the manner of live and educ of boy and of girl among the lower class of peopl in town she had never seen the fall of the clyde nor had ever been further than the porter lodg the boy i daresay knew everi hidingplac in everi access rock as well as the fine slae bush and the nut tree second week sunday august stthe morn wa veri hot a morn to tempt us to linger by the watersid i wish to have had the day befor us expect so much from what william had seen but when we went there i did not desir to stay longer than till the hour which we had prescrib to ourselv for it wa a rule not to be broken in upon that the person who conduct us to the fall wa to remain by our side till we chose to depart we left our inn immedi after breakfast the lane were full of peopl go to church mani of the middleag women wore long scarlet cardin and were without hat they brought to my mind the women of goslar as they use to go to church in their silver or gold cap with their long cloak black or colour the bank of the clyde from lanerk to the fall rise immedi from the river they are lofti and steep and cover with wood the road to the fall is along the top of one of the bank and to the left you have a prospect of the open countri corn field and scatter hous to the right over the river the countri spread out as it were into a plain cover over with hill no one hill much higher than anoth but hill all over there were endless pastur overgrown with broom and scatter tree without hedg or fenc of ani kind and no distinct footpath it wa delight to see the lass in gay dress run like cattl among the broom make their way straight forward toward the river here and there as it might chanc they wade across the stream and when they had reach the top of the opposit bank sat down by the roadsid about half a mile from the town to put on their shoe and cotton stock which they brought tie up in pockethandkerchief the porter lodg is about a mile from lanerk and the ladi housefor the whole belong to a ladi whose name i have forgotteni upon a hill at a littl distanc we walk after we had enter the privat ground perhap two hundr yard along a gravel carriageroad then came to a littl side gate which open upon a narrow gravel path under tree and in a minut and a half or less were directli opposit to the great waterfal i wa much affect by the first view of it the majesti and strength of the water for i had never befor seen so larg a cataract struck me with astonish which die away give place to more delight feel though there were some build that i could have wish had not been there though at first unnot the chief of them wa a neat white ladylik hous veri near to the waterfal william and coleridg howev were in a better and perhap wiser humour and did not dislik the hous inde it wa a veri nicelook place with a moderates garden leav the green field free and open thi hous is on the side of the river opposit to the grand hous and the pleasureground the waterfal cora linn is compos of two fall with a slope space which appear to be about twenti yard between but is much more the basin which receiv the fall is enclos by nobl rock with tree chiefli hazel birch and ash grow out of their side whenev there is ani hold for them and a magnific restingplac it is for such a river i think more grand than the fall themselv footnot ladi mari rossj c s footnot corehousej c s after have stay some time we return by the same footpath into the main carriageroad and soon came upon what william call an ellwid gravel walk from which we had differ view of the linn we sat upon a bench place for the sake of one of these view whenc we look down upon the waterfal and over the open countri and saw a ruin tower call wallac tower which stand at a veri littl distanc from the fall and is an interest object a ladi and gentleman more expediti tourist than ourselv came to the spot they left us at the seat and we found them again at anoth station abov the fall coleridg who is alway goodnatur enough to enter into convers with anybodi whom he meet in hi way began to talk with the gentleman who observ that it wa a majest waterfal coleridg wa delight with the accuraci of the epithet particularli as he had been settl in hi own mind the precis mean of the word grand majest sublim etc and had discuss the subject with william at some length the day befor ye sir say coleridg it is a majest waterfal sublim and beauti repli hi friend poor coleridg could make no answer and not veri desir to continu the convers came to us and relat the stori laugh heartili the distanc from one linn to the other may be half a mile or more along the same ellwid walk we came to a pleasurehous of which the littl girl had the key she said it wa call the foghous becaus it wa line with fog name moss on the outsid it resembl some of the hut in the print belong to captain cook voyag and within wa like a haystack scoop out it wa circular with a domelik roof a seat all round fix to the wall and a tabl in the middleseat wall roof and tabl all cover with moss in the neatest manner possibl it wa as snug as a bird nest i wish we had such a one at the top of our orchard onli a great deal smaller we afterward found that hut of the same kind were common in the pleasureground of scotland but we never saw ani that were so beauti wrought as thi it had howev littl els to recommend it the situat be chosen without judgment there wa no prospect from it nor wa it a place of seclus and retir for it stood close to the ellwid gravel walk we wish we could have shove it about a hundr yard further on when we arriv at a bench which wa also close to the walk for just below the bench the walk elbow out into a circl there wa a beauti spring of clear water which we could see rise up continu at the bottom of a round stone basin full to the brim the water gush out at a littl outlet and pass away under the walk a reason wa want for place the hut where it is what a good one would thi littl spring have furnish for bring it hither along the whole of the path were open at interv for view of the river but as almost alway happen in gentlemen ground they were injudici manag you were prepar for a dead standbi a parapet a paint seat or some other devic we stay some time at the boniton fall which ha one great advantag over the other fall that it is at the termin of the pleasureground and we see no trace of the boundarylin yet except under some accident circumst such as a sunset like that of the preced even it is greatli inferior to the cora linn we return to the inn to dinner the landlord set the first dish upon the tabl as is common in england and we were well wait upon thi first dish wa true scottisha boil sheep head with the hair sing off coleridg and i ate heartili of it we had barley broth in which the sheep head had been boil a parti of tourist whom we had met in the pleasureground drove from the door while we were wait for dinner i guess they were fresh from england for they had stuf the pocket of their carriag with bundl of heather root and all just as if scotland grew no heather but on the bank of the clyde they pass away with their treasur toward loch lomond a parti of boy dress all alik in blue veri neat were stand at the chaisedoor we conjectur they were chariti scholar but found on inquiri that they were apprentic to the cotton factori we were told that they were well instruct in read and write we had seen in the morn a flock of girl dress in grey come out of the factori probabl apprentic also after dinner set off toward hamilton but on foot for we had to turn asid to the cartland rock and our car wa to meet us on the road a guid attend us who might almost in size and certainli in activ have been compar with william companion who hid himself in the nich of the cavern hi method of walk and veri quick step soon excit our attent i could hardli keep up with him he paddl by our side just reach to my shoulder like a littl dog with hi long snout push befor himfor he had an enorm nose and walk with hi head foremost i said to him how quick you walk he repli that wa not quick walk and when i ask him what he call so he said five mile an hour and then relat in how mani hour he had late walk from lanerk to edinburgh done some errand and return to lanerki have forgotten the particular but it wa a veri short timeand ad that he had an old father who could walk at the rate of four mile an hour for twentyfour mile ani day and had never had an hour sick in hi life then said i he ha not drunk much strong liquor ye enough to drown him from hi eager manner of utter thi i infer that he himself wa a drinker and the man who met us with the car told william that he gain a great deal of money as an errandgo but spent it all in tippl he had been a shoemak but could not bear the confin on account of a weak in hi chest the neighbourhood of lanerk is exceedingli pleasant we came to a sort of district of glen or littl valley that cleav the hill leav a cheer open countri abov them with no superior hill but an undul surfac our guid point to the situat of the cartland crag we were to cross a narrow valley and walk down on the other side and then we should be at the spot but the littl fellow made a sharp turn down a footpath to the left say we must have some convers here he paddl on with hi small paw feet till we came right opposit to a gentleman hous on the other side of the valley when he halt repeat some word i have forgotten what which were taken up by the most distinct echo i ever heardthi is say littl it wa the most distinct echo that it is possibl to conceiv it shout the name of our firesid friend in the veri tone in which william and coleridg spoke but it seem to make a joke of me and i could not help laugh at my own voic it wa so shrill and pert exactli as if some one had been mimick it veri success with an intent of make me ridicul i wish joanna had been there to laugh for the echo is an excel laugher and would have almost made her believ that it wa a true stori which william ha told of her and the mountain we turn back cross the valley went through the orchard and plantat belong to the gentleman hous by the bye we observ to our guid that the echo must bring mani troublesom visitor to disturb the quiet of the owner of that hous oh no said he he glori in much compani he wa a nativ of that neighbourhood had made a moder fortun abroad purchas an estat built the hous and rais the plantat and further had made a conveni walk through hi wood to the cartland crag the hous wa modest and neat and though not adorn in the best tast and though the plantat were of fir we look at it with great pleasur there wa such true liber and kindhearted in leav hi orchard path open and hi walk unobstruct by gate i hope thi good is not often abus by plunder of the appletre which were hung with tempt appl close to the path at the termin of the littl valley we descend through a wood along a veri steep path to a muddi stream run over limeston rock turn up to the left along the bed of the stream and soon we were close in by rock on each side they were veri loftyof limeston tree start out of them high and low overhang the stream or shoot up toward the sky no place of the kind could be more beauti if the stream had been clear but it wa of a muddi yellow colour had it been a larg river one might have got the better of the unpleas of the muddi water in the grandeur of it roar the boil up of the foam over the rock or the obscur of it pool we had been told that the cartland crag were better worth go to see than the fall of the clyde i did not think so but i have seen rocki dell resembl thi befor with clear water instead of that muddi stream and never saw anyth like the fall of the clyde it would be a delici spot to have near one hous one would linger out mani a day in the cool shade of the cavern and the stream would sooth one by it murmur still be an old friend one would not love it the less for it home face even we as we pass along could not help stop for a long while to admir the beauti of the lazi foam for ever in motion and never move away in a still place of the water cover the whole surfac of it with streak and line and evervari circl wild marjoram grew upon the rock in great perfect and beauti our guid gave me a bunch and said he should come hither to collect a store for tea for the winter and that it wa varra halesom he drank none els we walk perhap half a mile along the bed of the river but it might seem to be much further than it wa owe to the difficulti of the path and the sharp and mani turn of the glen pass two of wallac cave there is scarc a note glen in scotland that ha not a cave for wallac or some other hero befor we left the river the rock becam less lofti turn into a wood through which wa a conveni path upward met the owner of the hous and the echoground and thank him for the pleasur which he had provid for us and other travel by make such pretti pathway it wa four oclock when we reach the place where the car wa wait we were anxiou to be off as we had fifteen mile to go but just as we were seat ourselv we found that the cushion were miss william wa forc to go back to the town a mile at least and coleridg and i wait with the car it rain and we had some fear that the even would be wet but the rain soon ceas though the sky continu gloomyan unfortun circumst for we had to travel through a beauti countri and of that sort which is most set off by sunshin and pleasant weather travel through the vale or trough of the clyde as it is call for ten or eleven mile have the river on our right we had fine view both up and down the river for the first three or four mile our road be not close to it but abov it bank along the open countri which wa here occasion intersect by hedgerow left our car in the road and turn down a field to the fall of stonebyr anoth of the fall of the clyde which i had not heard spoken of therefor it gave me the more pleasur we saw it from the top of the bank of the river at a littl distanc it ha not the impos majesti of cora linn but it ha the advantag of be left to itself a grand solitud in the heart of a popul countri we had a prospect abov and below it of cultiv ground with haystack hous hill but the river bank were lonesom steep and woodi with rock near the fall a littl further on came more into compani with the river sometim we were close to it sometim abov it but alway at no great distanc and now the vale becam more interest and amus it is veri popul with villag hamlet singl cottag or farmhous embosom in orchard and scatter over with gentlemen hous some of them veri ugli tall and obtrus other neat and comfort we seem now to have got into a countri where poverti and rich were shake hand togeth pear and appl of which the crop wa abund hung over the road often grow in orchard unfenc or there might be bunch of broom along the roadsid in an interrupt line that look like a hedg till we came to it and saw the gap border on these fruit orchard perhap would be a patch it chief produc be gors or broom there wa noth like a moor or common anywher but small plot of uncultiv ground were left high and low among the potato corn cabbag which grew intermingl now among tree now bare the trough of the clyde is inde a singular and veri interest region it is somewhat like the upper part of the vale of nith but abov the nith is much less cultiv groundwithout hedgerow or orchard or anyth that look like a rich countri we met crowd of peopl come from the kirk the lass were gaili dress often in white gown colour satin bonnet and colour silk handkerchief and gener with their shoe and stock in a bundl hung on their arm befor we left the river the vale becam much less interest resembl a poor english countri the field be larg and unluxuri hedg it had been dark long befor we reach hamilton and william had some difficulti in drive the tire hors through the town at the inn they hesit about be abl to give us bed the hous be brimfulllight at everi window we were rather alarm for our accommod dure the rest of the tour suppos the hous to be fill with tourist but they were in gener onli regular travel for out of the main road from town to town we saw scarc a carriag and the inn were empti there wa noth remark in the treatment we met with at thi inn except

not to wast an hour if there were anyth els in the neighbourhood worth see the waiter told us there wa a curiou place call baroncleugh with garden cut out in rock and we determin to go thither we had to walk through the town which may be about as larg as penrith and perhap a mile further along a dusti turnpik road the morn wa hot sunni and windi and we were half tire befor we reach the place but were ampli repaid for our troubl footnot the hous belong to the earl of hopetoun at leadhil not that which bear thi name about twelv mile from edinburghj c s the gener face of the countri near hamilton is much in the ordinari english style not veri hilli with hedgerow corn field and stone hous the clyde is here an open river with low bank and the countri spread out so wide that there is no

flowerbord kept in as exact order as if the spirit of the first architect of the terrac still presid over them the opposit bank of the river is left in it natur wild and noth wa to be seen higher up but the deep dell it steep bank be cover with fine tree a beauti relief or contrast to the garden which is one of the most elabor old thing ever seen a littl hang garden of babylon i wa sorri to hear that the owner of thi sweet place did not live there alway he had built a small thatch hous to eke out the old one it wa a neat dwell with no fals ornament we were exceedingli sorri to quit thi spot which is left to natur and past time and should have like to have pursu the glen further up we were told that there wa a ruin castl and the walk itself must be veri delight but we wish to reach glasgow in good time and had to go again to hamilton hous return to the town by a much shorter road and were veri angri with the waiter for not have direct us to it but he wa too great a man to speak three word more than he could help we stop at the proper door of the duke hous and seat ourselv humbl upon a bench wait the pleasur of the porter who after a littl time inform us that we could not be admit give no reason whatev when we got to the inn we could just gather from the waiter that it wa not usual to refus admitt to stranger but that wa all he could not or would not help us so we were oblig to give it up which mortifi us for i had wish much to see the pictur william vow that he would write that veri night to lord archibald hamilton state the whole matter which he did from glasgow i ought to have mention the park though as we were not allow to walk there we saw but littl of it it look pleasant as all park with fine tree must be but as it seem to be onli a larg nearli level plain it could not be a particularli beauti park though it border upon the clyde and the avon run i believ through it after leav the solitud of the glen of baroncleugh quit hamilton at about eleven oclock there is noth interest between hamilton and glasgow till we came to bothwel castl a few mile from hamilton the countri is cultiv but not rich the field larg a perfect contrast to the huddl togeth of hill and tree corn and pastur ground haystack cottag orchard broom and gors but chiefli broom that had amus us so much the even befor in pass through the trough of the clyde a nativ of scotland would not probabl be satisfi with the account i have given of the trough of the clyde for it is one of the most celebr scene in scotland we certainli receiv less pleasur from it than we had expect but it wa plain that thi wa chiefli owe to the unfavour circumst under which we saw ita gloomi sky and a cold blight wind it is a veri beauti district yet there as in all the other scene of scotland celebr for their fertil we found someth which gave us a notion of barren of what wa not altogeth genial the new fir and larch plantat here as in almost everi other part of scotland contribut not a littl to thi effect cross the clyde not far from hamilton and had the river for some mile at a distanc from us on our left but after have gone it might be three mile we came to a porter lodg on the left side of the road where we were to turn to bothwel castl which is in lord douglass ground the woman who keep the gate brought us a book in which we wrote down our name went about half a mile befor we came to the pleasureground came to a larg rang of stabl where we were to leav the car but there wa no one to unyok the hors so william wa oblig to do it himself a task which he perform veri awkwardli be then new to it we saw the ruin castl embosom in tree pass the hous and soon found ourselv on the edg of a steep brow immedi abov and overlook the cours of the river clyde through a deep hollow between wood and green steep we had approach at right angl from the main road to the place over a flat and had seen noth befor us but a nearli level countri termin by distant slope the clyde hide himself in hi deep bed it wa exceedingli delight to come thu unexpectedli upon such a beauti region the castl stand nobli overlook the clyde when we came up to it i wa hurt to see that flowerbord had taken place of the natur overgrow of the ruin the scatter stone and wild plant it is a larg and grand pile of red freeston harmon perfectli with the rock of the river from which no doubt it ha been hewn when i wa a littl accustom to the unnatur of a modern garden i could not help admir the excess beauti and luxuri of some of the plant particularli the purpleflow clemati and a broadleav creep plant without flower which scrambl up the castl wall along with the ivi and spread it vinelik branch so lavishli that it seem to be in it natur situat and one could not help think that though not selfplant among the ruin of thi countri it must somewher have it natur abod in such place if bothwel castl had not been close to the dougla mansion we should have been disgust with the possessor miser concept of adorn such a vener ruin but it is so veri near to the hous that of necess the pleasureground must have extend beyond it and perhap the neat of a shaven lawn and the complet desol natur to a ruin might have made an unpleas contrast and besid be within the precinct of the pleasureground and so veri near to the modern mansion of a nobl famili it ha forfeit in some degre it independ majesti and becom a tributari to the mansion it solitud be interrupt it ha no longer the same command over the mind in send it back into past time or exclud the ordinari feel which we bear about us in daili life we had then onli to regret that the castl and hous were so near to each other and it wa imposs not to regret it for the ruin presid in state over the river far from citi or town as if it might have had a peculiar privileg to preserv it memori of past age and maintain it own charact and independ for centuri to come we sat upon a bench under the high tree and had beauti view of the differ reach of the river abov and below on the opposit bank which is fine wood with elm and other tree are the remain of an ancient priori built upon a rock and rock and ruin are so blend togeth that it is imposs to separ the one from the other noth can be more beauti than the littl remnant of thi holi place elm treesfor we were near enough to distinguish them by their branchesgrow out of the wall and overshadow a small but veri eleg window it can scarc be conceiv what a grace the castl and priori impart to each other and the river clyde flow on smooth and unruffl below seem to my thought more in harmoni with the sober and state imag of former time than if it had roar over a rocki channel forc it sound upon the ear it blend gentli with the warbl of the smaller bird and chatter of the larger one that had made their nest in the ruin in thi fortress the chief of the english nobil were confin after the battl of bannockburn if a man is to be a prison he scarc could have a more pleasant place to solac hi captiv but i thought that for close confin i should prefer the bank of a lake or the seasid the greatest charm of a brook or river is in the liberti to pursu it through it wind you can then take it in whatev mood you like silent or noisi sportiv or quiet the beauti of a brook or river must be sought and the pleasur is in go in search of them those of a lake or of the sea come to you of themselv these rude

though go in search of sceneri as it is call had not then been thought of i had heard noth of bothwel castl at least noth that i rememb therefor perhap my pleasur wa greater compar with what i receiv

head and face all in motion all busi in an ordinari household employ in which we are accustom to see at the most onli three or four women employ in one place the women were veri civil i learnt from them the regul of the hous but i have forgotten the particular the substanc of them is that so much is to be paid for each tub of water so much for a tub and the privileg of wash for a day and so much to the gener overlook of the linen when it is left to be bleach an old man and woman have thi offic who were walk about two melancholi figur footnot glasgow greenj c s the shop at glasgow are larg and

so we put it off and i have sinc repent of my irresolut dine and left glasgow at about three oclock in a heavi rain we were oblig to ride through the street to keep our feet dri and in spite of the rain everi person as we went along stay hi step to look at us inde we had the pleasur of spread smile from one end of glasgow to the otherfor we travel the whole length of the town a set of schoolboy perhap there might be eight with satchel over their shoulder and except one or two without shoe and stock yet veri well dress in jacket and trouser like gentlemen children follow us in great delight admir the car and long to jump up at last though we were seat they made sever attempt to get on behind and they look so pretti and wild and at the same time so modest that we wish to give them a ride and there be a littl hill near the end of the town we got off and four of them who still remain the rest have drop into their home by the way took our place and inde i would have walk two mile willingli to have had the pleasur of see them so happi when they were to ride no longer they scamper away laugh and rejoic new hous are rise up in great number round glasgow citizenlik hous and new plantat chiefli of fir the field are frequent enclos by hedgerow but there is no rich nor ani particular beauti for some mile the first object that interest us wa a gentleman hous upon a green plain or holm almost close to the clyde shelter by tall tree a quiet modest mansion and though whitewash be an old build and no other hous near it or in connexion with it and stand upon the level field which belong to it it own domain the whole scene togeth brought to our mind an imag of the retired and sober eleg of a nunneri but thi might be owe to the grey of the afternoon and our have come immedi from glasgow and through a countri which till now had either had a townish taint or at best littl of rural beauti while we were look at the hous we overtook a foottravel who like mani other began to talk about our car we alight to walk up a hill and continu the convers the man told us with someth like a nation pride that it belong to a scotch lord lord sempl he ad that a littl further on we should see a much finer prospect as fine a one as ever we had seen in our live accordingli when we came to the top of the hill it open upon us most magnific we saw the clyde now a state seariv wind away mile after mile spot with boat and ship each side of the river hilli the right popul with singl hous and villagesdunglass castl upon a promontori the whole view termin by the rock of dumbarton at five or six mile distanc which stand by itself without ani hill near it like a searock we travel for some time near the river pass through cluster of hous which seem to owe their exist rather to the wealth of the river than the land for the bank were mostli bare and the soil appear poor even near the water the left side of the river wa gener uninhabit and moorish yet there are some beauti spot for instanc a nobleman hous where the field and tree were rich and in combin with the river look veri love as we went along william and i were remind of the view upon the thame in kent which though greatli superior in rich and soft are much inferior in grandeur not far from dumbarton we pass under some rocki copsecov hill which were so like some of the hill near grasmer that we could have half believ they were the same arriv at dumbarton befor it wa dark have push on briskli that we might have start of a travel at the inn who wa follow us as fast as he could in a gig everi front room wa full and we were afraid we should not have been admit they put us into a littl parlour dirti and smell of liquor the tabl unclean and not a chair in it place we were glad howev of our sorri accommod footnot no doubt erskin hous the seat of lord blantyr jc s while tea wa prepar we loll at our eas and though the roomwindow overlook the stableyard and at our entranc there appear to be noth but gloom and unloveli yet while i lay stretch upon the carriag cushion on three chair i discov a littl side peep which wa enough to set the mind at work it wa no more than a smoki vessel lie at anchor with it bare mast a clay hut and the shelv bank of the river with a green pastur abov perhap you will think that there is not much in thi as i describ it it is true but the effect produc by these simpl object as they happen to be combin togeth with the gloom of the even wa exceedingli wild our room wa part by a slender partit from a larg diningroom in which were a number of offic and their wive who after the first hour never ceas sing danc laugh or loud talk the ladi sang some pretti song a great relief to us we went earli to bed but poor coleridg could not sleep for the nois at the street door he lay in the parlour below stair it is no uncommon thing in the best inn of scotland to have shuttingup bed in the sittingroom wednesday august tha soon as breakfast wa over william and i walk toward the castl a short mile from the town we overtook two young men who on our ask the road offer to conduct us though it might seem it wa not easi to miss our way for the rock rise singli by itself from the plain on which the town stand the rock of dumbarton is veri grand when you are close to it but at a littl distanc under an ordinari sky and in open day it is not grand but curious wild the castl and fortif add littl effect to the gener view of the rock especi sinc the build of a modern hous which is whitewash and consequ jar wherev it is seen with the natur charact of the place there is a path up to the hous but it be low water we could walk round the rock which we resolv to do on that side next the town green grass grow to a consider height up the rock but wherev the river border upon it it is nake stone i never saw rock in nobler mass or more deepli stain by time and weather nor is thi to be wonder at for it is in the veri eye of seastorm and landstorm of mountain wind and water wind it is of all colour but a rusti yellow predomin as we walk along we could not but look up continu and the mass abov be on everi side so huge it appear more wonder than when we saw the whole togeth we sat down on one of the larg stone which lie scatter near the base of the rock with seawe grow amongst them abov our head the rock wa perpendicular for a consider height nay as it seem to the veri top and on the brink of the precipic a few sheep two of them ram with twist horn stood as if on the lookout over the wide countri at the same time we saw a sentinel in hi red coat walk backward and forward between us and the sky with hi firelock over hi shoulder the sheep i suppos owe to our be accustom to see them in similar situat appear to retain their real size while on the contrari the soldier seem to be diminish by the distanc till he almost look like a puppet move with wire for the pleasur of children or an eight year old drummer in hi stiff manli dress besid a compani of grenadi i had never befor perhap thought of sheep and men in soldier dress at the same time and here they were brought togeth in a strang fantast way as will be easili conceiv the fearless and still of those quiet creatur on the brow of the rock pursu their natur occup contrast with the restless and appar unmean motion of the dwarf soldier ad not a littl to the gener effect of thi place which is that of wild singular and the whole wa aid by a bluster wind and a gloomi sky coleridg join us and we went up to the top of the rock the road to a consider height is through a narrow cleft in which a flight of step is hewn the step nearli fill the cleft and on each side the rock form a high and irregular wall it is almost like a long slope cavern onli that it is roof by the sky we came to the barrack soldier wive were hang out linen upon the rail while the wind beat about them furiouslyther wa noth which it could set in motion but the garment of the women and the linen upon the rail the grassfor we had now come to green grasswa close and smooth and not one pile an inch abov anoth and neither tree nor shrub the standard pole stood erect without a flag the rock ha two summit one much broader and higher than the other when we were near to the top of the lower emin we had the pleasur of find a littl garden of flower and veget belong to the soldier there are three distinct and veri nobl prospectsth first up the clyde toward glasgowdunglass castl seen on it promontoryboat sloop hill and mani build the second down the river to the seagreenock and portglasgow and the distant mountain at the entranc of loch long and the third extens and distant view is up the leven which here fall into the clyde to the mountain of loch lomond the distant mountain in all these view were obscur by mist and dingi cloud but if the grand outlin of ani one of the view can be seen it is suffici recompens for the troubl of climb the rock of dumbarton the soldier who wa our guid told us that an old ruin which we came to at the top of the higher emin had been a windmillan inconveni station though certainli a gloriou place for wind perhap if it realli had been a windmil it wa onli for the use of the garrison we look over cannon on the batterywal and saw in an open field below the yeomanri cavalri exercis while we could hear from the town which wa full of soldier dumbarton drum beat bonni o yet while we stood upon thi emin rise up so far as it doesinland and have the habitu old english feel of our own secur as islandersw could not help look upon the fortress in spite of it cannon and soldier and the rumour of invas as set up against the hostil of wind and weather rather than for ani other warfar on our return we were invit into the guardroom about halfway down the rock where we were shown a larg rusti sword which they call wallac sword and a trout box up in a well close by where they said he had been confin for upward of thirti year for the pleasur of the soldier who were anxiou that we should see him we took some pain to spi him out in hi black den and at last succeed it wa pleas to observ how much interest the poor soldiersthough themselv probabl new to the placeseem to attach to thi antiqu inhabit of their garrison when we had reach the bottom of the rock along the same road by which we had ascend we made our way over the rough stone left bare by the tide round the bottom of the rock to the point where we had set off thi is a wild and melancholi walk on a bluster cloudi day the nake bed of the river scatter over with seawe grey swampi field on the other shore seabird fli overhead the high rock perpendicular and bare we came to two veri larg fragment which had fallen from the main rock coleridg thought that one of them wa as larg as bowderston william and i did not but it is imposs to judg accur we probabl without know it compar them with the whole mass from which they had fallen which from it situat we consid as one rock or stone and there is no object of the kind for comparison with the bowderston when we leav the shore of the clyde grass begin to show itself on the rock go a consider waystil under the rockalong a flat field and pass immedi below the white hous which wherev seen look so ugli footnot a rock in borrowdal cumberland left dumbarton at about eleven oclock the sky wa cheerless and the air ungeni which we regret as we were go to loch lomond and wish to greet the first of the scottish lake with our cheerfullest and best feel cross the leven at the end of dumbarton and when we look behind had a pleas view of the town bridg and rock but when we took in a reach of the river at the distanc of perhap half a mile the swamp ground be so near a town and not in it natur wild but seemingli half cultiv with hous here and there gave us an idea of extrem poverti of soil or that the inhabit were either indol or miser we had to travel four mile on the bank of the water of leven befor we should come to loch lomond have expect a grand river from so grand a lake we were disappoint for it appear to me not to be veri much larger than the emont and is not near so beauti but we must not forget that the day wa cold and gloomi near dumbarton it is like a river in a flat countri or under the influenc of tide but a littl higher up it resembl one of our river flow through a vale of no extrem beauti though prettili wood the hill on each side not veri high slope backward from the bed of the vale which is neither veri narrow nor veri wide the prospect termin by ben lomond and other mountain the vale is popul but look as if it were not inhabit by cultiv of the earth the hous are chiefli of stone often in row by the riversid they stand pleasantli but have a tradish look as if they might have been offset from glasgow we saw mani bleachyard but no other symptom of a manufactori except someth in the hous that wa not rural and a want of independ comfort perhap if the river had been glitter in the sun and the smoke of the cottag rise in distinct volum toward the sky as i have seen in the vale or basin below pillsden in dorsetshir when everi cottag hidden from the eye point out it lurkingplac by an upright wreath of white smoke the whole scene might have excit idea of perfect cheer here as on the nith and much more than in the trough of the clyde a great portion of the ground wa uncultiv but the hill be less wild the river more state and the ground not heav up so irregularli and toss about the imperfect cultiv wa the more to be lament particularli as there were so mani hous near the river in a small enclosur by the waysid is a pillar erect to the memori of dr smollett who wa born in a villag at a littl distanc which we could see at the same time and where i believ some of the famili still resid there is a long latin inscript which coleridg translat for my benefit the latin is miser bada coleridg said such as poor smollett who wa an excel scholar would have been asham of footnot the inscript on the pillar wa written by professor georg stuart of edinburgh john ramsay of ochtertyr and dr samuel johnson for dr johnson share in the work see croker boswel p j c s befor we came to loch lomond the vale widen and becam less popul we climb over a wall into a larg field to have a better front view of the lake than from the road thi view is veri much like that from mr clarkson window the mountain in front resembl hallan inde is almost the same but ben lomond is not seen stand in such majest compani as helvellyn and the meadow are less beauti than ulswat the reach of the lake is veri magnific you see it as ulswat is seen beyond the promontori of old church wind away behind a larg woodi island that look like a promontori the outlet of the lakew had a distinct view of it in the fieldi veri insignific the bulk of the river is fritter away by small alder bush as i recollect i do not rememb that it wa reedi but the ground had a swampi appear and here the vale spread out wide and shapeless as if the river were born to no inherit had no shelter cradl no hill of it own as we have seen thi doe not continu long it flow through a distinct though not a magnific vale but have lost the pastor charact which it had in the youth day of smollettif the descript in hi ode to hi nativ stream be a faith oneit is less interest than it wa then the road carri us sometim close to the lake sometim at a consider distanc from it over moorish ground or through halfcultiv enclosur we had the lake on our right which is here so wide that the opposit hill not be high are cast into insignific and we could not distinguish ani build near the water if ani there were it is howev alway delight to travel by a lake of clear water if you see noth els but a veri ordinari countri but we had some beauti distant view one in particular down the high road through a vista of overarch tree and the near shore wa frequent veri pleas with it gravel bank bend and small bay in one part it wa border for a consider way by irregular group of forest tree or singl straggler which although not larg seem old their branch were stunt and knotti as if they had been strive with storm and had half yield to them under these tree we had a varieti of pleas view across the lake and the veri roll over the road and look at it smooth and beauti surfac wa itself a pleasur it wa as smooth as a gravel walk and of the bluish colour of some of the road among the lake of the north of england pass no veri remark place till we came to sir jame colquhoun hous which stand upon a larg flat woodi peninsula look toward ben lomond there must be mani beauti walk among the cops of the peninsula and delici view over the water but the gener surfac of the countri is poor and look as if it ought to be rich and well peopl for it is not mountain nor had we pass ani hill which a cumbrian would dignifi with the name of mountain there wa mani a littl plain or gentlyslop hill cover with poor heath or broom without tree where one should have like to see a cottag in a bower of wood with it patch of corn and potato and a green field with a hedg to keep it warm as we advanc we perceiv less of the cold of poverti the hill not have so larg a space between them and the lake the surfac of the hill be in it natur state is alway beauti but where there is onli a half cultiv and half peopl soil near the bank of a lake or river the idea is forc upon one that they who do live there have not much of cheer enjoy but soon we came to just such a place as we had want to see the road wa close to the water and a hill bare rocki or with scatter cops rose abov it a deep shade hung over the road where some littl boy were at play we expect a dwellinghous of some sort and when we came nearer saw three or four thatch hut under the tree and at the same moment felt that it wa a paradis we had befor seen the lake onli as one wide plain of water but here the portion of it which we saw wa bound by a high and steep heathi and woodi island opposit which did not appear like an island but the main shore and frame out a littl oblong lake appar not so broad as rydalewat with one small island cover with tree resembl some of the most beauti of the holm of windermer and onli a narrow river breadth from the shore thi wa a place where we should have like to have live and the onli one we had seen near loch lomond how delight to have a littl shed conceal under the branch of the fairi island the cottag and the island might have been made for the pleasur of each other it wa but like a natur garden the distanc wa so small nay one could not have forgiven ani one live there not compel to daili labour if he did not connect it with hi dwell by some feel of domest attach like what he ha for the orchard where hi children play i thought what a place for william he might row himself over with twenti stroke of the oar escap from the busi of the hous and as safe from intrud with hi boat anchor besid him as if he had lock himself up in the strong tower of a castl we were unwil to leav thi sweet spot but it wa so simpl and therefor so remember that it seem almost as if we could have carri it away with us it wa noth more than a small lake enclos by tree at the end and by the waysid and opposit by the island a steep bank on which the purpl heath wa seen under low oak coppicewood a group of hous overshadow by tree and a bend road there wa one remark tree an old larch with hairi branch which sent out it main stem horizont across the road an object that seem to have been singl out for injuri where everyth els wa love and thrive tortur into that shape by storm which one might have thought could not have reach it in that shelter place we were now enter into the highland i believ luss is the place where we were told that countri begin but at these cottag i would have gladli believ that we were there for it wa like a new region the hut were after the highland fashion and the boy who were play wore the highland dress and philabeg on go into a new countri i seem to myself to waken up and afterward it surpris me to rememb how much aliv i have been to the distinct of dress household arrang etc etc and what a spirit these littl thing give to wild barren or ordinari place the cottag are within about two mile of luss came in view of sever island but the lake be so veri wide we could see littl of their peculiar beauti and they be larg hardli look like island pass anoth gentleman hous which stand prettili in a bay and soon after reach luss where we intend to lodg on see the outsid of the inn we were glad that we were to have such pleasant quarter it is a nicelook white hous by the roadsid but there wa not much promis of hospit when we stop at the door no person came out till we had shout a consider time a barefoot lass show me upstair and again my hope reviv the hous wa clean for a scotch inn and the view veri pleasant to the lake over the top of the villagea cluster of thatch hous among tree with a larg chapel in the midst of them like most of the scotch kirk which we had seen thi build resembl a big hous but it is a much more pleas build than they gener are and ha one of our rustic belfri not unlik that at amblesid with two bell hang in the open air we chose one of the back room to sit in be more snug and they look upon a veri sweet prospecta stream tumbl down a cleft or glen on the hillsid rocki coppic ground a rural lane such as we have from hous to hous at grasmer and a few outhous we had a poor dinner and sour ale but as long as the peopl were civil we were content footnot camstraddan hous and bayj c s coleridg wa not well so he did not stir out but william and i walk through the villag to the shore of the lake when i came close to the hous i could not but regret a want of loveli correspond with the beauti of the situat and the appear of the villag at a littl distanc not a singl ornament garden we saw potato and cabbag but never a honeysuckl yet there were wild garden as beauti as ani that ever man cultiv overgrow the roof of some of the cottag flower and creep plant how eleg were the wreath of the brambl that had built it own bower upon the riggin in sever part of the villag therefor we had chiefli to regret the want of garden as they are symptom of leisur and comfort or at least of no pain industri here we first saw hous without window the smoke come out of the open windowplac the chimney were like stool with four leg a hole be left in the roof for the smoke and over that a slate place upon four stickssometim the whole lean as if it were go to fall the field close to luss lie flat to the lake and a river as larg as our stream near the church at grasmer flow by the end of the villag be the same which come down the glen behind the inn it is veri much like our streamb of blue pebbl upon the shore we walk toward the head of the lake and from a larg pastur field near luss a gentl emin had a veri interest view back upon the villag and the lake and island beyond we then perceiv that luss stood in the centr of a spaciou bay and that close to it lay anoth small one within the larger where the boat of the inhabit were lie at anchor a beauti natur harbour the island as we look down the water are seen in great beauti inchtavannach the same that frame out the littl peac lake which we had pass in the morn tower abov the rest the lake is veri wide here and the opposit shore not be lofti the chief part of the perman beauti of thi view is among the island and on the near shore includ the low promontori of the bay of luss and the villag and we saw it under it dullest aspectth air cold the sky gloomi without a glimps of sunshin on a splendid even with the light of the sun diffus over the whole island distant hill and the broad expans of the lake with it creek bay and littl slip of water among the island it must be a gloriou sight up the lake there are no island ben lomond termin the view without ani other larg mountain no cloud were upon it therefor we saw the whole size and form of the mountain yet it did not appear to me so larg as skiddaw doe from derwentwat continu our walk a consider way toward the head of the lake and went up a high hill but saw no other reach of the water the hill on the luss side becom much steeper and the lake have narrow a littl abov luss wa no longer a veri wide lake where we lost sight of it came to a bark hut by the shore and sate for some time under the shelter of it while we were here a poor woman with a littl child by her side beg a penni of me and ask where she could find quarter in the villag she wa a travel beggar a nativ of scotland had often heard of that water but wa never there befor thi woman appear while the wind wa rustl about us and the wave break at our feet wa veri melancholi the water look wide the hill mani and dark and far offno hous but at luss i thought what a dreari wast must thi lake be to such poor creatur struggl with fatigu and poverti and unknown way we order tea when we reach the inn and desir the girl to light us a fire she repli i dinna ken whether shell gie fire mean her mistress we told her we did not wish her mistress to give fire we onli desir her to let her make it and we would pay for it the girl brought in the teath but no fire and when i ask if she wa come to light it she said her mistress wa not varra will to gie fire at last howev on our insist upon it the fire wa light we got tea by candlelight and spent a comfort even i had seen the landladi befor we went out for as had been usual in all the countri inn there wa a demur respect bed notwithstand the hous wa empti and there were at least halfadozen spare bed her counten correspond with the unkind of deni us a fire on a cold night for she wa the most cruel and hatefullook woman i ever saw she wa overgrown with fat and wa sit with her feet and leg in a tub of water for the dropsyprob brought on by whiskydrink the sympathi which i felt and express for her on see her in thi wretch conditionfor her leg were swollen as thick as millpostsseem to produc no effect and i wa oblig after five minut convers to leav the affair of the bed undecid coleridg had some talk with her daughter a smart lass in a cotton gown with a bandeau round her head without shoe and stock she told coleridg with some pride that she had not spent all her time at luss but wa then fresh from glasgow it came on a veri stormi night the wind rattl everi window in the hous and it rain heavili william and coleridg had bad bed in a twobed room in the garret though there were empti room on the first floor and they were disturb by a drunken man who had come to the inn when we were gone to sleep thursday august thwe were glad when we awok to see that it wa a fine morningth sky wa bright blue with quickmov cloud the hill cheer light and shadow vivid and distinct the villag look exceedingli beauti thi morn from the garret windowsth stream glitter near it while it flow under tree through the level field to the lake after breakfast william and i went down to the watersid the road were as dri as if no drop of rain had fallen which ad to the pure cheer of the appear of the villag and even of the distant prospect an effect which i alway seem to perceiv from clearli bright road for they are alway brighten by rain after a storm but when we came among the hous i regret even more than last night becaus the contrast wa greater the slovenli and dirt near the door and could not but rememb with pain from the contrast the cottag of somersetshir cover with rose and myrtl and their small garden of herb and flower while linger by the shore we began to talk with a man who offer to row us to inchtavannach but the sky began to darken and the wind be high we doubt whether we should ventur therefor made no engag he offer to sell me some thread point to hi cottag and ad that mani english ladi carri thread away from luss present after coleridg join us and we determin to go to the island i wa sorri that the man who had been talk with us wa not our boatman william by some chanc had engag anoth we had two rower and a strong boat so i felt myself bold though there wa a great chanc of a high wind the nearest point of inchtavannach is not perhap more than a mile and a quarter from luss we did not land there but row round the end and land on that side which look toward our favourit cottag and their own island which wherev seen is still their own it rain a littl when we land and i took my cloak which afterward serv us to sit down upon in our road up the hill when the day grew much finer with gleam of sunshin thi island belong to sir jame colquhoun who ha made a conveni road that wind gentli to the top of it we had not climb far befor we were stop by a sudden burst of prospect so singular and beauti that it wa like a flash of imag from anoth world we stood with our back to the hill of the island which we were ascend and which shut out ben lomond entir and all the upper part of the lake and we look toward the foot of the lake scatter over with island without begin and without end the sun shone and the distant hill were visibl some through sunni mist other in gloom with patch of sunshin the lake wa lost under the low and distant hill and the island lost in the lake which wa all in motion with travel field of light or dark shadow under raini cloud there are mani hill but no command emin at a distanc to confin the prospect so that the land seem endless as the water what i had heard of loch lomond or ani other place in great britain had given me no idea of anyth like what we beheld it wa an outlandish scenew might have believ ourselv in north america the island were of everi possibl varieti of shape and surfacehilli and level larg and small bare rocki pastor or cover with wood immedi under my eye lay one larg flat island bare and green so flat and low that it scarc appear to rise abov the water with straggl peatstack and a singl hut upon one of it outshoot promontoriesfor it wa of a veri irregular shape though perfectli flat anoth it next neighbour and still nearer to us wa cover over with heath and coppicewood the surfac undul with flat or slope bank toward the water and hollow place cradlelik valley behind these two island with inchtavannach where we were stand were intermingl with the water i might say interbed and intervein with it in a manner that wa exquisit pleas there were bay innumer strait or passag like calm river landlock lake and to the main water stormi promontori the solitari hut on the flat green island seem unshelt and desol and yet not wholli so for it wa but a broad river breadth from the covert of the wood of the other island near to these is a miniatur an islet cover with tree on which stand a small ruin that look like the remain of a religi hous it is overgrown with ivi and were it not that the arch of a window or gateway may be distinctli seen it would be difficult to believ that it wa not a tuft of tree grow in the shape of a ruin rather than a ruin overshadow by tree when we had walk a littl further we saw below us on the nearest larg island where some of the wood had been cut down a hut which we conjectur to be a bark hut it appear to be on the shore of a littl forest lake enclos by inchtavannach where we were and the woodi island on which the hut stand beyond we had the same intric view as befor and could discov dumbarton rock with it doubl head there be a mist over it it had a ghostlik appearancea i observ to william and coleridg someth like the tor of glastonburi from the dorsetshir hill right befor us on the flat island mention befor were sever small singl tree or shrub grow at differ distanc from each other close to the shore but some optic delus had detach them from the land on which they stood and they had the appear of so mani littl vessel sail along the coast of it i mention the circumst becaus with the ghostli imag of dumbarton castl and the ambigu ruin on the small island it wa much in the charact of the scene which wa throughout magic and enchantinga new world in it great perman outlin and composit and chang at everi moment in everi part of it by the effect of sun and wind and mist and shower and cloud and the blend light and deep shade which took the place of each other travers the lake in everi direct the whole wa inde a strang mixtur of sooth and restless imag of imag invit to rest and other hurri the fanci away into an activ still more pleas than repos yet intric and homeless that is without last abidingplac for the mind as the prospect wa there wa no perplex we had still a guid to lead us forward wherev we look it wa a delight feel that there wa someth beyond meanwhil the sens of quiet wa never lost sight of the littl peac lake among the island might make you forget that the great water loch lomond wa so near and yet are more beauti becaus you know that it is so they have their own bay and creek shelter within a shelter when we had ascend to the top of the island we had a view up to ben lomond over the long broad water without spot or rock and look backward saw the island below us as on a map thi view as may be suppos wa not nearli so interest as those we had seen befor we hunt out all the hous on the shore which were veri few there wa the villag of luss the two gentlemen hous our favourit cottag and here and there a hut but i do not recollect ani comfortablelook farmhous and on the opposit shore not a singl dwell the whole scene wa a combin of natur wild loveli beauti and barren or rather bare yet not comfortless or cold but the whole wa beauti we were too far off the more distant shore to distinguish ani particular spot which we might have regret were not better cultiv and near luss there wa no want of hous after we had left the island have been so much taken with the beauti of the bark hut and the littl lake by which it appear to stand we desir the boatman to row us through it and we land at the hut walk upon the island for some time and found out shelter place for cottag there were sever woodmen hut which with some scatter firtre and other in irregular knot that made a delici murmur in the wind ad greatli to the romant effect of the scene they were built in the form of a cone from the ground like savag hut the door be just larg enough for a man to enter with stoop straw bed were rais on log of wood tool lie about and a fork bough of a tree wa gener suspend from the roof in the middl to hang a kettl upon it wa a place that might have been just visit by new settler i thought of ruth and her dream of romant love and then he said how sweet it were a fisher or a hunter there a garden in the shade still wander with an easi mind to build a household fire and find a home in everi glade footnot see ruth stanza xiii we found the main lake veri stormi when we had left the shelter of the island and there wa again a threaten of rain but it did not come on i want much to go to the old ruin but the boatmen were in a hurri to be at home they told us it had been a stronghold built by a man who live there alon and wa use to swim over and make depred on the shorethat nobodi could ever lay hand on him he wa such a good swimmer but at last they caught him in a net the men point out to us an island belong to sir jame colquhoun on which were a great quantiti of deer arriv at the inn at about twelv oclock and prepar to depart immedi we should have gone with great regret if the weather had been warmer and the inn more comfort when we were leav the door a parti with smart carriag and servant drove up and i observ that the peopl of the hous were just as slow in their attend upon them as on us with one singl hors and outlandish hibernian vehicl when we had travel about two mile the lake becam consider narrow the hill rocki cover with cops or bare rise more immedi from the bed of the water and therefor we had not so often to regret the want of inhabit pass by or saw at a distanc sometim a singl cottag or two or three togeth but the whole space between luss and tarbet is a solitud to the eye we were remind of ulswat but miss the pleasant farm and the mountain were not so interest we had not seen them in compani or brotherhood rise one abov anoth at a long distanc ben lomond stood alon opposit to us majest overlook the lake yet there wa someth in thi mountain which disappoint mea want of massiv and simplic perhap from the top be broken into three distinct stage the road carri us over a bold promontori by a steep and high ascent and we had a long view of the lake push itself up in a narrow line through an avenu of mountain termin by the mountain at the head of the lake of which ben lui if i do not mistak is the most consider the afternoon wa showeri and misti therefor we did not see thi prospect so distinctli as we could have wish but there wa a grand obscur over it which might make the mountain appear more numer i have said so much of thi lake that i am tire myself and i fear i must have tire my friend we had a pleasant journey to tarbet more than half of it on foot for the road wa hilli and after we had climb one small hill we were not desir to get into the car again see anoth befor us and our path wa alway delight near the lake and frequent through wood when we were within about half a mile of tarbet at a sudden turn look to the left we saw a veri craggytop mountain amongst other smooth one the rock on the summit distinct in shape as if they were build rais up by man or uncouth imag of some strang creatur we call out with one voic that what we want allud to the framelik uniform of the sidescreen of the lake for the last five or six mile as we conjectur thi singular mountain wa the famou cobbler near arrochar tarbet wa befor us in the recess of a deep larg bay under the shelter of a hill when we came up to the villag we had to inquir for the inn there be no signboard it wa a wellsiz white hous the best in the place we were conduct upstair into a sittingroom that might make ani goodhumour travel happya squar room with window on each side look one way toward the mountain and across the lake to ben lomond the other there wa a pretti stone hous befor ie toward the lake some hut scatter tree two or three green field with hedgerow and a littl brook make it way toward the lake the field are almost flat and screen on that side nearest the head of the lake by a hill which push itself out form the bay of tarbet and toward the foot by a gentl slope and tree the lake is narrow and ben lomond shut up the prospect rise directli from the water we could have believ ourselv to be by the side of ulswat at glenridden or in some other of the inhabit retir of that lake we were in a shelter place among mountain it wa not an open joyou bay with a cheer popul villag like luss but a pastor and retir spot with a few singl dwell the peopl of the inn stare at us when we spoke without give us an answer immedi which we were at first dispos to attribut to coars of manner but found afterward that they did not understand us at onc ers be the languag spoken in the famili noth but salt meat and egg for dinnerno potato the hous smelt strongli of her which were hung to dri over the kitchen fire walk in the even toward the head of the lake the road wa steep over the hill and when we had reach the top of it we had long view up and down the water pass a troop of women who were rest themselv by the roadsid as if return from their day labour amongst them wa a man who had walk with us a consider way in the morn and told us he wa just come from america where he had been for some yearswa go to hi own home and should return to america he spoke of emigr as a gloriou thing for them who had money poor fellow i do not think that he had brought much back with him for he had work hi passag over i much suspect that a bundl which he carri upon a stick tie in a pockethandkerchief contain hi all he wa almost blind he said as were mani of the crew he intend cross the lake at the ferri but it wa stormi and he thought he should not be abl to get over that day i could not help smile when i saw him lie by the roadsid with such a compani about him not like a wayfar man but seem as much at home and at hi eas as if he had just step out of hi hut among them and they had been neighbour all their live pass one pretti hous a larg thatch dwell with outhous but the prospect abov and below wa solitari the sun had long been set befor we return to the inn as travel we were glad to see the moon over the top of one of the hill but it wa a cloudi night without ani peculiar beauti or solemn after tea we made inquiri respect the best way to go to loch ketterin the landlord could give but littl inform and nobodi seem to know anyth distinctli of the place though it wa but ten mile off we appli to the maidserv who wait on us she wa a finelook young woman dress in a white bedgown her hair fasten up by a comb and without shoe and stock when we ask her about the trossach she could give us no inform but on our say do you know loch ketterin she answer with a smile i should know that loch for i wa bred and born there after much difficulti we learn from her that the trossach were at the foot of the lake and that by the way we were to go we should come upon them at the head should have to travel ten mile to the foot of the water and that there wa no inn by the way the girl spoke english veri distinctli but she had few word and found it difficult to understand us she did not much encourag us to go becaus the road were bad and it wa a long way and there wa no puttingup for the like of us we determin howev to ventur and throw ourselv upon the hospit of some cottag or gentleman we desir the landladi to roast us a coupl of fowl to carri with us there are alway plenti of fowl at the door of a scotch inn and egg are as regularli brought to tabl at breakfast as bread and butter footnot thi distinct between the foot and head is not veri clear what is meant is thi they would have to travel the whole length of the lake from the west to the east end of it befor they came to the trossach the pass lead away from the east end of the lakej c s friday august thwe did not set off till between ten and eleven oclock much too late for a long day journey our boatman live at the pretti white hous which we saw from the window we call at hi door by the way and even when we were near the hous the outsid look comfort but within i never saw anyth so miser from dirt and dirt alon it remind one of the hous of a decay weaver in the suburb of a larg town with a sickli wife and a larg famili but william say it wa far wors that it wa quit hottentotish after long wait and mani clumsi prepar we got ourselv seat in the boat but we had not float five yard befor we perceiv that if ani of the partyand there wa a littl highland woman who wa go over the water with us the boatman hi helper and ourselvesshould stir but a few inch lean to one side or the other the boat would be full in an instant and we at the bottom besid it wa veri leaki and the woman wa employ to lade out the water continu it appear that thi crazi vessel wa not the man own and that hi wa lie in a bay at a littl distanc he said he would take us to it as fast as possibl but i wa so much frighten i would gladli have given up the whole day journey inde not one of us would have attempt to cross the lake in that boat for a thousand pound we reach the larger boat in safeti after coast a consider way near the shore but just as we were land william drop the bundl which contain our food into the water the fowl were no wors but some sugar ground coffe and peppercak seem to be entir spoil we gather togeth as much of the coffe and sugar as we could and tie it up and again trust ourselv to the lake the sun shone and the air wa calmluckili it had been so while we were in the crazi boatw had rock and wood on each side of us or bare hill seldom a singl cottag and there wa no remember place till we came opposit to a waterfal of no inconsider size that appear to drop directli into the lake close to it wa a hut which we were told wa the ferryhous on the other side of the lake wa a pretti farm under the mountain besid a river the cultiv ground lie all togeth and slope toward the lake from the mountain hollow down which the river came it is not easi to conceiv how beauti these spot appear after move on so long between the solitari steep we went a consider way further and land at rob roy cave which are in fact no cave but some fine rock on the brink of the lake in the crevic of which a man might hide himself cunningli enough the water is veri deep below them and the hill abov steep and cover with wood the littl highland woman who wa in size about a match for our guid at lanerk accompani us hither there wa someth veri graciou in the manner of thi woman she could scarc speak five english word yet she gave me whenev i spoke to her as mani intellig smile as i had need english word to answer me and help me over the rock in the most oblig manner she had left the boat out of goodwil to us or for her own amus she had never seen these cave befor but no doubt had heard of them the tale of rob roy exploit be told familiarli round the ingl hereabout for thi neighbourhood wa hi home we land at inversneyd the ferryhous by the waterfal and were not sorri to part with our boatman who wa a coars hardfeatur man and speak of the french utter the basest and most cowardli sentiment hi helper a youth fresh from the isl of skye wa innoc of thi fault and though but a bad rower wa a far better companion he could not speak a word of english and sang a plaintiv gaelic air in a low tone while he pli hi oar the ferryhous stood on the bank a few yard abov the landingplac where the boat lie it is a small hut under a steep wood and a few yard to the right look toward the hut is the waterfal the fall is not veri high but the stream is consider as we could see by the larg black stone that were lie bare but the rain if they had reach thi place had had littl effect upon the waterfal it nois wa not so great as to form a contrast with the still of the bay into which it fall where the boat and hous and waterfal itself seem all shelter and protect the highland woman wa to go with us the two first mile of our journey she led us along a bye footpath a shorter way up the hill from the ferryhous there is a consider settl in the hill that border loch lomond at the passag by which we were to cross to loch ketterin ben lomond termin near the ferryhous is on the same side of the water with it and about three mile abov tarbet we had to climb right up the hill which is veri steep and when close under it seem to be high but we soon reach the top and when we were there had lost sight of the lake and now our road wa over a moor or rather through a wide moorland hollow have gone a littl way we saw befor us at the distanc of about half a mile a veri larg stone build a singular structur with a high wall round it nake hill abov and neither field nor tree near but the moor wa not overgrown with heath mere but grey grass such as cattl might pastur upon we could not conjectur what thi build wa it appear as if it had been built strong to defend it from storm but for what purpos william call out to us that we should observ that place well for it wa exactli like one of the spittal of the alp built for the recept of travel and inde i had thought it must be so befor he spoke thi build from it singular structur and appear made the place which is itself in a countri like scotland nowis remark take a charact of unusu wild and desolationthi when we first came in view of it and afterward when we had pass it and look back three pyramid mountain on the opposit side of loch lomond termin the view which under certain accid of weather must be veri grand our highland companion had not english enough to give us ani inform concern thi strang build we could onli get from her that it wa a larg hous which wa plain enough we walk about a mile and a half over the moor without see ani other dwell but one hut by the burnsid with a peatstack and a tenyardssquar enclosur for potato then we came to sever cluster of hous even hamlet they might be call but where there is ani land belong to the highland hut there are so mani outbuild near which differ in no respect from the dwellinghous except that they send out no smoke that one hous look like two or three near these hous wa a consider quantiti of cultiv ground potato and corn and the peopl were busi make hay in the hollow place of the open vale and all along the side of the beck it wa a pretti sight altogethermen and women dog the littl run stream with linen bleach near them and cheer sunni hill and rock on everi side we pass by one patch of potato that a florist might have been proud of no carnationb ever look more gay than thi squar plot of ground on the wast common the flower were in veri larg bunch and of an extraordinari size and of everi conceiv shade of colour from snowwhit to deep purpl it wa pleas in that place where perhap wa never yet a flower cultiv by man for hi own pleasur to see these blossom grow more gladli than elsewher make a summer garden near the mountain dwell at one of the cluster of hous we part with our companion who had insist on bear my bundl while she stay with us i often tri to enter into convers with her and see a small tarn befor us wa remind of the pleasur of fish and the manner of live there and ask her what sort of food wa eaten in that place if they live much upon fish or had mutton from the hill she look earnestli at me and shake her head repli oh ye eat fishno papist eat everyth the tarn had one small island cover with wood the stream that run from it fall into loch ketterin which after we had gone a littl beyond the tarn we saw at some distanc befor us pursu the road a mountain horsetrack till we came to a corner of what seem the head of the lake and there sate down complet tire and hopeless as to the rest of our journey the road end at the shore and no hous were to be seen on the opposit side except a few wide part hut and on the near side wa a trackless heath the land at the head of the lake wa but a continu of the common we had come along and wa cover with heather intersect by a few straggl footpath coleridg and i were faint with hunger and could go no further till we had refresh ourselv so we ate up one of our fowl and drank of the water of loch ketterin but william could not be easi till he had examin the coast so he left us and made hi way along the moor across the head of the lake coleridg and i as we sate had what seem to us but a dreari prospecta wast of unknown ground which we guess we must travel over befor it wa possibl for us to find a shelter we saw a long way down the lake it wa all moor on the near side on the other the hill were steep from the water and there were larg coppicewood but no cheer green field and no road that we could see we knew howev that there must be a road from hous to hous but the whole lake appear a solitudeneith boat island nor hous no grandeur in the hill nor ani loveli in the shore when we first came in view of it we had said it wa like a barren ulswaterulswat dismantl of it grandeur and crop of it lesser beauti when i had swallow my dinner i hasten after william and coleridg follow me walk through the heather with some labour for perhap half a mile and found william sit on the top of a small emin whenc we saw the real head of the lake which wa push up into the vale a consider way beyond the promontori where we now sate the view up the lake wa veri pleas resembl thirlemer below armath there were rocki promontori and woodi island and what wa most cheer to us a neat white hous on the opposit shore but we could see no boat so in order to get to it we should be oblig to go round the head of the lake a long and weari way after coleridg came up to us while we were debat whether we should turn back or go forward we espi a man on horseback at a littl distanc with a boy follow him on foot no doubt a welcom sight and we hail him we should have been glad to have seen either man woman or child at thi time but there wa someth uncommon and interest in thi man appear which would have fix our attent wherev we had met him he wa a complet highland in dress figur and face and a veri finelook man hardi and vigor though past hi prime while he stood wait for us in hi bonnet and plaid which never look more grace than on horseback i forgot our errand and onli felt glad that we were in the highland william accost him with sir do you speak english he repli a littl he spoke howev suffici well for our purpos and veri distinctli as all the highland do who learn english as a foreign languag but in a long convers they want word he inform us that he himself wa go beyond the trossach to calland that no boat were kept to let but there were two gentlemen hous at thi end of the lake one of which we could not yet see it be hidden from us by a part of the hill on which we stood the other hous wa that which we saw opposit to us both the gentlemen kept boat and probabl might be abl to spare one of their servant to go with us after we had ask mani question which the highland answer with patienc and courtesi he part from us go along a sort of horsetrack which a footpasseng if he onc get into it need not lose if he be care when he wa gone we again debat whether we should go back to tarbet or throw ourselv upon the merci of one of the two gentlemen for a night lodg what we had seen of the main bodi of the lake made us littl desir to see more of it the highland upon the nake heath in hi highland dress upon hi carefulgo hors with the boy follow him wa worth it all but after a littl while we resolv to go on asham to shrink from an adventur pursu the horsetrack and soon came in sight of the other gentleman hous which stood on the opposit side of the vale a littl abov the lake it wa a white hous no tree near it except a new plantat of fir but the field were green sprinkl over with haycock and the brook which come down the valley and fall into the lake ran through them it wa like a newmad farm in a mountain vale and yet veri pleas after the depress prospect which had been befor us our road wa rough and not easi to be kept it wa between five and six oclock when we reach the brook side where coleridg and i stop and william went up toward the hous which wa in a field where about half a dozen peopl were at work he address himself to one who appear like the master and all drew near him stare at william as nobodi could have stare but out of sheer rude except in such a lone place he told hi tale and inquir about boat there were no boat and no lodg nearer than calland ten mile beyond the foot of the lake a laugh wa on everi face when william said we were come to see the trossach no doubt they thought we had better have stay at our own home william endeavour to make it appear not so veri foolish by inform them that it wa a place much celebr in england though perhap littl thought of by them and that we onli differ from mani of our countrymen in have come the wrong way in consequ of an erron direct after a littl time the gentleman said we should be accommod with such bed as they had and should be welcom to rest in their hous if we pleas william came back for coleridg and me the men all stood at the door to receiv us and now their behaviour wa perfectli courteou we

mistress desir the person whom we took to be her husband to return thank he said a short grace and in a few minut they all went off to their work we saw them about the door follow one anoth like a

a stone ball at everi corner we had notic it the even befor and wonder what it could be it wa in the middl of a plant as they call plantat which wa enclos for the preserv of the tree therefor we had to climb over a high wall it wa a dismal spot contain four or five grave overgrown with long grass nettl and brambl against the wall wa a marbl monument to the memori of one of the laird of whom they spoke with vener some english vers were inscrib upon the marbl purport that he had been the father of hi clan a brave and good man when we return to the hous she said she would show me what curiou feather they had in their countri and brought out a bunch care wrap up in paper on my ask her what bird they came from oh she repli it is a great beast we conjectur it wa an eagl and from her descript of it way and the manner of destroy it we knew it wa so she beg me to accept of some of the feather tell me that some ladi wore them in their head i wa much pleas with the gift which i shall preserv in memori of her kind and simplic of manner and the highland solitud where she live we took leav of the famili with regret they were handsom healthi and happylook peopl it wa ten oclock when we depart we had learn that there wa a ferryboat kept at three mile distanc and if the man wa at home he would row us down the lake to the trossach our walk wa mostli through coppicewood along a horseroad upon which narrow cart might travel pass that white hous which had look at us with such a friendli face when we were on the other side it stood on the slope of a hill with green pastur below it plot of corn and coppicewood and behind a rocki steep cover with wood it wa a veri pretti place but the morn be cold and dull the opposit shore appear dreari near to the white hous we pass by anoth of those littl pinfold squar which we knew to be a buryingplac it wa in a slope green field among wood and within sound of the beat of the water against the shore if there were but a gentl breez to stir it i thought if i live in that hous and my ancestor and kindr were buri there i should sit mani an hour under the wall of thi plot of earth where all the household would be gather togeth we found the ferryman at work in the field abov hi hut and he wa at liberti to go with us but be wet and hungri we beg that he would let us sit by hi fire till we had refresh ourselv thi wa the first genuin highland hut we had been in we enter by the cowhous the housedoor be within at right angl to the outer door the woman wa distress that she had a bad fire but she heap up some dri peat and heather and blow it with her breath in a short time rais a blaze that scorch us into comfort feel a small part of the smoke found it way out of the hole of the chimney the rest through the open windowplac one of which wa within the recess of the fireplac and made a frame to a littl pictur of the restless lake and the opposit shore seen when the outer door wa open the woman of the hous wa veri kind whenev we ask her for anyth it seem a fresh pleasur to her that she had it for us she alway answer with a sort of soften down of the scotch exclam hoot ho ye yell get that and hie to her cupboard in the spenc we were amus with the phrase yell get that in the highland which appear to us as if it came from a perpetu feel of the difficulti with which most thing are procur we got oatmeal butter bread and milk made some porridg and then depart it wa raini and cold with a strong wind coleridg wa afraid of the cold in the boat so he determin to walk down the lake pursu the same road we had come along there wa noth veri interest for the first three or four mile on either side of the water to the right uncultiv heath or poor coppicewood and to the left a scatter of meadow ground patch of corn coppicewood and here and there a cottag the wind fell and it began to rain heavili on thi william wrap himself in the boatman plaid and lay at the bottom of the boat till we came to a place where i could not help rous him we were row down that side of the lake which had hitherto been littl els than a moorish ridg after turn a rocki point we came to a bay close in by rock and steep wood chiefli of fullgrown birch the lake wa elsewher ruffl but at the entranc of thi bay the breez sunk and it wa calm a small island wa near and the opposit shore cover with wood look soft through the misti rain william rub hi eye for he had been asleep call out that he hope i had not let him pass by anyth that wa so beauti as thi and i wa glad to tell him that it wa but the begin of a new land after we had left thi bay we saw befor us a long reach of wood and rock and rocki point that promis other bay more beauti than what we had pass the ferryman wa a goodnatur fellow and row veri industri follow the in and out of the shore he wa delight with the pleasur we express continu repeat how pleasant it would have been on a fine day i believ he wa attach to the lake by some sentiment of pride as hi own domainhi be almost the onli boat upon itwhich made him see we were will gazer take far more pain than an ordinari boatman he would often say after he had compass the turn of a point thi is a bonni part and he alway chose the bonniest with greater skill than our prospecthunt and picturesqu travel place screen from the windsthat wa the first point the rest follow of courserich grow tree rock and bank and curv which the eye delight in the second bay we came to differ from the rest the hill retir a short space from the lake leav a few level field between on which wa a cottag embosom in tree the bay wa defend by rock at each end and the hill behind made a shelter for the cottag the onli dwell i believ except one on thi side of loch ketterin we now came to steep that rose directli from the lake and pass by a place call in the gaelic the den of the ghost which remind us of lodor it is a rock or mass of rock with a stream of larg black stone like the nake or driedup bed of a torrent down the side of it birchtre start out of the rock in everi direct and cover the hill abov further than we could see the water of the lake below wa veri deep black and calm our delight increas as we advanc till we came in view of the termin of the lake see where the river issu out of it through a narrow chasm between the hill footnot goblin cavej c s here i ought to rest as we rest and attempt to give utter to our pleasur but inde i can impart but littl of what we felt we were still on the same side of the water and be immedi under the hill within a consider bend of the shore we were enclos by hill all round as if we had been upon a smaller lake of which the whole wa visibl it wa an entir solitud and all that we beheld wa the perfect of loveli and beauti we had been through mani solitari place sinc we came into scotland but thi place differ as much from ani we had seen befor as if there had been noth in common between them no thought of dreari or desol found entranc here yet noth wa to be seen but water wood rock and heather and bare mountain abov we saw the mountain by glimps as the cloud pass by them and were not dispos to regret with our boatman that it wa not a fine day for the near object were not conceal from us but soften by be seen through the mist the lake is not veri wide here but appear to be much narrow than it realli is owe to the mani promontori which are push so far into it that they are much more like island than promontori we had a long desir to row to the outlet and look up into the narrow passag through which the river went but the point where we were to land wa on the other side so we bent our cours right across and just as we came in sight of two hut which have been built by ladi perth as a shelter for those who visit the trossach coleridg hail us with a shout of triumph from the door of one of them exult in the glori of scotland the hut stand at a small distanc from each other on a high and perpendicular rock that rise from the bed of the lake a road which ha a veri wild appear ha been cut through the rock yet even here among these bold precipic the feel of excess beauti overcom everi other while we were upon the lake on everi side of us were bay within bay often more like tini lake or pool than bay and these not in long success onli but all round some almost on the broad breast of the water the promontori shot out so far after we had land we walk along the road to the uppermost of the hut where coleridg wa stand from the door of thi hut we saw benvenu opposit to usa high mountain but cloud conceal it top it side rise directli from the lake is cover with birchtre to a great height and seam with innumer channel of torrent but now there wa no water in them noth to break in upon the still and repos of the scene nor do i recollect hear the sound of water from ani side the wind be fallen and the lake perfectli still the place wa all eye and complet satisfi the sens and the heart abov and below us to the right and to the left were rock knoll and hill which wherev anyth could growand that wa everywher between the rockswer cover with tree and heather the tree did not in ani place grow so thick as an ordinari wood yet i think there wa never a bare space of twenti yard it wa more like a natur forest where the tree grow in group or singli not hide the surfac of the ground which instead of be green and mossi wa of the richest purpl the heather wa inde the most luxuri i ever saw it wa so tall that a child of ten year old struggl through it would often have been buri head and shoulder and the exquisit beauti of the colour near or at a distanc seen under the tree is not to be conceiv but if i were to go on describ for evermor i should give but a faint and veri often a fals idea of the differ object and the variou combin of them in thi most intric and delici place besid i tire myself out with describ at loch lomond so i will hasten to the end of my tale thi remind me of a sentenc in a littl pamphlet written by the minist of calland descript of the environ of that place after have taken up at least six closelyprint page with the trossach he conclud thu in a word the trossach beggar all descriptiona conclus in which everybodi who ha been there will agre with him i believ the word trossach signifi mani hill it is a name given to all the emin at the foot of loch ketterin and about half a mile beyond we left the hut retrac the few yard of road which we had climb our boat lay at anchor under the rock in the last of all the compart of the lake a small oblong pool almost shut up within itself as sever other had appear to be by jut point of rock the termin of a long outshoot of the water push up between the step of the main shore where the hut stand and a broad promontori which with it hillock and point and lesser promontori occupi the centr of the foot of the lake a person sail through the lake up the middl of it would just as natur suppos that the outlet wa here as on the other side and so it might have been with the most trifl chang in the disposit of the ground for at the end of thi slip of water the lake is confin onli by a gentl rise of a few yard toward an open between the hill a narrow pass or valley through which the river might have flow the road is carri through thi valley which onli differ from the lower part of the vale of the lake in be excess narrow and without water it is enclos by mountain rocki mound hill and hillock scatter over with birchtre and cover with dutch myrtl and heather even surpass what we had seen befor our mother eve had no fairer though a more diversifi garden to tend than we found within thi littl close valley it rain all the time but the mist and calm air made us ampl amend for a wet at the open of the pass we climb up a low emin and had an unexpect prospect suddenli befor usanoth lake small compar with loch ketterin though perhap four mile long but the misti air conceal the end of it the transit from the solitari wild of loch ketterin and the narrow valley or pass to thi scene wa veri delight it wa a gentl place with love open bay one small island corn field wood and a group of cottag thi vale seem to have been made to be tributari to the comfort of man loch ketterin for the lone delight of natur and kind spirit delight in beauti the sky wa grey and heavyflo mist on the hillsid which soften the object and where we lost sight of the lake it appear so near to the sky that they almost touch one anoth give a visionari beauti to the prospect while we overlook thi quiet scene we could hear the stream rumbl among the rock between the lake but the mist conceal ani glimps of it which we might have had thi small lake is call loch achray we return of cours by the same road our guid repeat over and over again hi lament that the day wa so bad though we had often told himnot inde with much hope that he would believ usthat we were glad of it as we walk along he pull a leafi twig from a birchtre and after smell it gave it to me say how sweet and halesom it wa and that it wa pleasant and veri halesom on a fine summer morn to sail under the bank where the birk are grow thi remind me of the old scotch song in which you continu hear of the pu the birk common as birch are in the north of england i believ their sweet smell is a thing unnot among the peasant we return again to the hut to take a farewel look we had share our food with the ferryman and a travel whom we had met here who wa go up the lake and wish to lodg at the ferryhous so we offer him a place in the boat coleridg chose to walk we took the same side of the lake as befor and had much delight in visit the bay over again but the even began to darken and it rain so heavili befor we had gone two mile that we were complet wet it wa dark when we land and on enter the hous i wa sick with cold the good woman had provid accord to her promis a better fire than we had found in the morn and inde when i sate down in the chimneycorn of her smoki biggin i thought i had never been more comfort in my life coleridg had been there long enough to have a pan of coffe boil for us and have put our cloth in the way of dri we all sate down thank for a shelter we could not prevail upon the man of the hous to draw near the fire though he wa cold and wet or to suffer hi wife to get him dri cloth till she had serv us which she did though most willingli not veri expediti a cumberland man of the same rank would not have had such a notion of what wa fit and right in hi own hous or if he had one would have accus him of servil but in the highland it onli seem like polit howev erron and pain to us natur grow out of the depend of the inferior of the clan upon their laird he did not howev refus to let hi wife bring out the whiskybottl at our request she keep a dram as the phrase is inde i believ there is scarc a lone hous by the waysid in scotland where travel may not be accommod with a dram we ask for sugar butter barleybread and milk and with a smile and a stare more of kind than wonder she repli yell get that bring each articl separ we carous our cup of coffe laugh like children at the strang atmospher in which we were the smoke came in gust and spread along the wall and abov our head in the chimney where the hen were roost like light cloud in the sky we laugh and laugh again in spite of the smart of our eye yet had a quieter pleasur in observ the beauti of the beam and rafter gleam between the cloud of smoke they had been crust over and varnish by mani winter till where the firelight fell upon them they were as glossi as black rock on a sunni day case in ice when we had eaten our supper we sate about half an hour and i think i had never felt so deepli the bless of a hospit welcom and a warm fire the man of the hous repeat from time to time that we should often tell of thi night when we got to our home and interpos prais of thi hi own lake which he had more than onc when we were return in the boat ventur to say wa bonnier than loch lomond our companion from the trossach who it appear wa an edinburgh drawingmast go dure the vacat on a pedestrian tour to john o groat hous wa to sleep in the barn with william and coleridg where the man said he had plenti of dri hay i do not believ that the hay of the highland is often veri dri but thi year it had a better chanc than usual wet or dri howev the next morn they said they had slept comfort when i went to bed the mistress desir me to go ben attend me with a candl and assur me that the bed wa dri though not sic as i had been use to it wa of chaff there were two other in the room a cupboard and two chest on one of which stood the milk in wooden vessel cover over i should have thought that milk so kept could not have been sweet but the chees and butter were good the wall of the whole hous were of stone unplast it consist of three apartmentsth cowhous at one end the kitchen or hous in the middl and the spenc at the other end the room were divid not up to the rig but onli to the begin of the roof so that there wa a free passag for light and smoke from one end of the hous to the other i went to bed some time befor the famili the door wa shut between us and they had a bright fire which i could not see but the light it sent up among the varnish rafter and beam which cross each other in almost as intric and fantast a manner as i have seen the underbough of a larg beechtre wither by the depth of the shade abov produc the most beauti effect that can be conceiv it wa like what i should suppos an underground cave or templ to be with a drip or moist roof and the moonlight enter in upon it by some mean or other and yet the colour were more like melt gem i lay look up till the light of the fire fade away and the man and hi wife and child had crept into their bed at the other end of the room i did not sleep much but pass a comfort night for my bed though hard wa warm and clean the unusu of my situat prevent me from sleep i could hear the wave beat against the shore of the lake a littl syke close to the door made a much louder nois and when i sate up in my bed i could see the lake through an open windowplac at the bed head add to thi it rain all night i wa less occupi by remembr of the trossach beauti as they were than the vision of the highland hut which i could not get out of my head i thought of the fairyland of spenser and what i had read

the elder of these girl while she stood at the gate answer our inquiri her face flush with the rain her pronunci wa clear and distinct without difficulti yet slow like that of a foreign speech they told us we might sit in the ferryhous till the return of the boat went in with us and made a good fire as fast as possibl to dri our wet cloth we learnt that the taller wa the sister of the ferryman and had been left in charg with the hous for the day that the other wa hi wife sister and wa come with her mother on a visitan old woman who sate in a corner besid the cradl nurs her littl grandchild

of that befor they held a consult of sever minut over a pair of coars woollen stock gabbl ers as fast as their tongu could move and look as if uncertain what to do at last with great diffid they offer them to me ad as befor that i had never worn the like of them when we enter the hous we had been not a littl glad to see a fowl stew in barleybroth and now when the wettest of our cloth were strip off

english cottag without it comfort yet there wa no appear of povertyinde quit the contrari the peep out of the open doorplac across the lake made some amend for the want of the long roof and eleg rafter of our boatman cottag and all the while the waterfal which we could not see wa roar at the end of the hut which seem to serv as a soundingboard for it nois so that it wa not unlik sit in a hous where a mill is go the dash of the wave against the shore could not be distinguish yet in spite of my knowledg of thi i could not help fanci that the tumult and storm came from the lake and went out sever time to see if it wa possibl to row over in safeti after long wait we grew impati for our dinner at last the pan wa taken off and carri into the other room but we had to wait at least anoth half

togeth while we were walk forward the road lead us over the top of a brow we stop suddenli at the sound of a halfarticul gaelic hoot from the field close to us it came from a littl boy whom we could

say of which we had heard not a word befor that it wa bonnier to her fanci than loch lomond the landlord who wa not at home when we had set off told us that if he had known of our go he would have recommend us to mr macfarlan or the other farmhous ad that they were hospit peopl in that vale coleridg and i got tea and william and the drawingmast chose supper they ask to have a broil fowl a dish veri common in scotland to which the mistress repli would not a boil one do as well they consent suppos that it would be more easili cook but when the fowl made it appear to their great disappoint it prove a cold one that had been stew in the broth at dinner monday august thit rain heavili thi morn and have heard so much of the long rain sinc we came into scotland as well as befor we had no hope that it would be over in less than three week at the least so poor coleridg be veri unwel determin to send hi cloth to edinburgh and make the best of hi way thither be afraid to face much wet weather in an open carriag william and i were unwil to be confin at tarbet so we resolv to go to arrochar a mile and a half on the road to inverari where there is an inn celebr as a place of good accommod for travel coleridg and i set off on foot and william wa to follow with the car but a heavi shower come on coleridg left me to shelter in a hut and wait for william while he went on befor thi hut wa unplast and without window crowd with bed uncomfort and not in the simplic of the ferryman hous a number of good cloth were hang against the wall and a green silk umbrella wa set up in a corner i should have been surpris to see an umbrella in such a place befor we came into the highland but umbrella are not so common anywher as therea plain proof of the wet of the climat even five minut after thi a girl pass us without shoe and stock whose gown and petticoat were not worth half a crown hold an umbrella over her bare head we turn at a guidepost to the new inn and after descend a littl and wind round the bottom of a hill saw at a small distanc a white hous half hidden by tall tree upon a lawn that slope down to the side of loch long a sealoch which is here veri narrow right befor us across the lake wa the cobbler which appear to rise directli from the water but in fact it overtop anoth hill be a consider way behind the inn look so much like a gentleman hous that we could hardli believ it wa an inn we drove down the broad gravel walk and make a sweep stop at the front door were shown into a larg parlour with a fire and my first thought wa how comfort we should be but coleridg who had arriv befor us check my pleasur the waiter had shown himself dispos to look coolli upon us and there had been a hint that we could not have bedsa parti wa expect who had engag all the bed we conjectur thi might be but a pretenc and order dinner in the hope that matter would clear up a littl and we thought they could not have the heart to turn us out in so heavi a rain if it were possibl to lodg us we had a nice dinner yet would have gladli chang our roast lamb and pickl and the gentlemanwait with hi napkin in hi pocket for the more home fare of the smoki hut at loch ketterin and the good woman busi attent with the certainti of a hospit shelter at night after dinner i spoke to the landlord himself but he wa not to be move he could not even provid one bed for me so noth wa to be done but either to return to tarbet with coleridg or that william and i should push on the next stage to cairndow we had an interest close view from the window of the room where we sate look across the lake which did not differ in appear as we saw it here from a freshwat lake the slope lawn on which the hous stood wa prettili scatter over with tree but we had seen the place to great advantag at our first approach owe to the mist upon the mountain which had made them seem exceedingli high while the strang figur on the cobbler appear and disappear like live thing but as the day clear we were disappoint in what wa more like the perman effect of the scene the mountain were not so lofti as we had suppos and the low ground not so fertil yet still it is a veri interest i may say beauti place the rain ceas entir so we resolv to go on to cairndow and had the satisfact of see that our landlord had not told us an untruth concern the expect compani for just befor our departur we saw on the opposit side of the vale a coach with four hors anoth carriag and two or three men on horsebacka strike process as it move along between the bare mountain and the lake twenti year ago perhap such a sight had not been seen here except when the duke of argyl or some other highland chieftain might chanc to be go with hi famili to london or edinburgh they had to cross a bridg at the head of the lake which we could not see so after disappear about ten minut they drove up to the doorthre old ladi two waitingwomen and store of menserv the old ladi were as gaili dress as bullfinch in springtim we heard the next day that they were the renown miss waugh of carlisl and that they enjoy themselv over a game of card in the even left arrochar at about four oclock in the afternoon coleridg accompani us a littl way we portion out the content of our purs befor our part and after we had lost sight of him drove heavili along cross the bridg and look to the right up the vale which is soon termin by mountain it wa of a yellow green with but few tree and few hous seagul were fli abov it our roadth same along which the carriag had comewa directli under the mountain on our right hand and the lake wa close to us on our left the wave break among stone overgrown with yellow seawe fishermen boat and other larger vessel than are seen on freshwat lake were lie at anchor near the opposit shore seabird fli overhead the nois of torrent mingl with the beat of the wave and misti mountain enclos the valea melancholi but not a dreari scene often have i in look over a map of scotland follow the intric wind of one of these sealoch till pleas myself with my own imagin i have felt a long almost pain to travel among them by land or by water thi wa the first sealoch we had seen we came prepar for a new and great delight and the first impress which william and i receiv as we drove rapidli through the rain down the lawn of arrochar the object danc befor us wa even more delight than we had expect but as i have said when we look through the window as the mist disappear and the object were seen more distinctli there wa less of shelter valleycomfort than we had fanci to ourselv and the mountain were not so grand and now that we were near to the shore of the lake and could see that it wa not of fresh water the wreck the broken seashel and scatter seawe gave somewhat of a dull and uncleanli look to the whole lake and yet the water wa clear and might have appear as beauti as that of loch lomond if with the same pure pebbl shore perhap had we been in a more cheer mood of mind we might have seen everyth with a differ eye the still of the mountain the motion of the wave the stream torrent the seabird the fishingboat were all melancholi yet still occupi as my mind wa with other thing i thought of the long wind through which the water of the sea had come to thi inland retreat visit the inner solitud of the mountain and i could have wish to have muse out a summer day on the shore of the lake from the foot of these mountain whither might not a littl barqu carri one away though so far inland it is but a slip of the great ocean seamen fishermen and shepherd here find a natur home we did not travel far down the lake but turn to the right through an open of the mountain enter a glen call glen croe our thought were full of coleridg and when we were enclos in the narrow dale with a length of wind road befor us a road that seem to have insinu itself into the veri heart of the mountainsth brook the road bare hill float mist scatter stone rock and herd of black cattl be all that we could seei shiver at the thought of hi be sickli and alon travel from place to place the cobbler on our right wa preemin abov the other hill the singular rock on it summit seen so near were like ruinscastl or watchtow after we had pass one reach of the glen anoth open out long narrow deep and houseless with herd of cattl and larg stone but the third reach wa softer and more beauti as if the mountain had there made a warmer shelter and there were a more gentl climat the rock by the riversid had dwindl away the mountain were smooth and green and toward the end where the glen slope upward it wa a cradlelik hollow and at that point where the slope becam a hill at the veri bottom of the curv of the cradl stood one cottag with a few field and bed of potato there wa also anoth hous near the roadsid which appear to be a herdsman hut the dwell in the middl of the vale wa a veri pleas object i said within myself how quietli might a famili live in thi pensiv solitud cultiv and love their own field but the herdsman hut be the onli one in the vale had a melancholi face not be attach to ani particular plot of land one could not help consid it as just kept aliv and abov ground by some dreari connexion with the long barren tract we had travel through the afternoon had been exceedingli pleasant after we had left the vale of arrochar the sky wa often threaten but the rain blew off and the even wa uncommonli fine the sun had set a short time befor we had dismount from the car to walk up the steep hill at the end of the glen cloud were move all over the skysom of a brilliant yellow hue which shed a light like bright moonlight upon the mountain we could not have seen the head of the valley under more favour circumst the pass away of a storm is alway a time of life and cheer especi in a mountain countri but that afternoon and even the sky wa in an extraordinari degre vivid and beauti we often stop in ascend the hill to look down the long reach of the glen the road follow the cours of the river as far as we could see the farm and cottag hill smooth toward the base and rocki higher up were the sole object befor us thi part of glen croe remind us of some of the dale of the north of englandgrisdal abov ulswat for instanc but the length of it and the broad highway which is alway to be seen at a great distanc a sort of centr of the vale a point of refer give to the whole of the glen and each divis of it a veri differ charact at the top of the hill we came to a seat with the wellknown inscript rest and be thank on the same stone it wa record that the road had been made by col wade regiment the seat is place so as to command a full view of the valley and the long long road which with the fact record and the exhort make it an affect restingplac we call to mind with pleasur a seat under the brae of loch lomond on which i had rest where the travel is inform by an inscript upon a stone that the road wa made by col lascel regiment there the spot had not been chosen mere as a restingplac for there wa no steep ascent in the highway but it might be for the sake of a spring of water and a beauti rock or more probabl becaus at that point the labour had been more than usual toilsom in hew through the rock soon after we had climb the hill we began to descend into anoth glen call glen kingla we now saw the western sky which had hitherto been hidden from us by the hilla gloriou mass of cloud upris from a sea of distant mountain stretch out in length befor us toward the westand close by us wa a small lake or tarn from the reflect of the crimson cloud the water appear of a deep red like melt rubi yet with a mixtur of a grey or blackish hue the gorgeou light of the sky with the singular colour of the lake made the scene exceedingli romant yet it wa more melancholi than cheer with all the power of light from the cloud there wa an overcast of the gloom of even a twilight upon the hill we descend rapidli into the glen which resembl the lower part of glen croe though it seem to be inferior in beauti but befor we had pass through one reach it wa quit dark and i onli know that the steep were high and that we had the compani of a foam stream and mani a vagrant torrent cross us dash down the hill the road wa bad and uncertain how we should fare we were eager and somewhat uneasi to get forward but when we were out of the close glen and near to cairndow as a travel had told us the moon show her clear face in the sky reveal a spaciou vale with a broad loch and slope corn field the hill not veri high thi cheer sight put us into spirit and we thought it wa at least no dismal place to sit up all night in if they had no bed and they could not refus us a shelter we were howev well receiv and sate down in a neat parlour with a good fire tuesday august thbreakfast befor our departur and ate a her fresh from the water at our landlord earnest recommendationmuch superior to the her we get in the north of england though we rose at seven could not set off befor nine oclock the servant were in bed the kettl did not boilinde we were complet out of patienc but it had alway been so and we resolv to go off in futur without breakfast cairndow is a singl hous by the side of the loch i believ resort to by gentlemen in the fish season it is a pleasant place for such a purpos but the vale did not look so beauti as by moonlightit had a sort of seacold without mountain grandeur there is a ferri for footpasseng from cairndow to the other side of the water and the road along which all carriag go is carri round the head of the lake perhap a distanc of three mile footnot i should rather think soj c s after we had pass the landingplac of the ferri opposit to cairndow we saw the lake spread out to a great width more like an arm of the sea or a great river than one of our lake it remind us of the severn at the chepstow passag but the shore were less rich and the hill higher the sun shone which made the morn cheer though there wa a cold wind our road never carri us far from the lake and with the beat of the wave the sparkl sunshini water boat the opposit hill and on the side on which we travel the chanc cottag the coppic wood and common busi of the field the ride could not but be amus but what most excit our attent wa at one particular place a cluster of fishingboat at anchor in a still corner of the lake a small bay or harbour by the waysid they were overshadow by fishermen net hung out to dri which form a dark awn that cover them like a tent overhang the water on each side and fall in the most exquisit grace fold there wa a monast pensiv a funer gloom in the appear of thi littl compani of vessel which wa the more interest from the gener liveli and glanc motion of the water they be perfectli still and silent in their shelter nook when we had travel about seven mile from cairndow wind round the bottom of a hill we came in view of a great basin or elbow of the lake complet out of sight of the long track of water we had coast we seem now to be on the edg of a veri larg almost circular lake the town of inverari befor us a line of white build on a low promontori right opposit and close to the water edg the whole landscap a showi scene and burst upon us at onc a travel who wa ride by our side call out can that be the castl recollect the print which we had seen we knew it could not but the mistak is a natur one at that distanc it is so littl like an ordinari town from the mixtur of regular and irregular in the build with the expans of water and pleasant mountain the scatter boat and sloop and those gather togeth it had a truli festiv appear a few step more brought us in view of the castl a state turret mansion but with a modern air stand on a lawn retir from the water and screen behind by wood cover the side of high hill to the top and still beyond by bare mountain our road wound round the semicircular shore cross two bridg of lordli architectur the town look pretti when we drew near to it in connexion with it situat differ from ani place i had ever seen yet exceedingli like what i imag to myself from represent in rareeshow or pictur of foreign placesvenic for examplepaint on the scene of a playhous which one is apt to fanci are as cleanli and gay as they look through the magnifyingglass of the rareeshow or in the candlelight dazzl of a theatr at the door of the inn though certainli the build had not that delight outsid which they appear to have at a distanc yet they look veri pleasant the rang border on the water consist of littl els than the inn be a larg hous with veri larg stabl the counti gaol the open into the main street into the town and an arch gateway the entranc into the duke of argyl privat domain we were decent well receiv at the inn but it wa overrich in waiter and larg room to be exactli to our tast though quit in harmoni with the neighbourhood befor dinner we went into the duke pleasureground which are extens and of cours command a varieti of live and interest view walk through avenu of tall beechtre and observ some that we thought even the tallest we had ever seen but they were all scantili cover with leav and the leav exceedingli smallinde some of them in the most expos situat were almost bare as if it had been winter travel who wish to view the insid of the castl send in their name and the duke appoint the time of their go but we did not think that what we should see would repay us for the troubl there be no pictur and the hous which i believ ha not been built abov half a centuri is fit up in the modern style if there had been ani reliqu of the ancient costum of the castl of a highland chieftain we should have been sorri to have pass it sate after dinner by the firesid till near sunset for it wa veri cold though the sun shone all day at the begin of thi our second walk we pass through the town which is but a dole exampl of scotch filth the hous are plaster or roughcast and wash yellowwel built well size and sashwindow bespeak a connexion with the duke such a depend as may be expect in a small town so near to hi mansion and inde he seem to have done hi utmost to make them comfort accord to our english notion of comfort they are fit for the hous of peopl live decent upon a decent trade but the window and doorstead were as dirti as in a dirti bystreet of a larg town make a most unpleas contrast with the come face of the build toward the water and the ducal grandeur and natur festiv of the scene smoke and black are the wild growth of a highland hut the mud floor can not be wash the doorstead are trampl by cattl and if the inhabit be not veri cleanli it give one littl pain but dirti peopl live in twostori stone hous with dirti sash window are a melancholi spectacl anywher give the notion either of vice or the extrem of wretched return through the town we went toward the castl and enter the duke ground by a porter lodg follow the carriageroad through the park which is prettili scatter over with tree and slope gentli toward the lake a great number of limetre were grow singli not beauti in their shape but i mention them for the resembl to one of the same kind we had seen in the morn which form a shade as impenetr as the roof of ani hous the branch did not spread far nor ani one branch much further than anoth on the outsid it wa like a green bush shorn with shear but when we sate upon a bench under it look upward in the middl of the tree we could not perceiv ani green at all it wa like a hundr thousand magpi nest cluster and mat togeth the twig and bough be so intertwin that neither the light of the midday sun nor shower of hail or rain could pierc through them the limetre on the lawn resembl thi tree both in shape and in the manner of intertwist their twig but they were much smaller and not an impenetr shade the view from the castl are delight opposit is the lake girt with mountain or rather smooth high hill to the left appear a veri steep rocki hill call duniquoich hill on the top of which is a build like a watchtow it rise boldli and almost perpendicular from the plain at a littl distanc from the river arey that run through the ground to the right is the town overtop by a sort of spire or pinnacl of the church a thing unusu in scotland except in the larg town and which would often give an eleg appear to the villag which from the uniform of the hut and the frequent want of tall tree they seldom exhibit in look at an extens prospect or travel through a larg vale the trough of the clyde for instanc i could not help think that in england there would have been somewher a tower or spire to warn us of a villag lurk under the covert of a wood or bank or to point out some particular spot on the distant hill which we might look at with kindli feel i well rememb how we use to love the littl nest of tree out of which ganton spire rose on the distant wold opposit to the window at gallow hill the spire of inverari is not of so beauti a shape as those of the english church and not be one of a class of build which is understood at onc seen near or at a distanc is a less interest object but it suit well with the outlandish trim of the build border on the water inde there is no one thing of the mani gather togeth in the extens circuit of the basin or vale of inverari that is not in harmoni with the effect of the whole place the castl is built of a beauti hewn stone in

but it seem as if it were no insult to the hill to look on them as the shield and enclosur of the ducal domain to which the water might delight in bear it tribut the hill near the lake are smooth so smooth that they might have been shaven or swept the shore too had somewhat of the same effect be bare and have no rough no woodi point yet the whole circuit be veri larg and the hill so extens the

that point of the valley where the pleasureground appear to end we left our hors at a cottag door and turn a few step out of the road to see a waterfal which roar so loud that we could not have gone by without look about for it even if we had not known that there wa one near inverari the waterfal is not remark for anyth but the good tast with which it ha been left to itself though there is a

all togeth so that we could not know to which bodi thi leg or that arm belong we wait watch them till we were assur that the boatman had notic our signalbi the bye if we had receiv proper direct at loch lomond on our journey to loch ketterin we should have made our way down the lake till we had come opposit to the ferryman hous where there is a hut and the peopl who live there are accustom to call him by the same signal as here luckili for us we were not so well instruct for we should have miss the pleasur of receiv the kind of mr and mr macfarlan and their famili a young woman who want to go to the island accompani us to the watersid the walk wa pleasant through field with hedgerow the greenest field we had seen in scotland but we were oblig to return without go to the island the poor man had taken hi boat to anoth place and the water were swollen so that we could not go close to the shore and show ourselv to him nor could we make him hear by shout on our return to the publichous we ask the woman what we should pay her and were not a littl surpris when she answer three shill our hors had had a sixpenni feed of miser corn not worth threepenc the rest of the charg wa for skim milk oatbread porridg and blue milk chees we told her it wa far too much and give her halfacrown depart i wa sorri she had made thi unreason demand becaus we had like the woman and we had befor been so well treat in the highland cottag but on think more about it i satisfi myself that it wa no scheme to impos upon us for she wa content with the halfcrown and would i daresay have been so with two shill if we had offer it her at first not be accustom to fix a price upon porridg and milk to such as we at least when we ask her she did not know what to say but see that we were travel for pleasur no doubt she conclud we were rich and that what wa a small gain to her could be no great loss to us when we had gone a littl way we saw befor us a young man with a bundl over hi shoulder hung on a stick bear a great boy on hi back see that they were travel we offer to take the boy on the car to which the man repli that he should be more than thank and set him up besid me they had walk from

pretti chapel by the lakesid and an island with a farmhous upon it and corn and pastur field but as we went along we had frequent reason to regret the want of english hedgerow and english cultur for the ground wa often swampi or moorish near the lake where comfort dwell among green field might have been when we came near to the end of the lake we had a steep hill to climb so william and i walk and we had such confid in our hors that we were not afraid to leav the car to hi guidanc with the child in it we were soon howev alarm at see him trot up the hill a long way befor us the child have rais himself up upon the seat wa beat him as hard as he could with a littl stick which he carri in hi hand and when he saw our eye were on him he sate down i believ veri sorri to resign hi offic the hors slacken hi pace and no accid happen when we had ascend halfway up the hill direct by the man i took a nearer footpath and at the top came in view of a most impress scene a ruin castl on an island almost in the middl of the last compart of the lake back by a mountain cove down which came a roar stream the castl occupi everi foot of the island that wa visibl to us appear to rise out of the water

the wall broken down though complet in ruin after have stood some minut i join william on the high road and both wish to stay longer near thi place we request the man to drive hi littl boy on to dalmal about two mile further and leav the car at the inn he told us that the ruin wa call kilchurn castl that it belong to lord breadalban and had been built by one of the ladi of that famili for her defenc dure her lord absenc at the crusad for which purpos she levi a tax of seven year rent upon her tenant he said that from that side of the lake it did not appear in veri dri weather to stand upon an island but that it wa possibl to go over to it without be wetshod we were veri lucki in see it after a great flood for it enchant effect wa chiefli owe to it situat in the lake a decay palac rise out of the plain of water i have call it a palac for such feel it gave to me though have been built as a place of defenc a castl or fortress we turn again and reascend the hill and sate a long time in

loch awe child of loudthroat war the mountain stream roar in thi hear but thi hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thi age we walk up the hill again and look down the vale had a fine view of the lake and island resembl the view down windermer though much less rich our walk to dalmal wa pleasant the vale make a turn to the right beyond the head of the lake and the villag of dalmal which is in fact onli a few hut the mans or minist hous the chapel and the inn stand near the river which flow into the head of the lake the whole vale is veri pleas the lower part of the hillsid be sprinkl

we were go to glen coe he advis us instead of proceed directli to tyndrum the next stage to go round by the outlet of loch awe to loch etiv and thenc to glen coe we were glad to chang our plan for we want much to see more of loch awe and he told us that the whole of the way by loch etiv wa pleasant and the road to tyndrum as dreari as possibl inde we could see it at that time sever mile befor us upon the side of a bleak mountain and he said that there wa noth but moor and mountain all the way we reach the inn a littl befor sunset order supper and i walk out cross a bridg to look more nearli at the parsonagehous and the chapel which stand upon a bank close to the river a pretti stream overhung in some part by tree the vale is veri pleas but like all the other scotch vale we had yet seen it told of it kinship with the mountain and of poverti or some neglect on the part of man thursday septemb stwe had been attend at supper by a civil boy whom we engag to rous us at six oclock and to provid us each a basin of milk and bread and have the car readi all which he did punctual and we were off in good time the morn wa not unpleas though rather cold and we had some fear of rain cross the bridg and pass by the mans and chapel our road carri us back again in the direct we had come but on the opposit side of the river pass close to mani of the hous we had seen on the hillsid which the lame gentleman had told us belong to lord breadalban and were attach to littl farm or croft as he call them lord breadalban had late laid out a part of hi estat in thi way as an experi in the hope of prevent discont and emigr we were sorri we had not an opportun of see into these cottag and of learn how far the peopl were happi or otherwis the dwell certainli did not look so comfort when we were

her singl cow while it wa feed on the slip of grass between the cornground went round the head of the lake and onward close to the lakesid kilchurn castl wa alway interest though not so grand as seen from the other side with it own mountain cove and roar stream it combin with the vale of dalmal and the distant hillsa beauti scene yet overspread with a gentl desol as we went further down we lost sight of the vale of dalmal the castl which we often stop to look back upon wa veri beauti seen in combin with the opposit shore of the lakeperhap a littl bay a tuft of tree or a slope of the hill travel under the foot of the mountain cruachan along an excel road have the lake close to us on our left wood overhead and frequent torrent tumbl down the hill the distant view across the lake were not peculiarli interest after we were out of sight of kilchurn castl the lake be wide and the opposit shore not rich and those mountain which we could see were not high came opposit to the villag where we had dine the day befor and lose sight of the bodi of the lake pursu the narrow channel or pass which is i believ three mile long out of which issu the river that flow into loch etiv we were now enclos between steep hill on the opposit side entir bare on our side bare or woodi the branch of the lake gener fill the whole area of the vale it wa a pleas solitari scene the long reach of nake precipic on the other side rose directli out of the water exceedingli steep not rug or rocki but with scanti sheep pasturag and larg bed of small stone purpl dovecolour or red such as are call scree in cumberland and westmoreland these bed or rather stream of stone appear as smooth as the turf itself nay i might say as soft as the feather of bird which they resembl in colour there wa no build on either side of the water in mani part onli just room for the road and on the other shore no foot as it might seem for ani creatur larger than the mountain sheep and they in tread amongst the shelv stone must often send them down into the lake below footnot the pass of awej c s after we had wound for some time through the valley have met neither foottravel hors nor cart we start at the sight of a singl vessel just as it turn round the point of a hill come into the reach of the valley where we were she float steadili through the middl of the water with one larg sail spread out full swollen by the breez that blew her right toward us i can not express what romant imag thi vessel brought along with herhow much more beauti the mountain appear the lake how much more grace there wa one man on board who sate at the helm and he have no companion made the boat look more silent than if we could not have seen him i had almost said the ship for on that narrow water it appear as larg as the ship which i have watch sail out of a harbour of the sea a littl further on we pass a stone hut by the lakesid near which were mani charcoal sack and we conjectur that the vessel had been deposit charcoal brought from other part of loch awe to be carri to the ironwork at loch etiv a littl further on we came to the end of the lake but where exactli it end wa not easi to determin for the river wa as broad as the lake and we could onli say when it becam posit a river by the rush of the water it is inde a grand stream the quantiti of water be veri larg frequent form rapid and alway flow veri quickli but it great is shortliv for after a cours of three mile it is lost in the great water of loch etiv a sea loch cross a bridg and climb a hill toward taynuilt our baitingplac we saw a hollow to the right below us through which the river continu it cours between rock and steep bank of wood william turn asid to look into the dell but i wa too much tire we had left it two or three hundr yard behind an open river the hill enclos the branch of the lake have settl down into irregular slope we were glad when we reach taynuilt a villag of hut with a chapel and one stone hous which wa the inn it had begun to rain and i wa almost benumb with the cold besid have a bad headach so it rejoic me to see kind look on the landladi face and that she wa will to put herself in a bustl for our comfort we had a good fire present and breakfast wa set outegg preserv gooseberri excel cream chees and butter but no wheat bread and the oaten cake were so hard i could not chew them we wish to go upon loch

procur a boat it rain heavili but we went on hope the sky would clear up walk through unenclos field a sort of halfdesol countri but when we came to the mouth of the river which issu out of loch awe and which we had to cross by a ferri look up that river we saw that the vale down which it flow wa richli wood and beauti we were now among familiar firesid name we could see the town of bunaw a place of which the old woman with whom william lodg ten year at hawkshead use to tell tale half as long as an ancient romanc it is a small villag or port on the same side of loch etiv on which we stood and at a littl distanc is a hous built by a mr knott of coniston waterhead a partner in the ironfoundri at bunaw in the servic of whose famili the old woman had spent her youth it wa an ugli yellowdaub build stare thi way and that but william look at it with pleasur for poor ann tyson sake we hail the ferryboat and a littl boy came to fetch us he row up against the stream with all hi might for a consider way and then yield to it the boat wa shot toward the shore almost like an arrow from a bow it wa pleas to observ the dexter with which the lad manag hi oar glori in the appear of dangerfor he observ us watch him and afterward while he convey us over hi pride redoubl for my part i wa complet dizzi with the swift of the motion footnot the villag dame with whom he live when a schoolboy at hawkshead we could not have a boat from the ferri but were told that if we would walk to a hous half a mile up the river we had a chanc of get one i went a part of the way with william and then sate down under the umbrella near some hous a woman came out to talk with me and press me to take shelter in her hous which i refus afraid of miss william she eye me with extrem curios ask fifti question respect the object of our journey she told me that it rain most part of the year there and that there wa no chanc of fine weather that day and i believ when william came to tell me that we could have a boat she thought i wa half craze we went down to the shore of the lake and after have sate some time under a wall the boatman came to us and we went upon the water at first it did not rain heavili and the air wa not cold and befor we had gone far we rejoic that we had not been faintheart the loch is of a consider width but the mountain are so veri high that whether we were close under them or look from one shore to the other they maintain their digniti i speak of the higher part of the loch abov the town of bunaw and the larg river for downward they are but hill and the water spread out wide toward undetermin shore on our right wa the mountain cruachan rise directli from the lake and on the opposit side anoth mountain call ben durinish craggi and exceedingli steep with wild wood grow among the rock and stone footnot duirinnis we cross the water which wa veri rough in the middl but calmer near the shore and some of the rocki basin and littl creek among the rock were as still as a mirror and they were so beauti with the reflect of the orangecolour seawe grow on the stone or rock that a child with a child delight in gay colour might have danc with joy at the sight of them it never ceas rain and the top of the mountain were conceal by mist but as long as we could see across the water we were content for though littl could be seen of the true shape and perman appear of the mountain we saw enough to give us the most exquisit delight the power lake which fill the larg vale roar torrent cloud float on the mountain side sheep that pastur there seabird and land bird we sail a consider way without come to ani hous or cultiv field there wa no horseroad on either side of the loch but a person on foot as the boatman told us might make hi way at the foot of ben durinish name on that side of the loch on which we were there wa howev not the least track to be seen and it must be veri difficult and labori we happen to say that we were go to glen coe which would be the journey of a long day and a half when one of the men point to the head of the loch repli that if we were there we should be but an hour walk from glen coe though it continu rain and there wa no hope that the rain would ceas we could not help wish to go by that way it wa an adventur we were not afraid of trust ourselv to the hospit of the highland and we want to give our hors a day rest hi back have been gall by the saddl the owner of the boat who understood english much better than the other man hi helper said he would make inquiri about the road at a farmhous a littl further on he wa veri readi to talk with us and wa rather an interest companion he spoke after a slow and solemn manner in book and sermon languag and phrase a state speech such as grave liver do in scotland use footnot see resolut and independ stanza xive when we came to the farmhous of which the man had spoken william and he land to make the necessari inquiri it wa a thatch hous at the foot of the high mountain ben durinisha few patch or littl bed of corn belong to it but the spot wa pastor the green grass grow to the wall of the hous the dwellinghous wa distinguish from the outer build which were numer make it look like two or three hous as is common in scotland by a chimney and one small window with sashpan on one side wa a littl woodi glen with a precipit stream that fell into the bay which wa perfectli still and border with the rich orangecolour reflect from the seawe cruachan on the other side of the lake wa exceedingli grand and appear of an enorm height spread out two larg arm that made a cove down which fell mani stream swoln by the rain and in the hollow of the cove were some hut which look like a villag the top of the mountain wa conceal from us by cloud and the mist float high and low upon the side of it william came back to the boat highli pleas with the cheer hospit and kind of the woman of the hous who would scarc permit him and hi guid to go away without take some refresh she wa the onli person at home so they could not obtain the desir inform but william had been well repaid for the troubl of land inde raini as it wa i regret that i had not land also for i should have wish to bear away in my memori a perfect imag of thi placeth view from the door as well as the simpl highland comfort and contriv which were near it i think i never saw a retir that would have so complet satisfi me if i had want to be altogeth shut out from the world and at the same time among the grandest of the work of god but it must be rememb that mountain are often so much dignifi by cloud mist and other accid of weather that one could not know them again in the full sunshin of a summer noon but whatev the mountain may be in their own shape the farmhous with it pastor ground and corn field won from the mountain it warm outhous in irregular stage one abov anoth on the side of the hill the rock the stream and shelter bay must at all time be interest object the household boat lay at anchor chain to a rock which like the whole border of the lake wa edg with seawe and some fishingnet were hung upon polesaffect imag which led our thought out to the wide ocean yet made these solitud of the mountain bear the impress of greater safeti and more deep seclus the rain becam so heavi that we should certainli have turn back if we had not felt more than usual courag from the pleasur we had enjoy which rais hope where none wa there were some hous a littl higher up and we determin to go thither and make further inquiri we could now hardli see to the other side of the lake yet continu to go on and present heard some peopl push through a thicket close to us on which the boatman call out there one that can tell us someth about the road to glen coe for he wa born there we look up and saw a rag lame fellow follow by some other with a fishingrod over hi shoulder and he wa make such good speed through the bough that one might have half believ he wa the better for hi lame leg he wa the head of a compani of tinker who as the men told us travel with their fishingrod as duli as their hammer on be hail by us the whole compani stop and their lame leader and our boatmen shout to each other in ersea savag cri to our ear in that lone and romant place we could not learn from the tinker all we wish to know therefor when we came near to the hous william land again with the owner of the boat the rain wa now so heavi that we could see noth at allnot even the hous whither william wa go we had given up all thought of proceed further at that time but were desir to know how far that road to glen coe wa practic for us they met with an intellig man who wa at work with other in a hay field though it rain so heavili he gave them the inform they desir and said that there wa an acquaint of hi between that place and glen coe who he had no doubt would gladli accommod us with lodg and anyth els we might need when william return to the boat we shape our cours back again down the water leav the head of loch etiv not onli unvisit but unseento our great regret the rain wa veri heavi the wind had risen and both wind and tide were against us so that it wa hard labour for the boatmen to push us on they kept as close to the shore as they could to be under the wind but at the doubl of mani of the rocki point the tide wa so strong that it wa difficult to get on at all and i wa sometim afraid that we should be dash against the rock though i believ inde there wa not much danger came down the same side of the lake under ben durinish and land at a ferryhous opposit to bunaw where we gave the men a glass of whiski but our chief motiv for land wa to look about the place which had a most wild aspect at that time it wa a low promontori push far into the water narrow the lake exceedingli in the obscur occas by the mist and rain it appear to be an island it wa stain and weatherbeaten a rocki place seem to bear no produc but such as might be cherish by cold and storm lichen or the incrust

eight mile down loch etiv and then to cross a ferri our road wa at first at a consider distanc from the lake and out of sight of it among undul hill cover with coppic wood resembl the countri between coniston and windermer but it afterward carri us close to the water edg and in thi part of our ride we were disappoint we knew that the high mountain were all at the head of the lake therefor had not expect the same aw grandeur which we beheld the day befor and perceiv by glimps but the gentleman whom we met with at dalmal had told us that there were mani fine situat for gentlemen seat on thi part of the lake which had made us expect greater loveli near the shore and better cultiv it is true there are pleasant bay with ground prettili slope to the water and coppic wood where hous would stand in shelter and sun look on the lake but much is yet wantingwast land to be plough peatmoss drain hedgerow rear and the wood demand a grant of longer life than is now their privileg but after we had journey about six mile a beauti scene open upon us the morn had been gloomi and at thi time the sun shone out scatter the cloud we look right down the lake that wa cover with stream of dazzl sunshin which reveal the indent of the dark shore on a bold promontori on the same side of the loch where we were stood an old castl an irregular tall build not without majesti and beyond with leagu of water between our eye settl upon the island of mull a high mountain green in the sunshin and overcast with cloudsan object as invit to the fanci as the even sky in the west and though of a terrestri green almost as visionari we saw that it wa an island of the sea but were unacquaint with it name it wa of a gemlik colour and as soft as the sky the shore of loch etiv in their moorish rocki wild their earthli bare as they lay in length befor us produc a contrast which with the pure sea the brilliant sunshin the long distanc contribut to the aërial and romant power with which the mountain island wa invest soon after we came to the ferri the boat be on the other shore we had to wait a consider time though the water wa not wide and our call wa heard immedi the boatmen move with surli tardi as if glad to make us know that they were our master at thi point the lake wa narrow to the breadth of not a veri wide river by a round ear or promontori on the side on which we were and a low ridg of peatmossi ground on the other it wa a dreari place shut out from the beauti prospect of the isl of mull and dunstaffnag castleso the fortress wa call four or five men came over with the boat the hors wa unyok and be harshli driven over rough stone which were as slipperi as ice with slimi seawe he wa in terror befor he reach the boat and they complet the work by beat and push him by main forc over the ridg of the boat for there wa no open end or plank or ani other conveni for ship either hors or carriag i wa veri uneasi when we were launch on the water a blackguardlook fellow blind of one eye which i could not but think had been put out in some strife or other held him by forc like a horsebreak while the poor creatur fret and stamp with hi feet against the bare board frighten himself more and more with everi stroke and when we were in the middl of the water i would have given a thousand pound to have been sure that we should reach the other side in safeti the tide wa rush violent in make a strong eddi with the stream of the loch so that the motion of the boat and the nois and foam of the wave terrifi him still more and we thought it would be imposs to keep him in the boat and when we were just far enough from the shore to have been all drown he becam furiou and plung desper hi hindleg were in the water then recov himself he beat with such forc against the boatsid that we were afraid he should send hi feet through all the while the men were swear terribl oath and curs the poor beast redoubl their curs when we reach the landingplac and whip him ashor in brutal triumph we had onli room for half a heart of joy when we set foot on dri land for anoth ferri wa to be cross five mile further we had intend breakfast at thi hous if it had been a decent place but after thi affair we were glad to pay the men off and depart though i wa not well and need refresh the peopl made us more easi by assur us that we might easili swim the hors over the next ferri the first mile or two of our road wa over a peatmoss we then came near to the seashor and had beauti view backward toward the island of mull and dunstaffnag castl and forward where the sea ran up between the hill in thi part on the opposit side of the small bay or elbow of the sea wa a gentleman hous on a hillsid and a build on the hilltop which we took for a lighthous but were told that it belong to the mansion and wa onli light up on rejoic daysth laird birthday for instanc footnot lochnel housej c s befor we had left the peatmoss to travel close to the seashor we delight ourselv with look on a rang of green hill in shape like those border immedi upon the sea abrupt but not high they were in fact a continu of the same but retir backward and rise from the black peatmoss these hill were of a delic green uncommon in scotland a foam rivulet ran down one part and near it lay two herdsmen full in the sun with their dog among a troop of black cattl which were feed near and sprinkl over the whole rang of hillsa pastor scene to our eye the more beauti from know what a delight prospect it must overlook we now came under the steep by the seasid which were bold rock moulder scar or fresh with green grass under the brow of one of these rock wa a buryingground with mani upright graveston and haycock between and fenc round by a wall neatli sod near it were one or two hous with outhous under a group of tree but no chapel the neat of the buryingground would in itself have been notic in ani part of scotland where we have been but it wa more interest from it situat than for it own sakewithin the sound of the gentlest wave of the sea and near so mani quiet and beauti object there wa a rang of hill opposit which we were here first told were the hill of morven so much sung of by ossian we consult with some men respect the ferri who advis us by all mean to send our hors round the loch and go ourselv over in the boat they were veri civil and seem to be intellig men yet all disagre about the length of the loch though we were not two mile from it one said it wa onli six mile long anoth ten or fifteen and afterward a man whom we met told us it wa twenti we lost sight of the sea for some time cross a halfcultiv space then reach loch creran a larg irregular sea loch with low slope bank coppic wood and uncultiv ground with a scatter of corn field as it appear to us veri thinli inhabit mountain at a distanc we found onli women at home at the ferryhous i wa faint and cold and went to sit by the fire but though veri much need refresh i had not heart to eat anyth thereth hous wa so dirti and there were so mani wretchedli dirti women and children yet perhap i might have got over the dirt though i believ there are few ladi who would not have been turn sick by it if there had not been a most disgust combin of lazi and coars in the counten and manner of the women though two of them were veri handsom it wa a small hut and four women were live in it one the mother of the children and mistress of the hous the other i suppos to be lodger or perhap servant but there wa no work amongst them they had just taken from the fire a great pan full of potato which they mix up with milk all help themselv out of the same vessel and the littl children put in their dirti hand to dig out of the mess at their pleasur i thought to myself how light the labour of such a hous as thi littl sweep no wash of floor and as to scour the tabl i believ it wa a thing never thought of after a long time the ferryman came home but we had to wait yet anoth hour for the tide in the meanwhil our hors took fright in consequ of hi terror at the last ferri ran away with the car and dash out umbrella greatcoat etc but luckili he wa stop befor ani seriou mischief wa done we had determin whatev it cost not to trust ourselv with him again in the boat but send him round the lake seem almost out of the question there be no road and probabl much difficulti in go round with a hors so after some deliber with the ferryman it wa agre that he should swim over the usual place of ferri wa veri broad but he wa led to the point of a peninsula at a littl distanc it be an unusu affairinde the peopl of the hous said that he wa the first hors that had ever swum overw had sever men on board and the mistress of the hous offer herself as an assist we suppos for the sake of a share in eighteenpennyworth of whiski which her husband call for without ceremoni and of which she and the young lass who had help to push the boat into the water partook as freeli as the men at first i fear for the hors he wa frighten and strove to push himself under the boat but i wa soon toler easi for he went on regularli and well and after from six to ten minut swim land in safeti on the other side poor creatur he stretch out hi nostril and stare wildli while the man wa trot him about to warm him and when he put him into the car he wa afraid of the sound of the wheel for some time our road wa up a glen the bank chiefli cover with coppic wood an unpeopl but though without grandeur not a dreari tract came to a moor and descend into a broad vale which open to loch linnh an arm of the sea the prospect be shut in by high mountain on which the sun wa shine among mist and rest cloud a villag and chapel stood on the opposit hill the hill slope prettili down to the bed of the vale a larg level areath ground in gener cultiv but not rich we went perhap half a mile down the vale when our road struck right across it toward the villag on the hillsid we overtook a tall welllook man seemingli about thirti year of age drive a cart of whom we inquir concern the road and the distanc to portnacroish our baitingplac we made further inquiri respect our futur journey which he answer in an intellig manner be perfectli acquaint with the geographi of scotland he told us that the villag which we saw befor us and the whole tract of countri wa call appin william said that it wa a pretti wild place to which the man repli sir it is a veri bonni place if you did but see it on a fine day mistak william prais for a halfcensur i must say howev that we hardli ever saw a thoroughli pleas place in scotland which had not someth of wild in it aspect of one sort or other it came from mani caus here the sea or sealoch of which we onli saw as it were a glimps cross the vale at the foot of it the high mountain on the opposit shore the unenclos hill on each side of the vale with black cattl feed on them the simplic of the scatter hut the halfshelt halfexpos situat of the villag the imperfect cultur of the field the distanc from ani citi or larg town and the veri name of morven and appin particularli at such a time when old ossian old friend sunbeam and mist as like ghost as ani in the midafternoon could be were keep compani with them william did all he could to effac the unpleas impress he had made on the highland and not without success for he wa kind and commun when we walk up the hill toward the villag he had been a great travel in ireland and elsewher but i believ that he had visit no place so beauti to hi eye as hi nativ home the strath of appin under the heathi hill we arriv at portnacroish soon after part from thi man it is a small villagea few hut and an indiffer inn by the side of the loch order a fowl for dinner had a fire light and went a few step from the door up the road and turn asid into a field stood at the top of a low emin from which look down the loch to the sea through a long vista of hill and mountain we beheld one of the most delight prospect that even when we dream of fairer world than thi it is possibl for us to conceiv in our heart a cover of cloud rest on the long rang of the hill of morven mist float veri near to the water on their side and were slowli shift about yet the sky wa clear and the sea from the reflect of the sky of an ether or sapphir blue which wa intermingl in mani place and mostli by gentl gradat with bed of bright dazzl sunshin green island lay on the calm water island far greener for so it seem than the grass of other place and from their excess beauti their unearthli soft and the great distanc of mani of them they made us think of the island of the bless in the vision of mirzaa resembl more strike from the long tract of mist which rest on the top of the steep of morven the view wa endless and though not so wide had someth of the intricaci of the island and water of loch lomond as we saw them from inchtavannach and yet how differ at loch lomond we could never forget that it wa an inland lake of fresh water nor here that it wa the sea itself though among multitud of hill immedi below us on an island a few yard from the shore stood an old keep or fortress the vale of appin open to the watersid with cultiv field and cottag if there were tree near the shore they contribut littl to the delight effect of the scene it wa the immeasur water the lofti mistcov steep of morven to the right the emerald island without a bush or tree the celesti colour and bright of the calm sea and the innumer creek and bay the communion of land and water as far as the eye could travel my descript must need be languid for the sight itself wa too fair to be rememb we sate a long time upon the hill and pursu our journey at about four oclock had an indiffer dinner but the chees wa so excel that william wish to buy the remaind but the woman would not consent to sell it and forc us to accept a larg portion of it footnot castl stalkerj c s we had to travel up the loch leav behind us the beauti scene which we had view with such delight befor dinner often while we were climb the hill did we stop to look back and when we had gone twenti or thirti yard beyond the point where we had the last view of it we left the car to the care of some children who were come from school and went to take anoth farewel alway in the hope of bear away a more substanti remembr travel for some mile along a road which wa so smooth it wa more like a gravel walk in a gentleman ground than a public highway probabl the countri is indebt for thi excel road to lord tweeddal now a prison in franc hi hous stand upon an emin within a mile of portnacroish command the same prospect which i have spoken of except that it must lose someth in not have the old fortress at the foot of itinde it is not to be seen at all from the hous or ground footnot georg seventh marqui of tweeddal be in franc in wa detain by bonapart and die at verdun th august j c s we travel under steep hill stoni or smooth with coppicewood and patch of cultiv land and hous here and there and at everi hundr yard i may almost ventur to say a streamlet narrow as a ribbon came tumbl down and cross our road fell into the lake below on the opposit shore the hillsnam the continu of the hill of morvenwer stern and sever rise like upright wall from the water edg and in colour more resembl rock than hill as they appear to us we did not see ani hous or ani place where it wa like a hous could stand for mani mile but as the loch wa broad we could not perhap distinguish the object thoroughli a littl after sunset our road led us from the vale of the loch we came to a small river a bridg a mill and some cottag at the foot of a hill and close to the loch did not cross the bridg but went up the brook have it on our left and soon found ourselv in a retir valley scatter over with mani grey hut and surround on everi side by green hill the hay ground in the middl of the vale were unenclos which wa enough to keep aliv the scottish wild here blend with exceed beauti for there were tree grow irregularli or in clump all through the valley rock or stone here and there which with the peopl at work haycock sprinkl over the field made the vale look full and popul it wa a sweet time of the even the moon wa up but there wa yet so much of day that her light wa not perceiv our road wa through open field the peopl suspend their work as we pass along and lean on their pitchfork or rake with their arm at their side or hang down some in one way some in anoth and no two alik they form most beauti group the outlin of their figur be much more distinct than by day and all that might have been harsh or unlov soften down the dog were as usual attend on their master and watch after us they bark aloud yet even their bark hardli disturb the quiet of the place i can not say how long thi vale wa it made the larger half of a circl or a curv deeper than that of half a circl befor it open again upon the loch it wa less thoroughli cultiv and woodi after the last turningth hill steep and lofti we met a veri tall stout man a fine figur in a highland bonnet with a littl girl drive home their cow he accost us say that we were late travel and that we had yet four mile to go befor we should reach ballachulisha long way uncertain as we were respect our accommod he told us that the vale wa call the strath of duror and when we said it wa a pretti place he answer inde it wa and that they live veri comfort there for they had a good master lord tweeddal whose imprison he lament speak earnestli of hi excel qualiti at the end of the vale we came close upon a larg bay of the loch form by a rocki hill a continu of the ridg of high hill on the left side of the strath make a veri grand promontori under which wa a hamlet a cluster of hut at the water edg with their littl fleet of fishingboat at anchor and behind among the rock a hundr slip of corn slip and patch often no bigger than a garden such as a child eight year old would make for sport it might have been the work of a small coloni from china there wa someth touch to the heart in thi appear of scrupul industri and excess labour of the soil in a countri where hill and mountain and even valley are left to the care of natur and the pleasur of the cattl that feed among them it wa inde a veri interest place the more so be in perfect contrast with the few hous at the entranc of the stratha sea hamlet without tree under a nake stoni mountain yet perfectli shelter stand in the middl of a larg bay which half the wind that travel over the lake can never visit the other a littl boweri spot with it river bridg and mill might have been a hundr mile from the seasid the moon wa now shine and though it remind us how far the even wa advanc we stop for mani minut befor we could resolv to go on we saw noth stir neither men women nor cattl but the linen wa still bleach by the stoni rivulet which ran near the hous in waterbreak and tini cataract for the first half mile after we had left thi scene there wa noth remark and afterward we could onli see the hill the sky the moon and moonlight water when we came within it might be half a mile of ballachulish the place where we were to lodg the loch narrow veri much the hill still continu high i speak inaccur for it split into two divis the one along which we went be call loch leven the road grew veri bad and we had an anxiou journey till we saw a light befor us which with great joy we assur ourselv wa from the inn but what wa our distress when on go a few step further we came to a bridg half broken down with bush laid across to prevent travel from go over after some perplex we determin that i should walk on to the hous befor usfor we could see that the bridg wa safe for footpassengersand ask for assist by great good luck at thi veri moment four or five men came along the road toward us and offer to help william in drive the car through the water which wa not veri deep at that time though onli a few day befor the damag had been done to the bridg by a flood i walk on to the inn order tea and wa conduct into a lodgingroom i desir to have a fire and wa answer with the old scrupl about give firewith at the same time an excus that it wa so lateth girl howev would ask the landladi who wa lyingin the fire wa brought immedi and from that time the girl wa veri civil i wa not howev quit at eas for william stay long and i wa go to leav my fire to seek after him when i heard him at the door with the hors and car the hors had taken fright with the rough of the riverb and the rattl of the wheelsth second fright in consequ of the ferryand the men had been oblig to unyok him and drag the car through a troublesom affair for william but he talk less of the troubl and alarm than of the pleasur he had felt in have met with such true goodwil and readi kind in the highland they drank their glass of whiski at the door wish william twenti good wish and ask him twice as mani questionsif he wa marri if he had an estat where he live etc etc thi inn is the ferryhous on the main road up into the highland by fortwilliam and here coleridg though unknown to us had slept three night befor saturday septemb rdwhen we have arriv at an unknown place by moonlight it is never a moment of indiffer when i quit it again with the morn light especi if the object have appear beauti or in ani other way impress or interest i have kept back unwil to go to the window that i might not lose the pictur taken to my pillow at night so it wa at ballachulish and instantli i felt that the pass away of my own fanci wa a loss the place had appear exceedingli wild by moonlight i had mistaken cornfield for nake rock and the lake had appear narrow and the hill more steep and lofti than they realli were we rose at six oclock and took a basin of milk befor we set forward on our journey to glen coe it wa a delight morn the road excel and we were in good spirit happi that we had no more ferri to cross and pleas with the thought that we were go among the grand mountain which we saw befor us at the head of the loch we travel close to the water edg and were roll along a smooth road when the hors suddenli back frighten by the upright shaft of a roller rise from behind the wall of a field adjoin the road william pull whip and struggl in vain we both leapt upon the ground and the hors drag the car after him he go backward down the bank of the loch and it wa turn over half in the water the hors lie on hi back struggl in the har a fright sight i gave up everyth thought that the hors would be lame and the car broken to piec luckili a man came up in the same moment and assist william in extric the hors and after an hour delay with the help of string and pockethandkerchief we mend the har and set forward again william lead the poor anim all the way for the regular beat of the wave frighten him and ani littl gush stream that cross the road would have sent him off the villag where the blacksmith live wa befor usa few hut under the mountain and as it seem at the head of the loch but it run further up to the left be narrow by a hill abov the villag near which at the edg of the water wa a slate quarri and mani larg boat with mast on the water below high mountain shut in the prospect which stood in singl distinguish shape yet cluster togethersimpl and bold in their form and their surfac of all charact and all colourssom that look as if scarifi by fire other green and there wa one that might have been blast by an etern frost it summit and side for a consider way down be as white as hoarfrost at eight oclock on a winter morn no cloud were on the hill the sun shone bright but the wind blew fresh and cold when we reach the blacksmith shop i left william to help to take care of the hors and went into the hous the mistress with a child in her arm and two or three run about receiv me veri kindli make mani apolog for the dirti hous which she partli attribut to it be saturday but i could plainli see that it wa dirt of all day i sat in the midst of it with great delight for the woman benevol happi counten almost convert her slovenli and lazi way of leav all thing to take care of themselv into a comfort and a bless it wa not a highland hut but a slate hous built by the master of the quarri for the accommod of hi blacksmithth shell of an english cottag as if left unfinish by the workmen without plaster and with floor of mud two bed with not overclean bedcloth were in the room luckili for me there wa a good fire and a boil kettl the woman wa veri sorri she had no butter none wa to be had in the villag she gave me oaten and barley bread we talk over the fire i answer her hundr question and in my turn put some to her she ask me as usual if i wa marri how mani brother i had etc etc i told her that william wa marri and had a fine boy to which she repli and the man a decent man too her nextdoor neighbour came in with a babi on her arm to request that i would accept of some fish which i broil in the ash she join in our convers but with more shyness than her neighbour be a veri young woman she happen to say that she wa a stranger in that place and had been bred and born a long way off on my ask her where she repli at leadhil and when i told her that i had been there a joy light up her counten which i shall never forget and when she heard that it wa onli a fortnight befor her eye fill with tear i wa exceedingli affect with the simplic of her manner her tongu wa now let loos and she would have talk for ever of leadhil of her mother of the quiet of the peopl in gener and the good of mr otto who she told me wa a varra discreet woman she wa sure we should be well put up at mr otto and prais her hous and furnitur inde it seem she thought all earthli comfort were gather togeth under the bleak height that surround the villag of wanlockhead and leadhil and afterward when i said it wa a wild countri thereabout she even seem surpris and said it wa not half so wild as where she live now one circumst which she mention of mr otto i must record both in proof of her discret and the sobrieti of the peopl at leadhil name that no liquor wa ever drunk in her hous after a certain hour of the nighti have forgotten what hour but it wa an earli one i am sure not later than ten the blacksmith who had come in to hi breakfast wa impati to finish our job that he might go out into the hayfield for it be a fine day everi plot of hayground wa scatter over with haymak on my say that i guess much of their hay must be spoil he told me no for that they had high wind which dri it quicklyth peopl understood the climat were clever at the work and got it in with a blink he hastili swallow hi breakfast dri bread and a basin of weak tea without sugar and held hi babi on hi knee till he had done the women and i were again left to the firesid and there were no limit to their joy in me for they discov anoth bond of connexion i live in the same part of england from which mr rose the superintend of the slatequarri and hi wife had come oh said mr stuartso her neighbour call her they not give each other their christian name as is common in cumberland and westmorelandoh said she what would not i give to see anybodi that came from within four or five mile of leadhil they both exclaim that i must see mr rose she would make much of mesh would have given me tea and bread and butter and a good breakfast i learn from the two women mr stuart and mr duncanso the other wa calledthat stuart had come from leadhil for the sake of better wage to take the place of duncan who had resign hi offic of blacksmith to the quarri as far as i could learn in a pet intend to go to america that hi wife wa avers to go and that the scheme for thi caus and through other difficulti had been given up he appear to be a goodtemp man and made us a most reason charg for mend the car hi wife told me that they must give up the hous in a short time to the other blacksmith she did not know whither they should go but her husband be a good workman could find employ anywher she hurri me out to introduc me to mr rose who wa at work in the hayfield she wa exceedingli glad to see one of her countrywomen and entreat that i would go up to her hous it wa a substanti plain hous that would have held halfadozen of the common hut she conduct me into a sittingroom upstair and set befor me red and white wine with the

certainli had no better educ than peggi ashburn but she wa as a chief in thi seclud place a madam of the villag and seem to be treat with the utmost respect in our way to and from the hous we met sever peopl who interchang friendli greet with her but alway as with one greatli superior she attend me back to the blacksmith and would not leav me till she had seen us set forward again on our journey mr duncan and mr stuart shook me cordial nay affection by the hand i tri to prevail upon the former who had been my hostess to accept of some money but in vain she would not take a farth and though i told her it wa onli to buy someth for her littl daughter even seem griev that i should think it possibl i forgot to mention that while the blacksmith wa repair the car we walk to the slatequarri where we saw again some of the kind creatur who had help us in our difficulti the night befor the hovel under which they split their slate stood upon an outjut rock a part of the quarri rise immedi out of the water and command a fine prospect down the loch below ballachulish and upward toward the grand mountain and the other horn of the vale where the lake wa conceal the blacksmith drove our car about a mile of the road we then hire a man and hors to take me and the car to the top of glen coe be afraid that if the hors back or took fright we might be thrown down some precipic but befor we depart we could not resist our inclin to climb up the hill which i have mention as appear to termin the loch the mountain though inferior to those of glen coe on the other side are veri majest and the solitud in which we knew the unseen lake wa bed at their feet wa enough to excit our long we climb steep after steep far higher than they appear to us and i wa go to give up the accomplish of our aim when a gloriou sight on the mountain befor us made me forget my fatigu a slight shower had come on it skirt fall upon us and half the opposit side of the mountain wa wrap up in rainbow light cover as by a veil with one dilat rainbow so it continu for some minut and the shower and raini cloud pass away as suddenli as they had come and the sun shone again upon the top of all the hill in the meantim we reach the wishedfor point and saw to the head of the loch perhap it might not be so beauti as we had imag it in our thought but it wa beauti enough not to disappoint usa narrow deep valley a perfect solitud without hous or hut one of the hill wa thinli sprinkl with scotch fir which appear to be the survivor of a larg forest they were the first natur wild scotch fir we had seen though thin of their number and left compar to a helpless struggl with the element we were much struck with the gloom and even grandeur of the tree hasten back again to join the car but were tempt to go a littl out of our way to look at a nice white hous belong to the laird of glen coe which stood sweetli in a green field under the hill near some tall tree and coppic wood at thi hous the horribl massacr of glen coe began which we did not know when we were there but the hous must have been rebuilt sinc that time we had a delight walk through field among cops and by a riversid we could have fanci ourselv in some part of the north of england unseen befor it wa so much like it and yet so differ i must not forget one place on the opposit side of the water where we long to livea snug white hous on the mountainsid surround by it own green field and wood the high mountain abov the loch below and inaccess but by mean of boat a beauti spot inde it wa but in the retir part of scotland a comfort white hous is itself such a pleasant sight that i believ without our know how or whi it make us look with a more love eye on the field and tree than for their own sake they deserv at about one oclock we set off william on our own hors and i with my highland driver he wa perfectli acquaint with the countri be a sort of carrier or carriermerch or shopkeep go frequent to glasgow with hi hors and cart to fetch and carri good and merchandis he knew the name of everi hill almost everi rock and i made good use of hi knowledg but partli from lazi and still more becaus it wa inconveni i took no note and now i am littl better for what he told me he spoke english toler but seldom understood what wa said to him without a what your wull we turn up to the right and were at the foot of the glenth laird hous can not be said to be in the glen the afternoon wa delightfulth sun shone the mountaintop were clear the lake glitter in the great vale behind us and the stream of glen coe flow down to it glitter among aldertre the meadow of the glen were of the freshest green one newbuilt stone hous in the first reach some hut hillock cover with wood aldertre scatter all over look backward we were remind of patterdal and the head of ulswat but forward the great of the mountain overcam everi other idea the impress wa as we advanc up to the head of thi first reach as if the glen were noth it loneli and retirementa if it made up no part of my feel the mountain were all in all that which front usi have forgotten it namewa exceedingli lofti the surfac stoni nay the whole mountain wa one mass of stone wrinkl and pucker up togeth at the second and last reachfor it is not a wind valeit make a quick turn almost at right angl to the first and now we are in the depth of the mountain no tree in the glen onli green pasturag for sheep and here and there a plot of hayground and someth that tell of former cultiv i observ thi to the guid who said that formerli the glen had had mani inhabit and that there as elsewher in the highland there had been a great deal of corn where now the land were left wast and noth fed upon them but cattl i can not attempt to describ the mountain i can onli say that i thought those on our rightfor the other side wa onli a continu high ridg or craggi barrier broken along the top into petti spiral formswer the grandest i had ever seen it seldom happen that mountain in a veri clear air look exceedingli high but these though we could see the whole of them to their veri summit appear to me more majest in their own naked than our imagin could have conceiv them to be had they been half hidden by cloud yet show some of their highest pinnacl they were such form as milton might be suppos to have had in hi mind when he appli to satan that sublim express hi statur reach the sky the first divis of the glen as i have said wa scatter over with rock tree and woodi hillock and cottag were to be seen here and there the second divis is bare and stoni huge

impress scene our road frequent cross larg stream of stone left by the mountaintorr lose all appear of a road after we had pass the tarn the glen becam less interest or rather the mountain from the manner in which they are look at but again a littl higher up they resum their grandeur the river is for a short space hidden between steep rock we left the road and go to the top of one of the rock saw it foam over stone or lodg in dark black den birchtre grew on the inaccess bank and a few old scotch fir tower abov them at the entranc of the glen the mountain had been all without tree but here the birch climb veri far up the side of one of them opposit to us half conceal a rivulet which came tumbl down as white as snow from the veri top of the mountain leav the rock we ascend a hill which termin the glen we often stop to look behind at the majest compani of mountain we had left befor us wa no singl paramount emin but a mountain wast mountain beyond mountain and a barren hollow or basin into which we were descend we part from our companion at the door of a whiski hovel a build which when it came out of the workmen hand with it unglass window would in that forlorn region have been littl better than a howl place for the wind and wa now half unroof on see a smoke i exclaim is it possibl ani peopl can live there when at least half a dozen men women and children came to the door they were about to rebuild the hut and i suppos that they or some other poor creatur would dwell there through the winter deal out whiski to the starv travel the sun wa now set the air veri cold the

contrast with the ground which wa of a dull earthi brown long as the line of road appear befor us we could scarc believ it to be three milesi suppos owe to it be unbroken by ani one object and the

dwarfish potato which had no doubt been rais by mean of the dung left by travel hors they had not come to blossom and whether they would either yield fruit or blossom i know not the first thing we saw on enter the door wa two sheep hung up as if just kill from the barren moor their bone hardli sheath in flesh after we had wait a few minut look about for a guid to lead us into some corner of the

as a hous after a sale on a raini day and the room be larg and the wall nake they look as if more than half the good had been sold out we sate shiver in one of the larg room for threequart of an hour befor the woman could find time to speak to us again she then promis a fire in anoth room after two travel who were go a stage further had finish their whiski and said we should have supper as soon as possibl she had no egg no milk no potato no loafbread or we should have prefer tea with length of time the fire wa kindl and after anoth hour wait supper camea shoulder of mutton so hard that it wa imposs to chew the littl flesh that might be scrape off the bone and some sorri soup made of barley and water for it had no other tast after supper the woman have first ask if we slept on blanket brought in two pair of sheet which she beg that i would air by the fire for they would be dirti belowstair i wa veri will but behold the sheet were so wet that it would have been at least a twohour job befor a far better fire than could be muster at king housefor that noth might be want to make it a place of complet starvat the peat were not dri and if they had not been help out by decay wood dug out of the earth along with them we should have had no fire at all the woman wa civil in her fierc wild way she and the hous upon that desol and extens wild and everyth we saw made us think of one of those place of rendezv which we read of in novelsferdinand count fathom or gil blaswher there is one woman to receiv the booti and prepar the supper at night she told us that she wa onli a servant but that she had now live there five year and that when but a young lassi she had live there also we ask her if she had alway serv the same master nay nay mani master for they were alway chang i

we went to bed we talk over our day adventur by the firesid and often look out of the window toward a huge pyramid mountain at the entranc of glen coe all between the dreari wast wa clear almost as

prove better than we expect and we had not slept ill but poor coleridg had pass a wretch night here four day befor thi we did not know but sinc when he told us of it the notion of what he must have suffer with the nois of drunken peopl about hi ear all night himself sick and tire ha made our discomfort cling to my memori and given these recollect a twofold interest i ask if it wa possibl to have

earli when we set off for everyth at king hous wa in unisonequ uncomfort as the woman had told us the night befor they had no hay and that wa a loss there were neither stall nor bed in the stabl so that william wa oblig to watch the hors while it wa feed for there were sever other in the stabl all stand like wild beast readi to devour each other portion of corn thi with the slow of the servant and other hindranc took up much time and we were complet starv for the morn wa veri cold as i believ all the morn in that desol place are when we had gone about a quarter of a mile i recollect that i had left the littl cup given me by the kind landladi at taynuilt which i had intend that john should hereaft drink out of in memori of our wander i would have turn back for it but william push me on unwil that we should lose so much time though inde he wa as sorri to part with it as myself our road wa over a hill call the black mount for the first mile or perhap more after we left king hous we ascend on foot then came upon a new road one of the finest that wa ever trod and as we went downward almost all the way afterward we travel veri quickli the motion wa pleasant the differ reach and wind of the road were amus the sun shone the mountaintop were clear and cheer and we in good spirit in a bustl of enjoy though there never wa a more desol region mountain behind befor and on everi

such a countri as thi we had travel perhap seven and a half mile thi morn when after descend a hill we turn to the right and saw an unexpect sight in the moorland hollow into which we were enter a small lake bound on the opposit side by a grove of scotch fir two or three cottag at the head of it and a lot of cultiv ground with scatter haycock the road along which we were go after have made a

offstraggl to the border of the lake and under the tree on the slope ground in con over our mani wander i shall never forget the gentl pleasur with which we greet the lake of inveroran and it few grey cottag we suffer our hors to slacken hi pace have now no need of the comfort of quick motion though we were glad to think that one of those cottag might be the publichous where we were to breakfast a forestnow as it appear dwindl into the small grove border the lakehad not mani year ago spread to that side of the vale where we were larg stump of tree which had been cut down were yet remain undecay and there were some singl tree left aliv as if by their batter black bough to tell us of the storm that visit the valley which look now so sober and peac when we arriv at the hut one of them prove to be the inn a thatch hous without a signboard we were kindli receiv had a fire light in the parlour and were in such good humour that we seem to have a thousand comfort about us but we had need of a littl patienc in addit to thi good humour befor breakfast wa brought and at last it prove a disappoint the butter not eatabl the barleycak fusti the oatbread so hard i could not chew it and there were

i have said near the lakesid and through the grove of fir which extend backward much further than we had imagin after we had left it we came again among bare moorish wast as befor under the mountain so that inveroran still live in our recollect as a favour place a flower in the desert descend upon the whole i believ veri consider in our way to tyndrum but it wa a road of long up and down over

conceal and partli point out it cours arriv at tyndrum at about two oclock it is a cold spot though as i should suppos situat lower than inveroran and though we saw it in the hottest time of the afternoon sun it had a far colder aspect from the want of tree we were here inform that coleridg who we suppos wa gone to edinburgh had dine at thi veri hous a few day befor in hi road to fortwilliam by the help of the cook who wa call in the landladi made out the veri day it wa the day after we part from him as she express it the day after the great speet name the great rain we had a moorfowl and muttonchop for dinner well cook and a reason charg the hous wa clean for a scotch inn and the peopl about the door were well dress in one of the parlour we saw a compani of nine or ten with the landladi seat round a plenti tablea sight which made us think of the fat calf in the alehous pictur of the prodig son there seem to be a whole harvest of meat and drink and there wa someth of festiv and picturelik gaieti even in the freshcolour dress of the peopl and their sunday face the white tablecloth glass english dish etc were all in contrast with what we had seen at inveroran the place were but about nine mile asund both among hill the rank of the peopl littl differ and each hous appear to be a hous of plenti we were i think better pleas with our treatment at thi inn than ani of the lone hous on the road except taynuilt but coleridg had not fare so well and wa dissatisfi as he ha sinc told us and the two travel who breakfast with us at inveroran had given a bad account of the hous left tyndrum at about five oclock a gladsom afternoon the road excel and we bowl downward through a pleasant vale though not popul or well cultiv or woodi but enliven by a river that glitter as it flow on the side of a sunni hill a knot of men and women were gather togeth at a preach we pass by mani drove of cattl and shetland poni which accid stamp a charact upon place els unrememberablenot an individu charact but the soul the spirit and solitari simplic of mani a highland region we had about eleven mile to travel befor we came to our lodg and had gone five or six almost alway descend and still in the same vale when we saw a small lake befor us after the vale had made a bend to the left it wa about sunset when we came up to the lake the afternoon breez had die away and the water wa in perfect still one grovelik island with a ruin that stood upon it overshadow by the tree wa reflect on the water thi build which on that beauti even seem to be wrap up in religi quiet we were inform had been rais for defenc by some highland chieftain all trace of strength or war or danger are pass away and in the mood in which we were we could onli look upon it as a place of retir and peac the lake is call loch dochart we pass by two other of inferior beauti and continu to travel along the side of the same river the dochart through an irregular undetermin valepoor soil and much wast land at

were much pleas with the situat of our inn where we arriv between eight and nine oclock the river wa at the distanc of a broad field from the door we could see it from the upper window and hear it murmur the moon shone enliven the larg corn field with cheer light we had a bad supper and the next morn they made us an unreason charg and the servant wa uncivil becaus forsooth we had no wine nbthe

from one end to the other there are few bay no lurkingplac where the water hide itself in the land no outjut point or promontori no island and there are no command mountain or precipic i think that

believ fifteen or sixteen mile but in the cours of thi we turn out of our way to the fall of moness a stream tributari to the tay which pass through a narrow glen with veri steep bank a path like a

they tumbl from a great height and are inde veri beauti fall and we could have sate with pleasur the whole morn besid the cool basin in which the water rest surround by high rock and overhang tree in one of the most retir part of the dell we met a young man come slowli along the path intent upon a book which he wa read he did not seem to be of the rank of a gentleman though abov that of a peasant pass through the villag of aberfeldi at the foot of the glen of moness the birk of aberfeldi are spoken of in some of the scotch song which no doubt grew in the stream of moness but near the villag we did not see ani tree that were remark except a row of laburnum grow as a common field hedg their leav were of a golden colour and as live as the yellow blossom could have been in the spring afterward we saw mani laburnum in the wood which we were told had been plant though i rememb that wither speak of the laburnum as one of the british plant and grow in scotland the twig and branch be stiff were not so grace as those of our garden laburnum but i do not think i ever befor saw ani that were of so brilliant colour in their autumn decay in our way to and from moness we cross the tay by a bridg of ambiti and ugli architectur mani of the bridg in scotland are so have eyehol between the arch not in the battlement but at the outspread of the pillar of the arch which destroy it simplic and take from the appear of strength and secur without ad anyth of light we return by the same road to the villag of weem where we had left our car the vale of tay wa veri wide have been so from within a short

further besid the pass of killicranki wa within half a mile and we were unwil to go through a place so celebr in the dark therefor be join by a travel we inquir if there wa ani publichous near he said there wa and that though the accommod were not good we might do well enough for one night the host and hi wife be veri honest peopl it prove to be rather better than a common cottag of the countri we seat ourselv by the fire william call for a glass of whiski and ask if they could give us bed the woman posit refus to lodg us though we had everi reason to believ that she had at least one bed for me we entreat again and again in behalf of the poor hors but all in vain she urg though in an uncivil way that she had been sit up the whole of one or two night befor on account of a fair and that now she want to go to bed and sleep so we were oblig to remount our car in the dark and with a tire hors we move on and went through the pass of killicranki hear onli the roar of the river and see a black chasm with jaggedtop black hill tower abov afterward the moon rose and we should not have had an unpleas ride if our hors had been in better plight and we had not been annoy as we were almost at everi twenti yard by peopl come from a fair held that day near blairno pleasant prognost of what might be our accommod at the inn where we arriv between ten and eleven oclock and found the hous in an uproar but we were civilli treat and were glad after eat a morsel of cold beef to retir to rest and i fell asleep in spite of the noisi drunkard below stair who had outstay the fair wednesday septemb throse earli and went befor breakfast to the duke of athol garden and pleasureground where we complet tire ourselv with a threehour walk have been direct to see all the waterfal we submit ourselv to the garden who drag us from place to place call our attent to it might be halfadozeni can not say how manydrip stream veri pretti in themselv if we had had the pleasur of discov them but they were gener rob of their grace by the obtrus ornament which were first seen the whole neighbourhood a great countri seem to belong to the duke of athol in hi domain are hill and mountain glen and spaciou plain river and innumer torrent but near blair are no old wood and the plantat except those at a littl distanc from the hous appear inconsider be lost to the eye in so extens a circuit the castl stand on low ground and far from the garri command a prospect all round of distant mountain a bare and cold scene and from the irregular and width of it not so grand as one should expect know the great height of some of the mountain within the duke park are three glen the glen of the river tilt and two other which if they had been plant more judici would have been veri sweet retir but they are choke up the whole hollow of the glensi do not speak of the tilt for that is rich in natur woodb close plant with tree and those chiefli fir but mani of the old firtre are as singl tree veri fine on each side of the glen is an ellwid gravel walk which the garden told us wa swept onc a week it is conduct at the top of the bank on each side at nearli equal height and equal distanc from the stream they lead you up one of these path and down the otherveri wearisom as you will believemil after mile we went into the garden where there wa plenti of fruitgooseberri hang as thick as possibl upon the tree readi to drop off i thought the garden might have invit us to refresh ourselv with some of hi fruit after our long fatigu one part of the garden wa decor with statu imag as poor mr gill use to call those at racedown dress in gay paint cloth and in a retir corner of the ground under some tall tree appear the figur of a favourit old gamekeep of one of the former duke in the attitud of point hi gun at the gamereport to be a strike like said the garden look at some of the tall larch with long hairi twig veri beauti tree he told us that they were among the first which had ever been plant in scotland that a duke of athol had brought a singl larch from london in a pot in hi coach from which had sprung the whole famili that had overspread scotland thi probabl might not be accur for other might afterward have come or seed from other tree he told us mani anecdot of the present duke which i wish i could perfectli rememb he is an indefatig sportsman hunt the wild deer on foot attend by twelv highland in the highland dress which he himself formerli use to wear he will go out at four oclock in the morn and not return till night hi fine famili athol honest men and athol bonni lass to whom burn in hi bumper drank health and long life are dwindl away of nine i believ onli four are left the mother of them is dead in a consumpt and the duke marri again we rest upon the heather seat which burn wa so loth to quit that moonlight even when he first went to blair castl and had a pleasur in think that he had been under the same shelter and view the littl waterfal opposit with some of the happi and pure feel of hi better mind the castl ha been modern which ha spoil it appear it is a larg irregular pile not handsom but i think may have been picturesqu and even nobl befor it wa dock of it battlement and whitewash the most interest object we saw at blair wa the chapel shade by tree in which the bodi of the impetu dunde lie buri thi quiet spot is seen from the window of the inn whenc you look at the same time upon a high wall and a part of the towna contrast which i know not whi made the chapel and it grove appear more peac as if kept so for some sacr purpos we had a veri nice breakfast which we saunter over after our weari walk be come to the most northerli point of our destin cours we took out the map loth to turn our back upon the highland and look about for someth which we might yet see we fix our eye upon two or three spot not far distant and sent for the landlord to consult with him one of them wa loch rannoch a freshwat lake which he told us wa border by a natur pine forest that it bank were popul and that the place be veri remot we might there see much of the simplic of the highland life the landlord said that we must take a guid for the first nine or ten mile but afterward the road wa plain befor us and veri good so at about ten oclock we depart have engag a man to go with us the fall of bruar which we wish to visit for the sake of burn are about three mile from blair and our road wa in the same direct for two mile after have gone for some time under a bare hill we were told to leav the car at some cottag and pass through a littl gate near a brook which cross the road we walk upward at least three quarter of a mile in the hot sun with the stream on our right both side of which to a consider height were plant with fir and larch intermingledchildren of poor burnss song for hi sake we wish that they had been the natur tree of scotland birch ash mountainash etc howev sixti or seventi year henc they will be no unworthi monument to hi memori at present noth can be uglier than the whole chasm of the hillsid with it formal walk i do not mean to condemn them for for aught i know they are as well manag as they could be but it is not easi to see the use of a pleasurepath lead to noth up a steep and nake hill in the midst of an unlov tract of countri though by the side of a tumbl stream of clear water it doe not sure deserv the name of a pleasurepath it is three mile from the duke of athol hous and i do not believ that one person live within five mile of the place would wish to go twice to it the fall are high the rock and stone fret and gnaw by the water i do not wonder at the pleasur which burn receiv from thi stream i believ we should have been much pleas if we had come upon it as he did at the bottom of the hill we took up our car and turn back join the man who wa to be our guid cross the garri and went along a moor without ani road but straggl carttrack soon began to ascend a high hill and the ground grew so roughroad there wa nonethat we were oblig to walk most of the way ascend to a consider height and command an extens prospect bound by lofti mountain and have cross the top of the fell we part with our guid be in sight of the vale into which we were to descend and to pursu upward till we should come to loch rannoch a lake as describ to us bed in a forest of scotch pine when left to ourselv we sate down on the hillsid and look with delight into the deep vale below which wa exceedingli green not regularli fenc or cultiv but the level area scatter over with bush and tree and through that level ground glide a glassi river not in serpentin wind but in direct turn backward and forward and then flow into the head of the lake of tummel but i will copi a rough sketch which i made while we sate upon the hill which imperfect as it is will give a better idea of the cours of the riverwhich i must add is more curiou than beautifulthan my descript the ground must be often overflow in winter for the water seem to touch the veri edg of it bank at thi time the scene wa soft and cheer such as invit us downward and made us proud of our adventur come near to a cluster of hut we turn thither a few step out of our way to inquir about the road these hut were on the hill place side by side in a figur between a squar and a circl as if for the sake of mutual shelter like haystack in a farmyardno tree near them we call at one of the door and three hale stout men came out who could speak veri littl english and stare at us with an almost savag look of wonder one of them took much pain to set us forward and went a consider way down the hill till we came in sight of the cart road which we were to follow but we had not gone far befor we were dishearten it wa with the greatest difficulti william could lead the hors and car over the rough stone and to sit in it wa imposs the road grew wors and wors therefor we resolv to turn back have no reason to expect anyth better for we had been told that after we should leav the untrack ground all would be fair befor us we knew ourselv where we stood to be about eight mile distant from the point where the river tummel after have left the lake join the garri at fascal near the pass of killicranki therefor we resolv to make our way thither and endeavour to procur a lodg at the same publichous where it had been refus to us the night befor the road wa like to be veri bad but know the distanc we thought it more prudent than to ventur farther with noth befor us but uncertainti we were forc to unyok the hors and turn the car ourselv owe to the steep bank on either side of the road and after much troubl we got him in again and set our face down the vale toward loch tummel william lead the car and i walk by hi side for the first two or three mile we look down upon the lake our road be along the side of the hill directli abov it on the opposit side anoth rang of hill rose up in the same mannerfarmhous thinli scatter among the cops near the water and cultiv ground in patch the lake doe not wind nor are the shore much vari by baysth mountain not command but the whole a pleas scene our road took us out of sight of the water and we were oblig to procur a guid across a high moor where it wa imposs that the hors should drag us at all the ground be exceedingli rough and untrack of cours fatigu for foottravel and on foot we must travel after some time the river tummel again serv us for a guid when it had left the lake it wa no longer a gentl stream a mirror to the sky but we could hear it roar at a consider distanc between steep bank of rock and wood we had to cross the garri by a bridg a littl abov the junction of the two river and were now not far from the publichous to our great joy for we were veri weari with our labori walk i do not think that i had walk less than sixteen mile and william much more to which add the fatigu of lead the hors and the rough road and you will not wonder that we long for rest we stop at the door of the hous and william enter as befor and again the woman refus to lodg us in a most inhuman manner give no other reason than that she would not do it we plead for the poor hors entreat sooth and flatter but all in vain though the night wa cloudi and dark we beg to sit by the fire till morn and to thi she would not consent inde if it had not been for the sake of the hors i would rather have lain in a barn than on the best of featherb in the hous of such a cruel woman we were now after our long day journey five mile from the inn at blair whither we at first thought of return but final resolv to go to a publichous which we had seen in a villag we pass through about a mile abov the ferri over the tummel have come from that point to blair for the sake of the pass of killicranki and blair itself and had now the same road to measur back again we were oblig to leav the pass of killicranki unseen but thi disturb us littl at a time when we had seven mile to travel in the dark with a poor beast almost sink with fatigu for he had not rest onc all day we went on spiritless and at a dreari pace pass by one hous which we were half inclin to go up to and ask for a night lodg and soon after be greet by a gentl voic from a poor woman whom till she spoke though we were close to her we had not seen we stop and ask if she could tell us where we might stay all night and put up our hors she mention the publichous left behind and we told our tale and ask her if she had no hous to which she could take us ye to be sure she had a hous but it wa onli a small cottag and she had no place for the hors and how we could lodg in her hous she could not tell but we should be welcom to whatev she had so we turn the car and she walk by the side of it talk to us in a tone of human kind which made us friend at onc i rememb think to myself as i have often done in a stagecoach though never with half the reason to prejudg favour what sort of counten and figur shall we see in thi woman when we come into the light and inde it wa an interest moment when after we had enter her hous she blew the ember on the hearth and light a candl to assist us in take the luggag out of the car her husband present arriv and he and william took the hors to the publichous the poor woman hung the kettl over the fire we had tea and sugar of our own and she set befor us barley cake and milk which she had just brought in i recollect she said she had been west to fetch it the highland alway direct you by east and west north and southveri confus to stranger she told us that it wa her busi to keep the gate for mr who live at just belowthat is to receiv messag take in letter etc her cottag stood by the side of the road lead to hi hous within the gate have as we saw in the morn a dressedup porter lodg outsid but within wa noth but the nake wall unplast and floor of mud as in the common hut she said that they live rentfre in return for their servic but spoke of her place and mr with littl respect hint that he wa veri proud and inde her appear and subdu manner and that soft voic which had prepossess us so much in her favour seem to belong to an injur and oppress be we talk a great deal with her and gather some interest fact from her convers which i wish i had written down while they were fresh in my memori they had onli one child yet seem to be veri poor not discont but languid and will to suffer rather than rous to ani effort though it wa plain she despis and hate her master and had no wish to conceal it she hardli appear to think it worth while to speak ill of him we were oblig to sit up veri late while our kind hostess wa prepar our bed william lay upon the floor on some hay without sheet my bed wa of chaff i had plenti of cover and a pair of veri nice strong clean sheetssh said with some pride that she had good linen i believ the sheet had been of her own spin perhap when she wa first marri or befor and she probabl will keep them to the end of her life of poverti thursday septemb thbefor breakfast we walk to the pass of killicranki a veri fine scene the river garri forc it way down a deep chasm between rock at the foot of high rug hill cover with wood to a great height the pass did not howev impress us with awe or a sensat of difficulti or danger accord to our expect but the road be at a consider height on the side of the hill we at first onli look into the dell or chasm it is much grander seen from below near the river bed everybodi know that thi pass is famou in militari histori when we were travel in scotland an invas wa hourli look for and one could not but think with some regret of the time when from the now depopul highland forti or fifti thousand men might have been pour down for the defenc of the countri under such leader as the marqui of montros or the brave man who had so distinguish himself upon the ground where we were stand i will transcrib a sonnet suggest to william by thi place and written in octob six thousand veteran practis in war game tri men at killicranki were arrayd against an equal host that wore the plaid shepherd and herdsmen like a whirlwind came the highland the slaughter spread like flame and garri thunder down hi mountain road wa stoppd and could not breath beneath the load of the dead bodi twa a day of shame for them whom precept and the pedantri of cold mechan battl do enslav oh for a singl hour of that dunde who on that day the word of onset gave like conquest might the men of england see and her foe find a like inglori grave we turn back again and go down the hill below the pass cross the same bridg we had come over the night befor and walk through ladi perth ground by the side of the garri till we came to the tummel and then walk up to the cascad of the tummel the fall is inconsider scarc more than an ordinari wear but it make a loud roar over larg stone and the whole scene is grandhil mountain wood and rock is a veri pretti place all but the hous stoddart print give no notion of it the hous stand upon a small plain at the junction of the two river a close deep spot surround by high hill and wood after we had breakfast william fetch the car and while we were convey the luggag to the outsid of the gate where it stood mr mal apropo came veri near to the door call the woman out and rail at her in the most abus manner for harbour peopl in that way she soon slip from him and came back to us i wish that william should go and speak to her master for i wa afraid that he might turn the poor woman away but she would not suffer it for she did not care whether they stay or not in the meantim mr continu scold her husband inde he appear to be not onli proud but veri ignor insol and lowbr the woman told us that she had sometim lodg poor travel who were pass along the road and permit other to cook their victual in her hous for which mr had reprimand her befor but as she said she did not valu her place and it wa no matter in sound forth the disprais of mr i ought not to omit mention that the poor woman had great delight in talk of the excel qualiti of hi mother with whom she had been a servant and live mani year after have interchang good wish we part with our charit hostess who tell us her name entreat us if ever we came that way again to inquir for her we travel down the tummel till it is lost in the tay and then in the same direct continu our

veri pleas but as almost everywher els imperfectli cultiv we went up a broad vale through which run the stream from loch ketterin and came to loch vennachar a larger lake than loch achray the small one which had given us such unexpect delight when we left the pass of the trossach loch vennachar is much larger but greatli inferior in beauti to the imag which we had conceiv of it neighbour and so the realiti prove to us when we came up to that littl lake and saw it befor us in it true shape in the cheer sunshin the trossach overtop by benledi and other high mountain enclos the lake at the head and those hous which we had seen befor with their corn field slope toward the water stood veri prettili under low wood the field did not appear so rich as when we had seen them through the veil of mist but yet as in frame our expect we had allow for a much greater differ so we were even a second time surpris with pleasur at the same spot went as far as these hous of which i have spoken in the car and then walk on intend to pursu the road up the side of loch ketterin along which coleridg had come but we had resolv to spend some hour in the neighbourhood of the trossach and accordingli coast the head of loch achray and pursu the brook between the two lake as far as there wa ani track here we found to our surprisefor we had expect noth but heath and rock like the rest of the neighbourhood of the trossachsa seclud farm a plot of verdant ground with a singl cottag and it compani of outhous we turn back and went to the veri point from which we had first look upon loch achray when we were here with coleridg it wa no longer a visionari scene the sun shone into everi crevic of the hill and the mountaintop were clear after some time we went into the pass from the trossach and were delight to behold the form of object fulli reveal and even surpass in loveli and varieti what we had conceiv the mountain i think appear not so high but on the whole we had not the smallest disappoint the heather wa fade though still beauti sate for halfanhour in ladi perth shed and scrambl over the rock and through the thicket at the head of the lake i went till i could make my way no further and left william to go to the top of the hill whenc he had a distinct view as on a map of the intricaci of the lake and the cours of the river return to the hut and after have taken a second dinner of the food we had brought from calland set our face toward the head of loch ketterin i can add noth to my former descript of the trossach except that we depart with our old delight remembr endear and mani new one the path or roadfor it wa neither the one nor the other but someth between bothi the pleasantest i have ever travel in my life for the same length of waynow with mark of sledg or wheel or none at all bare or green as it might happen now a littl descent now a level sometim a shadi lane at other an open track through green pastur then again it would lead us into thick coppicewood which often entir shut out the lake and again admit it by glimps we have never had a more delight walk than thi even ben lomond and the three pointedtop mountain of loch lomond which we had seen from the garrison were veri majest under the clear sky the lake perfectli calm the air sweet and mild i felt that it wa much more interest to visit a place where we have been befor than it can possibl be the first time except under peculiar circumst the sun had been set for some time when be within a quarter of a mile of the ferryman hut our path have led us close to the shore of the calm lake we met two neatli dress women without hat who had probabl been take their sunday even walk one of them said to us in a friendli soft tone of voic what you are step westward i can not describ how affect thi simpl express wa in that remot place with the western sky in front yet glow with the depart sun william wrote the follow poem long after in remembr of hi feel and mine what you are step westward yea twould be a wildish destini if we who thu togeth roam in a strang land and far from home were in thi place the guest of chanc yet who would stop or fear to advanc though home or shelter he had none with such a sky to lead him on the dewi ground wa dark and cold behind all gloomi to behold and step westward seemd to be a kind of heavenli destini i like the greet twa a sound of someth without place or bound and seemd to give me spiritu right to travel through that region bright the voic wa soft and she who spake wa walk by her nativ lake the salut wa to me the veri sound of courtesi it power wa felt and while my eye wa fixd upon the glow sky the echo of the voic enwrought a human sweet with the thought of travel through the world that lay befor me in my endless way we went up to the door of our boatman hut as to a home and scarc less confid of a cordial welcom than if we had been approach our own cottag at grasmer it had been a veri pleas thought while we were walk by the side of the beauti lake that few hour as we had been there there wa a home for us in one of it quiet dwell accordingli so we found it the good woman who had been at a preach by the lakesid wa in her holiday dress at the door and seem to be rejoic at the sight of us she led us into the hut in hast to suppli our want we took onc more a refresh meal by her firesid and though not so merri as the last time we were not less happi bate our regret that coleridg wa not in hi old place i slept in the same bed as befor and listen to the household stream which now onli made a veri low murmur monday septemb threjoic in the morn to see the sun shine upon the hill when i first look out through the open windowplac at my bed head we rose earli and after breakfast our old companion who wa to be our guid for the day row us over the water to the same point where coleridg and i had sate down and eaten our dinner while william had gone to survey the unknown coast we intend to cross loch lomond follow the lake to glenfalloch abov the head of it and then come over the mountain to glengyl and so down the glen and pass mr macfarlan hous back again to the ferryhous where we should sleep so a third time we went through the mountain hollow now familiar ground the inhabit had not yet got in all their hay and were at work in the field our guid often stop to talk with them and no doubt wa call upon to answer mani inquiri respect us two stranger at the ferryhous of inversneyd we had not the happi sight of the highland girl and her companion but the good woman receiv us cordial gave me milk and talk of coleridg who the morn after we part from him had been at her hous to fetch hi watch which he had forgotten two day befor he ha sinc told me that he question her respect the miser condit of her hut which as you may rememb admit the rain at the door and retain it in the hollow of the mud floor he told her how easi it would be to remov these inconveni and to contriv someth at least to prevent the wind from enter at the windowplac if not a glass window for light and warmth by day she repli that thi wa veri true but if they made ani improv the laird would conclud that they were grow rich and would rais their rent the ferryman happen to be just readi at the moment to go over the lake with a poor man hi wife and child the littl girl about three year old cri all the way terrifi by the water when we part from thi famili they go down the lake and we up it i could not but think of the differ in our condit to that poor woman who with her husband had been driven from her home by want of work and wa now go a long journey to seek it elsewher everi step wa pain toil for she had either her child to bear or a heavi burthen i walk as she did but pleasur wa my object and if toil came along with it even that wa pleasurepleasur at least it would be in the remembr we were i believ nine mile from glenfalloch when we left the boat to us with mind at eas the walk wa delight it could not be otherwis for we pass by a continu success of rock wood and mountain but the hous were few and the ground cultiv onli in small portion near the water consequ there wa not that sort of varieti which leav distinct separ remembr but one impress of solitud and great while the highland and i were plod on togeth side by side interspers long silenc with now and then a question or a remark look down to the lake he espi two small rocki island and point to them said to me it will be gay and danger sail there in stormi weather when the water is high in give my assent i could not help smile but i afterward found that a like combin of word is not uncommon in scotland for at edinburgh william be afraid of rain ask the ostler what he thought who look up to the sky pronounc it to be gay and dull and therefor rain might be expect the most remark object we saw wa a huge singl stone i believ three or four time the size of bowder stone the top of it which on one side wa slope like the roof of a hous wa cover with heather william climb up the rock which would have been no easi task but to a mountain and we construct a rope of pockethandkerchief garter plaid coat etc and measur it height it wa so mani time the length of william walkingstick but unfortun have lost the stick we have lost the measur the ferryman told us that a preach wa held there onc in three month by a certain ministeri think of arrocharwho engag as a part of hi offic to perform the servic the interest feel we had connect with the highland sabbath and highland worship return here with doubl forc the rock though on one side a high perpendicular wall in no place overhung so as to form a shelter in no place could it be more than a screen from the element whi then had it been select for such a purpos wa it mere from be a central situat and a conspicu object or did there belong to it some inherit of superstit from old time it is imposs to look at the stone without ask how came it hither had then that obscur and unaccount that mysteri of power which is about it ani influenc over the first person who resort hither for worship or have they now on those who continu to frequent it the lake is in front of the perpendicular wall and behind at some distanc and total detach from it is the continu of the ridg of mountain which form the vale of loch lomonda magnific templ of which thi spot is a nobl sanctum sanctorum footnot thi is none other than the wellknown scottish word geyindiffer toler considerablej c s we arriv at glenfalloch at about one or two oclock it is no villag there be onli scatter hut in the glen which may be four mile long accord to my remembr the middl of it is veri green and level and tuft with tree higher up where the glen part into two veri narrow one is the hous of the laird i daresay a pretti place the view from the door of the publichous is exceedingli beauti the river flow smoothli into the lake and the field were at that time as green as possibl look backward ben lomond veri majest shut in the view the top of the mountain as seen here be of a pyramid form it is much grander than with the broken outlin and stage abov stage as seen from the neighbourhood of luss we found nobodi at home at the inn but the ferryman shout wish to have a glass of whiski and a young woman came from the hayfield dress in a white bedgown without hat or cap there wa no whiski in the hous so he beg a littl whey to drink with the fragment of our cold meat brought from calland after a short rest in a cool parlour we set forward again have to cross the river and climb up a steep mountain on the opposit side of the valley i observ that the peopl were busi bring in the hay befor it wa dri into a sort of fauld or yard where they intend to leav it readi to be gather into the hous with the first threaten of rain and if not complet dri brought out again our guid bore me in hi arm over the stream and we soon came to the foot of the mountain the most easi rise for a short way at first wa near a nake rivulet which made a fine cascad in one place afterward the ascent wa veri labori be frequent almost perpendicular it is one of those moment which i shall not easili forget when at that point from which a step or two would have carri us out of sight of the green field of glenfalloch be at a great height on the mountain we sate down and heard as if from the heart of the earth the sound of torrent ascend out of the long hollow glen to the eye all wa motionless a perfect still the nois of water did not appear to come thi way or that from ani particular quarter it wa everywher almost one might say as if exhal through the whole surfac of the green earth glenfalloch coleridg ha sinc told me signifi the hidden vale but william say if we were to name it from our recollect of that time we should call it the vale of aw sound we continu to climb higher and higher but the hill wa no longer steep and afterward we pursu our way along the top of it with mani small up and down the walk wa veri labori after the climb wa over be often exceedingli stoni or through swampi moss rush or rough heather as we proceed continu our way at the top of the mountain encircl by higher mountain at a great distanc we were pass without notic a heap of scatter stone round which wa a belt of green grassgreen and as it seem rich where all els wa either poor heather and coars grass or unprofit rush and spongi moss the highland made a paus say thi place is much chang sinc i wa here twenti year ago he told us that the heap of stone had been a hut where a famili wa then live who had their winter habit in the valley and brought their goat thither in the summer to feed on the mountain and that they were use to gather them togeth at night and morn to be milk close to the door which wa the reason whi the grass wa yet so green near the stone it wa affect in that solitud to meet with thi memori of manner pass away we look about for some other trace of human but noth els could we find in that place we ourselv afterward espi anoth of those ruin much more extensiveth remain as the man told us of sever dwell we were astonish at the sagac with which our highland discov the track where often no track wa visibl to us and scarc even when he point it out it remind us of what we read of the hottentot and other savag he went on as confid as if it had been a turnpik roadth more surpris as when he wa there befor it must have been a plain track for he told us that fishermen from arrochar carri her regularli over the mountain by that way to loch ketterin when the glen were much more popul than now descend into glengyl abov loch ketterin and pass through mr macfarlan ground that is through the whole of the glen where there wa now no hous left but hi we stop at hi door to inquir after the famili though with littl hope of find them at home have seen a larg compani at work in a hay field whom we conjectur to be hi whole householda it prove except a servantmaid who answer our inquiri we had sent the ferryman forward from the head of the glen to bring the boat round from the place where he left it to the other side of the lake pass the same farmhous we had such good reason to rememb and went up to the buryingground that stood so sweetli near the watersid the ferryman had told us that rob roy grave wa there so we could not pass on without go up to the spot there were sever tombston but the inscript were either wornout or unintellig to us and the place choke up with nettl and brambl you will rememb the descript i have given of the spot i have noth here to add except the follow poem which it suggest to william footnot see rob roy grave in poetic work vol ii p ed a famou man is robin hood the english balladsing joy and scotland boast of one as good she ha her own rob roy then clear the weed from off hi grave and let us chaunt a pass stave in honour of that outlaw brave heaven gave rob roy a dare heart and wondrou length and strength of arm nor crave he more to quell hi foe or keep hi friend from harm yet robin wa as wise as brave as wise in thought as bold in deed for in the principl of thing he sought hi moral creed said gener rob what need of book burn all the statut and their shelv they stir us up against our kind and wors against ourselv we have a passion make a law too fals to guid us or control and for the law itself we fight in bitter of soul and puzzl blind thu we lose distinct that are plain and few these find i graven on my heart that tell me what to do the creatur see of flood and field and those that travel on the wind with them

attest the same kindl with instantan joy at sound of rob roy name soon after we saw our boat come over the calm water it wa late in the even and i wa stiff and weari as well i might after such a long and toilsom walk so it wa no poor gratif to sit down and be consciou of advanc in our journey without further labour the star were begin to appear but the bright of the west wa not yet goneth lake perfectli still and when we first went into the boat we row almost close to the shore under steep crag hung with birch it wa like a newdiscov countri of which we had not dream for in walk down the lake owe to the road in that part be carri at a consider height on the hillsid the rock and the indent of the shore had been hidden from us at thi time those rock and their imag in the calm water compos one mass the surfac of both equal distinct except where the water trembl with the motion of our boat have row a while under the bold steep we launch out further when the shore were no longer abrupt we hardli spoke to each other as we move along reced from the west which diffus a solemn anim over the lake the sky wa cloudless and everyth seem at rest except our solitari boat and the mountainstreamsseldom heard and but faintli i think i have rare experienc a more elev pleasur than dure our short voyag of thi night the good woman had long been look out for us and had prepar everyth for our refresh and as soon as we had finish supper or rather tea we went to bed william i doubt not rest well and for my part i slept as soundli on my chaff bed as ever i have done in childhood after the long day play of a summer holiday tuesday th septemberagain a fine morn i stroll into the green field in which the hous stand while the woman wa prepar breakfast and at my return found one of her neighbour sit by the fire a feebl paralyt old woman after have inquir concern our journey the day befor she said i have travel far in my time and told me she had marri an english soldier who had been station at the garrison they had had mani children who were all dead or in foreign countri and she had return to her nativ place where now she had live sever year and wa more comfort than she could ever have expect to be be veri kindli dealt with by all her neighbour point to the ferryman and hi wife she said they were accustom to give her a day of their labour in dig peat in common with other and in that manner she wa provid with fuel and by like voluntari contribut with other necessari while thi infirm old woman wa relat her stori in a tremul voic i could not but think of the chang of thing and the day of her youth when the shrill fife sound from the wall of the garrison made a merri nois through the echo hill i ask myself if she were to be carri again to the desert spot after her cours of life no doubt a troublesom one would the silenc appear to her the silenc of desol or of peac after breakfast we took a final leav of our hostess and attend by her husband again set forward on foot my limb were a littl stiff but the morn be uncommonli fine i did not fear to aim at the accomplish of a plan we had laid of return to calland by a consider circuit we were to go over the mountain from loch ketterin a littl below the ferryhous on the same side of the water descend to loch voil a lake from which issu the stream that flow through strath eyer into loch lubnaig our road as is gener the case in pass from one vale into anoth wa through a settl between the hill not far from a small stream we had to climb consider the mountain be much higher than it appear to be owe to it retreat in what look like a gradual slope from the lake though we found it steep enough in the climb our guid had been born near loch voil and he told us that at the head of the lake if we would look about for it we should see the buryingplac of a part of hi famili the macgregor a clan who had long possess that district a circumst which he relat with no unworthi pride of ancestri we shook hand with him at part not without a hope of again enter hi hut in compani with other whom we love continu to walk for some time along the top of the hill have the high mountain of loch voil befor us and ben lomond and the steep of loch ketterin behind came to sever desert mountain hut or shiel and rest for some time besid one of them upon a hillock of it green plot of monument herbag william here conceiv the notion of write an ode upon the affect subject of those relic of human societi found in that grand and solitari region the spot of ground where we sate wa even beauti the grass be uncommonli verdant and of a remark soft and silki textur after thi we rest no more till we came to the foot of the mountain where there wa a cottag at the door of which a woman invit me to drink some whey thi i did while william went to inquir respect the road at a new stone hous a few step further he wa told to cross the brook and proceed to the other side of the vale and that no further direct were necessari for we should find ourselv at the head of the lake and on a plain road which would lead us downward we wade the river and cross the vale perhap half a mile or more the mountain all round are veri high the vale pastor and unenclos not mani dwell and but few tree the mountain in gener smooth near the bottom they are in larg unbroken mass combin with the vale to give an impress of bold simplic near the head of the lake at some distanc from us we discov the burialplac of the macgregor and did not view it without some interest with it ornament ball on the four corner of the wall which i daresay have been often look at with elev of heart by our honest friend of loch ketterin the lake is divid right across by a narrow slip of flat land make a small lake at the head of the larg one the whole may be about

the hill the music in my heart i bore long after it wa heard no more toward the foot of the lake on the opposit side which wa more barren than that on which we travel wa a bare road up a steep hill which lead to glen finla formerli a royal forest it is a wild and rocki glen as we had been told by a person who direct our notic to it outlet at loch achray the stream which pass through it fall into that lake near the head at the end of loch voil the vale is wide and populouslarg pastur with mani cattl larg tract of corn we walk downward a littl way and then cross over to the same road along which we had travel from loch ern to calland be onc again at the entranc of strath eyer it might be about four or five oclock in the afternoon we were ten mile from calland exceedingli tire and wish heartili for the poor hors and car walk up strath eyer and saw in clear air and sunshin what had been conceal from us when we travel befor in the mist and rain we found it less woodi and rich than it had appear to be but with all deduct a veri sweet valley not far from loch lubnaig though not in view of it is a long villag with two or three publichous and be in despair of reach calland that night without overfatigu we resolv to stop at the most respectablelook hous and should it not prove wretch inde to lodg there if there were bed for us at ani rate it wa necessari to take some refresh the woman of the hous spoke with gentl and civil and had a good counten which reconcil me to stay though i had been avers to the scheme dread the dirt usual in scotch publichous by the waysid she said she had bed for us and clean sheet and we desir her to prepar them immedi it wa a twostori hous light built though in other respect no better than the hut anda all the slate cottag aremuch more uncomfort in appear except that there wa a chimney in the kitchen at such place it is fit that travel should make up their mind to wait at least an hour longer than the time necessari to prepar whatev meal they may have order which we i may truli say did with most temper philosophi i went to talk with the mistress who wa bake barley cake which she wrought out with her hand as thin as the oaten bread we make in cumberland i ask her whi she did not use a rollingpin and if it would not be much more conveni to which she return me no distinct answer and seem to give littl attent to the question she did not know or that wa what they were use to or someth of the sort it wa a tediou process and i thought could scarc have been manag if the cake had been as larg as our but they are consider smaller which is a great loss of time in the bake thi woman whose common languag wa the gaelic talk with me a veri good english ask mani question yet without the least appear of an obtrus or impertin curios and inde i must say that i never in those women with whom i convers observ anyth on which i could put such a construct they seem to have a faith readi for all and as a child when you are tell him stori ask for more more so they appear to delight in be amus without effort of their own mind among other question she ask me the old one over again if i wa marri and when i told her that i wa not she appear surpris and as if recollect herself said to me with a piou serious and perfect simplic to be sure there is a great promis for virgin in heaven and then she began to tell how long she had been marri that she had had a larg famili and much sick and sorrow have lost sever of her children we had clean sheet and decent bed wednesday septemb throse earli and depart befor breakfast the morn wa dri but

than all i have said monday septemb thwe rose earli and went to melros six mile befor breakfast after ascend a hill descend and overlook a dell on the opposit side of which wa an old mansion surround with tree and steep garden a curiou and pleas yet melancholi spot for the hous and garden were evid go to decay and the whole of the small dell except near the hous wa unenclos and uncultiv be a sheepwalk to the top of the hill descend to gala water a pretti stream but much smaller than the tweed into which the brook flow from the glen i have spoken of near the gala is a larg modern hous the situat veri pleasant but the old build which we had pass put to shame the fresh colour and meagr outlin of the new one went through a part of the villag of galashiel pleasantli situat on the bank of the stream a pretti place it onc ha been but a manufactori is establish there and a townish bustl and ugli stone hous are fast take place of the brownroof thatch cottag of which a great number yet remain partli overshadow by tree left the gala and after cross the open countri came again to the tweed and pursu our way as befor near the river perhap for a mile or two till we arriv at melros the valley for thi short space wa not so pleas as befor the hill more broken and though the cultiv wa gener yet the scene wa not rich while it had lost it pastor simplic at melros the vale open out wide but the hill are high all roundsingl distinct rise after breakfast we went out intend to go to the abbey and in the street met mr scott who gave us a cordial greet and conduct us thither himself he wa here on hi own ground for he is familiar with all that is known of the authent histori of melros and the popular tale connect with it he point out mani piec of beauti sculptur in obscur corner which would have escap our notic the abbey ha been built of a pale red stone that part which wa first erect of a veri durabl kind the sculptur flower and leav and other minut ornament be as perfect in mani place as when first wrought the ruin is of consider extent but unfortun it is almost surround by insignific hous so that when you are close to it you see it entir separ from mani rural object and even when view from a distanc the situat doe not seem to be particularli happi for the vale is broken and disturb and the abbey at a distanc from the river so that you do not look upon them as companion of each other and sure thi is a nation barbar within these beauti wall is the ugliest church that wa ever beheldif it had been hewn out of the side of a hill it could not have been more dismal there wa no neat nor even decenc and it appear to be so damp and so complet exclud from fresh air that it must be danger to sit in it the floor is unpav and veri rough what a contrast to the beauti and grace order appar in everi part of the ancient design and workmanship mr scott went with us into the garden and orchard of a mr riddel from which we had a veri sweet view of the abbey through tree the town be entir exclud dine with mr scott at the inn he wa now travel to the assiz at jedburgh in hi charact of sheriff of selkirk and on that account as well as for hi own sake he wa treat with great respect a small part of which wa vouchsaf to us as hi friend though i could not persuad the woman to show me the bed or to make ani sort of promis till she wa assur from the sheriff himself that he had no object to sleep in the same room with william tuesday septemb thmr scott depart veri earli for jedburgh and we soon follow intend to go by dryburgh to kelso it wa a fine morn we went without breakfast be told that there wa a publichous at dryburgh the road wa veri pleasant seldom out of sight of the tweed for ani length of time though not often close to it the valley is not so pleasantli defin as between peebl and clovenford yet so soft and beauti and in mani part pastor but that peculiar and pensiv simplic which i have spoken of befor wa want yet there wa a fertil chequer with wild which to mani travel would be more than a compens the reach of the vale were shorter the turn more rapid the bank often cloth with wood in one place wa a lofti scar at anoth a green promontori a small hill skirt by the river the hill abov irregular and green and scatter over with tree we wish we could have brought the ruin of melros to that spot and mention thi to mr scott who told us that the monk had first fix their abod there and rais a temporari build of wood the monasteri of melros wa found by a coloni from rievaux abbey in yorkshir which build it happen to resembl in the colour of the stone and i think partli in the style of architectur but is much smaller that is ha been much smaller for there is not at rievaux ani one singl part of the ruin so larg as the remain of the church at melros though at rievaux a far more extens ruin remain it is also much grander and the situat at present much more beauti that ruin not have suffer like melros abbey from the encroach of a town the architectur at melros is i believ superior in the exact and tast of some of the minut ornament part inde it is imposs to conceiv anyth more delic than the workmanship especi in the imit of flower we descend to dryburgh after have gone a consider way upon high ground a heavi rain when we reach the villag and there wa no publichous a welldress wellspoken woman courteouslyshal i say charitablyinvit

instead of a porter an old woman came to open it through a narrow sidealley cut in a thick plantat of evergreen on enter saw the thatch of her hut just abov the tree and it look veri pretti but the

to show off the curios and she had her tale as perfect though it wa not quit so long a one as the gentleman swiss whom i rememb to have seen at blenheim with hi slender wand and dainti white cloth the hous of lord buchan and the abbey stand upon a larg flat peninsula a green holm almost cover with fruittre the ruin of dryburgh are much less extens than those of melros and greatli inferior both in

often shout as if for their own pleasur and the shout were echo through the circuit of the rock their guid afterward sang a hymn or pensiv song there wa an aërial sweet in the wild note which descend to our ear when we had attain the same height our guid sang the same air which made me think it might be a customari rite or practic in that part of the ascent the gemmi pass is in the direct road from bern to the bath of leuk invalid unabl to walk are born on litter by men and frequent have their eye blind that they may not look down and the most hardi travel never ventur to descend on their
