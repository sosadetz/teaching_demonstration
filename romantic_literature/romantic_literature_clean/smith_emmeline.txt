plan and one of which he would probabl be weari befor it could be execut but as it wa a militari maxim that in love and war all stratagem are allow he fail not to lay as much stress on the honour intent of delamer as if he had realli meant to assist in carri them into effect emmelin heard him in silenc or when an answer of some kind seem to be extort from her she told him that she refer herself entir to mr stafford and would not even speak upon the subject but befor her and as she should dictat in thi way sever meet pass between delamer the colonel and the two ladi for unless the

be no misrepresent of her conduct while they were togeth everi day they expect some consequ from mr stafford letter to lord montrevil but for ten day though they had heard noth they satisfi themselv with conjectur ten day more insens pass by and they began to think it veri extraordinari that hi lordship should give no attent to an affair which onli a few month befor seem to have occas him so much seriou alarm in thi interv delamer saw emmelin everi day and fitzedward on behalf of hi friend view attach himself to mr stafford with an attent as mark and as warm as that of delamer toward miss mowbray he wa well awar of the power a woman of her understand must have over an heart like emmelin so new to the world so ingenu and so much inclin to indulg all the delici enthusiasm of earli friendship he had had a slight acquaint with mr stafford when she wa first marri and knew enough of her husband to be inform of the sourc of that deject which through all her endeavour to conceal it frequent appear and have live alway among those who consid attach to marri women as allow gallantri and have had but too much success among them fitzedward thought he could take advantag of mr stafford situat to entangl her in a connect which would make her more indulg to the weak of her friend for delamer but such wa the aw yet simpl digniti of her manner and so sacr the puriti of unaffect virtu that he dare not hazard offend her while awar of the tendenc of hi flatter and incess assidu she wa alway watch to prevent ani diminut of the respect she had a right to exact and without affect to shun hi societi which wa extrem agreeabl she never suffer him to assum in hi convers with her those freedom which often made him admir by other nor allow him to avow that libertin of principl which she lament that he possess fitzedward who had at first undertaken to entertain her mere with a view of favour delamer convers with emmelin almost impercept found that it had charm on hi own account he could not be insens of the grace of a mind so highli cultiv and he felt hi admir mingl with a rever and esteem of which he had never befor been sensibl but hi vaniti wa piqu at the cold with which she receiv hi studi and delic adul and for the first time in hi life he wa oblig to acknowledg to himself that there might be a woman whose mind wa superior to it influenc not be dispos veri tranquilli to submit to thi mortifi convict he becam more anxiou to secur that partial from mr stafford which sinc he found it so hard to acquir becam necessari to hi happi and in the hope of obtain it he would

could be obtain she would continu avers to him thi question she evad by say that it wa to no purpos to consid how she should act in an event so unlik to happen he then again exert all the eloqu which love rather than reason lent him but emmelin combat hi argument with those of rectitud and honour by which she wa resolut bent to abid thi steadi origin from principl he could not controvert or deni seem while it shew him all it hopeless to give new forc to hi passion he becam again almost frantic and wa anew act the part of a madman when mr stafford and miss delamer enter the hous and enquir for

now go out for the whole day for i will not see my father onli to repeat to him what i have alreadi said befor i return see what you can do toward persuad him to consent to my marriag with miss mowbray for be assur that if he doe not the next meet in which i expect hi answer will be the last we shall have he then snatch up hi hat and disengag himself from hi sister who attempt to detain him he went hastili out of the hous leav mr stafford miss mowbray and hi sister under great uneasi and alarm they thought it necessari immedi to inform lord montrevil of the whole convers and miss delamer dispatch a note to fitzedward desir him to attend to the motion of hi friend fitzedward wa at breakfast with lord montrevil who took the first opportun of their be alon to reproach him with some sever for what he had done the colonel heard him with great seren and then began to justifi himself by assur hi lordship that he had accompani delamer onli in hope of be abl to detach him from hi pursuit and becaus he thought it prefer to hi be left wholli to himself he declar that he meant to have given lord montrevil inform if there had appear the least probabl of delamer marriag but that be perfectli convinc from the charact of emmelin that there wa noth to apprehend he had everi day hope hi friend would have quit a project in which there seem not the least likelihood of success and would have return to hi famili cure of hi passion though thi wa not all strictli true fitzedward possess a sort of plausibl and insinu eloqu which hardli ever fail of remov everi impress howev strong against him and lord montrevil wa convers with him with hi usual confid and friendship when the note from miss delamer wa brought in hi lordship ever anxiou for hi son gaze eagerli at it while

contribut to encreas hi alarm the imag of hi son in all the wild of ungovern passion shook hi nerv so much that he seem readi to faint yet unabl to move to enquir where he wa as he could attend to noth els mr stafford told him how anxious she had thought of a situat for emmelin and that she believ she had at length found one that would do if said she your lordship can not prevail on him to quit swansea which i think you had better attempt though from the scene of thi morn i own i despair of it more than ever the person with whom i hope to be abl to place miss mowbray is mr ashwood the sister of mr stafford she ha been two year a widow with three children and resid at a villag near london she ha a veri good fortun and would be happi to have with her such a companion as miss mowbray till i am so fortun as to be enabl to take her myself as her connect and acquaint lie in a differ set of peopl and in a remot part of the countri from those of mr delamer it is improb that with the precaut we shall take he will ever discov her resid lord montrevil express hi sens of mr stafford kind in the warmest term he assur her that he should never forget the friendli part she had taken and that if ever it wa in hi power to shew hi gratitud by be so happi as to have the abil to serv her or her famili he should consid it as the most fortun event of hi life mr stafford heard thi as matter of cours and would have felt great compass for lord montrevil whose state of mind wa truli deplor but she reflect that he had realli been the author of hi own miseri first by bring up hi son in a manner that had given such boundless scope to hi passion and now by refus to gratifi him in marri a young woman who wa in the eye of unprejud reason so perfectli unexception she advis him to tri onc more to prevail on hi son to leav swansea with him and he left her to enquir whether fitzedward had yet found delamer whose absenc gave him the most cruel uneasi fitzedward after a long search had overtaken delamer on an unfrequ common about a mile from the town where he wa walk with a quick pace and see fitzedward endeavour to escap him but when he found he could not avoid him he turn fierc toward himwhi do you follow me sir is it not enough that you have broken through the tie of honour and friendship in betray me to my father must you still persecut me with your insidi friendship fitzedward heard him with great cool and without much difficulti convinc him that miss mowbray herself had given the inform to lord montrevil by mean of mr stafford thi convict while it ad to the pain and mortif of delamer greatli reconcil him to fitzedward whom he had befor suspect and after a long convers which fitzedward so manag as to regain some degre of power over the passion of hi impetu friend he persuad him to go and dine with lord montrevil have first undertaken for hi lordship that noth should be said on the subject which occupi the thought of the father on which condit onli the son consent to meet him chapter xi notwithstand the steadi emmelin had hitherto shewn in reject the clandestin address of delamer he still hope they would succeed a degre of vaniti pardon in a young man possess so mani advantag of person and fortun made him trust to those advantag and to hi unweari assidu to conquer her reluct he determin therefor to persever and did not imagin it wa like he could again lose sight of her by a stratagem against which he wa now on hi guard as he fanci lord montrevil and hi sister design to carri her with them when they went he kept a constant eye on their motion and set hi own servant and fitzedward valet to watch the servant of lord montrevil fitzedward who had been so near lose the confid of both the father and son found it expedi to observ a neutral which it requir all hi address to support be constantli appeal to by them both lord montrevil he advis to adher to moder measur and gentl persuas and to trust to emmelin own strength of mind and good conduct while to delamer he recommend dissimul and advis him to quit swansea at present which would prevent emmelin be remov from thenc and leav it in hi power at ani time to see her again lord montrevil on cooler

hope sir said emmelin that i shall patient becom the victim of your rash is thi the respect you have sworn ever to observ toward me is thi the protect you have so often told me i should find from you

tender of persuas by all the rhetor of ardent passion tri to subdu her anger and silenc her scrupl but the more her mind dwelt on the circumst of her situat the more it recoil from the necess of enter under such compuls into an indissolubl engag the rash violenc of the measur which had put her in delamer power while it convinc her of hi passion yet told her that a man who would hazard everi thing

when time had diminish the influenc of those attract that now enchant him form of the softer element and with a mind calcul for select friendship and domest felic rather than for the tumult of fashion life and the parad of titl magnific emmelin covet not hi rank nor valu hi rich no woman perhap can help have some regard for a man who she know ardent and sincer love her and emmelin had felt all that sort of weak for delamer who in the bloom of life with fortun titl person and talent that might have command the loveliest and most affluent daughter of prosper had forsaken everi thing for her and even seclud himself from the companion of hi former pleasur and the indulg hi fortun and rank afford him to pass hi youth in unsuccess endeavour to obtain her the partial thi consider gave her toward him and the favour comparison she wa perpetu make between him and the men she had seen sinc her resid near london had creat in her bosom a sentiment warmer perhap than friendship yet it wa not that violent love which carri everi thing befor it leav the mind no longer at liberti to see ani fault in the belov object or ani improprieti in whatev can secur it success and which scorn futur consequ risk everi thing for it present indulg still artless and ingenu as when she first left the remot castl where she had been brought up emmelin had not been abl to conceal thi affect from delamer her eye

resent and disdain succeed delamer tri to appeas her by protest of inviol respect of etern esteem and unalter love but there wa someth of triumph even in hi humblest entreati that serv but to encreas the anger emmelin felt and she told him that the onli way to convinc her he had for her those sentiment he pretend wa to carri her back immedi to mr ashwood or rather to lord montrevil there to acknowledg the attempt he had made and that it failur had been sole owe to her determin adher to her word delamer presum on hi ascend over her attempt to interest her passion rather than tranquil her reason he repres to her how great would be her triumph when he present her as hi wife to the imperi ladi montrevil who had treat her with so much unmerit scorn and set her abov the haughti fanni delamer who had insult her with fanci superior but emmelin had in her breast none of those passion that find their gratif in humbl an enemi too gener for reveng too gentl for premedit resent she saw these circumst in a veri differ light and felt that she should be rather mortifi than elat by be forc into a famili who wish to reject her sir richard croft the object of delamer hatr and detest wa the subject of those acrimoni reflect that hi respect for hi father and mother prevent hi throw on them the influenc of thi man had he said made lord montrevil deaf to the voic of natur and forget of hi own honour while he wa plung into the dark and discredit labyrinth of polit intrigu and acquir an habit of subterfug and duplic unworthi a nobleman a gentleman or a man emmelin care noth about sir richard croft and could not enter into the bitter of hi resent toward him noth he had yet been abl to urg had shaken her resolut not to becom hi wife even tho he should oblig her to go with him into scotland the ruder passion of anger and resent had no influenc over her mind while he argu with warmth or ran into reproach emmelin found she had noth to fear but tho he could not rous her pride or awaken her dislik against hi famili but rather found them recoil on himself he hope in that sensibl of temper and that soft of heart to which he owe all the attent she had ever shewn him he should find a sure resourc in her piti an advoc for hi faultin her love an induc not onli to forgiv but to reward him and when he plead for compass and forgiv the heart of emmelin felt itself no longer invulner but against thi danger attack she endeavour to fortifi that sensibl heart by consid the probabl event of her yield to it if i marri delamer contrari to the consent of hi famili who shall assur me that hi violent and haughti spirit will bear without anguish and regret that inferior and confin fortun to which hi father displeasur will condemn him hi love too ardent perhap to last will declin while the inconveni of a narrow fortun will encreas and i who shall be the caus of these inconveni shall also be the victim he will lament the infatu which ha estrang him from hi famili and thrown him for some year at least out of the rank in which he ha been use to appear and recov from the delirium of love will behold with cold perhap with hatr her to whom he will imput hi distress to whom can i then appeal not to my own heart for it will condemn me for suffer myself to be precipit into a measur against my judgment nor to hi famili who may answer thi folli be upon thine own head and i have no father no brother to consol and receiv me if he should drive me from him as impetu as now he would forc me to be hi i shall be depriv even of the melancholi consol of know i have not deserv the neglect which i fear i shall never be abl to bear but if my steadi refus now induc him to return it is possibl that lord montrevil convinc at onc of my adher to the promis given him and of the improb of delamer desist may consent to receiv me into hi famili or if the inveter prejudic of hi wife still prevent hi do so i shall sure regain hi confid and esteem he will not refus to consid me as hi brother daughter and as such he will enabl me to pass my day in easi compet with mr stafford a prospect infinit prefer in my eye to the splendid vision offer me by delamer if they can not be realiz but at the expenc of truth and integr confirm in her determin by reflect like these emmelin wa abl to hear without betray ani symptom of the emot she felt the anim and passion protest of her lover she assum all the cold and reserv which hi headlong and inconsider attempt deserv she told him that hi want of respect and consider had forfeit all the claim he might otherwis have had to her regard and esteem that she certainli would quit him the moment she wa abl and that tho she might not be fortun enough to do so befor they reach scotland yet it would not be in hi power to compel her to be hi wife delamer for some time imput thi languag to sudden resent and again by the humblest submiss sought to obtain her forgiv and to excit her piti but have nearli exhaust her spirit by what she had alreadi said she gave veri littl repli to hi entreati her silenc wa howev more express than her word she took from him her hand as often as he attempt to hold it and would not suffer him to

encourag and though hi hope had been greatli damp by hi knowledg of delamer attach to her yet they were almost as quickli reviv by the great encourag to persever which he had receiv from lord montrevil he fanci that the barrier between her and delamer be insurmount she could not fail of be dazzl by so splendid a fortun as he could himself offer her that even she look more than usual love and he determin with new ardour to pursu her but her disappear put an end to all hi brilliant vision and convinc him that hi wealth on which he had so long been accustom to valu himself had fail of procur him the favour of the onli woman with whom he wa dispos to share it he wa too well convinc that delamer had carri her off and though depriv of all hope for himself he wa too angri at the good fortun of hi rival to forbear an attempt to disturb him in it possess he drove therefor from clapham to the hous of sir richard croft where he had the mortif of hear that sir richard wa gone with lord montrevil to the countri hous of lord dornock and wa not expect to return till the next day roch awar that the onli possibl chanc of prevent delamer marriag wa by an immedi pursuit wa greatli chagrin

that wa possibl to recov her son he therefor wrote to her a short letter state briefli what had happen and give her hope that he should be abl to overtak the parti befor they were marri thi he order to be deliv to her in the morn and direct hi servant to hasten to him with hi travel chais and four post hors the man howev who had the care of the carriag believ hi lord would stay out all night had gone out also and taken with him the key by thi delay and the blunder of the affright servant who in their hast onli imped each other it wa near nine oclock befor hi lordship and sir richard left london at barnet they heard of the fugit and easili trace them from thenc to hatfield after which believ all farther enquiri useless they pass through stevenag have sent on befor for hors without ask ani question which might have led them to discov that delamer and emmelin had gone from thenc toward hertford onli an hour and an half befor their arriv thi wa fortun for the pursu for an enquiri would probabl have led to question which mr lawson would have found it veri difficult to evad lord montrevil howev and sir richard hurri on to buckden where be oblig to get out for some refresh for themselv and their servant hi lordship renew the questionat what time did a young gentleman and ladi describ delamer and emmelin pass by the peopl told him they rememb no such person about the time he name lord montrevil then appli at the other hous and made sever other enquiri but receiv onli a gener assert that no such person had been that way within the last four and twenti hour or even within a

gratifi with better inform when they got to stilton to stilton therefor they went but heard exactli the same answer as they had done at the last stage sir richard wa now again to seek for some plausibl conjectur that might quiet the apprehens anxieti of lord montrevil who guess and dread he knew not what he now said that as there could be no doubt of the young peopl have gone toward scotland from the inform they had obtain at barnet and hatfield it wa most like that in the apprehens of a pursuit they had afterward quit the high road and were advanc to the border of scotland across the countri which must consider lengthen and imped their journey therefor if they themselv proceed directli to the town where these marriag are usual celebr the probabl wa that they should arriv befor delamer and miss mowbray and by such a circumst the connect would be as effectu prevent as it could be by their overtak them on the road lord montrevil despair of be abl by ani mean to obstruct a marriag on which hi son seem to be so determin and harrass in mind as much as he wa fatigu in bodi suffer himself to be carri forward mere through inabl to determin what he could do better and though quit hopeless of it success pursu hi journey the innoc caus of all thi troubl and anxieti remain in the mean time at the hospit hous of mr champ where miss lawson attend her with all possibl kind and solicitud it wa inde imposs to be with her without love her unless to an heart insens like that of mr ashwood to all but her own ideal perfect or steel by pride like that of ladi

blemish which she knew could hardli ever be remov but by her return as hi wife but to break her promis to lord montrevil a promis so solemnli given and to be compel into a marriag which howev advantag and fortun it would appear under other circumst would now bring with it a sever alloy of mortif in the displeasur of hi famili wa a measur which she could not determin to pursu her resent toward delamer for what wa pass wa not yet enough subdu by hi reluct repent to reconcil her to the thought of put herself again into hi power yet she could not suppos he would suffer her to return to london alon if she had courag to attempt it or wa she sure that when there mr ashwood would receiv her these reflect made her so restless and uneasi that she could not conceal their sourc from miss lawson who tho possess of a veri good understand wa too young and too littl acquaint with the world to be abl to advis her the handsom person and high rank of delamer and hi violent love and concern for emmelin made her suppos it imposs that she could help return it or be long abl to resist hi importun she conclud therefor that final it would be a match and wa impress with a sentiment that amount almost to vener for miss mowbray whom she consid as a prodigi of femal virtu and resolut delamer had been sever time to speak to miss lawson and he had plead the violenc of hi passion with so much

of croft to support without resent while sir richard and hi two son therefor set about the difficult task of find delamer lord montrevil went himself to fitzedward but heard that for mani day he had not been at hi apart that he had taken no servant with him and that they knew not whither he wa gone or when he would return lord montrevil who had depend more on the inform of fitzedward than ani

from thi resolut form in the integr of hi upright heart noth could long divert him yet he reflect as soon as he wa alon on the violent and ungovern passion which seem to render delamer unguid by reason and incap of hear it he wa apprehens that the discoveri if made to him at lough carryl might influenc him to say or do someth that might discov to ladi clancarryl the unhappi stori of her

and it fade in a convict that she would pardon her repent lover when he threw himself on her merci and not evad a promis so solemnli given which he learn from delamer himself had never been cancel delamer now return to dublin and in a few day godolphin follow him but on enquir at hi lodg he heard that he wa gone out of town for some day with some of hi friend on a parti of pleasur godolphin

godolphin testifi equal deject for howev she might repress the hope of hi rival by word of refus and resent he thought her counten gave more unequivoc intellig of the real state of her heart bellozan as proud as littl use to controul and disappoint and with more person vaniti than lord delamer beheld with anger and mortif the piti and regard which emmelin shew for her cousin and ceas to be jealou

of the fair and of the french king with these sentiment of each other the restraint and mistrust of everi parti imped gener or chear convers godolphin soon left the room to commun with hi own uneasi thought in a solitari walk lord westhaven would then have taken out bellozan in order to give lord delamer an opportun of be alon with hi sister and emmelin but he wa determin not to understand hint on that subject and when hi lordship ask him to take an afternoon walk found mean to refus it afraid of leav two such combust spirit togeth lord westhaven to the great relief of emmelin staid with

each other with such haughti reserv and their convers border so nearli on hostil and defianc that emmelin who expect everi hour to see their animos blaze out in a challeng could support her uneasi about it no longer and send earli to speak to lord westhaven on the begin of the second week of their stay she repres to him her fear and entreat him to prevail on the chevali to leav them and return to st alpin i have attempt it alreadi said he but with so littl success that if i press it ani farther i must quarrel with him myself i know perfectli well that your fear have too much foundat and that if we can neither separ or tranquillis these unquiet spirit we shall have some disagre affair happen between them i know noth that can be done but your accept at onc your penit cousin no my lord answer she with an air of chagrin that i will not do i most ardent wish lord delamer well and would do ani thing to make him happyexcept sacrif my own happi and act in opposit to my conscienc whi my dear emmelin how is thi you had onc sure an affect for delamer and hi offenc against you howev great admit of consider allevi consid all the pain that were taken to disunit you and the importun he

that i may give no room to charg me with capric or coquetri sinc your lordship believ i onc had so great a regard for him or with that unforgiv temper which i see you are dispos to accus me of it is my fix intent if i obtain by your lordship gener interposit the mowbray estat to retir to mowbray castl and never to marri at all lord westhaven at the solemn and graviti with which she pronounc these word began to laugh so immoder and to treat her resolut with ridicul so point that he first made her almost angri and then oblig her to laugh too at length howev she prevail on him again to listen to her apprehens about delamer and bellozan do not my lord ralli me so cruelli but for heaven sake befor it is too late prevent ani more meet between these two rash and turbul young men whi should the chevali de bellozan stay here becaus it is hi pleasur i do assur you serious my dear miss mowbray that i have almost everi day sinc we came hither attempt to send my fieri cousin back to st alpin but my anxieti ha onli piqu him and he determin more resolut to stay becaus he see my motiv for wish him gone he is exactli the charact which i have somewher seen describ by a french poeta young man who leger impetueux de soi meme rempli jaloux presomptueux bouillant dan se passion cedant a se capric pour un peu de valeur se passoit de tou se vice yet among all hi fault poor bellozan ha some good

repeatedli repres to him the improb of hi success but he answer that you have never posit dismiss him by avow your prefer to anoth that he know your engag with lord delamer is dissolv and that he consid himself at liberti to pursu you till you have decidedli chosen or even till you are actual marri nay i doubt whether your be marri would make ani differ in the attent of thi eccentr and presum frenchman for i do not consid bellozan as a swiss well but my dear lord if the chevali will persist in stay i must determin to go i see not that my remain here will be attend with ani good effect it may possibl be the caus of infinit uneasi to ladi westhaven do therefor prevail upon her to let me go alon to st germain when i am gone lord delamer will think more of get well than of forc me into a new engag he will then soon be abl to travel and the chevali de bellozan will return quietli to the baron whi to speak ingenu emmelin it doe appear to me that it were on everi account more proper for you to be in england thither i wish you could hasten befor it will be possibl for lord delamer or inde for my wife who must travel slowli to get thither i do not know whether your travel with us will be strictli proper on other account but if it were it would be render uneasi to you by the compani of these two mad head boy for bellozan i am sure intend if you accompani us to go also what object is there then to my set out immedi for st germain with le limosin and madelon if ladi westhaven would but consent to it i can easili convinc her of the necess of it but i forese anoth object that ha escap you what is that my lord that bellozan will follow you sure he will not attempt it inde i apprehend he will i have no manner of influenc over him and he is here connect with a set of militari men who are the likeliest peopl in the world to encourag such an enterprizeand if at last thi pari should carri off our fair helen nay but my lord do not ridicul my distress well then i will most serious and grave counsel you and my advic is that you set out as soon as you can get readi and that my brother godolphin escort you emmelin wa consciou that she too much wish such an escort yet fear that her prefer of him would engag godolphin in a quarrel with bellozan or lord delamer perhap with both she answer while the deepest blush dy her cheek no my lord i cannoti mean noti should be sorri to give captain godolphin the troubl of such a journeyand i beg you not to think of it i shall speak to him of it howev i beg my lordi intreat that you will not here he isand we will discuss the matter with him now godolphin at thi moment enter the room and lord westhaven relat plainli all emmelin fear and her wish to put an end to them by quit besançon ad the propos he had made that godolphin should take care of her till she join mr stafford tho godolphin saw in her apprehens for the safeti of delamer onli a convict of her tender regard for him and consid hi own attach as everi way desper yet he could not refus himself when it wa thu offer him the pleasur of be with herth exquisit tho pain delight of be use to her he therefor eagerli express the readi the happi with which he should undertak so preciou a charg emmelin fear of betray her real sentiment overact the civil cold with which she thought it necessari to refus thi offer godolphin mortifi and vex at her manner as much as at her denial ceas to press hi servic and lord westhaven who wonder what could be her object sinc of the honour and proprieti of godolphin conduct he knew she could not doubt seem hurt at her reject of hi brother friendli intent of wait on her and drop the convers went away with godolphin she saw that her conduct inevit impress on the mind of the latter a convict of her return regard for delamer and she fear that to lord westhaven it might appear to be the effect of vaniti and coquetri perhap he will think me said she so vain as to suppos that godolphin ha also design and that therefor i declin hi attend and coquet enough to wish for the pursuit of these men whom i onli affect to shun and for that reason prefer go alon to accept the protect of hi brother yet as i know the sentiment of godolphin which it appear lord westhaven doe not sure i had better suffer hi ill opinion of me than encourag godolphin hope which till delamer can be divert from prosecut hi unwelcom address will inevit involv him in a disput and such a disput as i can not bear to think of uncertain what to do anoth day pass and on the follow morn while she wait for ladi westhaven she wa address

health ha reduc her to a condit of deplor weak she speak so littl english that she is unabl to travel alon and i wa in hope that by her chais keep up with the coach i might have assist her on the road but she is now so extrem ill that i am afraid she must remain here dure the first part of thi short account emmelin charm more than ever with godolphin and asham of have for a moment entertain a suspicion to the disadvantag of such a man sat silent but at the conclus of it her eye overflow with tear she felt someth that told her she ought to apolog to him for the error she had been guilti oftho of that error he knew noth and impel by an involuntari impuls she held out her hand to himdear gener noblemind godolphin wa utter by her heart but her lip onli echo the last word godolphin said she let us go to thi poor young creaturelet us see her ourselv certainli we will cri mr stafford and inde sir you ought to have told us befor that we might sooner have offer all the assist in our power i wa afraid answer he i knew not whether i might not be deceiv in the charact of mr stornaway and dare not intrud upon you lest it should be found that the object merit not your good offic but she is in distress said emmelinesh is a strangerand shall we hesit godolphin who found in the tender of her address to him and in the approb her eye express a reward as sweet as that which the conscious of do good afford from hi own heart kiss the hand she had given him in silenc and then went to enquir if the poor young woman could see the ladi she express her joy at be so favour and mr stafford and emmelin were introduc the compass they express and the assur they gave her that she would meet her husband in london and that she should stay with them till she did calm and compos her and as her ill wa mere owe to fatigu and anxieti they believ a few hour rest now her mind wa easier would restor her tho they were impati to get on to london they yet hesit not to remain at canterburi all night on the account of thi poor stranger godolphin on hear their determin warmli thank them the heart of emmelin wa at onc eas of it inquietud and impress with a deeper sens than ever of godolphin worth she gave way almost for the first time to her tender and esteem without attempt to check or conceal her sentiment while mr stafford who ardent wish to see her in possess of her estat and marri to godolphin rejoic in observ her to be less reserv and godolphin himself hardli believ the happi he possess real forgot all hi fear of her attach to lord delamer and dare again entertain the hope he had discard at besançona he thought for ever the next day mr stornaway wa so much recov that they proceed in their journey take her into the coach with them and direct madelon to travel in the chais accompani by her father they arriv earli in town and godolphin leav them at an hotel went in search of lodg he soon found apart to accommod them in bond street and thither they immedi went mr stafford take upon herself the protect of the poor forlorn stranger till godolphin could find her husband on whose behalf he immedi intend to appli for a berth on board some ship in commiss he had given him a direct to hi banker and bid him there leav an address where he might be found in london the next day he brought the transport stornaway to hi wife and the gratitud these poor young peopl express to their benefactor convinc the fair friend that they had deserv hi kind and that there wa no decept in the stori the lieuten had told them about hi wife godolphin took a lodg for them in oxford street and gave them money for their support till he could get the young man employ which hi interest and indefatig friendship soon accomplish in the mean time he saw emmelin everi day and everi day he rose in her esteem yet still she hesit to discov to him all she thought of him and at time wa so reserv and so guard that godolphin knew not what to believ he knew she wa abov the paltri artific of coquetri yet she fear avoid be alon with him and never allow him an opportun of ask whether he had ani thing to hope from time and assidu is he not one of the best creatur in the world said mr stafford after he left the room on the second day of their arriv to go out in the servic of the stornaway ye ye and is that all the prais you allow to such a man is he not a perfect charact as perfect i suppos as ani of them are ah emmelin you are a littl hypocrit it is imposs you can be insens of the merit of godolphin and i wonder you are not in more hast to convinc him that you think of him as he deserv what would you have me do marri him befor i am sure he desir it smilingli ask emmelin you can not doubt that tho you so anxious repress everi attempt he make to explain himself shall i tell you what he ha said to me shall i tell you what motiv carri him to st alpin noi had rather not hear ani thing about it and whi not becaus it is better for some time if not for ever that godolphin should be ignor of those favour thought i may have had of himbett that i should ceas to entertain them whi so pray becaus i dread the mortifi pride and furiou jealousi of lord delamer on one hand and on the other the author of my uncl who till i am of age will probabl neither restor my fortun nor consent to my carri it out of hi famili for those veri reason you should immedi marri godolphin when you are actual marri delamer will reconcil himself to the loss of you to an inevit evil even hi haughti and selfwil spirit must submit and should lord montrevil give you ani troubl about your fortun who can so easili so properli oblig him to do you justic as a man of spirit of honour of understand who will have a right to insist upon it it wa imposs to deni so evid a truth yet still emmelin apprehend the consequ of delamer rage and disappoint and thought that there would be an indelicaci and an improprieti in withdraw herself from the protect of her own famili almost as soon as she could claim it and that her uncl might make such a step a pretenc for new content and longer wrath the result therefor of all her deliber end in a determin neither to engag herself or to marri till she wa of age and till then not even to encourag ani lover whatev by that time she hope that lord delamer weari by an hopeless passion and convinc of her fix indiffer would engag in some more success pursuit she knew that by that time all affair between her and lord montrevil must be adjust if the affect of godolphin wa as she hope fix and found on hi esteem for her charact he would not love her less at the end of that period when she should have the power of give him her estat unincumb with difficulti and unembarrass by law suit and should she hope escap the miseri of see delamer anguish and despair on which she could not bear to reflect she ingenu explain to mr stafford her reason for refus to receiv godolphin propos in which her friend tho she allow them to be plausibl by no mean acquiesc still insist upon it that the kindest thing she could do toward lord delamer as well as the properest in regard to the settlement of her estat wa immedi to accept godolphin but emmelin wa not to be convinc and all she could obtain from mr stafford wa an extort promis reluctantli given that she would not give ani advic or encourag to godolphin immedi to press hi suit emmelin tho convinc she wa right yet doubt whether she had fortitud enough to persist in the conduct she wish to adopt if expos at onc to the solicit of a woman of whose understand she had an high opinion and to the ardent supplic of the man she love the day after her arriv in london she had sent to berkleysquar and wa inform that lord montrevil and hi famili were in norfolk thither therefor she wrote and enclos the letter she had brought from lord westhaven her own wa couch in the most modest and duti term and that of lord westhaven wa equal mild and reason but they gave onli disquiet and concern to the ambiti and avarici bosom of lord montrevil tho alreadi tortur by delamer absenc and ill and uncertain whether the object of hi long solicitud would live to reap the advantag of hi accumul fortun he could not think but with pain and reluct of give up so larg a portion of hi annual incom still more unwil did he feel to refund the produc of the estat for so long a period and in the immedi emot of hi vexat at receiv lord westhaven first letter he had sent for sir richard croft who have at the time of mr mowbray death been entrust with all the paper and deed which belong to him wa the most like to know whether ani were among them that bore testimoni to the marriag of mr mowbray and miss stavordal the fact wa that a veri littl time befor he die hi steward williamson had receiv the memorandum of which emmelin had found a copi and on the death of hi master had carri it to sir richard croft lord montrevil be then in the north of england sir richard eagerli enquir whether there were ani other paper to the like purport williamson repli he believ not and veri thoughtlessli left it in hi hand when a few day afterward he call to know in whose name the busi of the mowbray estat wa to be carri on sir richard then act as an attorney and onli enter into life told him that everi thing wa to be consid as the properti of lord montrevil becaus there were mani doubt about the marriag of mr mowbray and great reason to think that the paper in question wa written mere with a view to piqu and perplex hi brother with whom he wa then at varianc but that lord montrevil would enquir into the busi and certainli do justic to ani claim the infant might have on the estat soon after williamson appli again to have the paper restor but croft answer that he should keep it by order of lord montrevil tho it wa of no use hi lordship have obtain undoubt inform that hi brother wa never marri sir richard had reflect on the great advantag that would accru to hi patron from the possess of thi estat to which besid it annual incom sever borough belong he thought it wa veri probabl that the littl girl then onli a few week old and without a mother or ani other than mercenari attend might die in her infanc if she did not that lord montrevil might easili provid for her and that it would be do hi friend a great servic and be highli advantag to himself should he conceal the legal claim of the child even unknown to her uncl and put him in immedi possess of hi patern estat have again strictli question williamson repress hi curios by law jargon and frighten him by threat of hi lord displeasur if he made ani effort to prove the legitimaci of emmelin he veri tranquilli destroy the paper and lord montrevil never knew that such a paper had exist williamson timid and ignor of everi thing beyond hi immedi busi return in great doubt and uneasi to mowbray castl when he receiv the child and the two casket he had question the frenchman who brought her and heard an absolut confirm of the marriag of hi master he then examin the casket and found the certif but without money or friend he knew not how to prosecut the claim of the orphan against the power and affluenc of lord montrevil and after frequent consult with mr carey they agre that the safest way would be care to secur those paper till emmelin wa old enough to find friend for should they attempt previous to procur justic for her they might probabl lose the paper which prove her birth as they had alreadi done that which williamson had deliv to croft as long as williamson live he care lock up these casket hi sudden death prevent him from take ani step to establish the claim of hi orphan mistress and that of mr carey two year afterward involv the whole affair in obscur which made sir richard quit easi as to ani futur discoveri but as the aggressor never forgiv sir richard had conceiv against emmelin the most unmanli and malign hatr and had invari oppos everi tendenc which he had observ in lord montrevil to befriend and assist her for no other reason but that he had alreadi irrepar injur her he hope that as he had at length divid her from lord delamer and driven her abroad she would there marri a foreign and be farther remov than ever from the famili and from ani chanc of recov the properti of which he had depriv her instead of which she had in consequ of go thither met the veri man in whose power it wa to prove the marriag of her mother and in lord westhaven had found a protector too intellig and too steadi to be discourag by evas or chicanerytoo power and too affluent to be thrown out of the pursuit either by the enmiti it might rais or the expenc it might demand noth could exceed the chagrin of sir richard when lord montrevil put into hi hand the first letter he had on thi subject from lord westhaven accustom howev to command hi counten he said without ani appar emot that as no paper in confirm of the fact alledg had ever exist among those deliv to him on the death of mr mowbray it wa probabl some forgeri that had impos on lord westhaven i see not how that can be answer lord montrevil it is not like that emmelin mowbray could forg such paper or should even conceiv such an idea true my lord but your lordship forget and overlook and pass by the long abod and continu and resid she ha made with the stafford mr stafford is to my certain knowledg and convict art and design and intrigu a woman my lord who affect and pretend and presum to understand and be compet and equal to busi and affair and concern with which women should never interfer or meddl or interest themselv it is clearli and evid and certainli to the interest and advantag and benefit of thi woman that miss mowbray over whom she ha great influenc and power and author should be establish and fix and settl in affluenc rather than remain and abid and continu where natur and justic and reason have place her i own sir richard i can not see the thing in thi light howev to do noth rashli let us consid how to proceed sir richard then advis him by no mean to answer lord westhaven letter but to wait till he saw hi lordship as in case so moment it wa he said alway wrong to give ani thing in black and white in a few day afterward he heard out of norfolk for he had come up from thenc to consult with sir richard croft that lord delamer wa ill at besançon hi precipit departur had befor given him the most poignant concern and now hi fear for hi life complet the distress of thi unfortun father on receiv howev the second letter from lord westhaven togeth with that of emmelin hi apprehens for the life of hi son were remov and left hi mind at liberti to recur again to the impend loss of four thousand five hundr a year with the unpleas accompany of be oblig to refund abov sixti thousand pound again sir richard croft wa sent for and again he tri to quiet the apprehens of lord montrevil but hi attempt to persuad him that the whole might be a decept origin with the stafford obtain not a moment attent he knew stafford himself wa weak ignor and indol and would neither have had sagac to think of or courag to execut such a design and that mr stafford should imagin and perform it seem equal improb he wa perfectli awar that lord westhaven had a thorough acquaint with busi and wa of all men on earth the most unlik to enter warmli into such an affair against the interest too of the famili into which he had marri unless he wa veri sure of have veri good ground for hi interfer but tho sir richard could not prevail on him to disbeliev the whole of the stori he saw that hi lordship thought with great reluct of the necess he should be under of relinquish the whole of the fortun he now therefor recommend it to him to remain quiet at least till lord westhaven came to england to send an answer to miss mowbray that meant noth and to gain time for farther enquiri these enquiri he himself undertook and leav lord montrevil in a polit fit of the gout he return from audley hall to london and bent all hi thought to the accomplish of hi design which wa to get the origin paper out of the hand of emmelin and to bribe le limosin to go back to franc while these thing were pass in england lord delamer whose rage and indign at emmelin departur the author of lord westhaven could hardli restrain had learn from hi brotherinlaw the real circumst of the birth of hi cousin and he heard them with the greatest satisfact he now thought it certain that hi father would press hi marriag as eagerli as he had befor oppos it and that so great an obstacl be remov and emmelin wholli in the power of hi famili she would be easili brought to forgiv him and to compli with the unit wish of all her relat in thi hope and be assur by lord westhaven that bellozan wa actual return into switzerland without ani design of follow emmelin who had been induc he said to leav besançon pure to avoid him he consent to attempt attain a greater command over hi temper on which the reestablish of hi health depend and after about ten day wa abl to travel lord and ladi westhaven therefor at the end of that time slowli began with him their journey to england chapter ix emmelin had now been almost a week in london and mr stafford with the assist of godolphin had succeed so much better than she expect in the arrang of some of those affair in which she apprehend the most difficulti that veri littl remain for her to do befor she should be enabl to return to franc where her husband wa to sign some paper to secur hi safeti and that littl depend on jame croft who seem to be make artifici delay and tri to give her all the troubl and perplex in hi power he had howev anoth motiv than mere to harrass and distress her hi father had employ him to deal with le limosin well know that there wa noth so base and degrad that he would not undertak where hi interest wa in question and sir richard had promis him a consider addit to hi fortun if he had address enough to prevent so capit a sum as emmelin claim from be deduct from that of the famili to whom hi brother wa alli and from whenc he had expect which could not but suffer from such a diminut of it wealth and interest the tedious therefor that the croft creat promis still to detain emmelin in london and her uncl letter which coldli and hardli with civil defer ani confer on her affair till the arriv of lord westhaven convinc her that from hi tender she had noth from hi justic littl to hope godolphin wa veri anxiou to be allow person to appli to him on the claim of hi niec but thi emmelin posit refus she would not even allow mr newton the lawyer to whom lord westhaven had recommend her and in whose hand her paper were safe deposit to write offici to lord montrevil but determin to wait quietli the return of lord westhaven himself on whom she knew neither the anger of her uncl or the artific of sir richard would make ani impress while hi lordship interfer could not be imput to such motiv as might possibl be thought to influenc godolphin or would it give her the appear of proceed unduti and harshli against lord montrevil which appear she might be liabl to should she hastili institut a suit against him she grew howev veri uneasi at the determin attend of godolphin whose presenc she knew wa so necessari to poor ladi adelina she saw that he wa anxiou about hi sister yet could not determin to tear himself from her and to insist upon hi return to ladi adelina would be to assum a right to which on the foot they were she declin pretend she fail not howev everi day to repres to him

tacitli allow him to entertain mr stafford notwithstand her promis to emmelin had not been abl to forbear discov to him part of the truth yet when he reflect on the advantag delamer had over him in fortun in rank in the influenc hi famili connect and hi former engag might give him he trembl least if he should be himself absent when lord delamer arriv her tender and timid spirit would yield to the sorrow of her lover and the author of her famili and that almost in despit of herself he might lose her for ever while he yet linger and continu to promis that he would go to the isl of wight the

of a temper which opposit and difficulti render more eager and more obstin yet when you are for ever out of hi reach as the obstacl will becom invinc he must yield to necess while you remain singl he will still hope the greatest kind therefor that you can do him will be to convinc him that he ha noth to expect from you and put an end at onc to the uncertainti which tortur him to drive him to

for the resembl he is said to bear to my father i piti him for the error which the natur impetuos of hi temper inflam by the unbound indulg of hi mother continu lead him into and the misfortun these caus are so frequent inflict on him and should hi fatal inclin for me be the mean of bring on himself and on hi famili yet other miseri i should never forgiv myself or him by whose mean they were incur from me at least you have noth of that sort to apprehend i truli piti delamer i feel what it must be to have relinquish the woman he love and to find her lost to hi hope while hi passion is

her other yet more terrifi she beheld in her dream godolphin wildli seek vengeanc of fitzedward for the death of hi sister then instead of fitzedward lord delamer appear to be the object of hi wrath and mutual furi seem to anim them against the live of each other to them her uncl in all the phrenzi of grief and despair succeed overwhelm her with reproach for the loss of hi onli son and tore her violent away from godolphin who in vain pursu her these horrid vision return so often drest in new form of terror that emmelin have long resist the impress they made upon her could at length bear them no longer but shake off all disposit to indulg sleep on such term she aros from her bed and wrap herself up in her night gown went to the window the dawn did not yet appear but she sat down by the window of which she had open the shutter to watch it welcom approach the morn for it wa between three and four wa mild the declin star were obscur by no cloud and serv to shew dimli the object in the garden beneath her she softli open the sash listen to the low hollow murmur of the sea and survey the lawn and the hill behind it which by the faint and uncertain light she could just discern all breath a certain solemn and melancholi still calcul to inspir horror emmelin blood ran cold yet innoc like her realli fear noth if free from the prejudic of superstit she endeavour to conquer the disagre sensat she felt and to shake off the effect of her dream but the silenc and the gloomi of the scene assist but littl her effort and she cast an eye of solicitud toward the eastern horizon and wish for the return of the sun in thi disposit of mind she wa at onc amaz and alarm by see the figur of a man tall and thin wrap in a long horseman coat as if on purpos to disguis him forc himself out from between the shrub which bound one part of the lawn he look not toward the window but with fold arm and hi hat over hi eye wa pore on the ground while with slow step he cross the lawn and came immedi under the window of the hous when she first perceiv him she had start back from that where she sat but tho greatli surpriz she could not forbear watch him on longer observ hi figur she fanci it wa that of a gentleman and by hi slow walk and manner he did not appear to have ani design to attack the hous her presenc of mind never forsook her unless where her heart wa greatli affect and she had now courag enough to determin that she would still continu for some moment to observ him and would not alarm the servant till she saw reason to believ he had ill intent she sat therefor quit still and saw that instead of make ani attempt to enter the hous he travers the whole side of it next the lawn with a measur and solemn pace sever time then stop a moment again went to the end and slowli return and have continu to do so near an hour he cross the grass and disappear among the shrub from whenc he had issu had not emmelin been veri sure that she not onli heard hi footstep distinctli as he pass over a gravel walk in hi way but even heard him breath hard and short as if agit or fatigu she would almost have persuad herself that it wa a phantom rais by her disord spirit the longer she reflect on it the more incomprehens it seem that a man should at such an hour make such an excurs appar to so littl purpos that it wa with a dishonest design there seem no likelihood as he made no effort to forc hi way into the hous which he might easili have done and had he come on a clandestin visit to ani of the servant he would probabl have had some signal by which hi confeder would have been inform of hi approach but he seem rather fear of disturb the sleep inhabit hi step wa slow and light and on perceiv the first ray of the morn he start like a guilti thing and swiftli step away to hi conceal emmelin continu some time at the window after hi disappear believ he might return but it soon grew quit light the garden appear at hi work and she wa then convinc that he would for that time come no more so extraordinari a circumst howev dwelt on her mind nor could she entir divest herself of alarm a strang and confus idea that thi visitor might be some one not unknown to her cross her mind hi height answer almost equal to that of bellozan godolphin and fitzedward the latter inde wa rather the tallest and to him she thought the figur bore the greatest resembl yet he had taken leav of her ten day befor she left london and told her he wa go down to mr perciv in berkshir where as he wa veri anxiou to hear of ladi adelina he had desir mr stafford to write to him who had done so and had receiv an answer of thank date from thenc befor the departur of emmelin from london that fitzedward therefor should be the person seem improb yet it wa hardli less so that a night ruffian should be on foot so long without ani attempt to execut mischief or even the appear of examin how it might be perpetr after long consider she determin that lest the first conjectur should be true she would speak to nobodi of the stranger she had seen but would watch anoth night befor she either terrifi ladi adelina with the apprehens of robber or gave rise to conjectur in her and the servant of yet more disquiet tendenc have taken thi resolut and argu herself out of all those fear for her person safeti which might have enfeebl a less ration mind she met ladi adelina at breakfast with her usual eas and almost with her usual chear but she wa pale and her eye were heavi ladi adelina remark it with concern but emmelin make light of it imput it intir to the fatigu of her journey and when their breakfast wa finish propos a walk to thi her friend assent and while she went to give some order and to fetch the crape veil in which she usual wrap herself for even her dress partook someth of the mourn cast of her mind emmelin alreadi equip went into the lawn and saw plainli where the stranger had made hi way thro the thick shrub and where the flexibl branch of a young larch were twist away a laurel broken and that some decidu tree behind them had lost all their lower leav which have sustain the first frost fell on the slightest violenc she mark the place with her eye and determin to observ whether if he came again it wa from thenc emmelin now desir that madelon might come with them to wait on littl william rather than hi own maid as she understood english so ill that she would be no interrupt to their discours they then walk arm in arm togeth toward the sea and there ladi adelina who now enjoy the opportun she had so long languish for open to her sympath friend the sorrow of an heart struggl vainli with a passion she condemn and sink under ineffectu effort to vindic her honour and erad her love she knew not that fitzedward had ever written to her godolphin well acquaint with hi hand had kept the letter from her she knew not that he had appli to emmelin and tho she had torn herself from him and had vow never again to write to him to name him to hear from him she involuntarili felt dispos to accus him of neglect of ingratitud of cruelti for have never attempt to write to her or see her and ad the poignant anguish of jealousi to the dreari horror of despair that fitzedward wa for ever lost to her she seem to be convinc yet that he should forget her or attach himself to anoth seem a torment so entir insupport that when her mind dwelt upon it as it perpetu did her reason wa inadequ to the pain it inflict and when she touch on that subject emmelin too evid saw symptom of that derang of intellect to which she had onc befor been a melancholi wit with a mind thu unsettl and a heart thu oppress the consequ of touch on the applic of fitzedward to herself might as emmelin believ have the most alarm effect on ladi adelina and she dare not therefor name it unless she had the concurr of godolphin she onli attempt to sooth and tranquil her mind without give her those assur of hi undiminish attach which she thought might in the event onli encreas her anguish if her brother remain inflex on the other hand she forbor to remonstr with her on the necess there might be to forget him be too well convinc that the argument which were to enforc that doctrin would be useless and perhap appear cruel to a heart so deepli wound as wa that of the luckless love adelina but in pour her sorrow into the bosom of her friend she appear to find consol the tender piti of emmelin wa a balm to her wound mind and grow more compos she began to discours on the singular discoveri emmelin had made and to enter with some interest into the affair depend between her and the marqui of montrevil and by question aid by the natur frank of emmelin at length becam acquaint with the happi prospect which tho distant open to godolphin thi wa the onli inform that seem to have the power of suspend for a moment the weight of those afflict which ladi adelina suffer my brother then cri shemi dear godolphin will be happi and you my most amiabl friend will constitut

interrupt your felic no longer by the sight of cureless calam she will in full confid entrust the sole tie she ha on earth the dear and innoc victim of her fatal weak to the compassion bosom of godolphin and hi emmelin the tremul voic and singular manner in which ladi adelina utter these word made emmelin trembl she now tri to divert the attent of her poor friend from dwell too earnestli either on her own wretched or the promis felic of her brother but as if exhaust by the mingl emot of pain and pleasur she soon afterward fell into a deep silenc scarc attend to what wa said and after

convinc of her partial intellectu derang follow her dread lest she should see it encreas without the power of appli ani remedi befor ladi adelina reach the gate which open from the cliff to the lawn she wa fatigu by her love burthen and forc to stop emmelin would then have taken him but she said no and sit down on the ground held him in her lap till barret who had seen her from a window came out and took him from her to which as to a thing usual she consent and then walk calmli home with emmelin who extrem discompos by the wild of her manner wa fear of again introduc ani interest topic lest she should again touch those fine chord which were untun in the mind of her unhappi friend and which seem occasion to vibrat with an acut that threaten the ruin of the whole fabric barret who

in which she must forgiv me if all my vener and esteem for her good and tender doe not induc me to desist he then went into the hall and by the lamp which burnt there open himself the door into the garden and hastili walk away while the trembl and harrass emmelin find him inflex went back to godolphin with veri littl hope that she should with him have better success chapter xiii on enter the

you thu pale and trembl he led her to a seat and place himself by her gaze with extrem concern on her face pallid as it wa and express onli of sorrow and anxieti whenc is it said she after a paus of some moment that i see you here did i not come hither on the assur you gave me that you would long be detain in or near london by the busi of your sister i certainli did say so but i could not then forese what happen on the sunday after you left london ha then ani thing happen the return of lord and ladi westhaven with lord delamer are they all well toler so but my brother is veri anxiou to see adelina and expect you with littl less solicitud he could not think of give ladi westhaven the troubl of such a journey nor could he now leav her without be unhappi i therefor at hi press request came myself to fetch you both to london and do you mean that we should begin our journey tomorrow i meant it certainli till the event of thi even made me doubt how far my sister herself may be in a situat to bear chang of place and varieti of object or be abl whether she may chuse to leav to me the direct of her action ah imput not to ladi adelina the meet with fitzedward it wa entir accident it sudden overcam her and threw her into the way in which you saw her and what ha a man to answer for who thu come to insult hi victim and to rob her of the littl tranquil time may have restor to her inde i think you injur poor fitzedward fondli attach to your sister he ha no other wish or hope than to be allow to address her when the time of her mourn for mr trelawni is expir for thi permiss he intend to appli to you but the sever with which you ever receiv hi advanc discourag him and he then in the hope of hear that such an applic would not be render ineffectu by her own refus and languish to see hi son came hither not with ani intent of forc himself abruptli into the presenc of ladi adelina but to see me and induc me to interced with her for an interview accid threw us in hi way your sister fell senseless on the ground and when she did recov endeavour to avoid him but she wa too weak to walk home without other assist than mine and i wa compel to accept for her that which fitzedward offer on hear from barret that you wa return the terror which ha ever pursu her lest you and fitzedward should meet as enemi again overcam her and occas the scene you must with so much astonish have beheld ha adelina had ani previou knowledg of the propos fitzedward intend to make none i believ in the world do you know whether they have ever correspond i am convinc they have not there are object in my mind insuper object to thi allianc these howev i must talk over with the colonel himself not hostil i hope sure you have too much regard for the unhappi adelina to give way now to ani resent you may have conceiv against him or if that doe not influenc you think of what i must suffer she knew not what she had said hardli what she intend to say enchant soft exclaim godolphin in a transporti then the safeti of godolphin so dear to that angel bosom you know it but too well but if my quiet is equal dear to you promis me that if thi meet tomorrow must take place you will receiv fitzedward with civil and hear him with patienc rememb on how mani account thi is necessari rememb how mani express there are which hi profess will not allow him to hear without resent that must end in blood your is no common caus of enmiti none of those trifl quarrel which daili send modern beaux into the field your charact are both high as militari men and as gentlemen and your former intimaci must i know impress more deepli on the mind of each the injuri or offenc that either suppos they receiv be care then godolphin promis me you will be care ah love emmelin more love from thi gener tender than from your other exquisit perfect can i be insens of the valu of a life for which you interest yourself and shall i suffer ani other consider to come in competit with your peac you promis me then to be calm with fitzedward i do and while i rememb hi offenc for can i forget while i suffer from it i will also recollect that you who have also suffer on the same account think him worthi of compass and i will tri to conquer at least to stifl my resent but what shall we do with adelina that must depend on her situat in the morn i have greatli apprehend an unhappi turn in her intellect ever sinc my first come the death of trelawni far from appear to have reliev her by remov the impedi to her union with fitzedward seem rather to have render her more wretch continu agit by contend passion she wa long unhappi in the supposit that fitzedward had obey her when she desir him to forget her sinc trelawni deceas as she ha more fearlessli allow her thought to dwell on him she ha suffer all the anxieti of expect to hear from him and all the bitter of disappoint and i could plainli perceiv that she wa still debat with herself whether if he did appli to her she should accept him or by a violent effort of heroism determin to see him no more thi conflict is yet to come judg whether in the frame of mind in which you see her she is equal to it and whether ani addit terror for you and for him will not quit undo her ala far from aggrav by pursu your resent anguish so poignant tri rather to sooth her sorrow and assist her determin and whatev that determin may be when it is onc made she may perhap be restor to health and to tranquil inde i will do all you dictat my loveliest friend sure i should ill deserv the generos you have shewn to me were i incap of feel for other and particularli for my sister but wherefor that air of defianc which mr fitzedward thought it necessari to assum he seem to come more dispos to insult than to concili the famili of ladi adelina ala do you make no allow for the perturb situat of hi mind when he saw the woman he ador to all appear dead and for the first time beheld the poor littl boy he look upon you as one who desir to tear from him for ever these belov object and forget that he wa the aggressor thought onli of the injuri which he suppos you intend there is inde some apolog for the asper of hi manner and perhap i wa in some measur to blame gener candid consider emmelin how doe your excel heart teach you to excus those weak you do not feel and to piti and to forgiv error which your own perfect mind make it imposs for you to commit ah how heavili is your tender perpetu tax here it is suffer from the sight of adelinain town it will have anoth object in the unfortun delamer did you not tell me he wa in toler health ala what is bodili health when the mind is ill at eas the anxieti of delamer to see you to hear hi destini from yourself is uneasi even to me who feel my own exquisit happi in know what that destini must be i look with even pain commiser on thi singular young man yet from passion so violent and obstinaci so invinc i must have rejoic that miss mowbray ha escap even tho her prefer of the fortun godolphin had not render hi lot the most happi that a human be can possess sinc you are so good said emmelin faintli for she wa quit exhaust to compassion the situat of mind of delamer you will i think see the human of conceal from himthat she could find no term that she like to express her mean and stop that he ha a fortun rival said godolphin no dearest emmelin i hope i am incap of such a triumph till poor delamer is more at eas i am content to enjoy the happi of know your favour opinion without wish by an insult display of it to convinc him he ha for ever thrown a pearl away richer than all hi tribe yet i am sure you will think it still more cruel to give him hope i will tell you all my weak while i see you here all benign and good to me i feel for lord delamer infinit piti but were you to receiv him with your usual sweet to give him mani of those enchant smile and to look at him with those soft eye as if you tenderli felt hi sorrow i am not sure whether the most unreason jealousi would not possess me and whether i should not hate him as much as i now wish him well that were to be inde unreason and to act veri inconsist with your natur candour and human i will not think so ill of you as to believ you you know i must of cours often see lord delamer but after the avow you have extort from me sure i need not repeat that i shall see him onli as my friend godolphin then kiss her hand in raptur and for a few moment forgot even hi concern for ladi adelina emmelin now wish to break off the convers and he at length allow her to leav him after have enquir of barret after her mistress who wa happili in a calmer sleep she retir to her own room where she hope to have a few hour of repos but notwithstand the promis of godolphin she felt as the hour of the morn approach on which he wa to meet fitzedward that anxieti chase away sleep and again made her suffer the cruellest suspens the heart of godolphin glow with the liveliest sens of hi own happi yet felt with great keen the unfortun situat of hi sister he began to doubt whether he had ani right to perpetu her wretched and whether it were not better to leav it to herself to decid in regard to fitzedward the delicaci of hi honour made him see an infin of object to their marriag which to common mind might appear chimer and romant to that part of hi own famili who were yet ignor of her former indiscret as he could not urg hi reason hi opposit of fitzedward must seem caprici and unjust lord westhaven must therefor either be told that which had hitherto with so much pain been conceal from him or he must determin to refer fitzedward entir to ladi adelina herself and on thi after long deliber he fix exactli as the clock struck seven fitzedward wa at the door and wa introduc into godolphin studi who wa alreadi up and wait for him emmelin still full of apprehens had arisen befor six and hear ladi adelina wa still asleep had gone down stair and wait with a palpit heart in the breakfast room she wa glad to distinguish at their first meet the usual salut of the morn she listen but tho the rest of the hous wa profoundli silent she could not hear their convers or even the tone in which it wa carri on it wa
