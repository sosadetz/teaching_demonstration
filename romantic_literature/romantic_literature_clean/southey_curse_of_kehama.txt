the perpetu fli of the manucodiata by the gape of the feather of her wing which seem therebi less fit to sustain her bodi but further make the narrat probabl by what he ha observ in kite hover in the air as he saith for a whole hour togeth without flap of her wing or chang place and he ha found also how she may sleep in the air from the exampl of fish which he ha seen sleep in the water without

describ els how could their gener continu franciscu hernandeo affirm the same with cardan expressli in everi thing as also eusebiu nierembergiu who is so taken with the stori of thi bird that he could not abstain from celebr her miracul properti in a short but eleg copi of vers and doe after though confid oppos assert the main matter again in prose such are the sufferag of cardan scalig hernandeo nierembergiu but aldrovandu reject that fabl of her feed on the dew of heaven and of her incubitur on the back of the male with much scorn and indign and as for the former hi reason are no way contempt he alledg that dew is a bodi not perfectli enough mix or heterogeni enough for food nor the hard bill of the bird made for such easi use as sip thi soft moistur to which i know not what cardan and the rest would answer unless thi that they mean by dew the more unctuou moistur of the air which as it may not be alik everi where so these bird may be fit with a natur sagac to find it out where it is that there is dew in thi sens day and night as well as in the morn and in all season of the year and therefor a constant suppli of moistur and spirit to their perpetu fli which they more copious imbib by reason of their exercis that the thicker part of thi moistur stick and convert into flesh and that the light of their feather is so great that their pain in sustain themselv are not overmuch that what is homogen and simpl to our sight is fit enough to be the rudiment of gener all anim be gener of a kind of clear crystallin liquor and that therefor it may be also of nutrit that

fli by cut the way and for better ornament for the rectifi also and compos of their feather while they swim in the air with as much eas as swan do in river to hi great impati against their manner of incub they would happili return thi answer that the way is not ridicul but it may be rather necessari from what aldrovandu himself not onli acknowledg but contend for name that they have no feet at all for henc it is manifest that they can not light upon the ground nor ani where rest on their belli and be abl to get on wing again becaus they can not creep out of hole of rock as swift and such like shortfoot bird can they have no feet at all to creep with besid as aristotl well argu concern the long leg of certain waterfowl that they were made so long becaus they were to wade in the water and catch fish ad that excel aphor τὰ γαρ ὄργανα πρὸς τὸ ἔργον ἡ φύσις ποιεῖ ἀλλ᾽ ὐ τὸ ἔργον πρὸς τὰ ὄργανα so may we ration conclud will they say that as the long leg of these waterfowl impli a design of their haunt the water so want of leg in these manucodiata argu they are never to come down to the earth becaus they can neither stand there nor get off again and if they never come on the earth or ani other restingplac where can their egg be laid or hatch but on the back of the male besid that cardan pleas himself with that antiphoni in natur that as the ostrich be a bird yet never fli in the air and never rest upon the earth and as for aldrovandu hi presumpt from the five sever manucodiata that he had seen and in which he could observ no such figur of part as impli a fit for such a manner of incub cardan will answer myself ha seen three and scalig one who both agre against you howev you see that both cardan aldrovandu and the rest do jointli agre in allow the manucodiata no feet as also in furnish her with two string hang at the hinder part of her bodi which aldrovandu will have to be in the femal as well as in the male though cardan experi reacheth not so far but pighafetta and clusiu will easili end thi grand controversi betwixt cardan and aldrovandu if it be true which they report and if they speak of the same kind of bird of paradis for they both affirm that they have feet a palm long and that with all confid imagin but nierembergiu on the contrari affirm that one that wa an eye wit and that had taken up one of these bird newli dead told him that it had no feet at all johnston also give hi suffrag with nierembergiu in thi though with aldrovandu he reject the manner of their incub but unless they can rais themselv from the ground by the stiff of some of the feather of their wing or rather by virtu of those nervou string which they may have a power to stiffen when they are aliv by transfus spirit into them and make them serv as well instead of leg to rais them from the ground as to hang upon the bough of tree by a slight thing be abl to rais or hold up their lightfeath bodi in the air as a small twig will us in the water i should rather inclin to the testimoni of pighafetta and clusiu than to the judgment of the rest and believ those marin that told him that the leg are pull off by them that take them and extenter them and dri them in the sun for either their privat use or sale which conclus would the best solv the credit of aristotl who long sinc ha so peremptorili pronounc ὄτι πτηνὸν μόνον ὐδὲν ἐσιν ὥσπερ νευσικὸν μόνον ἐσιν ὶχθὸς that there is not ani bird that onli fli as the fish onli swim but thu our bird of paradis is quit flown and vanish into a figment or fabl but if ani one will condol the loss of so convinc an argument for a

regard the bring thi doubt narrat into play may not justli seem to no purpos it carri so seriou and castigatori a piec of pleasantri with it the manucodiata live on the dew is no part of the convict of a provid in thi stori but the be excel well provid of wing and feather tanta levitati supellectil exornata as nierembergiu speak be so well furnish with all advantag for light that it seem harder for her to sink down as he conceit than to be born up in the air that a bird thu fit for that region should have no leg to stand on the earth thi would be a consider indic of a discrimin provid that on purpos avoid all useless and superflu the other remark and it is a notori one is the caviti on the back of the male and in the breast of the femal for incub and the third and last the use of those

if what i put in lieu of them and is but ordinari have not the same forc with thee for is not the fish want feet as we observ befor she be suffici suppli with fin in so thick an element as the water

swift as in give no leg at all to the manucodiata who ha still a greater power of wing and light of bodi and as for the caviti on the back of the male and in the breast of the femal is that design of natur ani more certain and plain than in the genit part of the male and femal in all kind of anim what greater argument of counsel and purpos of fit one thing for anoth can there be than that and if
