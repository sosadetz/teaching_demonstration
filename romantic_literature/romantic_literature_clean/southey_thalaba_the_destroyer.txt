which are seen afar off for they seem small and the more nere a man commeth to them the bigger they be but thi tower afar off seemeth a veri great thing and the nerer you come to it the lesser my judgement and reason of thi is that becaus the tower is set in a veri great plain and hath noth more about to make ani shew save the ruin of it which it hath made round about and for thi respect descri it afarr off that piec of the tower which yet standeth with the mountain that is made of the substanc that hath fallen from it maketh a greater shew than you shall find com neer to it cæsar frederick john eldr mention the same decept be upon a plain ground it seemeth afarr off veri great but the nerer you come to it the lesser and lesser it appeareth sundri time i have gone thither to

what to make of it it figur is squar and rise in form of a tower or pyramid with four front which answer to the four quarter of the compass but it seem longer from north to s than from e to w and is as far as i could judg by my pace it a larg quarter of a leagu it situat and form correspond with that pyramid which strabo call the tower of belu and is in all likelihood the tower of nimrod in babylon or babel as that place is still call in that author time it had noth remain of the stair and other ornament mention by herodotu the greatest part of it have been ruin by xerx and alexand who design to have restor it to it former lustr wa prevent by death there appear no mark of ruin without the compass of that huge mass to convinc one that so great a citi as babylon had ever stood there all one discov within or pace of it be onli the remain here and there of some foundat of build and the countri round about it so flat and level that one can hardli believ it should be chosen for the

these particular that night the father did not come but the next even he made him anoth visit and desir someth to eat it is not known whether hi son gave him ani thing or not but the next morn the young man wa found dead in hi bed the magistr or bailiff of the place had notic of thi as also that the same day five or six person fell sick in the villag and die one after the other he sent an exact account of thi to the tribun of belgrad and thereupon two commission were dispatch to the villag attend by an execution with instruct to examin close into the affair an offic in the imperi servic from whom we have thi relat went also from gradiseh in order to examin person an affair of which he had heard so much they open in the first place the grave of all who had been buri in six week when they came to that of the old man they found hi eye open hi colour fresh hi respir quick and strong yet he appear to be stiff and insens from these sign they conclud him to be a notori vampir the execution thereupon by the command of the commission struck a stake thro hi heart and when he had so done they made a bonfir and therein consum the carcas to ash there wa no mark of vampir found on hi son or on

the blood of the live insomuch that these peopl appear like skeleton while the dead bodi of the sucker are so full of blood that it run out at all the passag of their bodi and even at their veri pore thi odd opinion of their they support by a multitud of fact attest in such a manner that they leav no room for doubt we shall here mention some of the most consider it is now about five year ago that a certain heyduk an inhabit of the villag of medreiga whose name wa arnold paul wa bruis to death by a haycart which ran over him thirti day after hi death no less than four person die suddenli in that manner wherein accord to the tradit of the countri those peopl gener die who are suck by vampir upon thi a stori wa call to mind that thi arnold paul had told in hi lifetim viz that at cossova on the frontier of the turkish servia he had been torment by a vampir now the establish opinion is that a person suck by a vampir becom a vampir himself and suck in hi turn but that he had found a way to rid himself of thi evil by eat some of the earth out of the vampir grave and rub himself with hi blood thi precaut howev did not hinder hi becom a vampir insomuch that hi bodi be taken up forti day after hi death all the mark of a notori vampir were found thereon hi complexion wa fresh hi hair nail and beard were grown he wa full of fluid blood which ran from all part of hi bodi upon hi shroud the hadnagi or bailiff of the place who wa a person well acquaint with vampir caus a sharp stake to be thrust as the custom is through the heart of arnold paul and also quit through hi bodi whereupon he cri out dread as if he had been aliv thi done they cut off hi head burnt hi bodi and threw the ash thereof into saav they took the same measur with the bodi of those person who had die of vampir for fear that they should fall to suck in their turn all these prudent step did not hinder the same mischief from break out again about five year afterward when sever peopl in the same villag die in a veri odd manner in the space of three month seventeen person of all age and sex die of vampir some suddenli and some after two or three day suffer amongst other there wa one stanoska the daughter of a

they took up the bodi and found him so in effect the princip person of the place particularli the physician and surgeon began to examin veri narrowli how in spite of all their precaut vampir had again broke out in so terribl a manner after a strict inquisit they found that the deceas arnold paul had not onli suck the four person befor mention but likewis sever beast of whom the new vampir had eaten particularli the son of millo induc by these circumst they took a resolut of dig up the bodi of all person who had die within a certain time they did so and amongst forti bodi there were found

of peopl began to complain of it the papa themselv gave credit to the fact and no doubt had their reason for so do mass must be said to be sure but for all thi the peasant drove hi old trade and heed noth they could do after diver meet of the chief peopl of the citi of priest and monk it wa grave conclud that twa necessari in consequ of some musti ceremoni to wait till nine day after the inter should be expir on the tenth day they said one mass in the chapel where the bodi wa laid in order to drive out the demon which they imagin wa got into it after mass they took up the bodi and got everi thing readi for pull out it heart the butcher of the town an old clumsi fellow first open the belli instead of the breast he grope a long while among the entrail but could not find what he look for at last somebodi told him he should cut up the diaphragm the heart wa then pull out to the admir of all the spectat in the mean time the corps stunk so abomin that they were oblig to burn frankincens but the smoke mix with the exhal from the carcass increas the stink and began to muddl the poor peopl pericrani their imagin struck with the spectacl befor them grew full of vision it came into their

pretend redivivi the nois bellow thro the street and it seem to be a name invent on purpos to rend the roof of the chapel sever there present averrd that the wretch blood wa extrem red the butcher swore the bodi wa still warm whenc they conclud that the deceasd wa a veri ill man for not be thoroughli dead or in plain term for suffer himself to be reanim by old nick which is the notion they have of vroucolaca they then roard out that name in a stupend manner just at thi time came in a flock of peopl loudli protest they plainli perceiv the bodi wa not grown stiff when it wa carri from the field to church to be buri and that consequ it wa a true vroucolaca which word wa still the burden of the song i dont doubt they would have sworn it did not stink had not we been there so maze were the poor peopl with thi disast and so infatu with their notion of the dead be reanim as for us who were got as close to the corps as we could that we might be more exact in our observ we were almost poison with the intoler stink that issu from it when they ask us what we thought of thi bodi we told them we believ it to be veri thoroughli dead but as we were will to cure or at least not to exasper their prejud imagin we repres to them that it wa no wonder the butcher should feel a littl warmth when he grope among entrail that were then rot that it wa no extraordinari thing for it to emit fume sinc dung turn up will do the same that as for the pretend red of the blood it still appear by the butcher hand to be noth but a veri stink nasti smear after all our reason they were of opinion it would be their wisest cours to burn the dead man heart on the seashor but thi execut did not make him a bit more tractabl he went on with hi racket more furious than ever he wa accus of beat folk in
