that all the world exclaimd what magnanim no doubt thi patienc when the world is damn us is philosoph in our former friend t is also pleasant to be deemd magnanim the more so in obtain our own end and what the lawyer call a malu animu conduct like thi by no mean comprehend reveng in person s certainli no virtu but then t is not my fault if other hurt you and if your quarrel should rip up old stori

wa sole heir to a chanceri suit and messuag and land which with a long minor and care promis to turn out well in proper hand inez becam sole guardian which wa fair and answerd but to natur just demand an onli son left with an onli mother is brought up much more wise than anoth sagest of women even of widow she resolv that juan should be quit a paragon and worthi of the noblest pedigre hi sire wa of castil hi dam from aragon then for accomplish of chivalri in case our lord the king should go to war again he learnd the art of ride fenc gunneri and how to scale a fortressor a nunneri but that which donna inez most desir and saw into herself each day befor all the learn tutor whom for him she hire wa that hi breed should be strictli moral much into all hi studi she inquir and so they were submit first to her all art scienc no branch wa made a mysteri to juan eye except natur histori the languag especi the dead the scienc and most of all the abstrus the art at least all such as could be said to be the most remot from common use in all these he wa much and deepli read but not a page of ani thing that s loos or hint continu of the speci wa ever sufferd lest he should grow viciou hi classic studi made a littl puzzl becaus of filthi love of god and goddess who in the earlier age rais a bustl but never put on pantaloon or bodic hi reverend tutor had at time a tussl and for their aeneid iliad and odyssey were forc to make an odd sort of apolog for donna inez dread the mytholog ovid s a rake as half hi vers show him anacreon moral are a still wors sampl catullu scarc ha a decent poem i dont think sappho ode a good exampl although longinu tell us there is no hymn where the sublim soar forth on wing more ampl but virgil song are pure except that horrid one begin with formosum pastor corydon lucretiu irreligion is too strong for earli stomach to prove wholesom food i cant help think juven wa wrong although no doubt hi real intent wa good for speak out so plainli in hi song so much inde as to be downright rude and then what proper person can be partial to all those nauseou epigram of martial juan wa taught from out the best edit expurg by learn men who place judici from out the schoolboy vision the grosser part but fear to defac too much their modest bard by thi omiss and piti sore hi mutil case they onli add them all in an appendix which save in fact the troubl of an index for there we have them all at one fell swoop instead of be scatterd through the page they stand forth marshalld in a handsom troop to meet the ingenu youth of futur age till some less rigid editor shall stoop to call them back into their separ cage instead of stand stare all togeth like garden godsand not so decent either the missal too it wa the famili missal wa ornament in a sort of way which ancient massbook often are and thi all kind of grotesqu illumin and how they who saw those figur on the margin kiss all could turn their optic to the text and pray is more than i knowbut don juan mother kept thi herself and gave her son anoth sermon he read and lectur he endur and homili and live of all the saint to jerom and to chrysostom inur he did not take such studi for restraint but how faith is acquir and then ensur so well not one of the aforesaid paint as saint augustin in hi fine confess which make the reader envi hi transgress thi too wa a seald book to littl juan i cant but say that hi mamma wa right if such an educ wa the true one she scarc trust him from out her sight her maid were old and if she took a new one you might be sure she wa a perfect fright she did thi dure even her husband life i recommend as much to everi wife young juan waxd in goodli and grace at six a charm child and at eleven with all the promis of as fine a face as eer to man matur growth wa given he studi steadili and grew apac and seemd at least in the right road to heaven for half hi day were passd at church the other between hi tutor confessor and mother at six i said he wa a charm child at twelv he wa a fine but quiet boy although in infanc a littl wild they tame him down amongst them to destroy hi natur spirit not in vain they toild at least it seemd so and hi mother joy wa to declar how sage and still and steadi her young philosoph wa grown alreadi i had my doubt perhap i have them still but what i say is neither here nor there i knew hi father well and have some skill in characterbut it would not be fair from sire to son to augur good or ill he and hi wife were an illsort pair but scandal s my aversioni protest against all evil speak even in jest for my part i say nothingnothingbut thi i will saymi reason are my own that if i had an onli son to put to school as god be prais that i have none t is not with donna inez i would shut him up to learn hi catech alon nonoi d send him out betim to colleg for there it wa i pickd up my own knowledg for there one learnst is not for me to boast though i acquiredbut i pass over that as well as all the greek i sinc have lost i say that there s the placebut verbum sat i think i pickd up too as well as most knowledg of mattersbut no matter what i never marriedbut i think i know that son should not be educ so young juan now wa sixteen year of age tall handsom slender but well knit he seemd activ though not so sprightli as a page and everybodi but hi mother deemd him almost man but she flew in a rage and bit her lip for els she might have screamd if ani said so for to be precoci wa in her eye a thing the most atroci amongst her numer acquaint all select for discret and devot there wa the donna julia whom to call pretti were but to give a feebl notion of mani charm in her as natur as sweet to the flower or salt to ocean her zone to venu or hi bow to cupid but thi last simil is trite and stupid the dark of her orient eye accord with her moorish origin her blood wa not all spanish by the by in spain you know thi is a sort of sin when proud granada fell and forc to fli boabdil wept of donna julia kin some went to africa some stayd in spain her greatgreatgrandmamma chose to remain she marri i forget the pedigre with an hidalgo who transmit down hi blood less nobl than such blood should be at such allianc hi sire would frown in that point so precis in each degre that they bred in and in as might be shown marri their cousinsnay their aunt and niec which alway spoil the breed if it increas thi heathenish cross restor the breed again ruind it blood but much improv it flesh for from a root the ugliest in old spain sprung up a branch as beauti as fresh the son no more were short the daughter plain but there s a rumour which i fain would hush t is said that donna julia grandmamma produc her don more heir at love than law howev thi might be the race went on improv still through everi gener until it centr in an onli son who left an onli daughter my narrat may have suggest that thi singl one could be but julia whom on thi occas i shall have much to speak about and she wa marri charm chast and twentythre her eye i m veri fond of handsom eye wa larg and dark suppress half it fire until she spoke then through it soft disguis flashd an express more of pride than ire and love than either and there would aris a someth in them which wa not desir but would have been perhap but for the soul which struggl through and chastend down the whole her glossi hair wa clusterd oer a brow bright with intellig and fair and smooth her eyebrow shape wa like th aerial bow her cheek all purpl with the beam of youth mount at time to a transpar glow as if her vein ran lightn she in sooth possessd an air and grace by no mean common her statur talli hate a dumpi woman wed she wa some year and to a man of fifti and such husband are in plenti and yet i think instead of such a one t were better to have two of fiveandtwenti especi in countri near the sun and now i think on t mi vien in ment ladi even of the most uneasi virtu prefer a spous whose age is short of thirti t is a sad thing i can not choos but say and all the fault of that indec sun who can not leav alon our helpless clay but will keep bake broil burn on that howsoev peopl fast and pray the flesh is frail and so the soul undon what men call gallantri and god adulteri is much more common where the climat s sultri happi the nation of the moral north where all is virtu and the winter season send sin without a rag on shiver forth t wa snow that brought st anthoni to reason where juri cast up what a wife is worth by lay whateer sum in mulct they pleas on the lover who must pay a handsom price becaus it is a market vice alfonso wa the name of julia lord a man well look for hi year and who wa neither much belov nor yet abhorrd they live togeth as most peopl do suffer each other foibl by accord and not exactli either one or two yet he wa jealou though he did not show it for jealousi dislik the world to know it julia wasyet i never could see whi with donna inez quit a favourit friend between their tast there wa small sympathi for not a line had julia ever pennd some peopl whisper but no doubt they lie for malic still imput some privat end that inez had ere don alfonso marriag forgot with him her veri prudent carriag and that still keep up the old connect which time had late renderd much more chast she took hi ladi also in affect and certainli thi cours wa much the best she flatterd julia with her sage protect and compliment don alfonso tast and if she could not who can silenc scandal at least she left it a more slender handl i cant tell whether julia saw the affair with other peopl eye or if her own discoveri made but none could be awar of thi at least no symptom eer wa shown perhap she did not know or did not care indiffer from the first or callou grown i m realli puzzl what to think or say she kept her counsel in so close a way juan she saw and as a pretti child caressd him oftensuch a thing might be quit innoc done and harmless style when she had twenti year and thirteen he but i am not so sure i should have smile when he wa sixteen julia twentythre these few short year make wondrou alter particularli amongst sunburnt nation whateer the caus might be they had becom chang for the dame grew distant the youth shi their look cast down their greet almost dumb and much embarrass in either eye there sure will be littl doubt with some that donna julia knew the reason whi but as for juan he had no more notion than he who never saw the sea of ocean yet julia veri cold still wa kind and tremul gentl her small hand withdrew itself from hi but left behind a littl pressur thrill and so bland and slight so veri slight that to the mind t wa but a doubt but neer magician wand wrought chang with all armida fairi art like what thi light touch left on juan heart and if she met him though she smile no more she lookd a sad sweeter than her smile as if her heart had deeper thought in store she must not own but cherishd more the while for that compress in it burn core even innoc itself ha mani a wile and will not dare to trust itself with truth and love is taught hypocrisi from youth but passion most dissembl yet betray even by it dark as the blackest sky foretel the heaviest tempest it display it work through the vainli guard eye and in whatev aspect it array itself t is still the same hypocrisi cold or anger even disdain or hate are mask it often wear and still too late then there were sigh the deeper for suppress and stolen glanc sweeter for the theft and burn blush though for no transgress trembl when met and restless when left all these are littl prelud to possess of which young passion can not be bereft and mere tend to show how greatli love is embarrassd at first start with a novic poor julia heart wa in an awkward state she felt it go and resolv to make the noblest effort for herself and mate for honour pride religion virtu sake her resolut were most truli great and almost might have made a tarquin quak she prayd the virgin mari for her grace as be the best judg of a ladi case she vowd she never would see juan more and next day paid a visit to hi mother and lookd extrem at the open door which by the virgin grace let in anoth grate she wa and yet a littl sore again it open it can be no other t is sure juan nowno i m afraid that night the virgin wa no further prayd she now determin that a virtuou woman should rather face and overcom temptat that flight wa base and dastardli and no man should ever give her heart the least sensat that is to say a thought beyond the common prefer that we must feel upon occas for peopl who are pleasant than other but then they onli seem so mani brother and even if by chanceand who can tell the devil s so veri slysh should discov that all within wa not so veri well and if still free that such or such a lover might pleas perhap a virtuou wife can quell such thought and be the better when they re over and if the man should ask t is but denial i recommend young ladi to make trial and then there are such thing as love divin bright and immacul unmixd and pure such as the angel think so veri fine and matron who would be no less secur platon perfect just such love as mine thu julia saidand thought so to be sure and so i d have her think were i the man on whom her reveri celesti ran such love is innoc and may exist between young person without ani danger a hand may first and then a lip be kist for my part to such do i m a stranger but hear these freedom form the utmost list of all oer which such love may be a ranger if peopl go beyond t is quit a crime but not my faulti tell them all in time love then but love within it proper limit wa julia innoc determin in young don juan favour and to him it exert might be use on occas and light at too pure a shrine to dim it ether lustr with what sweet persuas he might be taught by love and her togeth i realli dont know what nor julia either fraught with thi fine intent and well fenc in mail of proofher puriti of soul she for the futur of her strength convinc and that her honour wa a rock or mole exceed sage from that hour dispens with ani kind of troublesom control but whether julia to the task wa equal is that which must be mentiond in the sequel her plan she deemd both innoc and feasibl and sure with a stripl of sixteen not scandal fang could fix on much that s seizabl or if they did so satisfi to mean noth but what wa good her breast wa peaceabl a quiet conscienc make one so seren christian have burnt each other quit persuad that all the apostl would have done as they did and if in the mean time her husband die but heaven forbid that such a thought should cross her brain though in a dream and then she sighd never could she surviv that common loss but just suppos that moment should betid i onli say suppos itint no thi should be entr nou for julia thought in french but then the rhyme would go for naught i onli say suppos thi supposit juan be then grown up to man estat would fulli suit a widow of condit even seven year henc it would not be too late and in the interim to pursu thi vision the mischief after all could not be great for he would learn the rudiment of love i mean the seraph way of those abov so much for julia now we ll turn to juan poor littl fellow he had no idea of hi own case and never hit the true one in feel quick as ovid miss medea he puzzl over what he found a new one but not as yet imagin it could be thing quit in cours and not at all alarm which with a littl patienc might grow charm silent and pensiv idl restless slow hi home desert for the lone wood torment with a wound he could not know hi like all deep grief plung in solitud i m fond myself of solitud or so but then i beg it may be understood by solitud i mean a sultan not a hermit with a haram for a grot oh love in such a wilder as thi where transport and secur entwin here is the empir of thi perfect bliss and here thou art a god inde divin the bard i quot from doe not sing amiss with the except of the second line for that same twine transport and secur are twist to a phrase of some obscur the poet meant no doubt and thu appeal to the good sens and sens of mankind the veri thing which everi bodi feel as all have found on trial or may find that no one like to be disturbd at meal or lovei wont say more about entwin or transport as we knew all that befor but beg secur will bolt the door young juan wanderd by the glassi brook think unutter thing he threw himself at length within the leafi nook where the wild branch of the cork forest grew there poet find materi for their book and everi now and then we read them through so that their plan and prosodi are elig unless like wordsworth they prove unintellig he juan and not wordsworth so pursu hi selfcommunion with hi own high soul until hi mighti heart in it great mood had mitig part though not the whole of it diseas he did the best he could with thing not veri subject to control and turnd without perceiv hi condit like coleridg into a metaphysician he thought about himself and the whole earth of man the wonder and of the star and how the deuc they ever could have birth and then he thought of earthquak and of war how mani mile the moon might have in girth of airballoon and of the mani bar to perfect knowledg of the boundless sky and then he thought of donna julia eye in thought like these true wisdom may discern long sublim and aspir high which some are born with but the most part learn to plagu themselv withal they know not whi t wa strang that one so young should thu concern hi brain about the action of the sky if you think t wa philosophi that thi did i cant help think puberti assist he pore upon the leav and on the flower and heard a voic in all the wind and then he thought of woodnymph and immort bower and how the goddess came down

sunset they began to take in sail for the sky showd it would come on to blow and carri away perhap a mast or so at one oclock the wind with sudden shift threw the ship right into the trough of the sea which struck her aft and made an awkward rift start the sternpost also shatterd the whole of her sternfram and ere she could lift herself from out her present jeopardi the rudder tore away t wa time to sound the pump and there were four feet water found one gang of peopl instantli wa put upon the pump and the remaind set to get up part of the cargo and what not but they could not come at the leak

from thenc without their will they carri them away for they were forc with steer to dispens and never had as yet a quiet day on which they might repos or even commenc a jurymast or rudder or could say the ship would swim an hour which by good luck still swamthough not exactli like a duck the wind in fact perhap wa rather less but the ship labourd so they scarc could hope to weather out much longer the distress wa also great with which they had to cope for want of water and their solid mess wa scant enough in vain the telescop wa usednor sail nor shore appeard in sight nought but the heavi sea

foam from hi pale lip and ever on him gaze and when the wishdfor shower at length wa come and the boy eye which the dull film half glaze brightend and for a moment seemd to roam he squeez from out a rag some drop of rain into hi die child mouthbut in vain the boy expiredth father held the clay and lookd upon it long and when at last death left no doubt and the dead burthen lay stiff on hi heart and puls and hope were past he watchd it wist until away t wa born by the rude wave wherein t wa cast then he himself sunk down all dumb and shiver and gave no sign of life save hi limb quiver now overhead a rainbow burst through the scatter cloud shone span the dark sea rest it bright base on the quiver blue and all within it arch appeard to be clearer than that without and it wide hue waxd broad and wave like a banner free then chang like to a bow that s bent and then forsook the dim eye of these shipwreckd men it chang of cours a heavenli chameleon the airi child of vapour and the sun brought forth in purpl cradl in vermilion baptiz in molten gold and swath in dun glitter like crescent oer a turk pavilion and blend everi colour into one just like a black eye in a recent scuffl for sometim we must box without the muffl our shipwreckd seamen thought it a good omen it is as well to think so now and then t wa an old custom of the greek and roman and may becom of great advantag when folk are discourag and most sure no men had greater need to nerv themselv again than these and so thi rainbow lookd like hope quit a celesti kaleidoscop about thi time a beauti white bird webfoot not unlik a dove in size and plumag probabl it might have errd upon it cours passd oft befor their eye and tri to perch although it saw and heard the men within the boat and in thi guis it came and went and flutterd round them till night fell thi seemd a better omen still but in thi case i also must remark t wa well thi bird of promis did not perch becaus the tackl of our shatterd bark wa not so safe for roost as a church and had it been the dove from noah ark return there from her success search which in their way that moment chanc to fall they would have eat her olivebranch and all with twilight it again came on to blow but not with violenc the star shone out the boat made way yet now they were so low they knew not where nor what they were about some fanci they saw land and some said no the frequent fogbank gave them caus to doubt some swore that they heard breaker other gun and all mistook about the latter onc as morn broke the light wind die away when he who had the watch sung out and swore if t wa not land that rose with the sun ray he wishd that land he never might see more and the rest rubbd their eye and saw a bay or thought they saw and shape their cours for shore for shore it wa and gradual grew distinct and high and palpabl to view and then of these some part burst into tear and other look with a stupid stare could not yet separ their hope from fear and seemd as if they had no further care while a few prayd the first time for some year and at the bottom of the boat three were asleep they shook them by the hand and head and tri to awaken them but found them dead the day befor fast sleep on the water they found a turtl of the hawksbil kind and by good fortun glide softli caught her which yield a day life and to their mind prove even still a more nutriti matter becaus it left encourag behind they thought that in such peril more than chanc had sent them thi for their deliver the land appeard a high and rocki coast and higher grew the mountain as they drew set by a current toward it they were lost in variou conjectur for none knew to what part of the earth they had been tost so changeabl had been the wind that blew some thought it wa mount aetna some the highland of candia cypru rhode or other island meantim the current with a rise gale still set them onward to the welcom shore like charon bark of spectr dull and pale their live freight wa now reduc to four and three dead whom their strength could not avail to heav into the deep with those befor though the two shark still followd them and dashd the spray into their face as they splashd famin despair cold thirst and heat had done their work on them by turn and thinnd them to such thing a mother had not known her son amidst the skeleton of that gaunt crew by night chilld by day scorchd thu one by one they perishd until witherd to these few but chiefli by a speci of selfslaught in wash down pedrillo with salt water as they drew nigh the land which now wa seen unequ in it aspect here and there they felt the fresh of it grow green that wave in foresttop and smoothd the air and fell upon their glaze eye like a screen from glisten wave and sky so hot and bare love seemd ani object that should sweep away the vast salt dread etern deep the shore lookd wild without a trace of man and girt by formid wave but they were mad for land and thu their cours they ran though right ahead the roar breaker lay a reef between them also now began to show it boil surf and bound spray but find no place for their land better they ran the boat for shoreand overset her but in hi nativ stream the

wa dark the beach which lay befor him high and dri the greatest danger here wa from a shark that carri off hi neighbour by the thigh as for the other two they could not swim so nobodi arriv on shore but him nor yet had he arriv but for the oar which providenti for him wa washd just as hi feebl arm could strike no more and the hard wave oerwhelmd him as t wa dashd within hi grasp he clung to it and sore the water beat while he thereto wa lashd at last with swim wade scrambl he rolld on the beach halfsenseless from the sea there breathless with hi dig nail he clung fast to the sand lest the return wave from whose reluct roar hi life he wrung should suck him back to her insati grave and there he lay full length where he wa flung befor the entranc of a cliffworn cave with just enough of life to feel it pain and deem that it wa save perhap in vain with slow and stagger effort he aros but sunk again upon hi bleed knee and quiver hand and then he lookd for those who long had been hi mate upon the sea but none of them appeard to share hi woe save one a corps from out the famishd three who die two day befor and now had found an unknown barren beach for burial ground and as he gaze hi dizzi brain spun fast and down he sunk and as he sunk the sand swam round and round and all hi sens passd he fell upon hi side and hi stretchd hand droopd drip on the oar their jurymast and like a

repos juan slept like a top or like the dead who sleep at last perhap god onli know just for the present and in hi lulld head not even a vision of hi former woe throbbd in accurs dream which sometim spread unwelcom vision of our former year till the eye cheat open thick with tear young juan slept all dreamlessbut the maid who smoothd hi pillow as she left the den lookd back upon him and a moment stayd and turnd believ that he calld again he slumberd yet she thought at least she said the heart will slip even as the tongu and pen he had pronounc her namebut she forgot that at thi moment juan knew it not and pensiv to her father hous she went enjoin silenc strict to zoe who better than her knew what in fact she meant she be wiser by a year or two a year or two s an age when rightli spent and zoe spent her as most women do in gain all that use sort of knowledg which is acquir in natur good old colleg the morn broke and found juan slumber still fast in hi cave and noth clashd upon hi rest the rush of the neighbour rill and the young beam of the exclud sun troubl him not and he might sleep hi fill and need he had of slumber yet for none had sufferd morehi hardship were compar to those relat in my granddad narr not so haide she sadli tossd and tumbl and start from her sleep and turn oer dreamd of a thousand wreck oer which she stumbl and handsom corps strewd upon the shore and woke her maid so earli that she grumbl and calld her father old slave up who swore in sever oathsarmenian turk and greek they knew not what to think of such a freak but up she got and up she made them get with some pretenc about the sun that make sweet sky just when he rise or is set and t is no doubt a sight to see when break bright phoebu while the mountain still are wet with mist and everi bird with him awak and night is flung off like a mourn suit worn for a husbandor some other brute i say the sun is a most gloriou sight i ve seen him rise full oft inde of late i have sat up on purpos all the night which hasten as physician say one fate and so all ye who would be in the right in health and purs begin your day to date from daybreak and when coffind at fourscor engrav upon the plate you rose at four and haide met the morn face to face her own wa freshest though a feverish flush had dy it with the headlong blood whose race from heart to cheek is curbd into a blush like to a torrent which a mountain base that overpow some alpin river rush check to a lake whose wave in circl spread or the red seabut the sea is not red and down the cliff the island virgin came and near the cave her quick light footstep drew while the sun smile on her with hi first flame and young aurora kissd her lip with dew take her for a sister just the same mistak you would have made on see the two although the mortal quit as fresh and fair had all the advantag too of not be air and when into the cavern haide steppd all timidli yet rapidli she saw that like an infant juan sweetli slept and then she stoppd and stood as if in awe for sleep is aw and on tipto crept and wrapt him closer lest the air too raw should reach hi blood then oer him still as death bent with hushd lip that drank hi scarcedrawn breath and thu like to an angel oer the die who die in righteous she leand and there all tranquilli the shipwreckd boy wa lie as oer him the calm and stirless air but zoe the meantim some egg wa fri sinc after all no doubt the youth pair must breakfastand betim lest they should ask it she drew out her provis from the basket she knew that the best feel must have victual and that a shipwreckd youth would hungri be besid be less in love she yawnd a littl and felt her vein chilld by the neighbour sea and so she cookd their breakfast to a tittl i cant say that she gave them ani tea but there were egg fruit coffe bread fish honey with scio wineand all for love not money and zoe when the egg were readi and the coffe made would fain have wakend juan but haide stoppd her with her quick small hand and without word a sign her finger drew on her lip which zoe need must understand and the first breakfast spoilt prepar a new one becaus her mistress would not let her break that sleep which seemd as it would neer awak for still he lay and on hi thin worn cheek a purpl hectic playd like die day on the snowtop of distant hill the streak of suffer yet upon hi forehead lay where the blue vein lookd shadowi shrunk and weak and hi black curl were dewi with the spray which weighd upon them yet all damp and salt mixd with the stoni vapour of the vault and she bent oer him and he lay beneath hushd as the babe upon it mother breast droopd as the willow when no wind can breath lulld like the depth of ocean when at rest fair as the crown rose of the whole wreath soft as the callow cygnet in it nest in short he wa a veri pretti fellow although hi woe had turnd him rather yellow he woke and gaze and would have slept again but the fair face which met hi eye forbad those eye to close though weari and pain had further sleep a further pleasur made for woman face wa never formd in vain for juan so that even when he prayd he turnd from grisli saint and martyr hairi to the sweet portrait of the virgin mari and thu upon hi elbow he aros and lookd upon the ladi in whose cheek the pale contend with the purpl rose as with an effort she began to speak her eye were eloqu her word would pose although she told him in good modern greek with an ionian accent low and sweet that he wa faint and must not talk but eat now juan could not understand a word be no grecian but he had an ear and her voic wa the warbl of a bird so soft so sweet so delic clear that finer simpler music neer wa heard the sort of sound we echo with a tear without know whyan overpow tone whenc melodi descend as from a throne and juan gaze as one who is awok by a distant organ doubt if he be not yet a dreamer till the spell is broke by the watchman or some such realiti or by one earli valet curs knock at least it is a heavi sound to me who like a morn slumberfor the night show star and women in a better light and juan too wa helpd out from hi dream or sleep or whatsoer it wa by feel a most prodigi appetit the steam of zoe cookeri no doubt wa steal upon hi sens and the kindl beam of the new fire which zoe kept up kneel to stir her viand made him quit awak and long for food but chiefli a beefsteak but beef is rare within these oxless isl goat flesh there is no doubt and kid and mutton and when a holiday upon them smile a joint upon their barbar spit they put on but thi occur but seldom between while for some of these are rock with scarc a hut on other are fair and fertil among which thi though not larg wa one of the most rich i say that beef is rare and cant help think that

know too they veri fond of war a pleasurelik all pleasuresrath dear so were the cretansfrom which i infer that beef and battl both were owe to her but to resum the languid juan rais hi head upon hi elbow and he saw a sight on which he had not late gaze as all hi latter meal had been quit raw three or four thing for which the lord he prais and feel still the famishd vultur gnaw he fell upon whateer wa offerd like a priest a shark an alderman or pike he ate and he wa well suppli and she who watchd him like a mother would have fed him past all bound becaus she smile to see such appetit in one she had deemd dead but zoe be older than haide knew by tradit for she neer had read that famishd peopl must be slowli nurst and fed by spoon els they alway burst and so she took the liberti to state rather by deed than word becaus the case wa urgent that the gentleman whose fate had made her mistress quit her bed to trace the seashor at thi hour must leav hi plate unless he wishd to die upon the place she snatchd it and refus anoth morsel say he had gorg enough to make a hors ill next theyh be nake save a tatterd pair of scarc decent trowsersw to work and in the fire hi recent rag they scatterd and dressd him for the present like a turk or greekthat is although it not much matterd omit turban slipper pistol dirk they furnishd him entir except some stitch with a clean shirt and veri spaciou breech and then fair haide tri her tongu at speak but not a word could juan comprehend although he listend so that the young greek in her earnest would neer have made an end and as he interrupt not went eke her speech out to her proteg and friend till paus at the last her breath to take she saw he did not understand romaic and then she had recours to nod and sign and smile and sparkl of the speak eye and read the onli book she could the line of hi fair face and found by sympathi the answer eloqu where soul shine and dart in one quick glanc a long repli and thu in everi look

poor dudu who onli sighd and said that she wa sorri she had cri i ve heard of stori of a cock and bull but vision of an appl and a bee to take us from our natur rest and pull the whole oda from their

as the sister weird but slowli and as he passd juan by glanc without paus on him a bright eye juan wa petrifi he had heard a hint of such a spirit in these hall of old but thought like most men there wa noth in t beyond the rumour which such spot unfold coind from surviv superstit mint which pass ghost in currenc like gold but rare seen like gold compar with paper and did he see thi or wa it a

felt hi hair twine like a knot of snake around hi face he taxd hi tongu for word which were not grant to ask the reverend person what he want the third time after a still longer paus the shadow passd awaybut where the hall wa long and thu far there wa no great caus to think hi vanish unnatur door there were mani through which by the law of physic bodi whether short or tall might come or go but juan could not state through which the spectr seemd to evapor he stoodhow long he knew not but it seemd an ageexpect powerless with hi eye straind on the spot where first the figur gleamd then by

took undrest and rather slowli went to bed there couchd all snugli on hi pillow nook with what he had seen hi phantasi he fed and though it wa no opiat slumber crept upon him by degre and so he slept

too much on one side and when he walkd down into the saloon he sate him pensiv oer a dish of tea which he perhap had not discoverd soon had it not happend scald hot to be which made him have recours unto hi spoon so much distrait he wa that all could see that someth wa the matteradelin the firstbut what she could not well divin she lookd and saw him pale and turnd as pale herself then hastili

the famili physician had great skill and be present now began to express hi readi to feel hi puls and tell the caus but juan said he wa quit well quit well yesnothes answer were mysteri and yet hi look appeard to sanction both howev they might savour of deliri someth like ill of a sudden growth weighd on hi spirit though by no mean seriou but for the rest as he himself seemd loth to state the case it might be taen for grant it wa not the physician that he want lord henri who had now discussd hi chocol also the muffin whereof he complaind said juan had not got hi usual look elat at which he marvelld sinc it had not raind then askd her grace what news were of the duke of late her grace repli hi grace wa rather paind with some slight light hereditari twing of gout which rust aristocrat

lyric sound and sang with much simplicitya merit not the less preciou that we seldom hear it bewar bewar of the black friar who sitteth by norman stone for he mutter hi prayer in the midnight air and hi mass of the day that are gone when the lord of the hill amundevil made norman church hi prey and expelld the friar one friar still would not be driven away though he came in hi might with king henri right to turn church land to lay with sword in hand and torch to light their wall if they said nay a monk remaind unchas unchaind and he did not seem formd of clay for he s seen in the porch and he s seen in the church though he is not seen by day and whether for good or whether for ill it is not mine to say but still with the hous of amundevil he abideth night and day by the marriageb of their lord t is said he flit on the bridal eve and t is held as faith to their bed of death he comesbut not to griev when an heir is born he s heard to mourn and when aught is to befal that ancient line in the we moonshin he walk from hall to hall hi form you may trace but not hi face t is shadowd by hi cowl but hi eye may be seen from the fold between and they seem of a part soul but bewar bewar of the black friar he still retain hi sway for he is yet the church heir whoever may be the lay amundevil is lord by day but the monk is lord by night nor wine nor wassail could rais a vassal to question that friar right say nought to him as he walk the hall and he ll say nought to you he sweep along in hi duski pall as oer the grass the dew then grammerci for the black friar heaven sain him
