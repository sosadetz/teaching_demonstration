that there wa pleasur there if i these thought may not prevent if such be of my creed the plan have i not reason to lament what man ha made of man the thorn i there is a thorn it look so old in truth youd find it hard to say how it could ever have been young it look so old and grey not higher than a twoyear child it stand erect thi age thorn no leav it ha no thorni point it is a mass of knot joint a wretch thing forlorn it stand erect and like a stone with lichen it is overgrown ii like rock or stone it is oergrown with lichen to the veri top and hung with heavi tuft of moss a melancholi crop up from the earth these moss creep and thi poor thorn they clasp it round so close youd say that they were bent with plain and manifest intent to drag it to the ground and all had join in one endeavour to buri thi poor thorn for ever iii high on a mountain highest ridg where oft the stormi winter gale cut like a scyth while through the cloud it sweep from vale to vale not five yard from the mountainpath thi thorn you on your left espi and to the left three yard beyond you see a littl muddi pond of water never dri ive measur it from side to side ti three feet long and two feet wide iv and close besid thi age thorn there is a fresh and love sight a beauteou heap a hill of moss just half a foot in height all love colour there you see all colour that were ever seen and mossi network too is there as if by hand of ladi fair the work had woven been and cup the darl of the eye so deep is their vermilion dye v ah me what love tint are there of olivegreen and scarlet bright in spike in branch and in star green red and pearli white thi heap of earth oergrown with moss which close besid the thorn you see so fresh in all it beauteou dye is like an infant grave in size as like as like can be but never never ani where an infant grave wa half so fair vi now would you see thi age thorn thi pond and beauteou hill of moss you must take care and chuse your time the mountain when to cross for oft there sit between the heap that like an infant grave in size and that same pond of which i spoke a woman in a scarlet cloak and to herself she cri oh miseri oh miseri oh woe is me oh miseri vii at all time of the day and night thi wretch woman thither goe and she is known to everi star and everi wind that blow and there besid the thorn she sit when the blue daylight in the sky and when the whirlwind on the hill or frosti air is keen and still and to herself she cri oh miseri oh miseri oh woe is me oh miseri viii now wherefor thu by day and night in rain in tempest and in snow thu to the dreari mountaintop doe thi poor woman go and whi sit she besid the thorn when the blue daylight in the sky or when the whirlwind on the hill or frosti air is keen and still and wherefor doe she cri oh wherefor wherefor tell me whi doe she repeat that dole cri ix i can not tell i wish i could for the true reason no one know but if youd gladli view the spot the spot to which she goe the heap that like an infant grave the pondand thorn so old and grey pass by her doorti seldom shut and if you see her in her hut then to the spot away i never heard of such as dare approach the spot when she is there x but wherefor to the mountaintop can thi unhappi woman go whatev star is in the sky whatev wind may blow nay rack your brainti all in vain ill tell you everi thing i know but to the thorn and to the pond which is a littl step beyond i wish that you would go perhap when you are at the place you someth of her tale may trace xi ill give you the best help i can befor you up the mountain go up to the dreari mountaintop ill tell you all i know ti now some two and twenti year sinc she her name is martha ray gave with a maiden true good will her compani to stephen hill and she wa blith and gay and she wa happi happi still wheneer she thought of stephen hill xii and they had fixd the weddingday the morn that must wed them both but stephen to anoth maid had sworn anoth oath and with thi other maid to church unthink stephen went poor martha on that woful day a cruel cruel fire they say into her bone wa sent it dri her bodi like a cinder and almost turnd her brain to tinder xiii they say full six month after thi while yet the summerleav were green she to the mountaintop would go and there wa often seen ti said a child wa in her womb as now to ani eye wa plain she wa with child and she wa mad yet often she wa sober sad from her exceed pain oh me ten thousand time id rather that he had die that cruel father xiv sad case for such a brain to hold communion with a stir child sad case as you may think for one who had a brain so wild last christma when we talk of thi old farmer simpson did maintain that in her womb the infant wrought about it mother heart and brought her sens back again and when at last her time drew near her look were calm her sens clear xv no more i know i wish i did and i would tell it all to you for what becam of thi poor child there none that ever knew and if a child wa born or no there no one that could ever tell and if twa born aliv or dead there no one know as i have said but some rememb well that martha ray about thi time would up the mountain often climb xvi and all that winter when at night the wind blew from the mountainpeak twa worth your while though in the dark the churchyard path to seek for mani a time and oft were heard cri come from the mountainhead some plainli live voic were and other ive heard mani swear were voic of the dead i can not think whateer they say they had to do with martha ray xvii but that she goe to thi old thorn the thorn which ive describ to you and there sit in a scarlet cloak i will be sworn is true for one day with my telescop to view the ocean wide and bright when to thi countri first i came ere i had heard of martha name i climb the mountain height a storm came on and i could see no object higher than my knee xviii twa mist and rain and storm and rain no screen no fenc could i discov and then the wind in faith it wa a wind full ten time over i look around i thought i saw a jut crag and oft i ran headforemost through the drive rain the shelter of the crag to gain and as i am a man instead of jut crag i found a woman seat on the ground xix i did not speaki saw her face her face it wa enough for me i turn about and heard her cri o miseri o miseri and there she sit until the moon through half the clear blue sky will go and when the littl breez make the water of the pond to shake as all the countri know she shudder and you hear her cri oh miseri oh miseri xx but what the thorn and what the pond and what the hill of moss to her and what the creep breez that come the littl pond to stir i can not tell but some will say she hang her babi on the tree some say she drown it in the pond which is a littl step beyond but all and each agre the littl babe wa buri there beneath that hill of moss so fair xxi ive heard the scarlet moss is red with drop of that poor infant blood but kill a newborn infant thu i do not think she could some say if to the pond you go and fix on it a steadi view the shadow of a babe you trace a babi and a babi face and that it look at you wheneer you look on it ti plain the babi look at you again xxii and some had sworn an oath that she should be to public justic brought and for the littl infant bone with spade they would have sought but then the beauteou hill of moss befor their eye began to stir and for full fifti yard around the grass it shook upon the ground but all do still aver the littl babe is buri there beneath that hill of moss so fair xxiii i can not tell how thi may be but plain it is the thorn is bound with heavi tuft of moss that strive to drag it to the ground and thi i know full mani a time when she wa on the mountain high by day and in the silent night when all the star shone clear and bright that i have heard her cri oh miseri oh miseri o woe is me oh miseri the last of the flock in distant countri i have been and yet i have not often seen a healthi man a man full grown weep in the public road alon but such a one on english ground and in the broad highway i met along the broad highway he came hi cheek with

and a spirit that impel all think thing all object of all thought and roll through all thing therefor am i still a lover of the meadow and the wood and mountain and of all that we behold from thi green earth of all the mighti world of eye and ear both what they halfcreat and what perceiv well pleas to recogn in natur and the languag of the sens the anchor of my purest thought the nurs the guid the guardian of my heart and soul of all my moral be nor perchanc if i were not thu taught should i the more suffer my genial spirit to decay for thou art with me here upon the bank of thi fair river thou my dearest friend my dear dear friend and in thi voic i catch the languag of my former heart and read my former pleasur in the shoot light of thi wild eye oh yet a littl while may i behold in thee what i wa onc my dear dear sister and thi prayer i make know that natur never did betray the heart that love her ti her privileg through all the year of thi our life to lead from joy to joy for she can so inform the mind that is within us so impress with quiet and beauti and so feed with lofti thought that neither evil tongu rash judgment nor the sneer of selfish men nor greet where no kind is nor all the dreari intercours of daili life shall eer prevail against us or disturb our chear faith that all which we behold is full of bless therefor let the moon shine on thee in thi solitari walk and let the misti mountain wind be free to blow against thee and in after year when these wild ecstasi shall be matur into a sober pleasur when thi mind shall be a mansion for all love form thi memori be as a dwellingplac for all sweet sound and harmoni oh then if solitud or fear or pain or grief should be thi portion with what heal thought of tender joy wilt thou rememb me and these my exhort nor perchanc if i should be where i no more can hear thi voic nor catch from thi wild eye these gleam of past exist wilt thou then forget that on the bank of thi delight stream we stood togeth and that i so long a worshipp of natur hither came unweari in that servic rather say with warmer love oh with far deeper zeal of holier love nor wilt thou then forget that after mani wander mani year of absenc these steep wood and lofti cliff and thi green pastor landscap were to me more dear both for themselv and for thi sake the river is not affect by the tide a few mile abov tintern thi line ha a close resembl to an admir line of young the exact express of which i can not recollect end
