poem by john keat what more felic can fall to creatur than to enjoy delight with liberti fate of the butterflyspens dedic to leigh hunt esq glori and loveli have pass away for if we wander out in earli morn no wreath incens do we see upborn into the east to meet the smile day no crowd of nymph soft voicd and young and gay in woven basket bring ear of corn rose and pink and violet to adorn the shrine of flora in her earli may but there are left delight as high as these and i shall ever bless my destini that in a time when under pleasant tree pan is no longer sought i feel a free a leafi luxuri see i could pleas with these poor offer a man like thee the short piec in the middl of the book as well as some of the sonnet were written at an earlier period than the rest of the poem poem place of nestl green for poet made stori of rimini i stood tipto upon a littl hill the air wa cool and so veri still that the sweet bud which with a modest pride pull droopingli in slant curv asid their scantli leav and fine taper stem had not yet lost those starri diadem caught from the earli sob of the morn the cloud were pure and white as flock new shorn and fresh from the clear brook sweetli they slept on the blue field of heaven and then there crept a littl noiseless nois among the leav born of the veri sigh that silenc heav for not the faintest motion could be seen of all the shade that slant oer the green there wa wide wandr for the greediest eye to peer about upon varieti far round the horizon crystal air to skim and trace the dwindl edg of it brim to pictur out the quaint and curiou bend of a fresh woodland alley never end or by the boweri cleft and leafi shelv guess were the jaunti stream refresh themselv i gaze awhil and felt as light and free as though the fan wing of mercuri had play upon my heel i wa lightheart and mani pleasur to my vision start so i straightway began to pluck a posey of luxuri bright milki soft and rosi a bush of may flower with the bee about them ah sure no tast nook would be without them and let a lush laburnum oversweep them and let long grass grow round the root to keep them moist cool and green and shade the violet that they may bind the moss in leafi net a filbert hedg with wild briar overtwin and clump of woodbin take the soft wind upon their summer throne there too should be the frequent chequer of a youngl tree that with a score of light green brethen shoot from the quaint mossi of age root round which is heard a springhead of clear water babbl so wildli of it love daughter the spread blue bell it may hapli mourn that such fair cluster should be rude torn from their fresh bed and scatter thoughtlessli by infant hand left on the path to die open afresh your round of starri fold ye ardent marigold dri up the moistur from your golden lid for great apollo bid that in these day your prais should be sung on mani harp which he ha late strung and when again your dewi he kiss tell him i have you in my world of bliss so hapli when i rove in some far vale hi mighti voic may come upon the gale here are sweet pea on tipto for a flight with wing of gentl flush oer delic white and taper fulgent catch at all thing to bind them all about with tini ring linger awhil upon some bend plank that lean against a streamlet rushi bank and watch intent natur gentl do they will be found softer than ringdov coo how silent come the water round that bend not the minutest whisper doe it send to the oerhang sallow blade of grass slowli across the chequerd shadow pass whi you might read two sonnet ere they reach to where the hurri fresh aye preach a natur sermon oer their pebbl bed where swarm of minnow show their littl head stay their wavi bodi gainst the stream to tast the luxuri of sunni beam temperd with cool how they ever wrestl with their own sweet delight and ever nestl their silver belli on the pebbl sand if you but scantili hold out the hand that veri instant not one will remain but turn your eye and they are there again the rippl seem right glad to reach those cress and cool themselv among the emrald tress the while they cool themselv they fresh give and moistur that the boweri green may live so keep up an interchang of favour like good men in the truth of their behaviour sometim goldfinch one by one will drop from low hung branch littl space they stop but sip and twitter and their feather sleek then off at onc as in a wanton freak or perhap to show their black and golden wing paus upon their yellow flutter were i in such a place i sure should pray that nought less sweet might call my thought away than the soft rustl of a maiden gown fan away the dandelion down than the light music of her nimbl toe pat against the sorrel as she goe how she would start and blush thu to be caught play in all her innoc of thought o let me lead her gentli oer the brook watch her halfsmil lip and downward look o let me for one moment touch her wrist let me one moment to her breath list and as she leav me may she often turn her fair eye look through her lock auburn what next a tuft of even primros oer which the mind may hover till it doze oer which it well might take a pleasant sleep but that ti ever startl by the leap of bud into ripe flower or by the flit of divers moth that aye their rest are quit or by the moon lift her silver rim abov a cloud and with a gradual swim come into the blue with all her light o maker of sweet poet dear delight of thi fair world and all it gentl liver spangler of cloud halo of crystal river mingler with leav and dew and tumbl stream closer of love eye to love dream lover of loneli and wander of upcast eye and tender ponder thee must i prais abov all other glori that smile us on to tell delight stori for what ha made the sage or poet write but the fair paradis of natur light in the calm grandeur of a sober line we see the wave of the mountain pine and when a tale is beauti staid we feel the safeti of a hawthorn glade when it is move on luxuri wing the soul is lost in pleasant smother fair dewi rose brush against our face and flower laurel spring from diamond vase oer head we see the jasmin and sweet briar and bloomi grape laugh from green attir while at our feet the voic of crystal bubbl charm us at onc away from all our troubl so that we feel uplift from the world walk upon the white cloud wreathd and curld so felt he who first told how

the bough asid that we might look into a forest wide to catch a glimps of fawn and dryad come with softest rustl through the tree and garland woven of flower wild and sweet upheld on ivori wrist or sport feet tell us how fair trembl syrinx fled arcadian pan with such a fear dread poor nymphpoor panhow he did weep to find nought but a love sigh of the wind along the reedi stream a half heard strain full of sweet desolationbalmi pain what first inspir a bard of old to sing narcissu pine oer the untaint spring in some delici rambl he had found a littl space with bough all woven round and in the midst of all a clearer pool than eer reflect in it pleasant cool the blue sky here and there seren peep through tendril wreath fantast creep and on the bank a lone flower he spi a meek and forlorn flower with naught of pride droop it beauti oer the wateri clear to woo it own sad imag into near deaf to light zephyru it would not move but still would seem to droop to pine to love so while the poet stood in thi sweet spot some fainter gleam oer hi fanci shot nor wa it long ere he had told the tale of young narcissu and sad echo bale where had he been from whose warm head outflew that sweetest of all song that ever new that aye refresh pure delici come ever to bless the wander by moonlight to him bring shape from the invis world unearthli sing from out the middl air from floweri nest and from the pillowi silki that rest full in the specul of the star ah sure he had burst our mortal bar into some wondrou region he had gone to search for thee divin endymion he wa a poet sure a lover too who stood on latmu top what time there blew soft breez from the myrtl vale below and brought in faint solemn sweet and slow a hymn from dian templ while upswel the incens went to her own starri dwell but though her face wa clear as infant eye though she stood smile oer the sacrific the poet wept at her so piteou fate wept that such beauti should be desol so in fine wrath some golden

upon thi bash eye ere he hi unseen pomp would solemn the even weather wa so bright and clear that men of health were of unusu cheer step like homer at the trumpet call or young apollo on the pedest and love women were as fair and warm as venu look sideway in alarm the breez were ether and pure and crept through half close lattic to cure the languid sick it coold their feverd sleep and sooth them into slumber full and deep soon they awok clear eye nor burnt with thirst nor with hot finger nor with templ burst and spring up they met the wondr sight of their dear friend nigh foolish with delight who feel their arm and breast and kiss and stare and on their placid forehead part the hair young men and maiden at each other gazd with hand held back and motionless amazd to see the bright in each other eye and so they stood filld with a sweet surpris until their tongu were loosd in poesi therefor no lover did of anguish die but the soft number in that moment spoken made silken tie that never
