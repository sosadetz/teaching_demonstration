thalaba the destroyer by robert southey greek poiêmatôn akratês ê eleutheria kai nomos eis to doxan tô poiêtê lucian quomodo hist scribenda the first volume london printed for t n longman and o rees paternosterrow by biggs and cottle bristol contents preface vii the first book the second book the third book the fourth book the fifth book preface in the continuation of the arabian tales the domdaniel is mentioned a seminary for evil magicians under the roots of the sea from this seed the present romance has grown let me not be supposed to prefer the metre in which it is written abstractedly considered to the regular blank verse the noblest measure in my judgement of which our admirable language is capable for the following poem i have preferred it because it suits the varied subject it is the arabesque ornament of an arabian tale the dramatic sketches of dr sayer a volume which no lover of poetry will recollect without pleasure induced me when a young versifier to practise in this metre i felt that while it gave the poet a wider range of expression it satisfied the ear of the reader it were easy to make a parade of learning by enumerating the various feet which it admits it is only needful to observe that no two lines are employed in sequence which can be read into one two sixsyllable lines it will perhaps be answered compose an alexandrine the truth is that the alexandrine when harmonious is composed of two sixsyllable lines one advantage this metre assuredly possesses the dullest reader can not distort it into discord he may read it with a prose mouth but its flow and fall will still be perceptible verse is not enough favoured by the english reader perhaps this is owing to the obtrusiveness the regular jewsharp twingtwang of what has been foolishly called heroic measure i do not wish the improvisatorè tune but something that denotes the sense of harmony something like the accent of feeling like the tone which every poet necessarily gives to poetry the first book thalaba the destroyer the first book how beautiful is night a dewy freshness fills the silent air no mist obscures no little cloud breaks the whole serene of heaven in fullorbed glory the majestic moon rolls thro the dark blue depths beneath her steady ray the desert circle spreads like the round ocean girdled with the sky how beautiful is night who at this untimely hour wanders oer the desert sands no station is in view no palmgrove islanded amid the waste the mother and her child the widow and the orphan at this hour wander oer the desert sands alas the setting sun saw zeinab in her bliss hodeirahs wife beloved alas the wife beloved the fruitful mother late whom when the daughters of arabia named they wished their lot like hers she wanders oer the desert sands a wretched widow now the fruitful mother of so fair a race with only one preserved she wanders oer the wilderness no tear relieved the burthen of her heart stunned with the heavy woe she felt like one halfwakened from a midnight dream of blood but sometimes when her boy would wet her hand with tears and looking up to her fixed countenance amid his bursting sobs say the dear name of mother then would she utter a feeble groan at length collecting zeinab turned her eyes to heaven exclaiming praised be the lord he gave he takes away the lord our god is good good is he cried the boy why are my brethren and my sisters slain why is my father killed did ever we neglect our prayers or ever lift a hand unclean to heaven did ever stranger from our tent unwelcomed turn away mother he is not good then zeinab beat her breast in agony o god forgive my child he knows not what he says thou knowst i did not teach him thoughts like these o prophet pardon him she had not wept till that assuaging prayer the fountains of her eyes were opened then and tears relieved her heart she raised her swimming eyes to heaven allah thy will be done beneath the dispensation of thy wrath i groan but murmur not the day of the trial will come when i shall understand how profitable it is to suffer now young thalaba in silence heard reproof his brow in manly frowns was knit with manly thoughts his heart was full tell me who slew my father cried the boy zeinab replied and said i knew not that there lived thy fathers foe the blessings of the poor for him went daily up to heaven in distant lands the traveller told his praise i did not think there lived hodeirahs enemy but i will hunt him thro the earth young thalaba exclaimed already i can bend my fathers bow soon will my arm have strength to drive the arrowfeathers to his heart zeinab replied o thalaba my child thou lookest on to distant days and we are in the desert far from men not till that moment her afflicted heart had leisure for the thought she cast her eyes around alas no tents were there beside the bending sands no palm tree rose to spot the wilderness the dark blue sky closed round and rested like a dome upon the circling waste she cast her eyes around famine and thirst were there then the mother bowed her head and wept upon her child sudden a cry of wonder from thalaba aroused her she raised her head and saw where high in air a stately palace rose amid a grove embowered stood the prodigious pile trees of such ancient majesty towered not on yemens happy hills nor crowned the stately brow of lebanon fabric so vast so lavishly enriched for idol or for tyrant never yet raised the slave race of men in rome nor in the elder babylon nor old persepolis nor where the family of greece hymned eleutherian jove here studding azure tablatures and rayed with feeble light starlike the ruby and the diamond shone here on the golden towers the yellow moonbeam lay here with white splendour floods the silver wall less wonderous pile and less magnificent sennamar built at hirah tho his art sealed with one stone the ample edifice and made its colours like the serpents skin play with a changeful beauty him its lord jealous lest aftereffort might surpass the now unequalled palace from its height dashed on the pavement down they entered and through aromatic paths wondering they went along at length upon a mossy bank beneath a tall mimosas shade that oer him bent its living canopy they saw a man reclined young he appeared for on his cheek there shone the morning glow of health and the brown beard curled close around his chin he slept but at the sound of coming feet awakening fixed his eyes in wonder on the wanderer and her child forgive us zeinab cried distress hath made us bold relieve the widow and the fatherless blessed are they who succour the distrest for them hath god appointed paradise he heard and he looked up to heaven and tears ran down his cheeks it is a human voice i thank thee o my god how many an age has past since the sweet sounds have visited mine ear i thank thee o my god it is a human voice to zeinab turning then he cried o mortal who art thou whose gifted eyes have pierced the shadow of concealment that hath wrapt these bowers so many an age from eye of mortal man for countless years have past and never foot of man the bowers of irem trod save only i a miserable wretch from heaven and earth shut out fearless and scarce surprized for grief in zeinabs soul all other feebler feelings overpowered she answered yesterday i was a wife beloved the fruitful mother of a numerous race i am a widow now of all my offspring this alone is left praise to the lord our god he gave he takes away then said the stranger not by heaven unseen nor with unguided feet thy steps have reached this secret place nor for light purpose is the veil that from the universe hath long shut out these ancient bowers withdrawn hear thou my words o mortal in thy heart treasure the wonders i shall tell and when amid the world thou shall emerge again repeat the warning tale why have the fathers suffered but to make the children wisely safe the paradise of irem this and that the palace pile which shedad built the king alas in the days of my youth the hum of the populous world was heard in yon wilderness waste oer all the winding sands the tents of ad were pitchd happy alahkaf then for many and brave were her sons her daughters were many and fair my name was aswad then alas alas how strange the sound so long unheard of noble race i came one of the wealthy of the earth my sire an hundred horses in my fathers stalls stood ready for his will numerous his robes of silk the number of his camels was not known these were my heritance o god thy gifts were these but better had it been for aswads soul to have asked alms on earth and begged the crumbs that from his table fell so he had known thy word boy who hast reached this solitude fear the lord in the days of thy youth my knee was never taught to bend before my god my voice was never taught to shape one holy prayer we worshipped idols wood and stone the work of our own foolish hands we worshipped in our foolishness vainly the prophets voice its frequent warning raised repent and be forgiven we mocked the messenger of god we mocked the lord longsuffering slow to wrath a mighty work the pride of shedad planned here in the wilderness to form a garden more surpassing fair than that before whose gate the lightning of the cherubs fiery sword waves wide to bar access since adam the transgressor thence was driven here too would shedad build a kingly pile sublime the palace of his pride for this exhausted mines supplied their golden store for this the central caverns gave their gems for this the woodmans axe opened the cedar forest to the sun the silkworm of the east spun her sepulchral egg the hunter african provoked the danger of the elephants wrath the ethiop keen of scent detects the ebony that deepinearthed and hating light a leafless tree and barren of all fruit with darkness feeds her boughs of raven grain such were the treasures lavished in yon pile ages have past away and never mortal eye gazed on their vanity the gardens copious springs blest that delightful spot and every flower was planted here that makes the gale of evening sweet he spake and bade the fullgrown forest rise his own creation should the king wait for slow natures work all trees that bend with luscious fruit or wave with feathery boughs or point their spiring heads to heaven or spreading wide their shadowy arms invite the traveller to repose at noon hither uprooted with their native soil the labour and the pain of multitudes mature in beauty bore them here frequent in the walks the marble statue stood of heroes and of chiefs the trees and flowers remain by natures care perpetuate and selfsown the marble statues long have lost all trace of heroes and of chiefs huge shapeless stones they lie oergrown with many a flower the work of pride went on often the prophets voice denounced impending woe we mocked at the words of the seer we mocked at the wrath of the lord a long continued drought first troubled us three years no cloud had formed three years no rain had fallen the wholesome herb was dry the corn matured not for the food of man the wells and fountains failed o hard of heart in whom the punishment awoke no sense of guilt headstrong to ruin obstinately blind to idols we applied for aid sakia we invoked for rain we called on razeka for food they did not hear our prayers they could not hear no cloud appeared in heaven no nightly dews came down then to the place of concourse messengers were sent to mecca where the nations came round the red hillock kneeling to implore god in his favoured place we sent to call on god ah fools unthinking that from all the earth the heart ascends to him we sent to call on god ah fools to think the lord would hear their prayers abroad who made no prayers at home meantime the work of pride went on and still before our idols wood and stone we bowed the impious knee turn men of ad and call upon the lord the prophet houd exclaimed turn men of ad and look to heaven and fly the wrath to come we mocked the prophets words now dost thou dream old man or art thou drunk with wine future woe and wrath to come still thy prudent voice forebodes when it comes will we believe till it comes will we go on in the way our fathers went now are thy words from god or dost thou dream old man or art thou drunk with wine so spake the stubborn race the unbelieving ones i too of stubborn unbelieving heart heard him and heeded not it chanced my father went the way of man he perished in his sins the funeral rites were duly paid we bound a camel to his grave and left it there to die so if the resurrection came together they might rise i past my fathers grave i heard the camel moan she was his favourite beast one that carried me in infancy the first that by myself i learnt to mount her limbs were lean with famine and her eyes looked ghastlily with want she knew me as i past she stared me in the face my heart was touched had it been human else i thought no eye was near and broke her bonds and drove her forth to liberty and life the prophet houd beheld he lifted up his voice blessed art thou young man blessed art thou o aswad for the deed in the day of visitation in the fearful hour of judgment god will remember thee the day of visitation was at hand the fearful hour of judgment hastened on lo shedads mighty pile complete the palace of his pride would ye behold its wonders enter in i have no heart to visit it time hath not harmed the eternal monument time is not here nor days nor months nor years an everlasting now of misery ye must have heard their fame or likely ye have seen the mighty pyramids for sure those mighty piles shall overlive the feeble generations of mankind what tho unmoved they bore the deluge weight survivors of the ruined world what tho their founder filled with miracles and wealth miraculous their ample vaults compared with yonder fabric and they shrink the baby wonders of a womans work her emerald columns oer the marble courts fling their green rays as when amid a shower the sun shines loveliest on the vernal corn here shedad bade the sapphire floor be laid as tho with feet divine to trample azure light like the blue pavement of the firmament here selfsuspended hangs in air as its pure substance loathed material touch the living carbuncle sun of the lofty dome darkness has no dominion oer its beams intense it glows an everflowing tide of glory like the dayflood in its source impious the trees of vegetable gold such as in edens groves yet innocent it grew impious he made his boast tho heaven had hidden so deep the baneful ore that they should branch and bud for him that art should force their blossoms and their fruit and recreate for him whateer was lost in paradise therefore at shedads voice here towered the palm a silver trunk the fine gold network growing out loose from its rugged boughs tall as the cedar of the mountain here rose the gold branches hung with emerald leaves blossomed with pearls and rich with ruby fruit o ad my country evil was the day that thy unhappy sons crouched at this nimrods throne and placed him on the pedestal of power and laid their liberties beneath his feet robbing their children of the heritance their fathers handed down what was to him the squandered wealth what was to him the burthen of the land the lavished misery he did but speak his will and like the blasting siroc of the east the ruin of the royal voice found its way everywhere i marvel not that he whose power no earthly law no human feeling curbed mocked at the living god and now the kings command went forth among the people bidding old and young husband and wife the master and the slave all the collected multitudes of ad here to repair and hold high festival that he might see his people they behold their kings magnificence and power the day of festival arrived hither they came the old man and the boy husband and wife the master and the slave hither they came from yonder high tower top the loftiest of the palace shedad looked down on his tribe their tents on yonder sands rose like the countless billows of the sea their tread and voices like the ocean roar one deep confusion of tumultuous sounds they saw their kings magnificence beheld his palace sparkling like the angel domes of paradise his garden like the bowers of early eden and they shouted out great is the king a god upon the earth intoxicate with joy and pride he heard their blasphemies and in his wantonness of heart he bade the prophet houd be brought and oer the marble courts and oer the gorgeous rooms glittering with gems and gold he led the man of god is not this a stately pile cried the monarch in his joy hath ever eye beheld hath ever thought conceived place more magnificent houd they saw that heaven imparted to thy lips the words of wisdom look at the riches round and value them aright if so thy wisdom can the prophet heard his vaunt and answered with an aweful smile costly thy palace king but only in the hour of death man learns to value things like these aright hast thou a fault to find in all thine eyes have seen again the king exclaimed yes said the man of god the walls are weak the building ill secured azrael can enter in the sarsar can pierce thro the icy wind of death i was beside the monarch when he spake gentle the prophet spake but in his eye there dwelt a sorrow that disturbed me while i gazed the countenance of shedad fell and anger sate upon his paler lips he to the high tower top the prophet led and pointed to the multitude and as again they shouted out great is the king a god upon the earth turned with a threatful smile to houd say they aright o prophet is the king great upon earth a god among mankind the prophet answered not his eye rolled round the infinite multitude and into tears he burst sudden an uproar rose a cry of joy below the messenger is come kail from mecca comes he brings the boon obtained forth as we went we saw where overhead there hung a deep black cloud on which the multitude with joyful eyes looked up and blest the coming rain the messenger addrest the king and told his tale of joy to mecca i repaired by the red hillock knelt and called on god for rain my prayer ascended and was heard three clouds appeared in heaven one white and like the flying cloud of noon one red as it had drunk the evening beams one black and heavy with its load of rain a voice went forth from heaven chuse kail of the three i thanked the gracious power and chose the black cloud heavy with its wealth right right a thousand tongues exclaimed and all was merriment and joy then stood the prophet up and cried aloud woe woe to irem woe to ad death is gone up into her palaces woe woe a day of guilt and punishment a day of desolation as he spake his large eye rolled in horror and so deep his tone it seemed some spirit from within breathed thro his moveless lips the unearthly voice all looks were turned to him o ad he cried dear native land by all rememberances of childhood by all joys of manhood dear o vale of many waters morn and night my age must groan for you and to the grave go down in sorrow thou wilt give thy fruits but who shall gather them thy grapes will ripen but who shall tread the winepress fly the wrath ye who would live and save your souls alive for strong is his right hand that bends the bow the arrows that he shoots are sharp and err not from their aim with that a faithful few prest thro the throng to join him then arose mockery and mirth go bald head and they mixed curses with laughter he set forth yet once looked backhis eye fell on me and he called aswad it startled me it terrified aswad again he called and i almost had followed him o moment fled too soon o moment irrecoverably lost the shouts of mockery made a coward of me he went and i remained in fear of man he went and darker grew the deepening cloud above at length it opened and o god o god there were no waters there there fell no kindly rain the sarsar from its womb went forth the icy wind of death they fell around me thousands fell around the king and all his people fell all all they perished all i only i was left there came a voice to me and said in the day of visitation in the fearful hour of judgement god hath remembered thee when from an agony of prayer i rose and from the scene of death attempted to go forth the way was open i beheld no barrier to my steps but round these bowers the arm of god had drawn a mighty chain a barrier that no human force might break twice i essayed to pass with that the voice was heard o aswad be content and bless the lord one righteous deed hath saved thy soul from utter death o aswad sinful man when by long penitence thou feelest thy soul prepared breathe up the wish to die and azrael comes obedient to the prayer a miserable man from earth and heaven shut out i heard the dreadful voice i looked around my prison place the bodies of the dead were there whereer i looked they lay they mouldered mouldered here their very bones have crumbled into dust so many years have past so many weary ages have gone by and still i linger here still groaning with the burthen of my sins have never dared to breathe the prayer to be released oh who can tell the unspeakable misery of solitude like this no sound hath ever reached my ear save of the passing wind the fountains everlasting flow the forest in the gale the pattering of the shower sounds dead and mournful all no bird hath ever closed her wing upon these solitary bowers no insect sweetly buzzed amid these groves from all things that have life save only me concealed this tree alone that oer my head hangs down its hospitable boughs and bends its whispering leaves as tho to welcome me seems to partake of life i love it as my friend my only friend i know not for what ages i have dragged this miserable life how often i have seen these antient trees renewed what countless generations of mankind have risen and fallen asleep and i remain the same my garment hath not waxed old nor the sole of my shoe hath worn i dare not breathe the prayer to die o merciful lord god but when it is thy will but when i have atoned for mine iniquities and sufferings have made pure my soul with sin defiled release me in thine own good time i will not cease to praise thee o my god silence ensued awhile then zeinab answered him blessed art thou o aswad for the lord who saved thy soul from hell will call thee to him in his own good time and would that when my heart breathed up the wish to die azrael might visit me then would i follow where my babes are gone and join hodeirah now she ceased and the rushing of wings was heard in the stillness of night and azrael the deathangel stood before them his countenance was dark solemn but not severe it awed but struck no terror to the heart zeinab thy wish is heard aswad thy hour is come they fell upon the ground and blest the voice and azrael from his sword let drop the drops of bitterness and death me too me too young thalaba exclaimed as wild with grief he kissed his mothers livid hand his mothers quivering lips o angel take me too son of hodeirah the deathangel cried it is not yet the hour son of hodeirah thou art chosen forth to do the will of heaven to avenge thy fathers death the murder of thy race to work the mightiest enterprise that mortal man hath wrought live and remember destiny hath marked thee from mankind he ceased and he was gone young thalaba looked round the palace and the groves were seen no more he stood amid the wilderness alone the second book thalaba the destroyer the second book not in the desert son of hodeirah wert thou abandoned the coexistent fire that in the dens of darkness burnt for thee burns yet and yet shall burn in the domdaniel caverns under the roots of the ocean met the masters of the spell before them in the vault blazing unfuelled from the floor of rock ten magic flames arose burn mystic fires abdaldar cried burn whilst hodeirahs dreaded race exist this is the appointed hour the hour that shall secure these dens of night dim they burn exclaimed lobaba dim they burn and now they waver okba lifts the arm of death they waver they go out curse on his hasty hand khawla exclaimed in wrath the womanfiend exclaimed curse on his hasty hand the fool hath failed eight only are gone out a teraph stood against the cavern side a newborn infants head that khawla at his hour of birth had seized and from the shoulders wrung it stood upon a plate of gold an unclean spirits name inscribed beneath the cheeks were deathy dark dark the dead skin upon the hairless skull the lips were bluey pale only the eyes had life they gleamed with demon light tell me quoth khawla is the fire gone out that threats the masters of the spell the dead lips moved and spake the fire still burns that threats the masters of the spell curse on thee okba khawla cried as to the den the sorcerer came he bore the dagger in his hand hot from the murder of hodeirahs race behold those unextinguished flames the fire still burns that threats the masters of the spell okba wert thou weak of heart okba wert thou blind of eye thy fate and ours were on the lot and we believed the lying stars that said thy hand might seize the auspicious hour thou hast let slip the reins of destiny curse thee curse thee okba the murderer answering said o versed in all enchanted lore thou better knowest okbas soul eight blows i struck eight homedriven blows needed no second stroke from this envenomed blade ye frown at me as if the will had failed as if ye did not know my double danger from hodeirahs race the deeper hate i feel the stronger motive that inspired my arm ye frown as if my hasty fault my illdirected blow had spared the enemy and not the stars that would not give and not your feeble spells that could not force the sign which of the whole was he did ye not bid me strike them all said ye not root and branch should be destroyed i heard hodeirahs dying groan i heard his childrens shriek of death and sought to consummate the work but oer the two remaining lives a cloud unpierceable had risen a cloud that mocked my searching eyes i would have probed it with the daggerpoint the dagger was repelled a voice came forth and cried son of perdition cease thou canst not change what in the book of destiny is written khawla to the teraph turned tell me where the prophets hand hides our destined enemy the dead lips spake again i view the seas i view the land i search the ocean and the earth not on ocean is the boy not on earth his steps are seen a mightier power than we lobaba cried protects our destined foe look look one fire burns dim it quivers it goes out it quivered it was quenched one flame alone was left a pale blue flame that trembled on the earth a hovering light upon whose shrinking edge the darkness seemed to press stronger it grew and spread its lucid swell around extending now where all the ten had stood with lustre more than all at that protentous sight the children of evil trembled and terror smote their souls over the den the fire its fearful splendour cast the broad base rolling up in wavy streams bright as the summer lightning when it spreads its glory oer the midnight heaven the teraphs eyes were dimmed that like two twinkling stars shone in the darkness late the sorcerers on each other gazed and every face all pale with fear and ghastly in that light was seen like a dead mans by the sepulchral lamp even khawla fiercest of the enchanter brood not without effort drew her fear suspended breath anon a deeper rage inflamed her reddening eye mighty is thy power mohammed loud in blasphemy she cried but eblis would not stoop to man when man fair statured as the stately palm from his creators hand was undefiled and pure thou art mighty o son of abdallah but who is he of woman born that shall vie with the might of eblis that shall rival the prince of the morning she said and raised her skinny hand as in defiance to high heaven and stretched her long lean finger forth and spake aloud the words of power the spirits heard her call and lo before her stands her demon minister spirit the enchantress cried where lives the boy coeval with whose life yon magic fire must burn demon mistress of the mighty spell not on ocean not on earth only eyes that view allahs glory throne see his hidingplace from some believing spirit ask and learn bring the dead hodeirah here khawla cried and he shall tell the demon heard her bidding and was gone a moment passed and at her feet hodeirahs corpse was laid his hand still held the sword he grasped in death the blood not yet had clotted on his wound the sorceress looked and with a smile that kindled to more fiendishness her hideous features cried where hodeirah is thy soul is it in the zemzem well is it in the eden groves waits it for the judgementblast in the trump of israfil is it plumed with silver wings underneath the throne of god even if beneath his throne hodeirah thou shalt hear thou shalt obey my voice she said and muttered charms that hell in fear and heaven in horror heard soon the stiff eyeballs rolled the muscles with convulsive motion shook the white lips quivered khawla saw her soul exulted and she cried prophet behold my power not even death secures thy slaves from khawlas spell where hodeirah is thy child hodeirah groaned and closed his eyes as if in the night and the blindness of death he would have hid himself speak to my question she exclaimed or in that mangled body thou shall live ages of torture answer me where can we find the boy god god hodeirah cried release me from this life from this intolerable agony speak cried the sorceress and she snatched a viper from the floor and with the living reptile lashed his neck wreathed round him with the blow the reptile tighter drew her folds and raised her wrathful head and fixed into his face her deadly teeth and shed poison in every wound in vain for allah heard hodeirahs prayer and khawla on a corpse had wrecked her baffled rage the fated fire moved on and round the body wrapt its funeral flames the flesh and bones in that portentous pile consumed the sword alone circled with fire was left where is the boy for whose hand it is destined where the destroyer who one day shall wield the sword that is circled with fire race accursed try your charms masters of the mighty spell mutter oer your words of power ye can shatter the dwellings of man ye can open the womb of the rock ye can shake the foundations of earth but not the word of god but not one letter can ye change of what his will hath written who shall seek thro araby hodeirahs dreaded son they mingle the arrows of chance the lot of abdaldar is drawn thirteen moons must wax and wane ere the sorcerer quit his quest he must visit every tribe that roam the desert wilderness or dwell beside perennial streams nor leave a solitary tent unsearched till he has found the boy the hated boy whose blood alone can quench that dreaded fire a crystal ring abdaldar bore the powerful gem condensed primeval dews that upon caucasus felt the first winters frost ripening there it lay beneath rock above rock and mountain ice uppiled on mountain till the incumbent mass assumed so huge its bulk the oceans azure hue with this he sought the inner den where burnt the eternal flame like waters gushing from some channelled rock full thro a narrow opening from a chasm the eternal flame streamed up no eye beheld the fount of that upflowing flame that blazed selfnurtured and for ever there it was no mortal element the abyss supplied it from the fountains at the first prepared in the heart of earth it lives and glows her vital heat till at the day decreed the voice of god shall let its billows loose to deluge oer with no abating flood the consummated world that thenceforth thro the air must roll the penal orb of fire unturbaned and unsandalled there abdaldar stood before the flame and held the ring beside and spake the language that the elements obey the obedient flame detatched a portion forth that in the crystal entering was condensed gem of the gem its living eye of fire when the hand that wears the spell shall touch the destined boy then shall that eye be quenched and the freed element fly to its sacred and remembered spring now go thy way abdaldar servant of eblis over arabia seek the destroyer over the sands of the scorching tchama over the waterless mountains of naïd in arud pursue him and yemen the happy and hejaz the country beloved by believers over arabia servant of eblis seek the destroyer from tribe to tribe from town to town from tent to tent abdaldar past him every morn the allbeholding eye saw from his couch unhallowed by a prayer rise to the scent of blood and every night lie down that rankling hope within him that by day goaded his steps still stinging him in sleep and startling him with vain accomplishment from visions still the same many a time his wary hand to many a youth applied the ring and still the dagger in his mantle hid was ready for the deed at length to the cords of a tent that were stretched by an island of palms in the desolate sea of the sands the weary traveller came under a shapely palm herself as shapely there a damsel stood she held her ready robe and looked towards a boy who from the tree above with one hand clinging to its trunk cast with the other down the clustered dates the wizard approached the tree he leaned on his staff like a wayfaring man and the sweat of his travel was seen on his brow he asks for food and lo the damsel proffers him her lap of dates and the stripling descends and runs into the tent and brings him forth water the draught of delight anon the master of the tent the father of the family came forth a man in years of aspect mild to the stranger approaching he gave the friendly saluting of peace and bade the skin be spread before the tent they spread the skin under a tamarinds shade that bending forward stretched its boughs of beauty far they brought the traveller rice with no false colours tinged to tempt the eye but white as the newfallen snow when never yet the sullying sun hath seen its purity nor the warm zephyr touched and tainted it the dates of the grove before their guest they laid and the luscious fig and water from the well the damsel from the tamarind tree had plucked its acid fruit and steeped it in water long and whoso drank of the cooling draught he would not wish for wine this to the guest the damsel brought and a modest pleasure kindled her cheek when raising from the cup his moistened lips the stranger smiled and praised and drank again whither is gone the boy he had pierced the melons pulp and closed with wax the wound and he had duly gone at morn and watched its ripening rind and now all joyfully he brings the treasure now matured his dark eyes sparkle with a boys delight as he pours out its liquid lusciousness and proffers to the guest abdaldar ate and he was satisfied and now his tongue discoursed of regions far remote as one whose busy feet had travelled long the father of the family with a calm eye and quiet smile sate pleased to hearken him the damsel who removed the meal she loitered on the way and listened with full hands a moment motionless all eagerly the boy watches the travellers lips and still the wily man with seemly kindness to the eager boy directs his winning tale ah cursed man if this be he if thou hast found the object of thy search thy hate thy bloody aim into what deep damnation wilt thou plunge thy miserable soul look how his eye delighted watches thine look how his open lips gasp at the winning tale and nearer now he comes to lose no word of that delightful talk then as in familiar mood upon the striplings arm the sorcerer laid his hand and the fire of the crystal fled whilst the sudden shoot of joy made pale abdaldars cheek the masters voice was heard it is the hour of prayer my children let us purify ourselves and praise the lord our god the boy the water brought after the law they purified themselves and bent their faces to the earth in prayer all save abdaldar over thalaba he stands and lifts the dagger to destroy before his lifted arm received its impulse to descend the blast of the desert came prostrate in prayer the pious family felt not the simoom pass they rose and lo the sorcerer lying dead holding the dagger in his blasted hand the third book thalaba the destroyer the third book thalaba oneiza look the dead man has a ring should it be buried with him oneiza oh yes yes a wicked man all that he has must needs be wicked too thalaba but see the sparkling stone how it has caught the glory of the sun and streams it back again in lines of light oneiza why do you take it from him thalaba and look at it so near it may have charms to blind or poison throw it in the grave i would not touch it thalaba and around its rim strange letters oneiza bury it oh bury it thalaba it is not written as the koran is some other tongue perchance the accursed man said he had been a traveller moath coming from the tent thalaba what hast thou there thalaba a ring the dead man wore perhaps my father you can read its meaning moath no boy the letters are not such as ours heap the sand over it a wicked man wears nothing holy thalaba nay not bury it it may be that some traveller who shall enter our tent may read them or if we approach cities where strangers dwell and learned men they may interpret moath it were better hid under the desert sands this wretched man whom god hath smitten in the very purpose and impulse of his unpermitted crime belike was some magician and these lines are of the language that the demons use oneiza bury it bury it dear thalaba moath such cursed men there are upon the earth in league and treaty with the evil powers the covenanted enemies of god and of all good dear purchase have they made of rule and riches and their lifelong sway masters yet slaves of hell beneath the roots of ocean the domdaniel caverns lie their impious meeting there they learn the words unutterable by man who holds his hope of heaven there brood the pestilence and let the earthquake loose thalaba and he who would have killed me was one of these moath i know not but it may be that on the table of destiny thy name is written their destroyer and for this thy life by yonder miserable man so sought so saved by interfering heaven thalaba his ring has some strange power then moath every gem so sages say has virtue but the science of difficult attainment some grow pale conscious of poison or with sudden shade of darkness warn the wearer same preserve from spells or blunt the hostile weapons edge some open rocks and mountains and lay bare their buried treasures others make the sight strong to perceive the presence of all beings thro whose pure substance the unaided eye passes like empty air and in yon stone i deem some such misterious quality thalaba my father i will wear it moath thalaba thalaba in gods name and the prophets be its power good let it serve the righteous if for evil god and my trust in him shall hallow it so thalaba drew on the written ring of gold then in the hollow grave they laid abdaldars corpse and levelled over him the desert dust the sun arose ascending from beneath the horizons circling line as thalaba to his ablutions went lo the grave open and the corpse exposed it was not that the winds of night had swept away the sands that covered it for heavy with the undried dew the desert dust was dark and close around and the night air had been so moveless calm it had not from the grove shaken a ripe date down amazed to hear the tale forth from the tent came moath and his child awhile the thoughtful man surveyed the corpse silent with downward eyes then turning spake to thalaba and said i have heard that there are places by the abode of holy men so holily possessed that if a corpse be buried there the ground with a convulsive effort shakes it out impatient of pollution have the feet of prophet or apostle blest this place ishmael or houd or saleh or than all mohammed holier name or is the man so foul with magic and all blasphemy that earth like heaven rejects him it is best forsake the station let us strike our tent the place is tainted and behold the vulture hovers yonder and his scream chides us that we still we scare him from his banquet so let the accursed one find fitting sepulchre then from the pollution of death with water they made themselves pure and thalaba drew up the fastening of the cords and moath furled the tent and from the grove of palms oneiza led the camels ready to receive their load the dews had ceased to steam towards the climbing sun when from the isle of palms they went their way and when the sun had reached his southern height as back they turned their eyes the distant palms arose like to the topsails of some faroff fleet distinctly seen where else the ocean bounds had blended with the sky and when the eve came on the sight returning reached the grove no more they planted the pole of their tent and they laid them down to repose at midnight thalaba started up for he felt that the ring on his finger was moved he called on allah aloud and he called on the prophets name moath arose in alarm what ails thee thalaba he cried is the robber of night at hand dost thou not see the youth exclaimed a spirit in the tent moath looked round and said the moon beam shines in the tent i see thee stand in the light and thy shadow is black on the ground thalaba answered not spirit he cried what brings thee here in the name of the prophet speak in the name of allah obey he ceased and there was silence in the tent dost thou not hear quoth thalaba the listening man replied i hear the wind that flaps the curtain of the tent the ring the ring the youth exclaimed for that the spirit of evil comes by that i see by that i hear in the name of god i ask thee who was he that slew my father demon master of the powerful ring okba the wise magician did the deed thalaba where does the murderer dwell demon in the domdaniel caverns under the roots of the ocean thalaba why were my father and my brethren slain demon we knew from the race of hodeirah the destined destroyer would come thalaba bring me my fathers sword demon a fire surrounds the fatedsword no spirit or magicians hand can pierce that guardian flame thalaba bring me his bow and his arrows distinctly moath heard his voice and she who thro the veil of separation watched all sounds in listening terror whose suspense forbade the aid of prayer they heard the voice of thalaba but when the spirit spake the motionless air felt not the subtle sounds too fine for mortal sense on a sudden the rattle of arrows was heard and the quiver was laid at the feet of the youth and in his hand they saw hodeirahs bow he eyed the bow he twanged the string and his heart bounded to the joyous tone anon he raised his voice and cried go thy way and never more evil spirit haunt our tent by the virtue of the ring by mohammeds holier might by the holiest name of god thee and all the powers of hell i adjure and i command never more to trouble us nor ever from that hour did rebel spirit on the tent intrude such virtue had the spell and peacefully the vernal years of thalaba past on till now without an effort he could bend hodeirahs stubborn bow black were his eyes and bright the sunny hue of health glowed on his tawny cheek his lip was darkened by maturing life strong were his shapely limbs his stature tall he was a comely youth compassion for the child had first old moaths kindly heart possessed an orphan wailing in the wilderness but when he heard his tale his wonderous tale told by the boy with such eyespeaking truth now with sudden bursts of anger now in the agony of tears and now in flashes of prophetic joy what had been pity became reverence and like a sacred trust from heaven the old man cherished him now with a fathers love child of his choice he loved the boy and like a father to the boy was dear oneiza called him brother and the youth more fondly than a brother loved the maid the loveliest of arabian maidens she how happily the years of thalaba went by it was the wisdom and the will of heaven that in a lonely tent had cast the lot of thalaba there might his soul develope best its strengthening energies there might he from the world keep his heart pure and uncontaminate till at the written hour he should be found fit servant of the lord without a spot years of his youth how rapidly ye fled in that beloved solitude is the morn fair and does the freshening breeze flow with cool current oer his cheek lo underneath the broadleaved sycamore with lids half closed he lies dreaming of days to come his dog beside him in mute blandishment now licks his listless hand now lifts an anxious and expectant eye courting the wonted caress or comes the father of the rains from his caves in the uttermost west comes he in darkness and storms when the blast is loud when the waters fill the travellers tread in the sands when the pouring shower streams adown the roof when the doorcurtain hangs in heavier folds when the outstrained tent flags loosely comfort is within the embers chearful glow the sound of the familiar voice the song that lightens toil under the common shelter on dry sand the quiet camels ruminate their food from moath falls the lengthening cord as patiently the old man intwines the strong palmfibers by the hearth the damsel shakes the coffeegrains that with warm fragrance fill the tent and while with dextrous fingers thalaba shapes the green basket haply at his feet her favourite kidling gnaws the twig forgiven plunderer for oneizas sake or when the winter torrent rolls down the deepchannelled raincourse foamingly dark with its mountain spoils with bare feet pressing the wet sand there wanders thalaba the rushing flow the flowing roar filling his yielded faculties a vague a dizzy a tumultuous joy or lingers it a vernal brook gleaming oer yellow sands beneath the lofty bank reclined with idle eye he views its little waves quietly listening to the quiet flow while in the breathings of the stirring gale the tall canes bend above floating like streamers on the wind their lank uplifted leaves nor rich nor poor was moath god had given enough and blest him with a mind content no hoarded gold disquieted his dreams but ever round his station he beheld camels that knew his voice and homebirds grouping at oneizas call and goats that morn and eve came with full udders to the damsels hand dear child the tent beneath whose shade they dwelt that was her work and she had twined his girdles manyhues and he had seen his robe grow in oneizas loom how often with a memorymingled joy that made her mother live before his sight he watched her nimble finders thread the woof or at the handmill when she knelt and toiled tost the thin cake on spreading palm or fixed it on the glowing ovens side with bare wet arm in safe dexterity tis the cool evening hour the tamarind from the dew sheaths its young fruit yet green before their tent the mat is spread the old mans aweful voice intones the holy book what if beneath no lampillumined dome its marble walls bedecked with flourished truth azure and gold adornment sinks the word with deeper influence from the imams voice where in the day of congregation crowds perform the duty task their father is their priest the stars of heaven their point of prayer and the blue firmament the glorious temple where they feel the present deity yet thro the purple glow of eve shines dimly the white moon the slackened bow the quiver the long lance rest on the pillar of the tent knitting light palmleaves for her brothers brow the darkeyed damsel sits the old man tranquilly up his curled pipe inhales the tranquillizing herb so listen they the reed of thalaba while his skilled fingers modulate the low sweet soothing melancholy tones or if he strung the pearls of poetry singing with agitated face and eloquent arms and sobs that reach the heart a tale of love and woe then if the brightening moon that lit his face in darkness favoured hers oh even with such a look as fables say the mother ostrich fixes on her egg till that intense affection kindle its light of life even in such deep and breathless tenderness oneizas soul is centered on the youth so motionless with such an ardent gaze save when from her full eyes quickly she wipes away the gushing tears that dim his image there she called him brother was it sisterlove that made the silver rings round her smooth ankles and her twany arms shine daily brightened for a brothers eye were her long fingers tinged as when she trimmed the lamp and thro the veins and delicate skin the light shone rosy that the darkened lids gave yet a softer lustre to her eye that with such pride she tricked her glossy tresses and on holy day wreathed the red flowercrown round their jetty waves how happily the years of thalaba went by yet was the heart of thalaba impatient of repose restless he pondered still the task for him decreed the mighty and mysterious work announced day by day with youthful ardour he the call of heaven awaits and oft in visions oer the murderers head he lifts the avenging arm and oft in dreams he sees the sword that is circled with fire one morn as was their wont in sportive mood the youth and damsel bent hodeirahs bow for with no feeble hand nor erring aim oneiza could let loose the obedient shaft with head backbending thalaba shot up the aimless arrow high in air whose line in vain the aching sight pursued lost in the depth of heaven when will the hour arrive exclaimed the youth that i shall aim these fated shafts to vengeance long delayed have i not strength my father for the deed or can the will of providence be mutable like man shall i never be called to the task impatient boy quoth moath with a smile impatient thalaba oneiza cried and she too smiled but in her smile a mild reproachful melancholy mixed then moath pointed where a cloud of locusts from the desolated fields of syria winged their way lo how created things obey the written doom onward they came a dark continuous cloud of congregated myriads numberless the rushing of whose wings was as the sound of a broad river headlong in its course plunged from a mountain summit or the roar of a wild ocean in the autumn storm shattering its billows on a shore of rocks onward they came the winds impelled them on their work was done their path of ruin past their graves were ready in the wilderness behold the mighty army moath cried blindly they move impelled by the blind element and yonder birds our welcome visitants lo where they soar above the embodied host pursue their way and hang upon their rear and thin their spreading flanks rejoicing oer their banquet deemest thou the scent of water on the syrian mosque placed with priestmummery and the jargonrites that fool the multitude has led them here from far khorasan allah who decreed yon tribe the plague and punishment of man these also hath he doomed to meet their way both passive instruments of his allacting will sole mover he and only spring of all while thus he spake oneizas eye looks up where one towards her flew satiate for so it seemed with sport and food the bird flew over her and as he past above from his relaxing grasp a locust fell it fell upon the maidens robe and feebly there it stood recovering slow the admiring girl surveyed his outspread sails of green his gauzy underwings one closely to the grass green body furled one ruffled in the fall and half unclosed she viewed his jetorbed eyes his glossy gorget bright greenglittering in the sun his plumy pliant horns that nearer as she gazed bent tremblingly before her breath she viewed his yellowcircled front with lines mysterious veined and knowest thou what is written here my father said the maid look thalaba perchance these lines are in the letters of the ring natures own language written here the youth bent down and suddenly he started and his heart sprung and his cheek grew red for the mysterious lines were legible when the sun shall be darkened at noon son of hodeirah depart and moath looked and read the lines aloud the locust shook his wings and fled and they were silent all who then rejoiced but thalaba who then was troubled but the arabian maid and moath sad of heart tho with a grief supprest beheld the youth sharpen his arrows now and now newplume their shafts now to beguile impatient hope feel every sharpened point why is that anxious look oneiza cried still upwards cast at noon is thalaba aweary of our tent i would be gone the youth replied that i might do my task and full of glory to the tent return whence i should part no more but on the noontide sun as anxious and as oft oneizas eye was upward glanced in fear and now as thalaba replied her cheek lost its fresh and lively hue for in the suns bright edge she saw or thought she saw a little speck the sage astronomer who with the love of science full trembled that day at every passing cloud he had not seen it twas a speck so small alas oneiza sees the spot increase and lo the ready youth over his shoulder the full quiver slings and grasps the slackened bow it spreads and spreads and now has shaddowed half the sun whose crescentpointed horns now momently decrease the day grows dark the birds retire to rest forth from her shadowy haunt flies the largeheaded screamer of the night far off the affrighted african deeming his god deceased falls on his knees in prayer and trembles as he sees the fierce hyenas eyes glare in the darkness of that dreadful noon then thalaba exclaimed farewell my father my oneiza the old man felt his throat swell with grief where wilt thou go my child he cried wilt thou not wait a sign to point thy destined way god will conduct me said the noble youth he said and from the tent in the depth of the darkness departed they heard his parting steps the quiver rattling as he past away the fourth book thalaba the destroyer the fourth book whose is yon dawning form that in the darkness meets the delegated youth dim as the shadow of a fire at noon or pale reflection on the evening brook of glowworm on the bank kindled to guide her winged paramour a moment and the brightening image shaped his mothers form and features go she cried to babylon and from the angels learn what talisman thy task requires the spirit hung towards him when she ceased as tho with actual lips she would have given a mothers kiss his arms outstretched his body bending on his lips unclosed and trembling into speech he prest to meet the blessing but the wind played on his cheek he looked and he beheld the darkness close again again he cried let me again behold thee from the darkness his mothers voice went forth thou shall behold me in the hour of death day dawns the twilight gleam dilates the sun comes forth and like a god rides thro rejoicing heaven old moath and his daughter from their tent beheld the adventurous youth dark moving oer the sands a lessening image trembling thro their tears visions of high emprize beguiled his lonely road and if sometimes to moaths tent the involuntary mind recurred fancy impatient of all painful thoughts pictured the bliss should welcome his return in dreams like these he went and still of every dream oneiza formed a part and hope and memory made a mingled joy in the eve he arrived at a well the acacia bent over its side under whose long lighthanging boughs he chose his nights abode there due ablutions made and prayers performed the youth his mantle spread and silently produced his solitary meal the silence and the solitude recalled dear recollections and with folded arms thinking of other days he sate till thought had left him and the acacias moving shade upon the sunny sand had caught his idle eye and his awakened ear heard the grey lizards chirp the only sound of life as thus in vacant quietness he sate a traveller on a camel reached the well and courteous greeting gave the mutual salutation past he by the cistern too his garment spread and friendly converse cheered the social meal the stranger was an antient man yet one whose green old age bore the fair characters of temperate youth so much of manhoods strength his limbs retained it seemed he needed not the staff he bore his beard was long and grey and crisp lively his eyes and quick and reaching over them the large broad eyebrow curled his speech was copious and his winning words enriched with knowledge that the attentive youth sate listening with a thirsty joy so in the course of talk the adventurer youth enquired whither his course was bent the old man answered to bagdad i go at that so welcome sound a flash of joy kindled the eye of thalaba and i too he replied am journeying thitherward let me become companion of thy way courteous the old man smiled and willing in assent old man son thou art young for travel thalaba until now i never past the desert boundary old man it is a noble city that we seek thou wilt behold magnificent palaces and lofty obelisks and highdomed mosques and rich bazars whither from all the world industrious merchants meet and market there the worlds collected wealth thalaba stands not bagdad near to the site of ancient babylon and nimrods impious temple old man from the walls tis but a long days distance thalaba and the ruins old man a mighty mass remains enough to tell us how great our fathers were how little we men are not what they were their crimes and follies have dwarfed them down from the old hero race to such poor things as we thalaba at babylon i have heard the angels expiate their guilt haruth and maruth old man tis a history handed from ages down the nurses make it a tale to please their children and as their garrulous ignorance relates we learn it and believe but all things feel the power of time and change thistles and grass usurp the desolate palace and the weeds of falshood root in the aged pile of truth how have you heard the tale thalaba thus on a time the angels at the wickedness of man expressed indignant wonder that in vain tokens and signs were given and prophets sent strange obstinacy this a stubborness of sin they said that should for ever bar the gates of mercy on them allah heard their unforgiving pride and bade that two of these untempted spirits should descend judges on earth haruth and maruth went the chosen sentencers they fairly heard the appeals of men to their tribunal brought and rightfully decided at the length a woman came before them beautiful zohara was as yonder evening star in the mild lustre of whose lovely light even now her beauty shines they gazed on her with fleshly eyes they tempted her to sin the wily woman listened and required a previous price the knowledge of the name of god she learnt the wonderworking name and gave it utterance and its virtue bore her up to the glorious presence and she told before the aweful judgementseat her tale old man i know the rest the accused spirits were called unable of defence and penitent they owned their crime and heard the doom deserved then they besought the lord that not for ever his wrath might be upon them and implored that penal ages might at length restore them clean from offence since then by babylon in the cavern of their punishment they dwell runs the conclusion so thalaba so i am taught old man the common tale and likely thou hast heard how that the bold and bad with impious rites intrude upon their penitence and force albeit from loathing and reluctant lips the sorcerysecret thalaba is it not the truth old man son thou hast seen the traveller in the sands move in the dizzy light of the hot noon huge as the giant race of elder times and his camel than the monstrous elephant seem of a vaster bulk thalaba a frequent sight old man and hast thou never in the twilight fancied familiar object into some strange shape and form uncouth thalaba aye many a time old man even so things viewed at distance thro the mist of fear in their distortion terrify and shock the abused sight thalaba but of these angels fate thus in the uncreated book is written old man wisely from legendary fables heaven inculcates wisdom thalaba how then is the truth is not the dungeon of their punishment by ruined babylon old man by babylon haruth and maruth may be found thalaba and there magician learn their impious sorcery old man son what thou sayest is true and it is false but night approaches fast i have travelled far and my old lids are heavy on our way we shall have hours for converse let us now turn to our due repose son peace be with thee so in his loosened cloak the old man wrapt himself and laid his limbs at length and thalaba in silence laid him down awhile he lay and watched the lovely moon oer whose broad orb the boughs a mazy fretting framed or with a pale transparent green lighting the restless leaves the thin acacia leaves that played above the murmuring wind the moving leaves lulled him to sleep with mingled lullabies not so the dark magician by his side lobaba who from the domdaniel caves had sought the dreaded youth silent he lay and simulating sleep till by the long and regular breath he knew the youth beside him slept carefully then he rose and bending over him surveyed him near and secretly he cursed the dead abdaldars ring armed by whose amulet he slept from danger safe wrapped in his mantle thalaba reposed his loose right arm pillowing his head the moon was on the ring whose crystal gem returned a quiet moveless light vainly the wizard vile put forth his hand and strove to reach the gem charms strong as hell could make them made it safe he called his servant fiends he bade the genii rob the sleeping youth by the virtue of the ring by mohammeds holier power by the holiest name of god had thalaba disarmed the evil race baffled and weary and convinced at length anger and fear and rancour gnawing him the accursed sorcerer ceased his vain attempts content perforce to wait temptations likelier aid restless he lay and brooding many a wile and tortured with impatient hope and envying with the bitterness of hate the innocent youth who slept so sweetly by the ray of morning on his eye lids fell and thalaba awoke and folded his mantle around him and girded his loins for the day then the due rites of holiness observed his comrade too arose and with the outward forms of righteousness and prayer insulted god they filled their water skin they gave the camel his full draught then on their road while yet the morn was young and the air was fresh with dew forward the travellers went with various talk beguiling the long way but soon the youth whose busy mind dwelt on lobabas wonderstirring words renewed the unfinished converse of the night thalaba thou saidest that it is true and yet is false that men accurst attain at babylon forbidden knowledge from the angel pair how mean you lobaba all things have a double power alike for good and evil the same fire that on the comfortable hearth at eve warmed the good man flames oer the house at night should we for this forego the needful element because the scorching summer sun darts fever wouldst thou quench the orb of day or deemest thou that heaven in anger formed iron to till the field because when man had tipt his arrows for the chase he rushed a murderer to the war thalaba what follows hence lobaba that nothing in itself is good or evil but only in its use think you the man praiseworthy who by painful study learns the knowledge of all simples and their power healing or harmful thalaba all men hold in honour the skilful leech from land to land he goes safe in his privilege the sword of war spares him kings welcome him with costly gifts and he who late had from the couch of pain lifted a languid look to him for aid views him with brightened eyes and blesses him in his first thankful prayer lobaba yet some there are who to the purposes of wickedness apply this knowledge and from herbs distil poison to mix it in the trusted draught thalaba allah shall cast them in the fire whose fuel is the cursed there shall they endure the everburning agony consuming still in flames and still renewed lobaba but is their knowledge therefore in itself unlawful thalaba that were foolishness to think lobaba o what a glorious animal were man knew he but his own powers and knowing gave them room for their growth and spread the horse obeys his guiding will the patient camel bears him over these wastes of sand the pigeon wafts his bidding thro the sky and with these triumphs he rests contented with these ministers when he might awe the elements and make myriads of spirits serve him thalaba but as how by a league with hell a covenant that binds the soul to utter death lobaba was solomon accurst of god yet to his talismans obedient oer his throne the birds of heaven their waving wings his sunshield fanned around him the motionless air of noon from place to place as his will reined the viewless element he rode the wind the genii reared his temple and ceaselessly in fear while his dead eye oerlooked them day and night pursued their toil so dreadful was his power thalaba but twas from heaven his wisdom came gods special gift the guerdon of early virtue lobaba learn thou o young man god hath appointed wisdom the reward of study tis a spring of living waters whose inexhaustible bounties all might drink but few dig deep enough son thou art silent perhaps i say too much perhaps offend thee thalaba nay i am young and willingly as becomes me hear the wise words of age lobaba is it a crime to mount the horse because forsooth thy feet can serve thee for the journey is it sin because the hern soars upward in the sky above the arrows flight to train the falcon whose beak shall pierce him there the powers which all granted to man were granted for his use all knowledge that befits not human weakness is placed beyond its reach they who repair to babylon and from the angels learn mysterious wisdom sin not in the deed thalaba know you these secrets lobaba i alas my son my age just knows enough to understand how little all its knowledge later years sacred to study teach me to regret youths unforeseeing indolence and hours that can not be recalled something i know the properties of herbs and have sometimes brought to the afflicted comfort and relief by the secrets of my art under his blessing without whom all had failed also of gems i have some knowledge and the characters that tell beneath what aspect they were set thalaba belike you can interpret then the graving around this ring lobaba my sight is feeble son and i must view it closer let me try the unsuspecting youth held forth his linger to draw off the spell even whilst he held it forth there settled there a wasp and just above the gem infixed its dart all purple swoln the hot and painful flesh rose round the tightened ring the baffled sorcerer knew the hand of heaven and inwardly blasphemed ere long lobabas heart fruitful in wiles devised new stratagem a mist arose at noon like the loose hanging skirts of some low cloud that by the breeze impelled sweeps oer the mountain side with joy the thoughtless youth that grateful shadowing hailed for grateful was the shade while thro the silverlighted haze guiding their way appeared the beamless sun but soon that beacon failed a heavier mass of cloud impenetrably deep hung oer the wilderness knowest thou the track quoth thalaba or should we pause and wait the wind to scatter this bewildering fog the sorcerer answered him now let us hold right on for if we stray the sun tomorrow will direct our course so saying he towards the desert depths misleads the youth deceived earlier the night came on nor moon nor stars were visible in heaven and when at morn the youth unclosed his eyes he knew not where to turn his face in prayer what shall we do lobaba cried the lights of heaven have ceased to guide us on our way should we remain and wait more favourable skies soon would our food and water fail us here and if we venture on there are the dangers of the wilderness sure it were best proceed the chosen youth replies so haply we may reach some tent or grove of dates or stationed tribe but idly to remain were yielding effortless and waiting death the wily sorcerer willingly assents and farther in the sands elate of heart he leads the credulous youth still oer the wilderness settled the moveless mist the timid antelope that heard their steps stood doubtful where to turn in that dim light the ostrich blindly hastening met them full at night again in hope young thalaba laid down the morning came and not one guiding ray thro the thick mist was visible the same deep moveless mist that mantled all oh for the vultures scream that haunts for prey the abode of humankind oh for the plovers pleasant cry to tell of water near oh for the cameldrivers song for now the waterskin grows light tho of the draught more eagerly desired imperious prudence took with sparing thirst oft from the third nights broken sleep as in his dreams he heard the sound of rushing winds started the anxious youth and looked abroad in vain for still the deadly calm endured another day past on the waterskin was drained but then one hope arrived for there was motion in the air the sound of the wind arose anon that scattered the thick mist and lo at length the lovely face of heaven alas a wretched scene was opened on their view they looked around no wells were near no tent no human aid flat on the camel lay the waterskin and their dumb servant difficultly now over hot sands and under the hot sun dragged on with patient pain but oh the joy the blessed sight when in the burning waste the travellers saw a green meadow fair with flowers besprent azure and yellow like the beautiful fields of england when amid the growing grass the bluebell bends the golden kingcup shines in the merry month of may oh joy the travellers gaze on each other with hopebrightened eyes for sure thro that green meadow flows the living stream and lo their famished beast sees the restoring sight hope gives his feeble limbs a sudden strength he hurries on the herbs so fair to eye were senna and the gentians blossom blue and kindred plants that with unwatered root fed in the burning sand whose bitter leaves even frantic famine loathed in uncommunicating misery silent they stood at length lobaba cried son we must slay the camel or we die for lack of water thy young hand is firm draw forth the knife and pierce him wretch accurst who that beheld thy venerable face thy features fixed with suffering the dry lips the feverish eyes could deem that all within was magic ease and fearlessness secure and wiles of hellish import the young man paused with reluctant pity but he saw his comrades red and painful countenance and his own burning breath came short and quick and at his feet the gasping beast lies overworn with want then from his girdle thalaba took the knife with stern compassion and from side to side across the camels throat drew deep the crooked blade servant of man that merciful deed for ever ends thy suffering but what doom waits thy deliverer little will thy death avail us thought the youth as in the waterskin he poured the camels hoarded draught it gave a scant supply the poor allowance of one prudent day son of hodeirah tho thy steady soul despaired not firm in faith yet not the less did suffering nature feel her pangs and trials long their craving thirst struggled with fear by fear itself inflamed but drop by drop that poor that last supply is drained still the same burning sun no cloud in heaven the hot air quivers and the sultry mist floats oer the desert with a show of distant waters mocking their distress the youths parched lips were black his tongue was dry and rough his eyeballs red with heat his comrade gazed on him with looks that seemed to speak of pity and he said let me behold thy ring it may have virtue that can save us yet with that he took his hand and viewed the writing close then cried with sudden joy it is a stone that whoso bears the genii must obey now raise thy voice my son and bid them in his name that here is written preserve us in our need nay answered thalaba shall i distrust the providence of god is it not he must save if allah wills it not vain were the geniis aid whilst he spake lobabas eye full on the distance fixed attended not his speech its fearful meaning drew the looks of thalaba columns of sand came moving on red in the burning ray like obelisks of fire they rushed before the driving wind vain were all thoughts of flight they had not hoped escape could they have backed the dromedary then who in his rapid race gives to the tranquil air a drowning force high high in heaven upcurled the dreadful columns moved swift as the whirlwind that impelled their way they rushed towards the travellers the old magician shrieked and lo the foremost bursts before the whirlwinds force scattering afar a burning shower of sand now by the virtue of the ring save us lobaba cried while yet thou hast the power save us o save us now the youth made no reply gazing in aweful wonder on the scene why dost thou wait the old man exclaimed if allah and the prophet will not save call on the powers that will ha do i know thee infidel accurst exclaimed the awakened youth and thou hast led me hither child of sin that fear might make me sell my soul to endless death fool that thou art lobaba cried call upon him whose name thy charmed signet bears or die the death thy foolishness deserves servant of hell die thou quoth thalaba and leaning on his bow he fitted the loose string and laid the arrow in its restingplace bow of my father do thy duty now he drew the arrow to its point true to his eye it fled and full upon the breast it smote the wizard man astonished thalaba beheld the blunted point recoil a proud and bitter smile wrinkled lobabas cheek try once again thine earthly arms he cried rash boy the power i serve abandons not his votaries it is for allahs wretched slaves like thou to serve a master who in the hour of need forsakes them to their fate i leave thee and he shook his staff and called the chariot of his charms swift as the viewless wind selfmoved the chariot came the sorcerer mounts the seat yet once more weigh thy danger he exclaimed ascend the car with me and with the speed of thought we pass the desert bounds the indignant youth vouchsafed not to reply and lo the magic car begins its course hark hark he screams lobaba screams what wretch and hast thou raised the rushing terrors of the wilderness to fall on thine own head death death inevitable death driven by the breath of god a column of the desert met his way the fifth book thalaba the destroyer the fifth book when thalaba from adoration rose the air was cool the sky with welcome clouds oercast that soon came down in rain he lifted up his fevered face to heaven and bared his head and stretched his hands to that delightful shower and felt the coolness flow thro every limb freshening his powers of life a loud quick panting thalaba looks up he starts and his instinctive hand grasps the knife hilt for close beside a tyger passes him an indolent and languid eye the passing tyger turned his head was hanging down his dry tongue lolling low and the short panting of his fevered breath came thro his hot parched nostrils painfully the young arabian knew the purport of his hurried pace and following him in hope saw joyful from afar the tyger stoop and drink the desert pelican had built her nest in that deep solitude and now returned from distant flight fraught with the river stream her load of water had disburthened there her young in the refreshing bath sported all wantonness dipt down their callow heads filled the swoln membrane from their plumeless throat pendant and bills yet soft and buoyant with arched breast plied in unpractised stroke the oars of their broad feet they as the spotted prowler of the wild laps the cool wave around their mother croud and nestle underneath her outspread wings the spotted prowler of the wild lapt the cool wave and satiate from the nest guiltless of blood withdrew the mother bird had moved not but cowering oer her nestlings sate confident and fearless and watched the wonted guest but when the human visitant approached the alarmed pelican retiring from that hostile shape gathers her young and menaces with wings and forward thrusts her threatening neck its feathers ruffling in her wrath bold with maternal fear thalaba drank and in the waterskin hoarded the precious element not all he took but in the large nest left store that sufficed for life and journeying onward blest the carrier bird and blest in thankfulness their common father provident for all with strength renewed and confident in faith the son of hodeirah proceeds till after the long toil of many a day at length bagdad appeared the city of his search he hastening to the gate roams oer the city with insatiate eyes its thousand dwellings oer whose level roofs fair cupolas appeared and highdomed mosques and pointed minarets and cypress groves every where scattered in unwithering green thou too art fallen bagdad city of peace thou too hast had thy day and loathsome ignorance and brute servitude pollute thy dwellings now erst for the mighty and the wise renowned o yet illustrious for remembered fame thy founder the victorious and the pomp of haroun for whose name by blood defiled jahias and the blameless barmecides genius hath wrought salvation and the years when science with the good almaimon dwelt so one day may the crescent from thy mosques be plucked by wisdom when the enlightened arm of europe conquers to redeem the east then pomp and pleasure dwelt within her walls the merchants of the east and of the west met in her arched bazars all day the active poor showered a cool comfort oer her thronging streets labour was busy in her looms thro all her open gates long troops of laden camels lined her roads and tigris on his tameless current bore armenian harvests to her multitudes but not in sumptuous caravansary the adventurer idles there nor satiates wonder with her pomp and wealth a long days distance from the walls stands ruined babylon the time of action is at hand the hope that for so many a year hath been his daily thought his nightly dream stings to more restlessness he loathes all lingering that delays the hour when full of glory from his quest returned he on the pillar of the tent beloved shall hang hodeirahs sword the manycoloured domes yet wore one dusky hue the cranes upon the mosque kept their nightclatter still when thro the gate the early traveller past and when at evening oer the swampy plain the bitterns boom came far distinct in darkness seen above the low horizons lingering light rose the near ruins of old babylon once from her lofty walls the charioteer looked down on swarming myriads once she flung her arches oer euphrates conquered tide and thro her brazen portals when she poured her armies forth the distant nations looked as men who watched the thundercloud in fear lest it should burst above them she was fallen the queen of cities babylon was fallen low lay her bulwarks the black scorpion basked in the palace courts within her sanctuary the she wolf hid her whelps is yonder huge and shapeless heap what once had been the aerial gardens height on height rising like medias mountains crowned with wood work of imperial dotage where the fame of belus where the golden image now which at the sound of dulcimer and lute cornet and sackbut harp and psaltery the assyrian slaves adored a labyrinth of ruins babylon spreads oer the blasted plain the wandering arab never sets his tent within her walls the shepherd eyes afar her evil towers and devious drives his flock alone unchanged a free and bridgeless tide euphrates rolls along eternal natures work thro the broken portal over weedy fragments thalaba went his way cautious he trod and felt the dangerous ground before him with his bow the chacal started at his steps the stork alarmed at sound of man from her broad nest upon the old pillar top affrighted fled on flapping wings the adder in her haunts disturbed lanced at the intruding staff her arrowy tongue twilight and moonshine dimly mingling gave an aweful light obscure evening not wholly closed the moon still pale and faint an aweful light obscure broken by many a mass of blackest shade long column stretching dark thro weeds and moss broad length of lofty wall whose windows lay in light and of their former shape lowarched or square rude outline on the earth figured with long grass fringed reclined against a columns broken shaft unknowing whitherward to bend his way he stood and gazed around the ruins closed him in it seemed as if no foot of man for ages had intruded there soon at approaching step starting he turned and saw a warrior in the moon beam drawing near forward the stranger came and with a curious eye perused the arab youth and who art thou he cried that at an hour like this wanderest in babylon a waybewildered traveller seekest thou the ruinous shelter here or comest thou to hide the plunder of the night or hast thou spells to make these ruins yawning from their rooted base disclose their secret wealth the youth replied nor wandering traveller nor robber of the night nor skilled in spells am i i seek the angels here haruth and maruth stranger in thy turn why wanderest thou in babylon and who art thou the questioner the man was fearless and the tempered pride that toned the voice of thalaba displeased not him himself of haughty heart heedless he answered knowest thou their cave of punishment thalaba vainly i seek it stranger art thou firm of foot to tread the ways of danger thalaba point the path stranger young arab if thou hast a heart can beat evenly in danger if thy bowels yearn not with human fears at scenes where undisgraced the soldier tried in battle might look back and tremble follow me for i am bound into that cave of horrors thalaba gazed on his comrade he was young of port stately and strong belike his face had pleased a womans eye yet the youth read in it unrestrained passions the obdurate soul bold in all evil daring and it taught by natures irresistible instinct doubt well timed and wary of himself assured fearless of man and confident in faith lead on cried thalaba mohareb led the way and thro the ruined streets and thro the farther gate they past in silence on what sound is borne on the wind is it the storm that shakes the thousand oaks of the forest but thalabas long locks flow down his shoulders moveless and the wind in his loose mantle raises not one fold is it the rivers roar dashed down some rocky descent along the level plain euphrates glides unheard what sound disturbs the night loud as the summer forest in the storm as the river that roars among rocks and what the heavy cloud that hangs upon the vale thick as the mist oer a wellwatered plain settling at evening when the cooler air lets its dayvapours fall black as the sulphurcloud that thro vesuvius or from heclas mouth rolls up ascending from the infernal fires from aits bitumen lake that heavy cloud ascends that everlasting roar from where its gushing springs boil their black billows up silent the arab youth along the verge of that wide lake followed moharebs way towards a ridge of rocks that banked its side there from a cave with torrent force and everlasting roar the black bitumen rolled the moonlight lay upon the rocks their crags were visible the shade of jutting cliffs and where broad lichens whitened some smooth spot and where the ivy hung its flowing tresses down a little way within the cave the moonlight fell glossing the sable tide that gushed tumultuous out a little way it entered then the rock arching its entrance and the winding way darkened the unseen depths no eye of mortal man if unenabled by enchanted spell had pierced those fearful depths for mingling with the roar of the portentous torrent oft were heard shrieks and wild yells that scared the brooding eagle from her midnight nest the affrighted countrymen call it the mouth of hell and ever when their way leads near they hurry with averted eyes and dropping their beads fast pronounce the holy name there pausing at the cavern mouth mohareb turned to thalaba now darest thou enter in behold the youth replied and leading in his turn the dangerous way set foot within the cave stay madman cried his comrade wouldst thou rush headlong to certain death where are thine arms to meet the guardian of the passage a loud shriek that shook along the windings of the cave scattered the youths reply mohareb when the long reechoing ceased exclaimed fate favoured thee young arab when she wrote upon thy brow the meeting of tonight else surely had thy name this hour been blotted from the book of life so saying from beneath his cloak a bag he drew young arab thou art brave he cried but thus to rush on danger unprepared as lions spring upon the hunters spear is blind brute courage zohak keeps the cave giantly tyrant of primeval days force can not win the passage thus he said and from his wallet drew a human hand shrivelled and dry and black and fitting as he spake a taper in its hold pursued a murderer on the stake had died i drove the vulture from his limbs and lopt the hand that did the murder and drew up the tendonstrings to close its grasp and in the sun and wind parched it nine weeks exposed the taper but not here the place to impart nor hast thou done the rites that fit thee to partake the mystery look it burns clear but with the air around its dead ingredients mingle deathiness this when the keeper of the cave shall feel maugre the doom of heaven the salutary spell shall lull his penal agony to sleep and leave the passage free thalaba answered not nor was there time for answer now for lo mohareb leads and oer the vaulted cave trembles the accursed tapers feeble light there where the narrowing chasm rose loftier in the hill stood zohak wretched man condemned to keep his cave of punishment his was the frequent scream which far away the prowling chacal heard and howled in terror back for from his shoulders grew two snakes of monster size that ever at his head aimed eager their keen teeth to satiate raving hunger with his brain he in the eternal conflict oft would seize their swelling necks and in his giant grasp bruise them and rend their flesh with bloody nails and howl for agony feeling the pangs he gave for of himself inseparable parts his torturers grew to him approaching now mohareb held the withered arm the taper of enchanted power the unhallowed spell in hand unholy held now ministered to mercy heavily the wretches eyelids closed and welcome and unfelt like the release of death a sudden sleep fell on his vital powers yet tho along the cave lay zohaks giant limbs the twinborn serpents kept the narrow pass kindled their fiery eyes darted their tongues of terror and rolled out their undulating length like the long streamers of some gallant ship buoyed on the wavy air still struggling to flow on and still withheld the scent of living flesh inflamed their appetite prepared for all the perils of the cave mohareb came he from his wallet drew two human heads yet warm o hard of heart whom not the visible power of retributive justice and the doom of zohak in his sight deterred from equal crime two human heads yet warm he laid before the scaly guardians of the pass they to their wonted banquet of old years turned eager and the narrow pass was free and now before their path the opening cave dilates they reach a spacious vault where the black river fountains burst their way now as a whirlwinds force had centered on the spring the gushing flood rolled up and now the deadened roar echoed beneath them as its sudden pause left wide a dark abyss adown whose fathomless gulphs the eye was lost blue flames that hovered oer the springs flung thro the cavern their uncertain light now waving on the waves they lay and now their fiery curls flowed in long tresses up and now contracting glowed with whiter heat then up they poured again darting pale flashes thro the tremulous air the flames the red and yellow sulphursmoke and the black darkness of the vault commingling indivisibly here quoth mohareb do the angels dwell the teachers of enchantment thalaba then raised his voice and cried haruth and maruth hear me not with rites accursed to disturb your penitence and learn forbidden lore repentant angels seek i your abode me allah and the prophet mission here their chosen servant i tell me the talisman and dost thou think mohareb cried as with a scornful smile he glanced upon his comrade dost thou think to trick them of their secret for the dupes of humankind keep this liprighteousness twill serve thee in the mosque and in the marketplace but spirits view the heart only by strong and torturing spells enforced those stubborn angels teach the charm by which we must descend descend said thalaba but then the wrinkling smile forsook moharebs cheek and darker feelings settled on his brow now by my soul quoth he and i believe idiot that i have led some camelkneed prayermonger thro the cave what brings thee hither thou shouldest have a hut by some saints grave beside the public way there to lessknowing fools retail thy koran scraps and in thy turn die civetlike at last in the dungperfume of thy sanctity ye whom i seek that led by me feet uninitiate tread your threshold this atones fit sacrifice he falls and forth he flashed his scymetar and raised the murderous blow then ceased his power his lifted arm suspended by the spell hung impotent to strike poor hypocrite cried he and this then is thy faith in allah and the prophet they had failed to save thee but for magics stolen aid yea they had left thee yonder serpents meal but that in prudent cowardice the chosen servant of the lord came in safe follower of my path blasphemer dost thou boast of guiding me kindling with pride quoth thalaba blindly the wicked work the righteous will of heaven sayest thou that diffident of god in magic spell i trust liar let witness this and he drew off abdaldars ring and cast it in the gulph a skinny hand came up and caught it as it fell and peals of devilish laughter shook the cave then joy suffused moharebs cheek and thalaba beheld the blue blade gleam descending to destroy the undefended youth sprung forward and he seized mohareb in his grasp and grappled with him breast to breast sinewy and large of limb mohareb was broadshouldered and his joints knit firm and in the strife of danger practised well time had not thus matured young thalaba but now the enthusiast mind the inspiration of his soul poured vigour like the strength of madness thro his frame mohareb reels before him he right on with knee with breast with arm presses the staggering foe and now upon the brink of that tremendous spring there with fresh impulse and a rush of force he thrust him from his hold the upwhirling flood received mohareb then absorbed engulphed him in the abyss thalabas breath came fast and panting he breathed out a broken prayer of thankfulness at length he spake and said haruth and maruth are ye here or has that evil guide misled my search i thalaba the servant of the lord invoke you hear me angels so may heaven accept and mitigate your penitence i go to root from earth the sorcerer brood tell me the needful talisman thus as he spake recumbent on the rock beyond the black abyss their forms grew visible a settled sorrow sate upon their brows sorrow alone for trace of guilt and shame no more remained and gradual as by prayer the sin was purged away their robe of glory purified of stain resumed the lustre of its native light in awe the youth received the answering voice son of hodeirah thou hast proved it here the talisman is faith end of the first volume thalaba the destroyer by robert southey greek poiêmatôn akratês ê eleutheria kai nomos eis to doxan tô

ninth book the tenth book the eleventh book the twelfth book the sixth book thalaba the destroyer the sixth book so from the inmost cavern thalaba retrod the windings of the rock still on the ground the giant limbs of zohak were outstretched the spell of sleep had ceased and his broad eyes were glaring on the youth yet raised he not his arm to bar the way fearful to rouse the snakes now lingering oer their meal oh then emerging from that dreadful cave how grateful did the gale of night salute his freshened sense how full of lightsome joy thankful to heaven he hastens by the verge of that bitumen lake whose black and heavy fumes surge heaving after surge rolled like the billowy and tumultuous sea the song of many a bird at morn aroused him from his rest lo by his side a courser stood more animate of eye of form more faultless never had he seen more light of limbs and beautiful in strength among the race whose blood pure and unmingled from the royal steeds of solomon came down the chosen arabs eye glanced oer his graceful shape his rich caparisons his crimson trappings gay but when he saw the mouth uncurbed the unbridled neck then flushed his cheek and leapt his heart for sure he deemed that heaven had sent the courser whom no erring hand should guide and lo the eager steed throws his head and paws the ground impatient of delay then up leapt thalaba and away went the selfgoverned steed far over the plain away went the bridleless steed with the dew of the morning his fetlocks were wet the foam frothed his limbs in the journey of noon nor stayed he till over the westerly heaven the shadows of evening had spread then on a sheltered bank the appointed youth reposed and by him laid the docile courser down again in the grey of the morning thalaba bounded up over hill over dale away goes the bridleless steed again at eve he stops again the youth descends his load discharged his errand done then bounded the courser away heavy and dark the eve the moon was hid on high a dim light only tinged the mist that crost her in the path of heaven all living sounds had ceased only the flow of waters near was heard a low and lulling melody fasting yet not of want percipient he on that mysterious steed had reached his resting place for expectation kept his nature up the flow of waters now awoke a feverish thirst led by the sound he moved to seek the grateful wave a meteor in the hazy air played before his path before him now it rolled a globe of livid fire and now contracted to a steady light as when the solitary hermit prunes his lamps long undulating flame and now its wavy point upblazing rose like a young cypresstree swayed by the heavy wind anon to thalaba it moved and wrapped him in its pale innocuous fire now in the darkness drowned left him with eyes bedimmed and now emerging spread the scene to sight led by the sound and meteorflame advanced the arab youth now to the nearest of the many rills he stoops ascending steam timely repels his hand for from its source it sprung a boiling tide a second course with better hap he tries the wave intensly cold tempts to a copious draught there was a virtue in the wave his limbs that stiff with toil dragged heavy from the copious draught received lightness and supple strength oerjoyed and deeming the benignant power who sent the reinless steed had blessed the healing waters to his use he laid him down to sleep lulled by the soothing and incessant sound the flow of many waters blending oft with shriller tones and deep low murmurings that from the fountain caves in mingled melody like faery music heard at midnight came the sounds that last he heard at night awoke his sense at morn a scene of wonders lay before his eyes in mazy windings oer the vale wandered a thousand streams they in their endless flow had channelled deep the rocky soil oer which they ran veining its thousand islet stones like clouds that freckle oer the summer sky the blue etherial ocean circling each and insulating all a thousand shapes they wore those islet stones and nature with her various tints varied anew their thousand forms for some were green with moss some rich with yellow lichens gold or ruddier tinged or grey or silverwhite or sparkling sparry radiance to the sun here gushed the fountains up alternate light and blackness like the play of sunbeams on the warriors burnished arms yonder the river rolled whose bed their labyrinthine lingerings oer received the confluent rills this was a wild and wonderous scene strange and beautiful as where by otontala like a sea of stars the hundred sources of hoangho burst high mountains closed the vale bare rocky mountains to all living things inhospitable on whose sides no herb rooted no insect fed no bird awoke their echoes save the eagle strong of wing a lonely plunderer that afar sought in the vales his prey thither towards those mountains thalaba advanced for well he weened that there had fate destined the adventures end up a wide vale winding amid their depths a stony vale between receding heights of stone he wound his way a cheerless place the solitary bee whose buzzing was the only sound of life flew there on restless wing seeking in vain one blossom where to fix still thalaba holds on the winding vale now narrows on his way and steeper of ascent rightward and leftward rise the rocks and now they meet across the vale was it the toil of human hands that hewed a passage in the rock thro whose rude portalway the light of heaven was seen rude and low the portalway beyond the same ascending straits went winding up the wilds still a bare silent solitary glen a fearful silence and a solitude that made itself be felt and steeper now the ascent a rugged path that tired the straining muscles toiling slowly up at length again a rock stretched oer the narrow vale there also was a portal hewn but gates of massy iron barred the way huge solid heavyhinged there hung a horn beside the gate ivorytipt and brazen mouthed he took the ivory tip and thro the brazen mouth he breathed from rock to rock rebounding rung the blast like a long thunder peal the gates of iron by no human arm unfolded turning on their hinges slow disclosed the passage of the rock he entered and the iron gates fell to and closed him in it was a narrow winding way dim lamps suspended from the vault lent to the gloom an agitated light winding it pierced the rock a long descending path by gates of iron closed there also hung the horn beside of ivory tip and brazen mouth again he took the ivory tip and gave the brazen mouth his voice again not now in thunder spake the horn but poured a sweet and thrilling melody the gates flew open and a flood of light rushed on his dazzled eyes was it to earthly eden lost so long the youth had found the wonderous way but earthly eden boasts no terraced palaces no rich pavilions bright with woven gold like these that in the vale rise amid odorous groves the astonished thalaba doubting as tho an unsubstantial dream beguiled his passive sense a moment closed his eyes still they were there the palaces and groves and rich pavilions glittering golden light and lo a man reverend in comely age advancing meets the youth favoured of fortune he exclaimed go taste the joys of paradise the reinless steed that ranges oer the world brings hither those alone for lofty deeds marked by their horoscope permitted here a foretaste of the full beatitude that in heroic acts they may go on more ardent eager to return and reap endless enjoyment here their destined meed favoured of fortune thou go taste the joys of paradise this said he turned away and left the youth in wonder mute for thalaba stood mute and passively received the mingled joy that flowed on every sense whereer his eye could reach fair structures rain bowhued arose and rich pavilions thro the opening woods gleamed from their waving curtains sunny gold and winding thro the verdant vale flowed streams of liquid light and fluted cypresses reared up their living obelisks and broadleaved zennars in long colonades oerarched delightful walks where round their trunks the thousandtendrild vine wound up and hung the bows with greener wreaths and clusters not their own wearied with endless beauty did his eyes return for rest beside him teems the earth with tulips like the ruddy evening streaked and here the lily hangs her head of snow and here amid her sable cup shines the red eyespot like one brightest star the solitary twinkler of the night and here the rose expands her paradise of leaves then on his ear what sounds of harmony arose far music and the distancemellowed song from bowers of merriment the waterfall remote the murmuring of the leafy groves the single nightingale perched in the rosier by so richly toned that never from that most melodious bird singing a lovesong to his brooding mate did thracian shepherd by the grave of orpheus hear a sweeter song tho there the spirit of the sepulchre all his own power infuse to swell the incense that he loves and oh what odours the voluptuous vale scatters from jasmine bowers from yon rose wilderness from clustered henna and from orange groves that with such perfumes fill the breeze as peris to their sister bear when from the summit of some lofty tree she hangs encaged the captive of the dives they from their pinions shake the sweetness of celestial flowers and as her enemies impure from that impervious poison far away fly groaning with the torment she the while inhales her fragrant food such odours flowed upon the world when at mohammeds nuptials word went forth in heaven to roll the everlasting gates of paradise back on their living hinges that its gales might visit all below the general bliss thrilled every bosom and the family of man for once partook one common joy full of the joy yet still awake to wonder on went thalaba on every side the song of mirth the music of festivity invite the passing youth wearied at length with hunger and with heat he enters in a banquet room where round a fountain brink on silken carpets sate the festive train instant thro all his frame delightful coolness spread the playing fount refreshed the agitated air the very light came cooled thro silvering panes of pearly shell like the pale moonbeam tinged or where the winevase filled the aperture rosy as rising morn or softer gleam of saffron like the sunny evening mist thro every hue and streaked by all the flowing fountain played around the wateredge vessels of wine alternate placed ruby and amber tinged its little waves from golden goblets there the guests sate quaffing the delicious juice of shiraz golden grape but thalaba took not the draught for rightly he knew had the prophet forbidden that beverage the mother of sins nor did the urgent guests proffer a second time the liquid fire for in the youths strong eye they saw no moveable resolve yet not uncourteous thalaba drank the cool draught of innocence that fragrant from its dewy vase came purer than it left its native bed and he partook the odorous fruits for all rich fruits were there watermelons rough of rind whose pulp the thirsty lip dissolved into a draught pistachios from the heavyclustered trees of malavert or halebs fertile soil and casbins luscious grapes of amber hue that many a week endure the summer sun intense till by its powerful fire all watery particles exhaled alone the strong essential sweetness ripens there here cased in ice the apricot a topaz crystalset here on a plate of snow the sunny orange rests and still the aloes and the sandalwood from golden censers oer the banquet room diffuse their dying sweets anon a troop of females formed the dance their ancles bound with braceletbells that made the modulating harmony transparent garments to the greedy eye gave all their harlot limbs that writhed in each immodest gesture skilled with earnest eyes the banqueters fed on the sight impure and thalaba he gazed but in his heart he bore a talisman whose blessed alchemy to virtuous thoughts refined the loose suggestions of the scene impure oneizas image swam before his sight his own arabian maid he rose and from the banquet room he rushed and tears ran down his burning cheek and nature for a moment woke the thought and murmured that from all domestic joys estranged he wandered oer the world a lonely being far from all he loved son of hodeirah not among thy crimes that murmur shall be written from tents of revelry from festal bowers to solitude he ran and now he reached where all the rills of that wellwatered garden in one tide rolled their collected waves a straight and stately bridge stretched its long arches oer the ample stream strong in the evening and distinct its shade lay on the watry mirror and his eye saw it united with its parent pile one huge fantastic fabric drawing near loud from the chambers of the bridge below sounds of carousal came and song and unveiled women bade the advancing youth come merrymake with them unhearing or unheeding thalaba past oer with hurried pace and plunged amid the forest solitude deserts of araby his soul returned to you he cast himself upon the earth and closed his eyes and called the voluntary vision up a cry as of distress aroused him loud it came and near he started up he strung his bow he plucked the arrow forth again a shriek a womans shriek and lo she rushes thro the trees her veil all rent her garments torn he follows close the ravisher even on the unechoing grass she hears his tread so close prophet save me save me god help help she cried to thalaba thalaba drew the bow the unerring arrow did its work of death he turned him to the woman and beheld his own oneiza his arabian maid the seventh book thalaba the destroyer the seventh book from fear amazement joy at length the arabian maid recovering speech threw around thalaba her arms and cried my father o my father thalaba in wonder lost yet fearful to enquire bent down his cheek on hers and their tears mingled as they fell oneiza at night they seized me thalaba in my sleep thou wert not near and yet when in their grasp i woke my shriek of terror called on thee my father could not save me an old man and they were strong and many o my god the hearts they must have had to hear his prayers and yet to leave him childless thalaba we will seek him we will return to araby oneiza alas we should not find him thalaba our tent is desolate the wind hath heaped the sands within its door the lizards track is left fresh on the untrodden dust prowling by night the tyger as he passes hears no breath of man and turns to search its solitude alas he strays a wretched wanderer seeking his child old man he will not rest he can not rest his sleep is misery his dreams are of my wretchedness my wrongs o thalaba this is a wicked place let us be gone thalaba but how to pass again the iron doors that opening at a breath gave easy entrance armies in their strength would fail to move those hinges for return oneiza but we can climb the mountains that shut in this dreadful garden thalaba are oneizas limbs equal to that long toil oneiza oh i am strong dear thalaba for this fear gives me force and you are with me so she took his hand and gently drew him forward and they went towards the mountain chain it was broad moonlight and obscure or lost the garden beauties lay but the great boundary rose distinctly marked these were no little hills no sloping uplands lifting to the sun their vineyards with fresh verdure and the shade of ancient woods courting the loiterer to win the easy ascent stone mountains these desolate rock on rock the burthens of the earth whose snowy summits met the morning beam when night was in the vale whose feet were fixed in the worlds foundations thalaba surveyed the heights precipitous impending crags rocks unascendible and summits that had tired the eagles wing there is no way he cried paler oneiza grew and hung upon his arm a feebler weight but soon again to hope revives the arabian maid as thalaba imparts the sudden thought i past a river cried the youth a full and copious stream the flowing waters can not be restrained and where they find or force their way there we perchance may follow thitherward the current rolled along so saying yet again in hope quickening their eager steps they turned them thitherward silent and calm the river rolled along and at the verge arrived of that fair garden oer a rocky bed towards the mountain base still full and silent held its even way but the deep sound the dash louder and louder in the distance rose as if it forced its stream struggling with crags along a narrow pass and lo where raving oer a hollow course the everflowing tide foams in a thousand whirlpools there adown the perforated rock plunge the whole waters so precipitous so fathomless a fall that their earthshaking roar came deadened up like subterranean thunders allah save us oneiza cried there is no path for man from this accursed place and as she spake her joints were loosened and her knees sunk under her cheer up oneiza thalaba replied be of good heart we can not fly the dangers of the place but we can conquer them and the young arabs soul arose within him what is he he cried who has prepared this garden of delight and wherefore are its snares the arabian maid replied the women when i entered welcomed me to paradise by aloadins will chosen like themselves a houri of the earth they told me credulous of his blasphemies that aloadin placed them to reward his faithful servants with the joys of heaven o thalaba and all are ready here to wreak his wicked will and work all crimes how then shall we escape woe to him cried the appointed a stern smile darkening with stronger shades his countenance woe to him he hath laid his toils to take the antelope the lion is come in she shook her head a sorcerer he and guarded by so many thalaba and thou but one he raised his hand to heaven is there not god oneiza i have a talisman that whoso bears him nor the earthly nor the infernal powers of evil can cast down remember destiny hath marked me from mankind now rest in faith and i will guard thy sleep so on a violet bank the arabian maid lay down her soft cheek pillowed upon moss and flowers she lay in silent prayer till prayer had tranquillized her fears and sleep fell on her by her side silent sate thalaba and gazed upon the maid and as he gazed drew in new courage and intenser faith and waited calmly for the eventful day loud sung the lark the awakened maid beheld him twinkling in the morning light and wished for wings and liberty like his the flush of fear inflamed her cheek but thalaba was calm of soul collected for the work he pondered in his mind how from lobabas breast his blunted arrow fell aloadin too might wear spell perchance of equal power to blunt the weapons edge beside the riverbrink rose a young poplar whose unsteady leaves varying their verdure to the gale with silver glitter caught his meditating eye then to oneiza turned the youth and gave his fathers bow and oer her shoulders slung the quiver arrowstored me other weapon suits said he bear thou the bow dear maid the days return upon me when these shafts true to thy guidance from the lofty palm brought down the cluster and thy gladdened eye exulting turned to seek the voice of praise oh yet again oneiza we shall share our desert joys so saying to the bank he moved and stooping low with double grasp hand below hand he clenched and from its watry soil uptore the poplar trunk then off he shook the clotted earth and broke away the head and boughs and lesser roots and lifting it aloft wielded with able sway the massy club now for this child of hell quoth thalaba belike he shall exchange to day his dainty paradise for other dwelling and the fruit of zaccoum cursed tree with that the youth and arab maid towards the garden centre past it chanced that aloadin had convoked the gardenhabitants and with the assembled throng oneiza mingled and the appointed youth unmarked they mingled or if one with busier finger to his neighbour notes the quivered maid haply he says some daughter of the homerites or one who yet remembers with delight her native tents of himiar nay rejoins his comrade a lovepageant for the man mimics with that fierce eye and knotty club some savage liontamer she forsooth must play the heroine of the years of old radiant with gems upon his throne of gold aloadin sate oer the sorcerers head hovered a bird and in the fragrant air waved his winnowing wings a living canopy large as the plumeless cassowar was that oershadowing bird so huge his talons in their grasp the eagle would have hung a helpless prey his beak was iron and his plumes glittered like burnished gold and his eyes glowed as tho an inward fire shone thro a diamond orb the blinded multitude adored the sorcerer and bent the knee before him and shouted out his praise mighty art thou the bestower of joy the lord of paradise aloadin waved his hand in idolizing reverence moveless they stood and mute children of earth he cried whom i have guided here by easier passage than the gate of death the infidel sultan to whose lands my mountains reach their roots blasphemes and threatens me strong are his armies many are his guards yet may a dagger find him children of earth i tempt you not with the vain promise of a bliss unseen with tales of a hereafter heaven whence never traveller hath returned have ye not tasted of the cup of joy that in these groves of happiness for ever overmantling tempts the everthirsty lip who is there here that by a deed of danger will deserve the eternal joys of actual paradise i thalaba exclaimed and springing forward on the sorcerers head he dashed the knotty club he fell not tho the force shattered his skull nor flowed the blood for by some hellish talisman his life imprisoned still dwelt in the body the astonished crowd stand motionless with fear and wait immediate vengeance from the wrath of heaven and lo the bird the monster bird soars up then pounces down to seize on thalaba now oneiza bend the bow now draw the arrow home it fled the arrow from oneizas hand it pierced the monster bird it broke the talisman then darkness covered all earth shook heaven thundered and amid the yells of spirits accursed destroyed the paradise of sin at last the earth was still the yelling of the demons ceased opening the wreck and ruin to their sight the darkness rolled away alone in life amid the desolation and the dead stood the destroyer and the arabian maid they looked around the rocks were rent the path was open late by magic closed awestruck and silent down the stony glen they wound their thoughtful way amid the vale below tents rose and streamers played and javelins sparkled in the sun and multitudes encamped swarmed far as eye could follow oer the plain there in his war pavilion sate in council with his chiefs the sultan of the land before his presence there a captain led oneiza and the appointed youth obedient to our lords command said he we past towards the mountains and began the ascending strait when suddenly earth shook and darkness like the midnight fell around and fire and thunder came from heaven as tho the retribution day were come after the terror ceased and when with hearts somewhat assured again we ventured on this youth and woman met us on the way they told us that from aloadins haunt they came on whom the judgementstroke has fallen he and his sinful paradise at once destroyed by them the agents they of heaven therefore i brought them hither to repeat the tale before thy presence that as search shall prove it false or faithful to their merit thou mayest reward them be it done to us thalaba answered as the truth shall prove the sultan while he spake fixed on him the proud eye of sovereignty if thou hast played with us by allah and by ali death shall seal the lying lips for ever if the thing be as thou sayest it arab thou shalt stand next to ourself and hark the cry the lengthening cry the increasing shout of joyful multitudes breathless and panting to the tent the bearer of good tidings comes o sultan live for ever be thy foes like aloadin all the wrath of god hath smitten him joy at the welcome tale shone in the sultans cheek array the arab in the robe of honour he exclaimed and place a chain of gold around his neck and bind around his brow the diadem and mount him on my steed of state and lead him thro the camp and let the heralds go before and cry thus shall the sultan reward the man who serves him well then in the purple robe they vested thalaba and hung around his neck the golden chain and bound his forehead with the diadem and on the royal steed they led him thro the camp and heralds went before and cried thus shall the sultan reward the man who serves him well when from the pomp of triumph and presence of the king thalaba sought the tent allotted him thoughtful the arabian maid beheld his animated eye his cheek inflamed with pride oneiza cried the youth the king hath done according to his word and made me in the land next to himself be named but why that serious melancholy smile oneiza when i heard the voice that gave me honour and wealth and fame the instant thought arose to fill my joy that thou wouldest hear the tidings and be happy oneiza thalaba thou wouldest not have me mirthful am i not an orphan among strangers thalaba but with me oneiza my father thalaba nay be comforted last night to what wert thou exposed in what a peril the morning found us safety honour wealth these now are ours this instant who thou wert the sultan asked i told him from our childhood we had been plighted was i wrong oneiza and when he said with bounties he would heap our nuptials wilt thou blame me if i blest his will that bade me fix the marriage day in tears oneiza oneiza remember destiny hath marked thee from mankind thalaba perhaps when aloadin was destroyed the mission ceased else would wise providence with its rewards and blessings strew my path thus for accomplished service oneiza thalaba thalaba or if haply not yet whither should i go is it not prudent to abide in peace till i am summoned oneiza take me to the deserts thalaba but moath is not there and wouldest thou dwell in a strangers tent thy father then might seek in long and fruitless wandering for his child oneiza take me then to mecca there let me dwell a servant of the temple bind thou thyself my veil to human eye it never shall be lifted there whilst thou shalt go upon thine enterprize my prayers dear thalaba shall rise to succour thee and i shall live if not in happiness surely in hope thalaba oh think of better things the will of heaven is plain by wonderous ways it led us here and soon the common voice shall tell what we have done and how we dwell under the shadow of the sultans wing so shall thy father hear the fame and find us what he hath wished us ever still in tears still that unwilling eye nay nay oneiza has then another since i left the tent oneiza thalaba thalaba with song with music and with dance the bridal pomp proceeds following on the veiled bride fifty female slaves attend in costly robes that gleam with interwoven gold and sparkle far with gems an hundred slaves behind them bear vessels of silver and vessels of gold and many a gorgeous garment gay the presents that the sultan gave on either hand the pages go with torches flaring thro the gloom and trump and timbrel merriment accompanies their way and multitudes with loud acclaim shout blessings on the bride and now they reach the palace pile the palace home of thalaba and now the marriage feast is spread and from the finished banquet now the wedding guests are gone who comes from the bridal chamber it is azrael the angel of death the eighth book thalaba the destroyer the eighth book woman go not among the tombs old man there is a madman there old man will he harm me if i go woman not he poor miserable man but tis a wretched sight to see his utter wretchedness for all day long he lies on a grave and never is he seen to weep and never is he heard to groan nor ever at the hour of prayer bends his knee nor moves his lips i have taken him food for charity and never a word he spake but yet so ghastly he looked that i have awakened at night with the dream of his ghastly eyes now go not among the tombs old man old man wherefore has the wrath of god so sorely stricken him woman he came a stranger to the land and did good service to the sultan and well his service was rewarded the sultan named him next himself and gave a palace for his dwelling and dowered his bride with rich domains but on his wedding night there came the angel of death since that hour a man distracted among the sepulchres he wanders the sultan when he heard the tale said that for some untold crime judgement thus had stricken him and asking heaven forgiveness that he had shewn him favour abandoned him to want old man a stranger did you say woman an arab born like you but go not among the tombs for the sight of his wretchedness might make a hard heart ache old man nay nay i never yet have shunned a countryman in distress and the sound of his dear native tongue may be like the voice of a friend then to the sepulchre the woman pointed out old moath bent his way by the tomb lay thalaba in the light of the setting eve the sun and the wind and the rain had rusted his raven locks his checks were fallen in his face bones prominent by the tomb he lay along and his lean fingers played unwitting with the grass that grew beside the old man knew him not and drawing near him cried countryman peace be with thee the sound of his dear native tongue awakened thalaba he raised his countenance and saw the good old man and he arose and fell upon his neck and groaned in bitterness then moath knew the youth and feared that he was childless and he turned his eyes and pointed to the tomb old man cried thalaba thy search is ended there the fathers cheek grew white and his lip quivered with the misery howbeit collecting with a painful voice he answered god is good his will be done the woe in which he spake the resignation that inspired his speech they softened thalaba thou hast a solace in thy grief he cried a comforter within moath thou seest me here delivered to the evil powers a godabandoned wretch the old man looked at him incredulous nightly the youth pursued thy daughter comes to drive me to despair moath thou thinkest me mad but when the cryer from the minaret proclaims the midnight hour hast thou a heart to see her in the meidan now the clang of clarions and of drums accompanied the suns descent dost thou not pray my son said moath as he saw the white flag waving on the neighbouring mosque then thalabas eye grew wild pray echoed he i must not pray and the hollow groan he gave went to the old mans heart and bowing down his face to earth in fervent agony he called on god a night of darkness and of storms into the chamber of the tomb thalaba led the old man to roof him from the rain a night of storms the wind swept thro the moonless sky and moaned among the pillared sepulchres and in the pauses of its sweep they heard the heavy rain beat on the monument above in silence on oneizas grave the father and the husband sate the cryer from the minaret proclaimed the midnight hour now now cried thalaba and oer the chamber of the tomb there spread a lurid gleam like the reflection of a sulphur fire and in that hideous light oneiza stood before them it was she her very lineaments and such as death had changed them livid cheeks and lips of blue but in her eyes there dwelt brightness more terrible than all the loathsomeness of death still art thou living wretch in hollow tones she cried to thalaba and must i nightly leave my grave to tell thee still in vain god has abandoned thee this is not she the old man exclaimed a fiend a manifest fiend and to the youth he held his lance strike and deliver thyself strike her cried thalaba and palsied of all powers gazed fixedly upon the dreadful form yea strike her cried a voice whose tones flowed with such sudden healing thro his soul as when the desert shower from death delivered him but unobedient to that wellknown voice his eye was seeking it when moath firm of heart performed the bidding thro the vampire corpse he thrust his lance it fell and howling with the wound its demon tenant fled a sapphire light fell on them and garmented with glory in their sight oneizas spirit stood o thalaba she cried abandon not thyself wouldst thou for ever lose me go fulfill thy quest that in the bowers of paradise in vain i may not wait thee o my husband to moath then the spirit turned the dark lustre of her angel eyes short is thy destined path o my dear father to the abode of bliss return to araby there with the thought of death comfort thy lonely age and azrael the deliverer soon shall visit thee in peace they stood with earnest eyes and arms outreaching when again the darkness closed around them the soul of thalaba revived he from the floor the quiver took and as he bent the bow exclaimed was it the overruling providence that in the hour of frenzy led my hands instinctively to this tomorrow and the sun shall brace anew the slackened cord that now sounds loose and damp tomorrow and its livelier tone will sing in tort vibration to the arrows flight i but i also with recovered health of heart shall do my duty my father here i leave thee then he cried and not to meet again till at the gate of paradise the eternal union of our joys commence we parted last in darkness and the youth thought with what other hopes but now his heart was calm for on his soul a heavenly hope had dawned the old man answered nothing but he held his garment and to the door of the tomb chamber followed him the rain had ceased the sky was wild its black clouds broken by the storm and lo it chanced that in the chasm of heaven between a star leaving along its path continuous light shot eastward see my guide quoth thalaba and turning he received old moaths last embrace and his last blessing it was eve when an old dervise sitting in the sun at his cell door invited for the night the traveller in the sun he spread the plain repast rice and fresh grapes and at their feet there flowed the brook of which they drank so as they sate at meal with song with music and with dance a wedding train went by the veiled bride the female slaves the torches of festivity and trump and timbrel merriment accompanied their way the good old dervise gave a blessing as they past but thalaba looked on and breathed a low deep groan and hid his face the dervise had known sorrow and he felt compassion and his words of pity and of piety opened the young mans heart and he told all his tale repine not o my son the old man replied that heaven has chastened thee behold this vine i found it a wild tree whose wanton strength had swoln into irregular twigs and bold excrescencies and spent itself in leaves and little rings in the vain flourish of its outwardness wasting the sap and strength that should have given forth fruit but when i pruned the tree then it grew temperate in its vain expence of useless leaves and knotted as thou seest into these full clear clusters to repay the hand whose foresight wounded it repine not o my son in wisdom and in mercy heaven inflicts like a wise leech its painful remedies then pausing whither goest thou now he asked i know not answered thalaba straight on with destiny my guide quoth the old man i will not blame thy trust and yet methinks thy feet should tread with certainty in kaf the simorg hath his dwelling place the allknowing bird of ages who hath seen the world with all her children thrice destroyed long is the thither path and difficult the way of danger full but his unerring voice could point to certain end thy weary search easy assent the youth gave to the words of wisdom and behold at dawn the adventurer on his way to kaf and he has travelled many a day and many a river swum over and many a mountain ridge has crost and many a measureless plain and now amid the wilds advanced long is it since his eyes have seen the trace of man cold cold tis a chilly clime that the toil of the youth has reached and he is aweary now and faint for the lack of food cold cold there is no sun in heaven but a heavy and uniform cloud and the snows begin to fall dost thou wish for thy deserts o son of hodeirah dost thou long for the gales of arabia cold cold his blood flows languid his hands are red his lips are blue his feet are sore with the frost cheer thee cheer thee thalaba a little yet bear up all waste no sign of life but the track of the wolf and the bear no sound but the wild wild wind and the snow crunching under his feet night is come no moon no stars only the light of the snow but behold a fire in the cave of the hill a heartreviving fire and thither with strength renewed thalaba presses on he found a woman in the cave a solitary woman who by the fire was spinning and singing as she spun the pine boughs they blazed chearfully and her face was bright with the flame her face was as a damsels face and yet her hair was grey she bade him welcome with a smile and still continued spinning and singing as she spun the thread the woman drew was finer than the silkworms was finer than the gossamer the song she sung was low and sweet and thalaba knew not the words he laid his bow before the hearth for the string was frozen stiff he took the quiver from his neck for the arrow plumes were iced then as the chearful fire revived his languid limbs the adventurer asked for food the woman answered him and still her speech was song the she bear she dwells near to me and she hath cubs one two and three she hunts the deer and brings him here and then with her i make good cheer and she to the chase is gone and she will be here anon she ceased from her work as she spake and when she had answered him again her fingers twirled the thread and again the woman began in low sweet tones to sing the unintelligible song the thread she spun it gleamed like gold in the light of the odorous fire and yet so wonderous thin that save when the light shone on it it could not be seen by the eye the youth sate watching it and she beheld his wonder and then again she spake to him and still her speech was song now twine it round thy hands i say now twine it round thy hands i pray my thread is small my thread is fine but he must be a stronger than thee who can break this thread of mine and up she raised her bright blue eyes and sweetly she smiled on him and he conceived no ill and round and round his right hand and round and round his left he wound the thread so fine and then again the woman spake and still her speech was song now thy strength o stranger strain now then break the slender chain thalaba strove but the thread was woven by magic hands and in his cheek the flush of shame arose commixt with fear she beheld and laughed at him and then again she sung my thread is small my thread is fine but he must be a stronger than thee who can break this thread of mine and up she raised her bright blue eyes and fiercely she smiled on him i thank thee i thank thee hodeirahs son i thank thee for doing what cant be undone for binding thyself in the chain i have spun then from his head she wrenched a lock of his raven hair and cast it in the fire and cried aloud as it burnt sister sister hear my voice sister sister come and rejoice the web is spun the prize is won the work is done for i have made captive hoderiahs son borne in her magic car the sister sorceress came khawla the fiercest of the sorcerer brood she gazed upon the youth she bade him break the slender thread she laughed aloud for scorn she clapt her hands for joy the she bear from the chase came in she bore the prey in her bloody mouth she laid it at maimunas feet and she looked up with wistful eyes as if to ask her share there there quoth maimuna and pointing to the prisoner youth she spurned him with her foot and bade her make her meal but soon their mockery failed them and anger and shame arose for the she bear fawned on thalaba and quietly licked his hand the grey haired sorceress stamped the ground and called a spirit up shall we bear the enemy to the dungeon dens below spirit woe woe to our empire woe if ever he tread the caverns below maimuna shall we leave him fettered here with hunger and cold to die spirit away from thy lonely dwelling fly here i see a danger nigh that he should live and thou shouldst die maimuna whither must we bear the foe spirit to moharebs island go there shalt thou secure the foe there prevent thy future woe then in the car they threw the fettered thalaba and took their seats and set their feet upon his neck maimuna held the reins and khawla shook the scourge and away away away they were no steeds of mortal race that drew the magic car with the swiftness of feet and of wings the snowdust rises behind them the icerocks splinters fly and hark in the valley below the sound of their chariot wheels and they are far over the mountains away away away the demons of the air shout their joy as the sisters pass the ghosts of the wicked that wander by night flit over the magic car away away away over the hills and the plains over the rivers and rocks over the sands of the shore the waves of ocean heave under the magic steeds with unwet hoofs they trample the deep and now they reach the island coast and away to the city the monarchs abode open fly the city gates open fly the iron doors the doors of the palace court then stopt the charmed car the monarch heard the chariot wheels and forth he came to greet the mistress whom he served he knew the captive youth and thalaba beheld mohareb in the robes of royalty whom erst his arm had thrust down the bitumen pit the ninth book thalaba the destroyer the ninth book go up my sister maimuna go up and read the stars lo on the terrace of the topmost tower she stands her darkening eyes her fine face raised to heaven her white hair flowing like the silver streams that streak the northern night they hear her coming tread they lift their asking eyes her face is serious her unwilling lips slow to the tale of ill what hast thou read what hast thou read quoth khawla in alarm danger death judgement maimuna replied is that the language of the lights of heaven exclaimed the sterner witch creatures of allah they perform his will and with their lying menaces would daunt our credulous folly maimuna i never liked this uncongenial lore better befits to make the sacrifice of divination so shall i be mine own oracle command the victims thou o king male and female they must be thou knowest the needful rites meanwhile i purify the place the sultan went the sorceress rose and north and south and east and west she faced the points of heaven and ever where she turned she laid her hand upon the wall and up she looked and smote the air and down she stooped and smote the floor to eblis and his servants i consecrate the place let none intrude but they whatever hath the breath of life whatever hath the sap of life let it be blasted and die now all is prepared mohareb returns the circle is drawn the victims have bled the youth and the maid she in the circle holds in either hand clenched by the hair a head the heads of the youth and the maid go out ye lights quoth khawla and in darkness began the spell with spreading arms she whirls around rapidly rapidly ever around and around and loudly she calls the while eblis eblis loudly incessantly still she calls eblis eblis giddily giddily still she whirls loudly incessantly still she calls the motion is ever the same ever around and around the calling is still the same still it is eblis eblis and her voice is a shapeless yell and dizzily rolls her brain and now she is full of the fiend she stops she rocks she reels look look she appears in the darkness her flamy hairs curl up all living like the meteors locks of light her eyes are like the sickly moon it is her lips that move her tongue that shapes the sound but whose is the voice that proceeds ye may hope and ye may fear the danger of his stars is near sultan if he perish woe fate has written one deathblow for mohareb and the foe triumph triumph only she that knit his bonds can set him free she spake the oracle and senselessly she fell they knelt in care beside her her sister and the king they sprinkled her palms with water they wetted her nostrils with blood she wakes as from a dream she asks the uttered voice but when she heard an anger and a grief darkened her wrinkling brow then let him live in long captivity she answered but moharebs quickened eye perused her sullen countenance that lied not with the lips a miserable man what boots it that in central caves the powers of evil at his baptism pledged the sacrament of hell his death secures them now what boots it that they gave abdaldars guardian ring when thro anothers life the blow may reach his own he sought the dungeon cell where thalaba was laid twas the grey morning twilight and the voice of thalaba in prayer with words of hallowed import smote the kings alarmed sense the grating of the heavy hinge roused not the arabian youth nor lifted he his earthward face at sound of coming feet nor did mohareb with unholy voice disturb the duty silent spiritawed envious hearthumbled he beheld the dungeonpeace of piety till thalaba the perfect rite performed raised his calm eye then spake the islandchief arab my guidance thro the dangerous cave thy service overpaid an unintended friend in enmity the hand that caught thy ring received and bore me to the scene i sought now know me grateful i return that amulet thy only safety here artful he spake with show of gratitude veiling the selfish deed locked in the magic chain the powerless hand of thalaba received again the spell remembering then with what an ominous faith first he drew on the gem the youth repeats his words of augury in gods name and the prophets be its power good let it serve the holy if for evil god and my faith shall hallow it blindly the wicked work the righteous will of heaven so thalaba received again the written ring of gold thoughtful awhile mohareb stood and eyed the captive youth then building skilfully the sophist speech thus he began brave art thou thalaba and wherefore are we foes for i would buy thy friendship at a princely price and make thee to thine own welfare wise hear me in nature are two hostile gods makers and masters of existing things equal in power nay hear me patiently equal for look around thee the same earth bears fruit and poison where the camel finds his fragrant food the horned viper there sucks in the juice of death the elements now serve the use of man and now assert dominion oer his weakness dost thou hear the sound of merriment and nuptial song from the next house proceeds the mourners cry lamenting oer the dead sayest thou that sin entered the world of allah that the fiend permitted for a season prowls for prey when to thy tent the venomous serpent creeps dost thou not crush the reptile even so besure had allah crushed his enemy but that the power was wanting from the first eternal as themselves their warfare is to the end it must endure evil and good what are they thalaba but words in the strife of angels as of men the weak are guilty power must decide the spirits of the dead quitting their mortal mansion enter not as falsely ye are preached their final seat of bliss or bale nor in the sepulchre sleep they the long long sleep each joins the host of his great leader aiding in the war whose fate involves his own woe to the vanquished then woe to the sons of man who followed him they with their leader thro eternity must howl in central fires thou thalaba hast chosen ill thy part if choice it may be called where will was not nor searching doubt nor judgement wise to weigh hard is the service of the power beneath whose banners thou wert born his discipline severe yea cruel and his wages rich only in promise who has seen the pay for us the pleasures of the world are ours riches and rule the kingdoms of the earth we met in babylon adventurers both each zealous for the hostile power he served we meet again thou feelest what thou art thou seest what i am the sultan here the lord of life and death abandon him who has abandoned thee and be as i am great among mankind the captive did not hasty to confute break of that subtle speech but when the expectant silence of the king looked for his answer then spake thalaba and this then is thy faith this monstrous creed this lie against the sun and moon and stars and earth and heaven blind man who canst not see how all things work the best who wilt not know that in the manhood of the world whateer of folly marked its infancy of vice sullied its youth ripe wisdom shall cast off stablished in good and knowing evil safe sultan mohareb yes ye have me here in chains but not forsaken tho opprest cast down but not destroyed shall danger daunt shall death dismay his soul whose life is given for god and for his brethren of mankind alike rewarded in that noble cause the conquerors and the martyrs palm above beam with one glory hope ye that my blood can quench the dreaded flame and know ye not that leagued against you are the just and wise and all good actions of all ages past yea your own crimes and truth and god in heaven slave quoth mohareb and his lips quivered with eager wrath i have thee thou shalt feel my power and in thy dungeon loathsomeness rot piecemeal limb from limb and out the tyrant rushes and all impatient of the thoughts that cankered in his heart seeks in the giddiness of boisterous sport short respite from the avenging power within what woman is she so wrinkled and old that goes to the wood she leans on her staff with a tottering step she tells her beadstrings slow thro fingers dulled by age the wanton boys bemock her the babe in arms that meets her turns round with quick affright and clings to his nurses neck hark hark the hunters cry mohareb gone to the chase the dogs with eager yell are struggling to be free the hawks in frequent stoop token their haste for flight and couchant on the saddlebow with tranquil eyes and talons sheathed the ounce expects his liberty propt on the staff that shakes beneath her trembling weight the old woman sees them pass halloa halloa the game is up the dogs are loosed the deer bounds over the plain the lagging dogs behind follow from afar but lo the falcon oer his head hovers with hostile wings and buffets him with blinding strokes dizzy with the deafening strokes in blind and interrupted course poor beast be struggles on and now the dogs are nigh how his heart pants you see the panting of his heart and tears like human tears roll down along the big veins feverswoln and now the deathsweat darkens his dun hide his fear his groans his agony his death are the sport and the joy and the triumph halloa another prey the nimble antelope the ounce is freed one spring and his talons are sheathed in her shoulders and his teeth are red in her gore there came a sound from the wood like the howl of the winter wind at night around a lonely dwelling the ounce whose gums were warm in his prey he hears the summoning sound in vain his masters voice no longer dreaded now calls and recalls with threatful tone away to the forest he goes for that old woman had laid her shrivelled finger on her shrivelled lips and whistled with a long long breath and that long breath was the sound like the howl of the winter wind at night around a lonely dwelling mohareb knew her not as to the chase he went the glance of his proud eye passing in scorn oer age and wretchedness she stands in the depth of the wood and panting to her feet fawning and fearful creeps the charmed ounce well mayst thou fear and vainly dost thou fawn her form is changed her visage new her power her heart the same it is khawla that stands in the wood she knew the place where the mandrake grew and round the neck of the ounce and round the mandrakes head she tightens the ends of her cord her ears are closed with wax and her prest finger fastens them deaf as the adder when with grounded head and circled form her avenues of sound barred safely one slant eye watches the charmers lips waste on the wind his baffled witchery the spotted ounce so beautiful springs forceful from the scourge the dying plant all agony feeling its lifestrings crack uttered the unimaginable groan that none can hear and live then from her victim servant khawla loosed the precious poison next with naked hand she plucked the boughs of the manchineel then of the wormy wax she took that from the perforated tree forced out bewrayed its insectparents work within in a cavern of the wood she sits and moulds the wax to human form and as her fingers kneaded it by magic accents to the mystic shape imparted with the life of thalaba in all its passive powers mysterious sympathy with the mandrake and the manchineel she builds her pile accurst she lays her finger to the pile and blue and green the flesh glows with emitted fire a fire to kindle that strange fuel meet before the fire she placed the imaged wax there waste away the enchantress cried and with thee waste hodeirahs son fool fool go thaw the everlasting ice whose polar mountains bound the human reign blindly the wicked work the righteous will of heaven the doomed destroyer wears abdaldars ring against the danger of his horoscope yourselves have shielded him and on the sympathizing wax the unadmitted flames play powerlessly as the cold moonbeam on a plain of snow curse thee curse thee cried the fiendly woman hast thou yet a spell of safety and in the raging flames she cast the imaged wax it lay amid the flames like polycarp of old when by the glories of the burning stake oer vaulted his grey hairs curled lifelike to the fire that haloed round his saintly brow wherefore is this cried khawla and she stamped thrice on the cavern floor maimuna maimuna thrice on the floor she stamped then to the rocky gateway glanced her eager eyes and maimuna was there nay sister nay quoth she moharebs life is linked with thalabas nay sister nay the plighted oath the common sacrament idiot said khawla one must die or all faith kept with him were treason to the rest why lies the wax like marble in the fire what powerful amulet protects hodeirahs son cold marblecold the wax lay on the raging pile cold in that white intensity of fire the bat that with her hooked and leathery wings clung to the caveroof loosed her hold deathsickening with the heat the toad who to the darkest nook had crawled panted fast with fever pain the viper from her nest came forth leading her quickened brood who sportive with the warm delight rolled out their thin curls tender as the tendril rings ere the green beauty of their brittle youth grows brown and toughens in the summer sun cold marblecold the wax lay on the raging pile the silver quivering of the element oer its pale surface shedding a dim gloss amid the red and fiery smoke watching the strange portent the blueeyed sorceress and her sister stood seeming a ruined angel by the side of spirit born in hell at length raised maimuna her thoughtful eyes whence sister was the wax the work of the worm or the bee nay then i marvel not it were as wise to bring from ararat the foreworlds wood to build the magic pile and feed it from the balm bower thro whose veins the martyrs blood sends such a virtue out that the fond mother from beneath its shade wreathes the cerastes round her playful child this the eternal universal strife there is a gravewax i have seen the gouls fight for the dainty at their banquetting excellent witch quoth khawla and she went to the cave arch of entrance and scowled up mocking the blessed sun shine thou in heaven but i will shadow earth thou wilt not shorten day but i will hasten darkness then the witch began a magic song one long low tone thro teeth halfclosed thro lips slowmoving muttered slow one longcontinued breath till to her eyes a darker yellowness was driven and fuller swoln the prominent veins on her loose throat grew black then looking upward thrice she breathed into the face of heaven the baneful breath infected heaven a mildewing mist it spread darker and darker so the evening sun poured his unentering glory on the mist and it was night below bring now the wax quoth khawla for thou knowest the mine that yields it forth went maimuna in mist and darkness went the sorceress forth and she has reached the place of tombs and in their sepulchres the dead feel feet unholy trampling over them thou startest maimuna because the breeze is in thy lilted locks is khawlas spell so weak sudden came the breeze and strong the mist that in the labouring lungs was felt so heavy late flies now before the gale thin as an infants breath seen in the sunshine of an autumn frost sudden it came and soon its work was done and suddenly it ceased cloudless and calm it left the firmament and beautiful in the blue sky arose the summer moon she heard the quickened action of her blood she felt the fever in her cheeks daunted yet desperate in a tomb entering with impious hand she traced circles and squares and trines and magic characters till riven by her charms the grave yawned and disclosed its dead maimunas eyes were opened and she saw the secrets of the grave there sate a spirit in the vault in shape in hue in lineaments like life and by him couched as if intranced the hundredheaded worm that never dies nay sorceress not tonight the spirit cried the flesh in which i sinned may rest tonight from suffering all things even i tonight even the damned repose the flesh of maimuna crept on her bones with terror and her knees trembled with their trembling weight only this sabbath and at dawn the worm will wake and this poor flesh must grow to meet the gnawing of his hundred poisonmouths god god is there no mercy after death soulstruck she rushed away she fled the place of tombs she cast herself upon the earth all agony and tumult and despair and in that wild and desperate agony sure maimuna had died the utter death if aught of evil had been possible on this mysterious night for this was that most holy night when all created things know and adore the power that made them insects beasts and birds the waterdwellers herbs and trees and stones yea earth and ocean and the infinite heaven with all its worlds man only does not know the universal sabbath does not join with nature in her homage yet the prayer flows from the righteous with intenser love a holier calm succeeds and sweeter dreams visit the slumbers of the penitent therefore on maimuna the elements shed healing every breath she breathed was balm was not a flower but sent in incense up its richest odours and the song of birds now like the music of the seraphim entered her soul and now made silence aweful by their sudden pause it seemed as if the quiet moon poured quietness its lovely light was like the smile of reconciling heaven is it the dew of night that down her glowing cheek shines in the moonbeam oh she weeps she weeps and the good angel that abandoned her at her hellbaptism by her tears drawn down resumes his charge then maimuna recalled to mind the double oracle quick as the lightening flash its import glanced upon her and the hope of pardon and salvation rose as now she understood the lying prophecy of truth she pauses not she ponders not the driven air before her fanned the face of thalaba and he awoke and saw the sorceress of the silver locks one more permitted spell she takes the magic chain with the wide eye of wonder thalaba watches her snowy fingers round and round wind the loosening chain again he hears the low sweet voice the low sweet voice so musical that sure it was not strange if in those unintelligible tones was more than human potency that with such deep and undefined delight filled the surrendered soul the work is done the song is ceased he wakes as from a dream of paradise and feels his fetters gone and with the burst of wondering adoration praises god her charm has loosed the chain it bound but massy walls and iron gates confine hodeirahs son heard ye not genii of the air her spell that oer her face there flits the sudden flush of fear again her louder lips repeat the charm her eye is anxious her cheek pale her pulse plays fast and feeble nay maimuna thy power has ceased and the wind scatters now the voice that ruled it late pray for me thalaba she cried for death and judgement are at hand all night in agony she feared the instant blow of hells revenge at dawn the sound of gathering multitudes led to the prison bars her dreading eye what spectacle invites the growing multitude that torrentlike they roll along boys and greyheaded age the mother comes leading her child who at arms length outstripping her looks back and bids her hasten more why does the city pour her thousands forth what glorious pageantry makes her streets desolate and silences her empty dwellings comes the bridal pomp and have the purveyors of imperial lust torn from their parents arms again the virgin beauties of the land will elephants in gilded cages bear the imprisoned victims or may yet their eyes with a last look of liberty behold banners and guards and silkarched palanquins the long procession and the gorgeous pomp of their own sacrifice on the house tops and in the windows ranged face above face they wait the coming spectacle the trees are clustered and below the dust thro the thronged populace can find no way to rise he comes the sultan hark the swelling horn the trumpets spreading blair the timbrel tinkling as its silver bells twinkle aloft and the shrill cymbals sound whose broad brass flashes in the morning sun accordant light and music closing all the heavy gong is heard that falls like thunder on the dizzy ear on either hand the thickwedged crowd fall from the royal path recumbent in the palanquin he casts on the wide tumult of the waving throng a proud and idle eye now in his tent alighted he receives homage and worship the slave multitude with shouts of blasphemy adore him father of his people him their lord great king allwise allmighty and allgood whose smile was happiness whose frown was death their present deity with silken cords his slaves wave the silk fan that waving oer his head freshens the languid air others the while shower oer his robes the roses treasured sweets rich odours burn before him ambergrese sandal and aloe wood and thus inhaling the voluptuous air he sits to watch the agony to hear the groan of death at once all sounds are hushed all eyes take one direction for he comes the object he of this days festival of all this expectation and this joy the christian captive hark so silently they stand the clanking of his chain is heard and he has reached the place of suffering now and as the deathsmen round his ancles bind the cords and to the gibbet swing him up the priests begin their song the song of praise the hymn of glory to their devilgod then maimuna grew pale as thro the bars she saw the martyr pendant by the feet his gold locks hanging downwards and she cried this is my sisters deed o thalaba for us not for his faith the redhaired christian dies she wants the foam that in his agony last from his lips shall fall the deadliest poison that the devils know son of hodeirah thou and i shall prove its deadly force and lo the executioners begin and beat his belly with alternate blows and these are human that look on the very women that would shrink and shudder if they saw a worm crushed by the careless tread they clap their hands for joy and lift their children up to see the christian die convulsing nature with her tortures drunk ceases to suffer now his eyelids tremble his lips quake but like the quivering of a severed limb move no responsive pang now catch the exquisite poison for it froths his dying lips and khawla holds the bowl enough the island crimes had cried to heaven the measure of their guilt was full the hour of wrath was come the poison burst the bowl it fell upon the earth the sorceress shrieked and caught moharebs robe and called the whirlwind and away for lo from that accursed venom springs the upas tree of death the tenth book thalaba the destroyer the tenth book alone beside a rivulet it stands the upas tree of death thro barren banks the barren waters flow the fish that meets them in the unmingling sea floats poisoned on the waves tree grows not near nor bush nor flower nor herb the earth has lost its parent powers of life and the fresh dew of heaven that there descends steams in rank poison up before the appointed youth and maimuna saw the first struggle of the dying throng crash sunk their prison wall the whirlwind wrapt them round borne in the chariot of the winds ere there was time to fear their way was past and lo again they stand in the cavedwelling of the blueeyed witch then came the weakness of her natural age at once on maimuna the burthen of her years fell on her and she knew that her repentance in the sight of god had now found favour and her hour was come her death was like the righteous turn my face to mecca in her languid eyes the joy of certain hope lit a last lustre and in death the smile was on her cheek no faithful crowded round her bier no tongue reported her good deeds for her no mourners wailed and wept no iman oer her perfumed corpse for her souls health intoned the prayer no column raised by the way side implored the passing traveller to say a requiem for the dead thalaba laid her in the snow and took his weapons from the hearth and then once more the youth began his weary way of solitude the breath of the east is in his face and it drives the sleet and the snow the air is keen the wind is keen his limbs are aching with the cold his eyes are aching with the snow his very heart is cold his spirit chilled within him he looks on if ought of life be near but all is sky and the white wilderness and here and there a solitary pine its branches broken by the weight of snow his pains abate his senses dull with suffering cease to suffer languidly languidly thalaba drags along a heavy weight is on his lids his limbs move slow with heaviness and he full fain would sleep not yet not yet o thalaba thy hour of rest is come not yet may the destroyer sleep the comfortable sleep his journey is not over yet his course not yet fulfilled run thou thy race o thalaba the prize is at the goal it was a cedartree that woke him from the deadly drowsiness its broad roundspreading branches when they felt the snow rose upward in a point to heaven and standing in their strength erect defied the baffled storm he knew the lesson nature gave and he shook off his heaviness and hope revived within him now sunk the evening sun a broad red beamless orb adown the glowing sky thro the red light the snowflakes fell like fire louder grows the biting wind and it drifts the dust of the snow the snow is clotted in his hair the breath of thalaba is iced upon his lips he looks around the darkness the dizzy floating of the snow close in his narrow view at length thro the thick atmosphere a light not distant far appears he doubting other wiles of enmity with mingled joy and quicker step bends his way thitherward it was a little lowly dwelling place amid a garden whose delightful air felt mild and fragrant as the evening wind passing in summer oer the coffeegroves of yemen and its blessed bowers of balm a fount of fire that in the centre played rolled all around its wonderous rivulets and fed the garden with the heat of life every where magic the arabians heart yearned after human intercourse a light the door unclosed all silent he goes in there lay a damsel sleeping on a couch his step awoke her and she gazed at him with pleased and wondering look fearlessly like a yearling child too ignorant to fear with words of courtesy the young intruder spake at the sound of his voice a joy kindled her bright black eyes she rose and took his hand but at the touch the smile forsook her cheek oh it is cold she cried i thought i should have felt it warm like mine but thou art like the rest thalaba stood mute awhile and wondering at her words cold lady then he said i have travelled long in this cold wilderness till life is almost spent laila art thou a man then thalaba i did not think sorrow and toil could so have altered me that i seem otherwise laila and thou canst be warm sometimes lifewarm as i am thalaba surely lady as others are i am to heat and cold subject like all you see a traveller bound upon hard adventure who requests only to rest him here tonight tomorrow he will pursue his way laila oh not tomorrow not like a dream of joy depart so soon and whither wouldst thou go for all around is everlasting winter ice and snow deserts unpassable of endless frost thalaba he who has led me here will still sustain me thro cold and hunger hunger laila cried she clapt her lilly hands and whether from above or from below it came sight could not see so suddenly the floor was spread with food laila why dost thou watch with hesitating eyes the banquet tis for thee i bade it come thalaba whence came it laila matters it from whence it came my father sent it when i call he hears nay thou hast fabled with me and art like the forms that wait upon my solitude human to eye alone thy hunger would not question so idly else thalaba i will not eat it came by magic fool to think that aught but fraud and danger could await me here let loose my cloak laila begone then insolent why dost thou stand and gaze upon my face aye watch the features well that threaten thee with fraud and danger in the wilderness they shall avenge me in the hour of want rise on thy view and make thee feel how innocent i am and this remembered cowardice and insult with a more painful shame will burn thy cheek than now beats mine in anger thalaba mark me lady many and restless are my enemies my daily paths have been beset with snares till i have learnt suspicion bitter sufferings teaching the needful vice if i have wronged you and yours should be the face of innocence i pray you pardon me in the name of god and of his prophet i partake your food laila lo now thou wert afraid of sorcery and yet hast said a charm thalaba a charm laila and wherefore is it not not delicate food what mean thy words i have heard many spells and many names that rule the genii and the elements but never these thalaba how never heard the names of god and of the prophet laila never nay now again that troubled eye thou art a strange man and wonderous fearful but i must not twice be charged with fraud if thou suspectest still depart and leave me thalaba and you do not know the god that made you laila made me man my father made me he made this dwelling and the grove and yonder fountainfire and every morn he visits me and takes the snow and moulds women and men like thee and breathes into them motion and life and sense but to the touch they are chilling cold and ever when night closes they melt away again and leave me here alone and sad oh then how i rejoice when it is day and my dear father comes and chears me with kind words and kinder looks my dear dear father were it not for him i am so weary of this loneliness that i should wish i also were of snow that i might melt away and cease to be thalaba and have you always had your dwelling here amid this solitude of snow laila i think so i can remember with unsteady feet tottering from room to room and finding pleasure in flowers and toys and sweetmeats things that long have lost their power to please that when i see them raise only now a melancholy wish i were the little trifler once again that could be pleased so lightly thalaba then you know not your fathers art laila no i besought him once to give me power like his that where he went i might go with him but he shook his head and said it was a power too dearly bought and kist me with the tenderness of tears thalaba and wherefore has he hidden you thus far from all the ways of humankind laila twas fear fatherly fear and love he read the stars and saw a danger in my destiny and therefore placed me here amid the snows and laid a spell that never human eye if foot of man by chance should reach the depth of this wide waste shall see one trace of grove garden or dwellingplace or yonder fire that thaws and mitigates the frozen sky and more than this even if the enemy should come i have a guardian here thalaba a guardian laila twas well that when my sight unclosed upon thee there was no dark suspicion in thy face else i had called his succour wilt thou see him but if a woman can have terrified thee how wilt thou bare his unrelaxing brow and lifted lightnings thalaba lead me to him lady she took him by the hand and thro the porch they past over the garden and the grove the fountain streams of fire poured a broad light like noon a broad unnatural light that made the roses blush of beauty pale and dimmed the rich geraniums scarlet blaze the various verdure of the grove now wore one undistinguishable grey checqured with blacker shade suddenly laila stopt i do not think thou art the enemy she said but he will know if thou hast meditated wrong stranger depart in time i would not lead thee to thy death the glance of lailas eye turned anxiously toward the arabian youth so let him pierce my heart cried thalaba if it hide thought to harm you laila tis a figure almost i fear to look at yet come on twill ease me of a heaviness that seems to sink my heart and thou mayest dwell here then in safety for thou shalt not go tomorrow nor on the after nor the after day nor ever it was only solitude that made my misery here and now that i can see a human face and hear a human voice oh no thou wilt not leave me thalaba alas i must not rest the star that ruled at my nativity shone with a strange and blasting influence o gentle lady i should draw upon you a killing curse laila but i will ask my father to save you from all danger and you know not the wonders he can work and when i ask it is not in his power to say me nay perhaps thou knowest the happiness it is to have a tender father thalaba he was one whom like a loathsome leper i have tainted with my contagious destiny at evening he kist me as he wont and laid his hands upon my head and blest me ere i slept his dying groan awoke me for the murderer had stolen upon our sleep for me was meant the midnight blow of death my father died the brother playmates of my infancy the baby at the breast they perished all all in that dreadful hour but i was saved to remember and revenge she answered not for now emerging from the oerarched avenue the finger of her upraised hand marked where the guardian of the garden stood it was a brazen image every limb and swelling vein and muscle true to life the left knee bending on the other straight firm planted and his hand lifted on high to hurl the lightning that it grasped when thalaba approached the charmed image knew hodeirahs son and hurled the lightning at the dreaded foe the ring the saviour ring full in his face the lightningbolt was driven the scattered fire recoiled like the flowing of a summer gale he felt its ineffectual force his countenance was not changed nor a hair of his head was singed he started and his glance turned angrily upon the maid the sight disarmed suspicion breathless pale against a tree she stood her wan lips quivering and her eye upraised in silent supplicating fear she started with a scream of joy seeing her father there and ran and threw her arms around his neck save me she cried the enemy is come save me save me okba okba repeats the youth for never since that hour when in the tent the spirit told his name had thalaba let slip the memory of his fathers murderer okba and in his hand he graspt an arrowshaft and he rushed on to strike him son of hodeirah the old man replied my hour is not yet come and putting forth his hand gently he repelled the youth my hour is not yet come but thou mayest shed this innocent maidens blood that vengeance god allows thee around her fathers neck still lailas hands were clasped her face was turned to thalaba a broad light floated oer its marble paleness as the wind waved the fountain fire her large dilated eye in horror raised watched his every movement not upon her said he not upon her hodeirahs blood cries out for vengeance and again his lifted arm threatened the sorcerer again withheld it felt the barrier that no human strength could burst thou dost not aim the blow more eagerly okba replied than i would rush to meet it but that were poor revenge o thalaba thy god wreaks on the innocent head his vengeance i must suffer in my child why dost thou pause to strike thy victim allah permits commands the deed liar quoth thalaba and lailas wondering eye looked up all anguish to her fathers face by allah and the prophet he replied i speak the words of truth misery misery that i must beg mine enemy to speed the inevitable vengeance now so near i read it in her horoscope her birthstar warned me of hodeirahs race i laid a spell and called a spirit up he answered one must die laila or thalaba accursed spirit even in truth giving a lying hope last i ascended the seventh heaven and on the everlasting table there in characters of light i read her written doom the years that it has gnawn me and the load of sin that it has laid upon my soul curse on this hand that in the only hour the favouring stars allowed reeked with other blood than thine still dost thou stand and gaze incredulous young man be merciful and keep her not longer in agony thalabas unbelieving frown scowled on the sorcerer when in the air the rush of wings was heard and azrael stood among them in equal terror at the sight the enchanter the destroyer stood and laila the victim maid son of hodeirah said the angel of death the accursed fables not when from the eternal hand i took the yearly scroll of fate her name was written there this is the hour and from thy hands commissioned to receive the maid i come hear me o angel thalaba replied to avenge my fathers death to work the will of heaven to root from earth the accursed sorcerer race i have dared danger undismayed i have lost all my soul held dear i am cut off from all the ties of life unmurmuring for whateer awaits me still pursuing to the end the enterprize peril or pain i bear a ready heart but strike this maid this innocent angel i dare not do it remember answered azrael all thou sayest is written down for judgement every word in the balance of thy trial must be weighed so be it said the youth he who can read the secrets of the heart will judge with righteousness this is no doubtful path the voice of god within me can not lie i will not harm the innocent he said and from above as tho it were the voice of night the startling answer came son of hodeirah think again one must depart from hence laila or thalaba she dies for thee or thou for her it must be life for life son of hodeirah weigh it well while yet the choice is thine he hesitated not but looking upward spread his hands to heaven oneiza in thy bower of paradise receive me still unstained what exclaimed okba darest thou disobey abandoning all claim to allahs longer aid the eager exultation of his speech earthward recalled the thoughts of thalaba and dost thou triumph murderer dost thou deem because i perish that the unsleeping lids of justice shall be closed upon thy crime poor miserable man that thou canst live with such beastblindness in the present joy when oer thy head the sword of god hangs for the certain stroke servant of allah thou hast disobeyed god hath abandoned thee this hour is mine cried okba and shook his daughter off and drew the dagger from his vest and aimed the deadly blow all was accomplished laila rushed between to save the saviour youth she met the blow and sunk into his arms and azrael from the hands of thalaba received her parting soul the eleventh book the eleventh book o fool to think thy human hand could check the chariotwheels of destiny to dream of weakness in the allknowing mind that his decrees should change to hope that the united powers of earth and air and hell might blot one letter from the book of fate might break one link of the eternal chain thou miserable wicked poor old man fall now upon the body of thy child beat now thy breast and pluck the bleeding hairs from thy grey beard and lay thine ineffectual hand to close her wound and call on hell to aid and call on heaven to send its merciful thunderbolt the young arabian silently beheld his frantic grief the presence of the hated youth to raging anguish stung the wretched sorcerer aye look and triumph he exclaimed this is the justice of thy god a righteous god is he to let his vengeance fall upon the innocent head curse thee curse thee thalaba all feelings of revenge had left hodeirahs son pitying and silently he heard the victim of his own iniquities not with the busy hand of consolation fretting the sore wound he could not hope to heal so as the servant of the prophet stood with sudden motion the night air gently fanned his cheek twas a green bird whose wings had waved the quiet air on the hand of thalaba the green bird perched and turned a mild eye up as if to win the adventurers confidence then springing on flew forward and now again returns to court him to the way and now his hand perceives her rosy feet press firmer as she leaps upon the wing again obedient to the call by the pale moonlight thalaba pursued oer trackless snows his way unknowing he what blessed messenger had come to guide his steps that lailas spirit went before his path brought up in darkness and the child of sin yet as the meed of spotless innocence just heaven permitted her by one good deed to work her own redemption after death so till the judgement day she might abide in bliss green warbler of the bowers of paradise the morning sun came forth wakening no eye to life in this wide solitude his radiance with a saffron hue like heat suffused the desert snow the green bird guided thalaba now oaring with slow wing her upward way descending now in slant descent on outspread pinions motionless floating now with rise and fall alternate as if the billows of the air heaved her with their sink and swell and when beneath the noon the icey glitter of the snow dazzled his aching sight then on his arm alighted the green bird and spread before his eyes her plumage of refreshing hue evening came on the glowing clouds tinged with a purple ray the mountain ridge that lay before the traveller ah whither art thou gone guide and companion of the youth whose eye has lost thee in the depth of heaven why hast thou left alone the weary wanderer in the wilderness and now the western clouds grow pale and night descends upon his solitude the arabian youth knelt down and bowed his forehead to the ground and made his evening prayer when he arose the stars were bright in heaven the sky was blue and the cold moon shone over the cold snow a speck in the air is it his guide that approaches for it moves with the motion of life lo she returns and scatters from her pinions odours diviner than the gales of morning waft from sabea hovering before the youth she hung till from her rosy feet that at his touch uncurled their grasp he took the fruitful bough they bore he took and tasted a new life flowed thro his renovated frame his limbs that late were sore and stiff felt all the freshness of repose his dizzy brain was calmed the heavy aching of his lids at once was taken off for laila from the bowers of paradise had borne the healing fruit so up the mountain steep with untired foot he past the green bird guiding him mid crags and ice and rocks a difficult way winding the long ascent how then the heart of thalaba rejoiced when bosomed in the mountain depths a sheltered valley opened on his view it was the simorgs vale the dwelling of the ancient bird on a green and mossy bank beside a rivulet the bird of ages stood no sound intruded on his solitude only the rivulet was heard whose everlasting flow from the birthday of the world had made the same unvaried murmuring here dwelt the allknowing bird in deep tranquillity his eyelids ever closed in full enjoyment of profound repose reverently the youth approached that old and only bird and crossed his arms upon his breast and bowed his head and spake earliest of existing things earliest thou and wisest thou guide me guide me on my way i am bound to seek the caverns underneath the roots of ocean where the sorcerer brood are nurst thou the eldest thou the wisest guide me guide me on my way the ancient simorg on the youth unclosed his thoughtful eyes and answered to his prayer northward by the stream proceed in the fountain of the rock wash away thy worldly stains kneel thou there and seek the lord and fortify thy soul with prayer thus prepared ascend the sledge be bold be wary seek and find god hath appointed all the ancient simorg then let fall his lids returning to repose northward along the rivulet the adventurer went his way tracing its waters upward to their source green bird of paradise thou hast not left the youth with slow associate flight she companies his way and now they reach the fountain of the rock there in the cold clear well thalaba washed away his earthly stains and bowed his face before the lord and fortified his soul with prayer the while upon the rock stood the celestial bird and pondering all the perils he must pass with a mild melancholy eye beheld the youth beloved and lo beneath yon lonely pine the sledge and there they stand the harnessed dogs their wide eyes watching for the youth their ears erected turned towards his way they were lean as lean might be their furrowed ribs rose prominent and they were black from head to foot save a white line on every breast curved like the crescent moon and he is seated in the sledge his arms are folded on his breast the bird is on his knees there is fear in the eyes of the dogs there is fear in their pitiful moan and now they turn their heads and seeing him there away the youth with the start of their speed falls back to the bar of the sledge his hair floats straight in the stream of the wind like the weeds in the running brook they wind with speed the upward way an icey path thro rocks of ice his eye is at the summit now and thus far all is dangerless and now upon the height the black dogs pause and pant they turn their eyes to thalaba as if to plead for pity they moan and moan with fear once more away and now the long descent is seen a long long narrow path icerocks aright and hills of snow aleft the giddy precipice be firm be firm o thalaba one motion now one bend and on the crags below thy shattered flesh will harden in the frost why howl the dogs so mournfully and wherefore does the blood flow fast all purple oer their sable hair his arms are folded on his breast nor scourge nor goad has he no hand appears to strike no sounding lash is heard but piteously they moan and moan and track their way with blood and lo on yonder height a giant fiend aloft waits to thrust down the tottering avalanche if thalaba looks back he dies the motion of fear is death on on with swift and steady pace adown that dreadful way the youth is firm the dogs are fleet the sledge goes rapidly the thunder of the avalanche reechoes far behind on on with swift and steady pace adown that dreadful way the dogs are fleet the way is steep the sledge goes rapidly they reach the plain below a wide wide plain all desolate nor tree nor bush nor herb on go the dogs with rapid step the sledge slides after rapidly and now the sun went down they stopt and looked at thalaba the youth performed his prayer they knelt beside him as he prayed they turned their heads to mecca and tears ran down their cheeks then down they laid them in the snow as close as they could lie they laid them down and slept and backward in the sledge the adventurer laid him down there peacefully slept thalaba and the green bird of paradise lay in his bosom warm the dogs awoke him at the dawn they knelt and wept again then rapidly they journeyed on and still the plain was desolate nor tree nor bush nor herb and ever at the hour of prayer they stopt and knelt and wept and still that green and graceful bird was as a friend to him by day and ever when at night he slept lay in his bosom warm in that most utter solitude it cheered his heart to hear her soft and soothing voice her voice was soft and sweet it swelled not with the blackbirds thrill nor warbled rich like the dear bird that holds the solitary man a loiterer in his thoughtful walk at eve but if no overflowing joy spake in its tones of tenderness they soothed the softened soul her bill was not the beak of blood there was a human meaning in her eye its mild affection fixed on thalaba woke wonder while he gazed and made her dearer for the mystery oh joy the signs of life appear the first and single fir that on the limits of the living world strikes in the ice its roots another and another now and now the larch that flings its arms down arching like the falling wave and now the aspins scattered leaves grey glitter on the moveless twig the poplars varying verdure now and now the birch so beautiful light as a ladys plumes oh joy the signs of life the deer hath left his slot beside the way the little ermine now is seen white wanderer of the snow and now from yonder pines they hear the clatter of the grouses wings and now the snowy owl pursues the travellers sledge in hope of food and hark the rosybreasted bird the throstle of sweet song joy joy the winterwilds are left green bushes now and greener grass red thickets here all berrybright and here the lovely flowers when the last morning of their way arrived after the early prayer the green bird fixed on thalaba a sad and supplicating eye and with a human voice she spake servant of god i leave thee now if rightly i have guided thee give me the boon i beg o gentle bird quoth thalaba guide and companion of my dangerous way friend and sole solace of my solitude how can i pay thee benefits like these ask what thou wilt that i can give o gentle bird the poor return will leave me debtor still son of hodeirah she replied when thou shalt see an old man crushed beneath the burthen of his earthly punishment forgive him thalaba yea send a prayer to god on his behalf a flush oerspread the young destroyers cheek he turned his eye towards the bird as if in half repentance for he thought of okba and his fathers dying groan came on his memory the celestial bird saw and renewed her speech o thalaba if she who in thine arms received the daggerblow and died for thee deserve one kind remembrance save o save the father that she loved from endless death laila and is it thou the youth replied what is there that i durst refuse to thee this is no time to harbour in my heart one evil thought here i put off revenge the last rebellious feeling be it so god grant to me the pardon that i need as i do pardon him but who am i that i should save the sinful soul alive enough said laila when the hour shall come remember me my task is done we meet again in paradise she said and shook her wings and up she soared with arrowswiftness thro the heights of heaven his aching eye pursued her path when starting onward went the dogs more rapidly they hurried on in hope of near repose it was the early morning yet when by the wellhead of a brook they stopt their journey done the spring was clear the water deep a venturous man were he and rash that should have probed its depths for all its loosened bed below heaved strangely up and down and to and fro from side to side it heaved and waved and tossed and yet the depths were clear and yet no ripple wrinkled oer the face of that fair well and on that well so strange and fair a little boat there lay without on oar without a sail one only seat it had one seat as if for only thalaba and at the helm a damsel stood a damsel bright and bold of eye yet did a maiden modesty adorn her fearless brow she seemed sorrowful but sure more beautiful for sorrow to her the dogs looked wistful up and then their tongues were loosed have we done well o mistress dear and shall our sufferings end the gentle damsel made reply poor servants of the god i serve when all this witchery is destroyed your woes will end with mine a hope alas how long unknown this new adventurer gives now god forbid that he like you should perish for his fears poor servants of the god i serve wait ye the event in peace a deep and total slumber as she spake seized them sleep on poor sufferers be at rest ye wake no more to anguish ye have borne the chosen the destroyer soon his hand shall strike the efficient blow soon shaking off your penal forms shall ye with songs of joy amid the eden groves hymn the deliverers praise then did the damsel say to thalaba the morn is young the sun is fair and pleasantly thro pleasant banks the quiet brook flows on wilt thou embark with me thou knowest not the waters way think stranger well and night must come wilt thou embark with me thro fearful perils thou must pass stranger the oppressed ask thine aid thou wilt embark with me she smiled in tears upon the youth what heart were his who could gainsay that melancholy smile sail on sail on quoth thalaba sail on in allahs name he sate him on the single seat the little boat moved on thro pleasant banks the quiet brook went winding pleasantly by fragrant fir groves now it past and now thro aldershores thro green and fertile meadows now it silently ran by the flagflower blossomed on its side the willow tresses waved the flowing current furrowed round the waterlillys floating leaf the fly of green and gauzy wing fell sporting down its course and grateful to the voyager the freshness of the running stream the murmur round the prow the little boat falls rapidly adown the rapid brook but many a silent spring meantime and many a rivulet had swoln the growing brook and when the southern sun began to wind the downward way of heaven it ran a river deep and wide thro banks that widened still then once again the damsel spake the stream is strong the river broad wilt thou go on with me the day is fair but night must come wilt thou go on with me far far away the mourners eye is watching for our little boat thou wilt go on with me sail on sail on quoth thalaba sail on in allahs name the little boat falls rapidly adown the riverstream a broader and a broader stream that rocked the little boat the cormorant stands upon its shoals his black and dripping wings half opened to the wind the sun goes down the crescent moon is brightening in the firmament and what is yonder roar that sinking now and swelling now but roaring roaring still still louder louder grows the little boat falls rapidly adown the rapid tide the moon is bright above and the wide ocean opens on their way then did the damsel speak again wilt thou go on with me the moon is bright the sea is calm and i know well the oceanpaths wilt thou go on with me deliverer yes thou dost not fear thou wilt go on with me sail on sail on quoth thalaba sail on in allahs name the moon is bright the sea is calm the little boat rides rapidly across the ocean waves the line of moonlight on the deep still follows as they voyage on the winds are motionless the gentle waters gently part in murmurs round the prow he looks above he looks around the boundless heaven the boundless sea the crescent moon the little boat nought else above below the moon is sunk a dusky grey spreads oer the eastern sky the stars grow pale and paler oh beautiful the godlike sun is rising oer the sea without an oar without a sail the little boat rides rapidly is that a cloud that skirts the sea there is no cloud in heaven and nearer now and darker now it is it is the land for yonder are the rocks that rise dark in the reddening morn for loud around their hollow base the surges rage and roar the little boat rides rapidly and now with shorter toss it heaves upon the heavier swell and now so near they see the shelves and shadows of the cliff and the lowlurking rocks oer whose black summits hiddenhalf the shivering billows burst and nearer now they feel the breakers spray then spake the damsel yonder is our path beneath the cavern arch now is the ebb and till the oceanflow we can not override the rocks go thou and on the shore perform thy last ablutions and with prayer strengthen thy heart i too have need to pray she held the helm with steady hand amid the stronger waves thro surge and surf she drove the adventurer leapt to land the twelfth book the twelfth book then thalaba drew off abdaldars ring and cast it in the sea and cried aloud thou art my shield my trust my hope o god behold and guard me now thou who alone canst save if from my childhood up i have looked on with exultation to my destiny if in the hour of anguish i have felt the justice of the hand that chastened me if of all selfish passions purified i go to work thy will and from the world root up the illdoing race lord let not thou the weakness of my arm make vain the enterprize the sun was rising all magnificent ocean and heaven rejoicing in his beams and now had thalaba performed his last ablutions and he stood and gazed upon the little boat riding the billows near where like a seabird breasting the broad waves it rose and fell upon the surge till from the glitterance of the sunny main he turned his aching eyes and then upon the beach he laid him down and watched the rising tide he did not pray he was not calm for prayer his spirit troubled with tumultuous hope toiled with futurity his brain with busier workings felt the roar and raving of the restless sea the boundless waves that rose and rolled and rocked the everlasting sound opprest him and the heaving infinite he closed his lids for rest meantime with fuller reach and stronger swell wave after wave advanced each following billow lifted the last foam that trembled on the sand with rainbow hues the living flower that rooted to the rock late from the thinner element shrunk down within its purple stem to sleep now feels the water and again awakening blossoms out all its green anthernecks was there a spirit in the gale that fluttered oer his cheek for it came on him like the gentle sun that plays and dallies oer the nightclosed flower and woos it to unfold anew to joy for it came on him as the dews of eve descend with healing and with life upon the summer mead or liker the first sound of seraph song and angel hail to him whose latest sense had shuddered at the groan of anguish kneeling by his death bedside he starts and gazes round to seek the certain presence thalaba exclaimed the voice of the unseen father of my oneiza he replied and have thy years been numbered art thou too among the angels thalaba a second and a dearer voice repeats go in the favour of the lord my thalaba go on my husband i have drest our bower of bliss go and perform the work let me not longer suffer hope in heaven he turned an eager glance towards the sea come quoth the damsel and she drove her little boat to land impatient thro the rising wave he rushed to meet its way his eye was bright his cheek was flushed with joy hast thou had comfort in thy prayers she cried yea answered thalaba a heavenly visitation god be praised she uttered then i do not hope in vain and her voice trembled and her lips quivered and tears ran down stranger quoth she in years long past was one who vowed himself the champion of the lord like thee against the race of hell young was he as thyself gentle and yet so brave a lionhearted man shame on me stranger in the arms of love i held him from his calling till the hour was past and then the angel who should else have crowned him with his glorywreath smote him in anger years and years are gone and in his place of penance he awaits thee the deliverer surely thou art he it was my righteous punishment in the same youth unchanged and changeless love and fresh affliction and keen penitence to abide the written hour when i should waft the doomed destroyer and deliverer here remember thou that thy success involves no single fate no common misery as thus she spake the entrance of the cave darkened the boat below around them from their nests the screaming seabirds fled wondering at that strange shape yet unalarmed at sight of living man unknowing of his sway and power misused the clamours of their young echoed in shriller yells that rung in wild discordance round the rock and farther as they now advanced the dim reflection of the darkened day grew fainter and the dash of the outbreakers deadened farther yet and yet more faint the gleam and there the waters at their utmost bound silently rippled on the rising rock they landed and advanced and deeper in two adamantine doors closed up the cavern pass reclining on the rock beside sate a greyheaded man watching an hourglass by to him the damsel spake is it the hour appointed the old man nor answered her awhile nor lifted he his downward eye for now the glass ran low and like the days of age with speed perceivable the latter sands descend and now the last are gone then he looked up and raised his arm and smote the adamantine gates the gates of adamant unfolding at the stroke opened and gave the entrance then she turned to thalaba and said go in the name of god i can not enter i must wait the end in hope and agony god and mohammed prosper thee for thy sake and for ours he tarried not he past the threshold over which was no return all earthly thoughts all human hopes and passions now put off he cast no backward glance towards the gleam of day there was a light within a yellow light as when the autumnal sun through travelling rain and mist shines on the evening hills whether from central fires effused or if the sunbeams day by day from earliest generations there absorbed were gathering for the wrathflame shade was in those portentous vaults crag overhanging nor the columnrock cast its dark outline there for with the hot and heavy atmosphere the light incorporate permeating all spread over all its equal yellowness there was no motion in the lifeless air he felt no stirring as he past adown the long descent he heard not his own footsteps on the rock that thro the thick stagnation sent no sound how sweet it were he thought to feel the flowing wind with what a thirst of joy he should breathe in the open gales of heaven downward and downward still and still the way the long long way is safe is there no secret wile no lurking enemy his watchful eye is on the wall of rock and warily he marks the roof and warily surveyed the path that lay before downward and downward still and still the way the long long way is safe rock only the same light the same dead atmosphere and solitude and silence like the grave at length the long descent ends on a precipice no feeble ray entered its dreadful gulphs for in the pit profound black darkness utter night repelled the hostile gleam and oer the surface the light atmosphere floated and mingled not above the depth four overawning wings unplumed and huge and strong bore up a little car four living pinions headless bodyless sprung from one stem that branched below in four downarching limbs and clenched the carrings endlong and aside with claws of griffin grasp but not on these the depths so terrible the wonderous wings fixed thalaba his eye for there upon the brink with fiery fetters fastened to the rock a man a living man tormented lay the young othatha in the arms of love he who had lingered out the auspicious hour forgetful of his call in shuddering pity thalaba exclaimed servant of god can i not succour thee he groaned and answered son of man i sinned and am tormented i endure in patience and in hope the hour that shall destroy the race of hell that hour shall set me free is it not come quoth thalaba yea by this omen and with fearless hand he grasped the burning fetters in the name of god and from the rock rooted the rivets and adown the gulph hurled them the rush of flames roared up for they had kindled in their fall the deadly vapours of the pit profound and thalaba bent on and looked below but vainly he explored the deep abyss of flame that sunk beyond the plunge of mortal eye now all ablaze as if infernal fires illumed the world beneath soon was the poisonfuel spent the flame grew pale and dim and dimmer now it fades and now is quenched and all again is dark save where the yellow air enters a little in and mingles slow meantime the freed othatha clasped his knees and cried deliverer struggling then with joyful hope and where is she he cried whose promised coming for so many a year go answered thalaba she waits thee at the gates and in thy triumph he replied there thou wilt join us the deliverers eye glanced on the abyss way else was none the depth was unascendable await not me he cried my path hath been appointed go embark return to life live happy othatha but thy name that thro the nations we may blazon it that we may bless thee thalaba bless the merciful then thalaba pronounced the name of god and leapt into the car down down it sunk down down he neither breathes nor sees his eyes are closed for giddiness his breath is sinking with the fall the air that yields beneath the car inflates the wings above down down a mighty depth and was the simorgh with the powers of ill associate to destroy and was that lovely mariner a fiend as false as fair for still he sinks down down but ever the uprushing wind inflates the wings above and still the struggling wings repel the rushing wind down down and now it strikes he stands and totters giddily all objects round awhile float dizzy on his sight collected soon he gazes for the way there was a distant light that led his search the torch a broader blaze the unpruned taper flames a longer flame but this was fierce as is the noontide sun so in the glory of its rays intense it quivered with green glow beyond was all unseen no eye could penetrate that unendurable excess of light it veiled no friendly form thought thalaba and wisely did he deem for at the threshold of the rocky door hugest and fiercest of his kind accurst fit warden of the sorcery gate a rebel afreet lay he scented the approach of human food and hungry hope kindled his eye of flame raising his hand to save the dazzled sense onward held thalaba and lifted still at times a rapid glance till the due distance gained with head abased he laid the arrow in its rest with steady effort and knit forehead then full on the painful light he fixed his aching eye and loosed the bow an anguish yell ensued and sure no human voice had scope or power for that prodigious shriek whose pealing echoes thundered up the rock dim grew the dying light but thalaba leapt onward to the doors now visible beyond and while the afreet warden of the way was writhing with his deathpangs over him sprung and smote the stony doors and bade them in the name of god give way the dying fiend beneath him at that name tossed in worse agony and the rocks shuddered and the rocky doors rent at the voice asunder lo within the teraph and the fire and khawla and in mail complete mohareb for the strife but thalaba with numbing force smites his raised arm and rushes by for now he sees the fire amid whose flames on the white ashes of hodeirah lies hodeirahs holy sword he rushes to the fire then khawla met the youth and leapt upon him and with clinging arms clasps him and calls mohareb now to aim the effectual vengeance o fool fool he sees his fathers sword and who shall bar his way who stand against the fury of that arm that spurns her to the earth she rises half she twists around his knees a moment and he vainly strives to shake her from her hold impatient then into her cursed breast he stamps his crushing heel and from her body heaving now in death springs forward to the sword the coexistent flame knew the destroyer it encircled him rolled up his robe and gathered round his head condensing to intenser splendour there his crown of glory and his light of life hovered the irradiate wreath the moment thalaba had laid his hand upon his fathers sword the living image in the inner cave smote the round altar the domdaniel rocked thro all its thundering vaults over the surface of the reeling earth the alarum shock was felt the sorcerer brood all all whereer dispersed perforce obeyed the summons all they came compelled by hell and heaven by hell compelled to keep their baptismcovenant and with the union of their strength oppose the common danger forced by heaven to share the common doom vain are all spells the destroyer treads the domdaniel floor they crowd with human arms and human force to crush the single foe vain is all human force he wields his fathers sword the vengeance of awakened deity but chief on thalaba mohareb prest the language of the inspired witch announced one fatal blow for both and desperate of selfsafety yet he hoped to serve the cause of eblis and uphold his empire true in death who shall withstand his way scattered before the sword of thalaba the sorcerer throng recede and leave him space for combat wretched man what shall the helmet or the shield avail against almighty anger wretched man too late mohareb finds that he has chosen the evil part he rears his shield to meet the arabians sword under the edge of that firehardened steel the shield falls severed his cold arm rings with the jarring blow he lifts his scymetar a second stroke and lo the broken hilt hangs from his palsied hand and now he bleeds and now he flies and fain would hide himself amid the throng but they feel the sword of hodeirah but they also fly from the ruin and hasten to the inner cave and fall all fearfully around the giant idols feet seeking salvation from the power they served it was a living image by the art of magic hands of flesh and bones composed and human blood thro veins and arteries that flowed with vital action in the shape of eblis it was made its stature such and such its strength as when among the sons of god preeminent he raised his radiant head prince of the morning on his brow a coronet of meteor flames flowing in points of light selfpoised in air before him hung the round altar rolling like the world on its diurnal axis like the world checquered with sea and shore the work of demon art for where the sceptre in the idols hand touched the round altar in its answering realm earth felt the stroke and ocean rose in storms and ruining cities shaken from their seat crushed all their habitants his other arm was raised and its spread palm upbore the oceanweight whose naked waters arched the sanctuary sole prop and pillar he fallen on the ground around his feet the sorcerers lay moharebs quivering arms clung to the idols knees the idols face was pale and calm in terror he beheld the approach of the destroyer sure of his stroke and therefore in pursuit following nor blind nor hasty on his foe moved the destroyer okba met his way of all that brotherhood he only fearless miserable man the one that had no hope on me on me the childless sorcerer cried let fall the weapon i am he who stole upon the midnight of thy fathers tent this is the hand that pierced hodeirahs heart that felt thy brethrens and thy sisters blood gush round the daggerhilt let fall on me the fated sword the vengeance hour is come destroyer do thy work nor wile nor weapon had the desperate wretch he spread his bosom to the stroke old man i strike thee not said thalaba the evil thou hast done to me and mine brought its own bitter punishment for thy dear daughters sake i pardon thee as i do hope heavens pardon for her sake repent while time is yet thou hast my prayers to aid thee thou poor sinner cast thyself upon the goodness of offended god i speak in lailas name and what if now thou canst not think to join in paradise her spotless spirit hath not allah made alaraf in his wisdom where the sight of heaven shall kindle in the penitent the strong and purifying fire of hope till at the day of judgement he shall see the mercygates unfold the astonished man stood gazing as he spake at length his heart was softened and the tears gushed and he sobbed aloud then suddenly was heard the allbeholding prophets aweful voice thou hast done well my servant ask and receive thy reward a deep and aweful joy seemed to distend the heart of thalaba with arms in reverence crost upon his breast upseeking eyes suffused with transporttears he answered to the voice prophet of god holy and good and bountiful one only earthly wish have i to work thy will and thy protection grants me that look on this sorcerer heavy are his crimes but infinite is mercy if thy servant have now found favour in the sight of god let him be touched with penitence and save his soul from utter death the groans of penitence replied the voice never arise unheard but for thyself prefer the prayer the treasurehouse of heaven is open to thy will prophet of god then answered thalaba i am alone on earth thou knowest the secret wishes of my heart do with me as thou wilt thy will is best there issued forth no voice to answer him but lo hodeirahs spirit comes to see his vengeance and beside him a pure form of roseate light the angel mother hangs my child my dear my glorious blessed child my promise is performed fufil thy work thalaba knew that his deathhour was come and on he leapt and springing up

labour characterises all the works of the orientalists i have seen illuminated persian manuscripts that must each have been the toil of many years every page painted not with representations of life and manners but usually like the curves and lines of a turkey carpet conveying no idea whatever as absurd to the eye as nonsenseverses to the ear the little of their literature that has reached us is equally worthless our barbarian scholars have called ferdusi the oriental homer we have a specimen of his poem the translation is said to be bad and certainly must be unfaithful for it is in rhyme but the vilest copy of a picture at least represents the subject and the composition to make this iliad of the east as they have sacrilegiously stiled it a good poem would be realizing the dreams of alchemy and transmuting lead into gold the arabian tales certainly abound with genius they have lost their metaphorical rubbish in passing through the filter of a french translation the arabians call this palace one of the wonders of the world it was built for nômanalaôuar one of those arabian kings who reigned at hirah a single stone fastened the whole structure the colour of the walls varied frequently in a day nôman richly rewarded the architect sennamar but recollecting afterwards that he might build palaces equal or superior in beauty for his rival kings ordered that he should be thrown from the highest tower of the edifice dherbelot the tribe of ad were descended from ad the son of aus or uz the son of irem the son of shem the son of noah who after the confusion of tongues settled in al ahkâf or the winding sands in the province of hadramaut where his posterity greatly multiplied their first king was shedad the son of ad of whom the eastern writers deliver many fabulous things particularly that he finished the magnificent city his father had begun wherein he built a fine palace adorned with delicious gardens to embellish which he spared neither cost nor labour proposing thereby to create in his subjects a superstitious veneration of himself as a god this garden or paradise was called the garden of irem and is mentioned in the koran and often alluded to by the oriental writers the city they tell us is still standing in the desarts of aden being preserved by providence as a monument of divine justice though it be invisible unless very rarely when god permits it to be seen a favour one colabah pretended to have received in the reign of the khalif moâwiyah who sending for him to know the truth of the matter colabah related his whole adventure that is he was seeking a camel he had lost he found himself on a sudden at the gates of this city and entering it saw not one inhabitant at which being terrified he stayed no longer than to take with him some fine stones which he shewed the khalif sale the descendants of ad in process of time falling from the worship of the true god into idolatry god sent the prophet houd who is generally agreed to be heber to preach the unity of his essence and reclaim them houd preached for many years to this people without effect till god at last was weary of waiting for their repentance the first punishment which he inflicted was a famine of three years continuance during all which time the heavens were closed upon them this with the evils which it caused destroyed a great part of this people who were then the richest and most powerful of all in arabia the adites seeing themselves reduced to this extremity and receiving no succour from their false gods resolved to make a pilgrimage to a place in the province of hegiaz where at present mecca is situated there was then a hillock of red sand there around which a great concourse of different people might always be seen and all these nations the faithful as well as the unfaithful believed that by visiting this spot with devotion they should obtain from god whatever they petitioned for respecting the wants and necessities of life the adites having then resolved to undertake this religious journey chose seventy men at whose head they appointed mortadh and kail the two most considerable personages of the country to perform this duty in the name of the whole nation and by this means procure rain from heaven without which their country must be ruined the deputees departed and were hospitably received by moâwiyah who at that time reigned in the province of hegiaz they explained to him the occasion of their journey and demanded leave to proceed and perform their devotions at the red hillock that they might procure rain mortadh who was the wisest of this company and who had been converted by the prophet houd often remonstrated with his associates that it was useless to to take this journey for the purpose of praying at this chosen spot unless they had previously adopted the truths which the prophet preached and seriously repented of their unbelief for how said he can you hope that god will shed upon us the abundant showers of his mercy if we refuse to hear the voice of him whom he hath sent to instruct us kail who was one of the most obstinate in error and consequently of the prophets worst enemies hearing the discourses of his colleague requested king moâwiyah to detain mortadh prisoner whilst he and the remainder of his companions proceeded to make their prayers upon the hillock moâwiyah consented and detaining mortadh captive permitted the others to pursue their journey and accomplish their vow kail now the sole chief of the deputation having arrived at the place prayed thus lord give to the people of ad such rains as it shall please thee and he had scarcely finished when there appeared three clouds in the sky one white one red the third black at the same time these words were heard to proceed from heaven chuse which of the three thou wilt kail chose the black which he imagined the fullest and most abundant in water of which they were in extreme want after having chosen he immediately quitted the place and took the road to his own country congratulating himself on the happy success of his pilgrimage as soon as kail arrived in the valley of magaith a part of the territory of the adites he informed his countrymen of the favourable answer he had received and of the cloud which was soon to water all their lands the senseless people all came out of their houses to receive it but this cloud which was big with the divine vengeance produced only a wind most cold and most violent which the arabs call sarsar it continued to blow for seven days and seven nights and exterminated all the unbelievers of the country leaving only the prophet houd alive and those who had heard him and turned to the faith dherbelot alahkaf signifies the winding sands i have heard from a certain cyprian botanist that the ebony does not produce either leaves or fruit and that it is never seen exposed to the sun that its roots are indeed under the earth which the æthiopians dig out and that there are men among them skilled in finding the place of its concealment pausanias translated by taylor the adites worshipped four idols sakiah the dispenser of rain hafedah the protector of travellers razecah the giver of food and salemah the preserver in sickness dherbelot sale mecca was thus called mohammed destroyed the other superstitions of the arabs but he was obliged to adopt their old and rooted veneration for the well and the black stone and transfer to mecca the respect and reverence which he had designed for jerusalem some of the pagan arabs when they died had their camel tied by their sepulchre and so left without meat or drink to perish and accompany them to the other world lest they should be obliged at the resurrection to go on foot which was accounted very scandalous ali affirmed that the pious when they come forth from their sepulchres shall find ready prepared for them whitewinged camels with saddles of gold here are some footsteps of the doctrine of the ancient arabians sale she stared me in the face this line is in one of the most beautiful passages of our old ballads so full of beauty i have never seen the ballad in print and with some trouble have procured only an imperfect copy from memory it is necessary to insert some of the preceding stanzas the title is old poulters mare at length old age came on her and she grew faint and poor her master he fell out with her and turned her out of door saying if thou wilt not labour i prithee go thy way and never let me see thy face until thy dying day these words she took unkind and on her way she went for to fulfill her masters will always was her intent the hills were very high the vallies very bare the summer it was hot and dry it starved old poulters mare old poulter he grew sorrowful and said to his kinsman will id have thee go and seek the mare oer valley and oer hill go go go go says poulter and make haste back again for until thou hast found the mare in grief i shall remain away went will so willingly and all day long he sought till when it grew towards the night he in his mind bethought he would go home and rest him and come again tomorrow for if he could not find the mare his heart would break with sorrow he went a little farther and turned his head aside and just by goodman whitfields gate oh there the mare he spied he asked her how she did she stared him in the face then down she laid her head again she was in wretched case concerning the pyramids i shall put down says greaves that which is confessed by the arabian writers to be the most probable relation as is reported by ibn abd alhokm whose words out of the arabick are these the greatest part of chronologers agree that he which built the pyramids was saurid ibn salhouk king of egypt who lived three hundred years before the flood the occasion of this was because he saw in his sleep that the whole earth was turned over with the inhabitants of it the men lying upon their faces and the stars falling down and striking one another with a terrible noise and being troubled he concealed it after this he saw the fixed stars falling to the earth in the similitude of white fowl and they snatched up men carrying them between two great mountains and these mountains closed upon them and the shining stars were made dark awaking with great fear he assembles the chief priests of all the provinces of egypt an hundred and thirty priests the chief of them was called aclimum relating the whole matter to them they took the altitude of the stars and making their prognostication foretold of a deluge the king said will it come to our country they answered yea and will destroy it and there remained a certain number of years for to come and he commanded in the mean space to build the pyramids and a vault to be made into which the river nilus entering should run into the countries of the west and into the land alsaid and he filled them with telesmesb and with strange things and with riches and treasures and the like he engraved in them all things that were told him by wise men as also all profound sciences the names of alakakirsc the uses and hurts of them the science of astrology and of arithmetick and of geometry and of physick all this may be interpreted by him that knows their characters and language after he had given order for this building they cut out vast columns and wonderful stones they fetch massy stones from the æthopians and made with these the foundation of the three pyramids fastening them together with lead and iron they built the gates of them forty cubits under ground and they made the height of the pyramids one hundred royal cubits which are fifty of ours in these times he also made each side of them an hundred royal cubits the beginning of this building was in a fortunate horoscope after that he had finished it he covered it with coloured satten from the top to the bottom and he appointed a solemn festival at which were present all the inhabitants of his kingdom then he built in the western pyramid thirty treasures filled with store of riches and utensils and with signatures made of precious stones and with instruments of iron and vessels of earth and with arms that rust not and with glass which might be bended and yet not broken and with several kind of alakakirs single and double and with deadly poisons and with other things besides he made also in the east pyramid divers celestial spheres and stars and what they severally operate in their aspects and the perfumes which are to be used to them and the books which treat of these matters he also put in the coloured pyramid the commentaries of the priests in chests of black marble and with every priest a book in which were the wonders of his profession and of his actions and of his nature and what was done in his time and what is and what shall be from the beginning of time to the end of it he placed in every pyramid a treasurer the treasurer of the westerly pyramid was a statue of marble stone standing upright with a lance and upon his head a serpent wreathed he that came near it and stood still the serpent bit him of one side and wreathing round about his throat and killing him returned to his place he made the treasurer of the east pyramid an idol of black agate his eyes open and shining sitting upon a throne with a lance when any looked upon him he heard of one side of him a voice which took away his sense so that he fell prostrate upon his face and ceased not till he died he made the treasurer of the coloured pyramid a statue of stone called albut sitting he which looked towards it was drawn by the statue till he stuck to it and could not be separated from it till such time as he died the coptites write in their books that there is an inscription engraven upon them the exposition of which in arabick is this i king saurid built the pyramids in such and such a time and finished them in six years he that comes after me and says that he is equal to me let him destroy them in six hundred years and yet it is known that it is easier to pluck down than to build up i also covered them when i had finished them with satten and let him cover them with mats after that almamon the calif entered ægypt and saw the pyramids he desired to know what was within and therefore would have them opened they told him it could not possibly be done he replied i will have it certainly done and that hole was opened for him which stands open to this day with fire and vinegar two smiths prepared and sharpened the iron and engines which they forced in and there was a great expence in the opening of it the thickness of the wall was found to be twenty cubits and when they came to the end of the wall behind the place they had digged there was an ewer of green emerald in it were a thousand dinars very weighty every dinar was an ounce of our ounces they wondered at it but knew not the meaning of it then almamon said cast up the account how much hath been spent in making the entrance they cast it up and lo it was the same sum which they found it neither exceeded nor was defective within they found a square well in the square of it there were doors every door opened into a house or vault in which there were dead bodies wrapped up in linen they found towards the top of the pyramid a chamber in which there was an hollow stone in it was a statue of stone like a man and within it a man upon whom was a breastplate of gold set with jewels upon his breast was a sword of invaluable price and at his head a carbuncle of the bigness of an egg shining like the light of the day and upon him were characters written with a pen no man knows what they signify after almamon had opened it men entered into it for many years and descended by the slippery passage which is in it and some of them came out safe and others died greavess pyramidographia b that which the arabians commonly mean by telesmes are certain sigilla or amuleta made under such and such an aspect or configuration of the stars and planets with several characters accordingly inscribed c alakakir amongst other significations is the name of a precious stone and therefore in abulfeda it is joined with yacut a ruby i imagine it here to signify some magical spell which it may be was engraven on this stone the carbuncle is to be found in most of the subterranean palaces of romance i have no where seen so circumstantial an account of its wonderful properties as in a passage of thuanus quoted by setphanius in his notes to saxo grammaticus whilst the king was at bologna a stone wonderful in its species and nature was brought to him from the east indies by a man unknown who appeared by his manners to be a barbarian it sparkled as tho all burning with an incredible splendour flashing radiance and shooting on every side its beams it filled the surrounding air to a great distance with a light scarcely by any eyes endurable in this also it was wonderful that being most impatient of the earth if it was confined it would force its way and immediately fly aloft neither could it be contained by any art of man in a narrow place but appeared only to love those of ample extent it was of the utmost purity stained by no soil nor spot certain shape it had none for its figure was inconstant and momentarily changing and tho at a distance it was beautiful to the eye it would not suffer itself to be handled with impunity but hurt those who obstinately struggled with it as many persons before many spectators experienced if by chance any part of it was broken off for it was not very hard it become nothing less thuanus lib in the mirror of stones carbuncles are said to be male and female the females throw out their brightness the stars appear burning within the males like many other jewels the carbuncle was supposed to be an animal substance formed in the serpent the serpents ingenious method of preserving it from the song of the charmer is related in an after note book adam says a moorish author after having eaten the forbidden fruit sought to hide himself under the shade of the trees that form the bowers of paradise the gold and silver trees refused their shade to the father of the human race god asked them why they did so because replied the trees adam has transgressed against your commandment ye have done well answered the creator and that your fidelity may be rewarded

than the oriental writers who describe it in the notes to the bahardanush is the following account of its magnificence from the tofet al mujalis a pleasant and elevated spot being fixed upon shuddaud dispatched an hundred chiefs to collect skilful artists and workmen from all countries he also commanded the monarchs of syria and ormus to send him all their jewels and precious stones forty camel loads of gold silver and jewels were daily used in the building which contained a thousand spacious quadrangles of many thousand rooms in the areas were artificial trees of gold and silver whose leaves were emeralds and fruit clusters of pearls and jewels the ground was strewed with ambergris musk and saffron between every two of the artificial trees was planted one of delicious fruit this romantic abode took up five hundred years in the completion when finished shuddaud marched to view it and when arrived near divided two hundred thousand youthful slaves whom he had brought with him from damascus into four detachments which were stationed in cantonments prepared for their reception on each side of the garden towards which he proceeded with his favourite courtiers suddenly was heard in the air a voice like thunder and shuddaud looking up beheld a personage of majestic figure and stern aspect who said i am the angel of death commissioned to seize thy impure soul shuddaud exclaimed give me leisure to enter the garden and was descending from his horse when the seizer of life snatched away his impure spirit and he fell dead upon the ground at the same time lightnings flashed and destroyed the whole army of the infidel and the rose garden of irim became concealed from the sight of man lamai relates that a great monarch whom he does not name having erected a superb palace wished to show it to every man of talents and taste in the city he therefore invited them to a banquet and after the repast was finished asked them if they knew any building more magnificent and more perfect in the architecture in the ornaments and in the furniture all the guests contented themselves with expressing their admiration and lavishing praise except one who led a retired and austere life and was one of those persons whom the arabians call zahed this man spoke very freely to the prince and said to him i find a great defect in this building it is that the foundation is not good nor the walls sufficiently strong so that azrael can enter on every side and the sarsar can easily pass thro and when they showed him the walls of the palace ornamented with azure and gold of which the marvellous workmanship surpassed in costliness the richness of the materials he replied there is still a great inconvenience here it is that we can never estimate these works well till we

say that they feel a smell of sulphur as it passes the only means by which any person can preserve himself from suffering by these noxious blasts is by throwing himself down with his face upon the earth till this whirlwind of poisonous exhalations has blown over which always moves at a certain height in the atmosphere instinct even teaches the brutes to incline their heads to the ground on these occasions niebuhr the arabs of the desert call these winds semoum or poison and the turks shamyela or wind of syria from which is formed the samiel their heat is sometimes so excessive that it is difficult to form any idea of its violence without having experienced it but it may be compared to the heat of a large oven at the moment of drawing out the bread when these winds begin to blow the atmosphere assumes an alarming aspect the sky at other times so clear in this climate becomes dark and heavy the sun loses his splendour and appears of a violet colour the air is not cloudy but grey and thick and is in fact filled with an extremely subtile dust which penetrates every where this wind always light and rapid is not at first remarkably hot but it increases in heat in proportion as it continues all animated bodies soon discover it by the change it produces in them the lungs which a too rarefied air no longer expands are contracted and become painful respiration is short and difficult the skin parched and dry and the body consumed by an internal heat in vain is recourse had to large draughts of water nothing can restore perspiration in vain is coolness sought for all

reigns every where the inhabitants of houses and villages shut themselves up in their houses and those of the desert in their tents or in pits they dig in the earth where they wait the termination of this destructive heat it usually lasts three days but if it exceeds that time it becomes insupportable woe to the traveller whom this wind surprizes remote from shelter he must suffer all its dreadful consequences which sometimes are mortal the danger is most imminent when it blows in squalls for then the rapidity of the wind increases the heat to such degree as to cause sudden death this death is a real suffocation the lungs being empty are convulsed the circulation disordered and the whole mass of blood driven by the heart towards the head and breast whence that hæmorrhage at the nose and mouth which happens after death this wind is especially fatal to persons of a plethoric habit and those in whom fatigue has destroyed the tone of the muscles and the vessels the corpse remains a long time warm swells turns blue and is easily separated all which are signs of that putrid fermentation which takes place in animal bodies when the humours become stagnant these accidents are to be avoided by stopping the nose and mouth with handkerchiefs an efficacious method likewise is that practised by the camels who bury their noses in the sand and keep them there till the squall is over another quality of this wind is its extreme aridity which is such that water sprinkled on the floor evaporates in a few minutes by this extreme dryness it withers and strips all the plants and by exhaling too suddenly the emanations from animal bodies crisps the skin closes the pores and causes that feverish heat which is the invariable effect of suppressed perspiration volney from the mirror

and being taken up was buried decently in the church yard now there was an image or rood in the church called our lady of chatham this lady say the monks went the next night and roused up the clerk telling him that a sinful person was buried near the place where she was worshipped who offended her eyes with his ghastly grinning and unless he were removed to the great grief of good people she must remove from thence and could work no more miracles therefore she desired him to go with her to take him up and throw him into the river again which being done soon after the body floated again and was taken up and buried in the church yard but from that time all miracles ceased and the place where he was buried did continually sink downwards this tale is still remembered by some aged people

was a madheaded hollander among the rest who going into the bottome of the dike tooke the dogge by the taile and cast him into the middest of the gulfe then speedily they cast earth and torfe into it

two hundred and fifty pounds and each camel at ten pounds sterling we must not therefore when we speak of the bedouins affix to the words prince and lord the ideas they usually convey we should come nearer the truth by comparing them to substantial farmers in mountainous countries whose simplicity they resemble in their dress as well as in their domestic life and manners a shaik who has the command of five hundred horse does not disdain to saddle and bridle his own nor to give him his barley and chopped straw in his tent his wife makes the coffee kneeds the dough and superintends the dressing of the victuals his daughters and kinswomen wash the linen and go with pitchers on their heads and veils over their faces to draw water from the fountain these manners agree precisely with the descriptions in homer and the history of abraham in genesis but it must be owned that it is difficult to form a just idea of them without having ourselves been eye witnesses volney thus confined to the most absolute necessaries of life the arabs have as little industry as their wants are few all their arts consist in weaving their clumsy tents and in making mats and butter their whole commerce only extends to the exchanging camels kids stallions and milk for arms clothing a little rice or corn and money which they bury volney the chief manufacture among the arabs is the making of hykes as they call woollen blankets and webs of goats hair for their tents the women alone are employed in this work as andromache and penelope were of old who make no use of a shuttle but conduct

by observing the dexterity of the arab women in baking their bread they have a small place built with clay between two and three feet high having a hole at the bottom for the convenience of drawing out the ashes something similar to that of a lime kiln the oven which i think is the most proper name for this place is usually about fifteen inches wide at the top and gradually grows wider to the bottom it is heated with wood and when sufficiently hot and perfectly clear from smoke having nothing but clear embers at bottom which continue to reflect great heat they prepare the dough in a large bowl and mould the cakes to the desired size on a board or stone placed near the oven after they have kneaded the cake to a proper consistence they pat it a little then toss it about with great dexterity in one hand till it is as thin as they choose to make it they then wet one side of it with water at the same time wetting the hand and arm with which they put it into the oven the wet side of the cake adheres fast to the side of the oven till it is sufficiently baked when if not paid sufficient attention to it would fall down among the embers if they were not exceedingly quick at this work the heat of the oven would burn the skin from off their hands and arms but with such amazing dexterity do they perform it that one woman will continue keeping three or four cakes at a time in the oven till she has done baking this mode let me add does not require half the fuel that is made use of in europe jackson tamarinds grow on great trees full of branches whereof the leaves are not bigger than nor unlike to the leaves of pimpernel only something longer the flower at first is like the peaches but at last turns white and puts forth its fruit at the end of certain strings as soon as the sun is set the leaves close up the fruit to preserve it from the dew and open as soon as that luminary appears again the fruit at first is green but ripening it becomes of a dark grey drawing towards a red inclosed in husks brown or twany of taste a little bitter like our prunelloes the tree is as big as a walnuttree full of leaves bearing its fruit at the branches like the sheath of a knife but not so straight rather bent like a bow mandelslo i have often says niebuhr heard the sheiks sing passages from the koran they never strain the voice by attempting to raise it too high and this natural music pleased me very much the airs of the orientals are all grave and simple they chuse their singers to sing so distinctly that every word may be comprehended when several instruments are played at once and accompanied by the voice you hear them all render the same melody unless some one mingles a running base either singing or playing always in the same key if this music is not greatly to our taste ours is as little to the taste of the orientals niebuhr description the mosques which they pronounce mesg jid are built exactly in the fashion of our churches where instead of such seats and benches as we make use of they only strew the floor with mats upon which they perform the several sittings and prostrations that are enjoyned in their religion near the middle particularly of the principal mosque of each city there is a large pulpit erected which is ballustraded round with about half a dozen steps leading up to it upon these for i am told none are permitted to enter the pulpit the mufty or one of the imams placeth himself every friday the day of the congregation as they call it and from thence either explaineth some part or other of the coran or else exhorteth the people to piety and good works that end of these mosques which regards mecca whither they direct themselves throughout the whole course of their devotions is called the kiblah in which there is commonly a nich representing as a judicious writer conjectures the presence and at the same time the invisibility of the deity there is usually a square tower erected at the other end with a flagstaff upon the top of it hither the cryer ascends at the appointed times and displaying a small flag advertised the people with a loud voice from each side of the battlements of the hour of prayer these places of the mahometan worship together with the mufty imams and other persons belonging to them are maintained out of certain revenues arising from the rents of lands and houses either left by will or set apart by the public for that use shaw all the mosques are built nearly in the same style they are of an oblong square form and covered in the middle with a large dome on the top of which is fixed a gilt crescent in front there is a handsome portico covered with several small cupolas and raised one step above the pavement of the court the turks sometimes in the hot season perform their devotions there and between the columns upon cross iron bars are suspended a number of lamps for illuminations on the thursday nights and on all festivals the entrance into the mosque is by one large door all these edifices are solidly built of freestone and in several the domes are covered with lead the minarets stand on one side adjoining to the body of the mosque they are sometimes square but more commonly round and taper the gallery for the maazeen or cryers projecting a little from the column near the top has some resemblance to a rude capital and from this the spire tapering more in proportion than before soon terminates in a point crowned with a crescent russels aleppo the keabé is the point of direction and the centre of union for the prayers of the whole human race as the beïthmâmourd is for those of all the celestial beings the kursye for those of the four arch angels and the arschf for those of the cherubims and seraphims who guard the throne of the almighty the inhabitants of mecca who enjoy the happiness of contemplating the keabé are obliged when they pray to fix their eyes upon the sanctuary but they who are at a distance from this valuable privilege are required only during prayer to direct their attention towards that hallowed edifice the believer who is ignorant of the position of the keabé must use every endeavour to gain a knowledge of it and after he has shown great solicitude whatever be his success his prayer is valid dohsson d beïth mâmour which means the house of prosperity and felicity is the ancient keabé of mecca which according to tradition was taken up

matter they are made of they are the same with what the antients called mapalia which being then as they are to this day secured from the heat and inclemency of the weather by a covering only of such hair cloth as our coal sacks are made of might very justly be described by virgil to have thin roofs when we find any number of them together and i have seen from to then they are usually placed in a circle and constitute a douwar the fashion of each tent is the same being of an oblong figure not unlike the bottom of a ship turned upside down as satlust hath long ago described them however they differ in bigness according to the number of people who live in them and are accordingly supported some with one pillar others with two or three whilst a curtain or carpet placed upon occasion at each of these divisions separateth the whole into so many apartments the pillar which i have mentioned is a straight pole or feet high and or inches in thickness serving not only to support the tent but

suitable to their homely instruments and to their simple invention the arabebbah as they call the bladder and string is in the highest vogue and doubtless of great antiquity as is also the gaspah which is only a common reed open at each end having the side of it bored with three or more holes according to the ability of the person who is to touch it tho the compass of their tunes rarely or ever exceeds an octave yet sometimes even in this simplicity of harmony they observe something of method and ceremony for in their historical cantatas especially they have their preludes and symphonies each stanza being introduced with a flourish from the arabebbah while the narration itself is accompanied with the softest touches they are able to make upon the gaspah the tarr another of their instruments is made like a sive consisting as isidore describeth the tympanum of a thin rim or hoop of wood with a skin of parchment stretched over the top of it this serves for the bass in all their concerts which they accordingly touch very artfully with their fingers and the knuckles or palms of their hands as the time and measure require or as force and softness are to be communicated to the several parts of the performance the tarr is undoubtedly the tympanum of the antients which appears as well from the general use of it all over barbary egypt and the levant as from the method of playing upon it and the figure of the instrument itself being exactly of the same fashion with what we find in the hands of cybele and the bacchanals among the basso relievos and statues of the

point of character and execution resemble nothing we have heard in europe except the seguidillas of the spaniards they have divisions more laboured even than those of the italians and cadences and inflections of tone impossible to be imitated by european throats their performance is accompanied with sighs and gestures which paint the passions in a more lively manner than we snould venture to

the mimosa selam produces splendid flowers of a beautiful red colour with which the arabians crown their heads on their days of festival niebuhr the large locusts which are near three inches long are not the most destructive as they fly they yield to the current of the wind which hurries them into the sea or into sandy deserts where they perish with hunger or fatigue the young locusts that can not fly are the most ruinous they are about fifteen lines in length and the thickness of a goose quill they creep over the country in such multitudes that they leave not a blade of grass behind and the noise of their feeding announces their approach at some distance the devastations of locusts increase the price of provisions and often occasion famines but the moors find a kind of compensation in making food of these insects prodigious quantities are brought to market salted and dried like red herrings they have an oily and rancid taste which habit only can render agreeable they are eat here however with pleasure chenier in the empire of morocco was ravaged by these insects in the summer of that year such clouds of locusts came from the south that they darkened the air and devoured a part of the harvest their offspring which they left on the ground committed still much greater mischief locusts appeared and bred anew in the following year so that in the spring the country was wholly covered and they crawled one over the other in search of their subsistence it has been remarked in speaking of the climate of morocco that the young locusts are those which are the most mischievous and that it seems almost impossible to rid the land of these insects and their ravages when the country once becomes thus afflicted in order to preserve the houses and gardens in the neighbourhood of cities they dig a ditch two feet in depth and as much in width this they pallisade with reeds close to each other and inclined inward toward the ditch so that the insects unable to climb up the slippery reed fall back into the ditch where they devour one another this was the means by which the gardens and vineyards of rabat and the city itself were delivered from this scourge in the intrenchment which was at least a league in extent formed a semicircle from the sea to river which separates rabat from sallee the quantity of young locusts here assembled was so prodigious that on the third day the ditch could not be approached because of the stench the whole country was eaten up the very bark of the fig pomegranate and orange tree bitter hard and corrosive as it was could not escape the voracity of these insects the lands ravaged throughout all the western provinces produced no harvest and the moors being obliged to live on their stores which the exportation of corn permitted till had drained began to feel a dearth their cattle for which they make no provision and which in these climates have no other subsistance than that of daily grazing died with hunger nor could any be preserved but those which were in the neighbourhood of mountains or in marshy grounds where the regrowth of pasturage is more rapid in the distress was still farther increased the dry winter had checked the products of the earth and given birth to a new generation of locusts who devoured whatever had escaped from the inclemency of the season the husbandman did not reap even what he had sowed and found himself destitute of food cattle or seed corn in this time of extreme wretchedness the poor felt all the horrors of famine they were seen wandering over the country to devour roots and perhaps abridged their days by digging into the entrails of the earth in search of the crude means by which they might be preserved vast numbers perished of indigestible food and want i have beheld country people in the roads and in the streets who had died of hunger and who were thrown across asses to be taken and buried fathers sold their children the husband with the consent of his wife would take her into another province there to bestow her in marriage as if she were his sister and afterwards come and reclaim her when his wants were no longer so great i have seen women and children run after camels and rake in their dung to seek for some indigested grain of barley which if they found they devoured with avidity chenier the abmelec or eater of locusts or grasshoppers is a bird which better deserves to be described perhaps than most others of which travellers have given us an account because the facts relating to it are not only strange in themselves but so well and distinctly attested that however surprising they may seem we can not but afford them our belief the food of this creature is the locust or the grasshopper it is of the size of an ordinary hen its feathers black its wings large and its flesh of a greyish colour they fly generally in great flocks as the starlings are wont to do with us but the thing which renders these birds wonderful is that they are so fond of the water of a certain fountain in corasson or bactria that whereever that water is carried they follow on which account it is carefully preserved for where ever the locusts fall the armenian priests who are provided with this water bring a quanity of it and place in jars or pour it into little channels in the fields the next day whole troops of these birds arrive and quickly deliver the people from the locusts universal history sir john chardin has given us the following passage from an antient traveller in relation to this bird in cyprus about the time that the corn was ripe for the sickle the earth produced such a quantity of cavalettes or locusts that they obscured sometimes the splendour of the sun wherever these came they burnt and eat up all for this there was no remedy since as fast as they were destroyed the earth produced more god however raised them up a means for their deliverance which happened thus in persia near the city of cuerch there is a fountain of water which has a wonderful property of destroying these insects for a pitcher full of this being carried in the open air without passing through house or vault and being set on an high place certain birds which follow it and fly and cry after the men who carry it from the fountain come to the place where it is fixed these birds are red and black and fly in great flocks together like starlings the turks and persians call them musulmans these birds no sooner came to cyprus but they destroyed the locusts with which the island was infested but if the water be spilt or lost these creatures immediately disappear which accident fell out when the turks took this island for one of them going up into the steeple of famagusta and finding there a pitcher of this water he fancying that it contained gold or silver or some precious thing broke it and spilt what was therein since which the cypriots have been as much tormented as ever by the locusts on the confines of the medes and of armenia at certain times a great quantity of birds are seen who resemble our blackbirds and they have a property sufficiently curious to make me mention it when the corn in these parts begins to grow it is astonishing to see the number of locusts with which all the fields are covered the armenians have no other method of delivering themselves from these insects than by going in procession round the fields and sprinkling them with a particular water which they take care to preserve in their houses for this water comes from a great distance they fetch it from a well belonging to one of their convents near the frontiers and they say that the bodies of many christian martyrs were formerly thrown into this well these processions and the sprinkling continue three or four days after which the birds that i have mentioned come in great flights and whether it be that they eat the locusts or drive them away in two or three days the country is cleared of them tavernier at mosul and at haleb says niebuhr i heard much of the locust bird without seeing it they there call it samarmar or as others pronounce it samarmog it is said to be black larger than a sparrow and no ways pleasant to the palate i am assured that it every day destroys an incredible number of locusts they pretend nevertheless that the locusts sometimes defend themselves and devour the bird with its feathers when they have overpowered it by numbers when the children in the frontier towns of arabia catch a live locust they place it before them and cry samarmog and because it stoops down terrified at the noise or at the motion of the child or clings more closely to its place the children believe that it fears the name of its enemy that it hides itself and attempts to throw stones the samarmog is not a native of mosul or haleb but they go to seek it in khorasan with much ceremony when the locusts multiply very greatly the government sends persons worthy of trust to a spring near the village of samarûn situated in a plain between four mountains by mesched or musa er ridda in that province of persia the deputies with the ceremonies prescribed fill a chest with this water and pitch the chest so that the water may neither evaporate nor be spilt before their return from the spring to the town whence they were sent the chest must always be between heaven and earth they must neither place it on the ground nor under any roof lest it should lose all its virtue mosul being surrounded with a wall the water must not pass under the gate way but it is received over the wall and the chest placed upon the mosque nebbi gurgis a building which was formerly a church and which in preference to all the other buildings has had from time immemorial the honour to possess this chest upon its roof when this precious water has been brought from khorasan with the requisite precautions the common mohammedans christians and jews of mosul believe that the samarmog follows the water and remains in the country as long as there is a single drop left in the chest of nebbigurgis seeing one day a large storks nest upon this vessel i told a christian of some eminence in the town how much i admired the quick smell of the samarmog who perceived the smell of the water thro such a quantity of ordure he did not answer me but was very much scandalized that the government should have permitted the stork to make her nest upon so rare a treasure and still more angry that for more than nine years the government had not sent to procure fresh water niebuhr desc de larabie dr russell describes this bird as about the size of a starling the body of a flesh colour the rest of its plumage black the bill and legs black also the locusts are remarkable for the hieroglyphic that they bear upon the forehead their colour is green throughout the whole body excepting a little yellow rim that surrounds their head which is lost at their eyes this insect has two upper wings pretty solid they are green like the rest of the body except that there is in each a little white spot the locust keeps them extended like great sails of a ship going before the wind it has besides two other wings underneath the former and which resemble a light transparent stuff pretty much like a cobweb and which it makes use of in the manner of smack sails that are along a vessel but when the locust reposes herself she does like a vessel that lies at anchor for she keeps the second sails furled under the first norden the mohammedans believe some mysterious meaning is contained in the lines upon the locusts forehead i compared the description in the poem with a locust which was caught in leicestershire it is remarkable that a single insect should have found his way so far inland an arabian expression from the moallakat she

of yemen were so far advanced in this science by their devotion that they said their prayers every noon in the kaba of mecca and were not absent from their own houses any other part of the day a merchant of mecca who had learnt it in all its forms from mohammed el dsjanâdsjeni at present so famous in that city pretended that he himself being in danger of perishing at sea had fastened a billet to the mast with the usual ceremonies and that immediately the tempest ceased he showed me at bombay but at a distance a book which contained all sorts of figures and mathematical tables with instructions how to arrange the billets and the appropriate prayers for every circumstance but he would neither suffer me to touch the book nor copy the title there are some mohammedans who shut themselves up in a dark place without eating and drinking for a long time and there with a loud voice repeat certain short prayers till they faint when they recover they pretend to have seen not only

troublesome kind of garment being frequently disconcerted and falling upon the ground so that the person who wears it is every moment obliged to tuck it up and fold it anew about his body this shews the great use there is for a girdle in attending any active employment and in consequence thereof the force of the scripture injunction alluding thereunto of having our loyns girded the method of wearing these garments with the use they are at other times put to in serving for coverlets to their beds should induce us to take the finer sort of them at least such as are wore by the ladies and persons of distinction to be the peplus of the antients it is very probable likewise that the loose folding garment the toga i take it to be of the romans was of this kind for if the drapery of their

nor stripes nor caresses nor food nor rest will make him rise again his vigor is exhausted and life ebbs out apace this the arabs are very sensible of and kindly plunge a sword into the breast of the dying beast to shorten his pangs even the arab feels remorse when he commits this deed his hardened heart is moved at the loss of a faithful servant eyles irwin in the monthly magazine for january is a letter from professor heering recommending the introduction of these animals at the cape but the camel is made only for level countries this animal is very ill qualified to travel upon the snow or wet ground the breadth in which they carry their legs when they slip often occasions their splitting themselves so that when they fall with great burdens they seldom rise again jonas hanway the

algiers no creature seems so peculiarly fitted to the climate in which it exists we can not doubt the nature of the one has been adapted to that of the other by some disposing intelligence designing the camel to dwell in a country where he can find little nourishment nature has been sparing of her materials in the whole of his formation she has not bestowed upon him the plump fleshiness of the ox horse or elephant but limiting herself to what is strictly necessary she has given him a small head without ears at the end of a long neck without flesh she has taken from his legs and thighs every muscle not immediately resquisite for motion and in short has bestowed on his withered body only the vessels and tendons necessary to connect his frame together she has furnished him with a strong jaw that he may grind the hardest aliments but lest he should consume too much she has contracted his stomach and obliged him to chew the cud she has lined his foot with a lump of flesh which sliding in the mud and being no way adapted for climbing fits him only for a dry level and sandy soil like that of arabia she has evidently destined him likewise to slavery by refusing him every sort of defence against his enemies destitute of the horns of the bull the hoofs of the horse the tooth of the elephant and the swiftness of the stag how can the camel resist or avoid the attacks of the lion the tyger or even the wolf to preserve the species therefore nature has concealed him in the depths of the vast deserts where the want of vegetables can attract no game and whence the want of game repels every voracious animal tyranny must have expelled man from the habitable parts of the earth before the camel could have lost his liberty become domestic he has rendered habitable the most barren soil the world contains he alone supplies all his masters wants the milk of the camel nourishes the family of the arab under the various forms of curds cheese and butter and they often feed upon his flesh slippers and harness are made of his skin and tents and clothing of his hair heavy burthens are transported by his means and when the earth denies forage to the horse so valuable to the bedouin the shecamel supplies that deficiency by her milk at no other cost for so many advantages than a few stalks of brambles or wormwood and pounded date kernels so great is the importance of the camel to the desert that were it deprived of that useful animal it must infallibly lose every inhabitant volney where any part of these deserts is sandy and level the horizon is as fit for astronomical observations as the sea and appears at a small distance to be no less a collection of water it was likewise equally surprising to observe in what an extraordinary manner every object appeared to be magified within it insomuch that a shrub seemed as big as a tree and a flock of achbobbas might be mistaken for a caravan of camels this seeming collection of water always advances about a quarter of

windings of confusion and error she conducts them to the fountains of enjoyment the burning heat of the sun was reflected with double violence from the hot sand and the distant ridges of the hills seen thro the ascending vapour seemed to wave and fluctuate like the unsettled sea mungo park i shake the lash over my camel and she quickens her pace while the sultry vapour rolls in waves over the burning cliffs moallakat poem of tarafa perhaps no traveller but mr park ever survived to relate similar sufferings i pushed on as fast as possible in hopes of reaching some wateringplace in the course of the night my thirst was by this time become insufferable my mouth was parched and inflamed a sudden dimness would frequently come over my eyes with other symptoms of fainting and my horse being very much fatigued i began seriously to apprehend that i should perish of thirst to relieve the burning pain in my mouth and throat i chewed the leaves of different shrubs but found them all bitter and of no service to me a little before sunset having reached the top of a gentle rising i climbed a high tree from the topmost branches of which i cast a melancholy look over the barren wilderness but without discovering the most distant trace of a human dwelling the same dismal uniformity of shrubs and sand every where presents itself and the horizon was as level and uninterrupted as that of the sea descending from the tree i found my horse devouring the stubble and brushwood with great avidity and as i was now too faint to attempt walking and my horse too much fatigued to carry me i thought it but an act of humanity and perhaps the last i should ever have it in my power to perform to take off his bridle and let him shift for himself in doing which i was suddenly affected with sickness and giddiness and falling upon the sand felt as if the hour of death was fast approaching here then thought i after a short but ineffectual struggle terminate all my hopes of being useful in my day and generation here must the short span of my life come to an endi cast as i believed a last look on the surrounding scene and whilst i reflected on the awful change that was about to take place this world with its enjoyments seemed to vanish from my recollection nature however at length resumed its functions and on recovering my senses i found myself stretched upon the sand with the bridle still in my hand and the sun just sinking behind the trees i now summoned all my resolution and determined to make another effort to prolong my existence and as the evening was somewhat cool i resolved to travel as far as my limbs would carry me in hopes of reaching my only resource a watering place with this view i put the bridle on my horse and driving him before me went slowly along for about an hour when i perceived some lightning from the north east a most delightful sight for it promised rain the darkness and lightning increased very rapidly and in less than an hour i heard the wind roaring among the bushes i had already opened my mouth to receive the refreshing drops which i expected but i was instantly covered with a cloud of sand driven with such force by the wind as to give a very disagreeable sensation to my face and arms and i was obliged to mount my horse and stop under a bush to prevent being suffocated the sand continued to fly in amazing quantities for near an hour after which i again set forward and travelled with difficulty until ten oclock about this time i was agreeably surprized by some very vivid flashes of lightning followed by a few heavy drops of rain in a little time the sand ceased to fly and i alighted and spread out all my clean clothes to collect the rain which at length i saw would certainly fallfor more than an hour it rained plentifully and i quenched my thirst by wringing and sucking my clothes parks travels in the interior of africa all the time i was in barbary i could never get sight of above three or four dromedaries these the arabs call mehera the singular is meheri they are of several sorts and degrees of value some worth many common camels others scarce worth two or three to look on they seem little different from the rest of that species only i think the excrescence on a dromedarys back is somewhat less than that of a camel what is reported of their sleeping or rather seeming scarce alive for some time after coming into this world is no fable the longer they lie so the more excellent they prove in their kind and consequently of higher price and esteem none lie in that trance more than ten days and nights these that do are pretty rare and are called ashari from aashara which signifies ten in arabick i saw one such perfectly white all over belonging to lella oumane princess of that noble arab neja named hayl ben ali i spoke of and upon which she put a very great value never sending it abroad but upon some extraordinary occasion when the greatest expedition was required having others inferior in swiftness for more ordinary messages they say that one of these aasharies will in one night and thro a level country traverse as much ground as any single horse can perform in ten which is no exaggeration of the matter since many have affirmed to me that it makes nothing of holding its rapid pace which is a most violent hard trot for four and twenty hours upon a stretch without shewing the least sign of weariness or inclination to bait and that having then swallowed a ball or two of sort of a paste made up of barleymeal and may be a little powder of dates among it with a bowl of water or camels milk if to be had and which the courier seldom forgets to be provided with in skins as well for the sustenance of himself as of his pegasus the indefatigable animal will seem as fresh as at first setting out and ready to continue running at the same scarce credible rate for as many hours longer and so on from one extremity of the african desarts to the other provided its rider could hold out without sleep and other refreshment this has been averred to me by i believe more than a thousand arabs and moors all agreeing in every particular i happened to be once in particular at the tent of that princess with ali ben mahamoud the bey or viceroy of the algerine eastern province when he went thither to celebrate his nuptials with ambarca her only daughter if i mistake not among other entertainments she gave her guests the favourite white dromedary was brought forth ready saddled and bridled i say bridled because the thong which serves instead of a bridle was put thro the hole purposely made in the gristle of the creatures nose the arab appointed to mount was straightly laced from the very loins quite to his throat in a strong leathern jacket they never riding these animals any otherwise accoutred so impetuously violent are the concussions the rider undergoes during that rapid motion that were he to be loose i much question whether a few hours such unintermitting agitation would not endanger the bursting of some of his entrails and this the arabs scruple not to acknowledge we were to be diverted with seeing this fine ashari run against some of the swiftest barbs in the whole neja which is famed for having good ones of the true libyan breed shaped like greyhounds and which will sometimes run down an ostridge which few of the very best can pretend to do especially upon a hard ground perfectly level we all started like racers and for the first spurt most of the best mounted among us kept up pretty well but our grass fed horses soon flagged several of the libyan and numidian runners held pace till we who still followed upon a good round hand gallop could no longer discern them and then gave out as we were told after their return when the dromedary had been out of our sight about half an hour we again espied it flying towards us with an amazing volocity and in a very few moments was among us and seemingly nothing concerned while the horses and mares were all on a foam and scarce able to breathe as was likewise a fleet tall greyhound bitch of the young princes who had followed and kept pace the whole time and was no sooner got back to us but lay down panting as if ready to expire i can not tell how many miles we went but we were near three hours in coming leisurely back to the tents yet made no stop in the way the young prince hamet ben al guydom ben sakhari and his younger brother messoud told their new brotherinlaw that they defied all the potentates of africa to shew him such an ashari and the arab who rode it challenged the bey to lay his lady a wager of ducats that he did not bring him an answer to a letter from the prince of wargala in less than four days tho leo africanus marmol and several others assure us that it is no less than forty spanish leagues of four miles each south of tuggurt to which place upon another occasion as i shall observe we made six tedious days march from the neighbourhood of biscara north of which we were then at least thirty hours riding if i remember rightly however the bey who was a native of biscara and consequently well acquainted with the sahara durst not take him up by all circumstances and the description given us besides what i know of the matter my self it could not be much less than miles and as many back again the fellow offered to ride in so short a time nay many other arabs boldly proffered to venture all they were worth in the world that he would perform it with all the ease imaginable morgans history of algiers chenier says the dromedary can travel leagues

exaggerated the royal couriers in persia wear a white sash girded from the shoulders to their waist many times round their bodies by which means they are enabled to ride for many days without great fatigue hanway we were here at once surprised and terrified by a sight surely the most magnificent in the world in that vast expanse of desert from w and to n w of us we saw a number of prodigious pillars of sand at different distances at times moving with great celerity at others stalking with a majestic slowness at intervals we thought they were coming in a very few moments to overwhelm us and small quantities of sand did actually more than once reach us again they would retreat so as to be almost out of sight their tops reaching to the very clouds there the tops often separated from the bodies and these once disjoined dispersed in the air and did not appear more sometimes they were broken near the middle as if struck with a large cannon shot about noon they began to advance with considerable swiftness upon us the wind being very strong at north eleven of them ranged alongside of us about the distance of three miles the greatest diameter of the largest appeared to me at that distance as if it would measure ten feet they retired from us with a wind at s e leaving an impression upon my mind to which i can give no name though surely one ingredient in it was fear with a considerable deal of wonder and astonishment it was in vain to think of flying the swiftest horse or fastest sailing ship could be of no use to carry us out of this danger and the full persuasion of this rivetted me as if to the spot where i stood on the th the same appearance of moving pillars of sand presented themselves to us only they seemed to be more in number and less in size they came several times in a direction close upon us that is i believe within less than two miles they began immediately after sunrise like a thick wood and almost darkened the sun his rays shining through them

spreading palm trees the terraced houses which seem to have no roof the lofty slender minarets all announce to the traveller that he is in another world almanzor riding one day with his courtiers along the banks of the tigris where seleucia formerly stood was so delighted with the beauty of the country that he resolved there to build his new capital whilst he was conversing with his attendants upon this project one of them separating from the rest met a hermit whose cell was near and entered into talk with him and communicated the design of the caliph the hermit replied he well knew by a tradition of the country that a city would one day be built in that plain but that its founder would be a man called moclas a name very different from both those of the caliph giaffar and almanzor the officer rejoined almanzor and repeated his conversation with the hermit as soon as the caliph heard the name of moclas he descended from his horse prostrated himself and returned thanks to god for that he was chosen to execute his orders his courtiers waited for an explanation of this conduct with eagerness and the caliph told them thus during the caliphate of the ommiades my brothers and myself being very young and possessing very little were obliged to live in the country where each in rotation was to provide sustenance for the whole on one of my days as i was without money and had no means of procuring food i took a bracelet belonging to my nurse and pawned it this woman made a great outcry and after much search discovered that i had been the thief in her anger she abused me plentifully and among other terms of reproach she called me moclas the name of a famous robber in those days and during the rest of her life she never called me by any other name therefore i know that god has destined me to perform this work marigny almanzor named his new city daralsalam the city of peace but it obtained the name of bagdat from that of this hermit who dwelt upon its site bagdat was founded in consequence of a singular superstition a sect called ravendiens conceived that they ought to render those honours to the caliphs which the moslem hold should only be paid to the deity they therefore came in great numbers to haschemia where the caliph almanzor usually resided and made around his palace the same processions and ceremonies which the moslem made around the temple at mecca the caliph prohibited this commanding them not to profane a religious ceremony which ought to be reserved solely to the temple at mecca the ravendiens did not regard the prohibition and continued to act as before almanzor seeing their obstinacy resolved to conquer it and began by arresting an hundred of these fanatics this astonished them but they soon recovered their courage took arms marched to the prison forced the doors delivered their friends and then returned to make their processions round the palace in reverence of the caliph enraged at this insolence the caliph put himself at the head of his guards and advanced against the ravendiens expecting that his appearance would immediately disperse them instead of this they resisted and repulsed him so vigorously that he had nearly fallen a victim but timely succours arrived and after a great slaughter these fanatics were expelled the town this singular rebellion arising from excess of loyalty so disgusted almanzor that he determined to forsake the town which had witnessed it and accordingly laid the foundation of bagdat marigny almanzor signifies the victorious the houses in persia are not in the same place with their shops which

adanaquicranes are so abundant that there is scarcely a house which has not several nests upon it they are very tame and the inhabitants never molest them when any thing disturbs these birds they make a violent clatter with their long beaks which is sometimes repeated by the others all over the town and this noise will sometimes continue for several minutes it is as loud as a watchmans rattle and not much unlike it in sound jackson the cranes were now arrived at their respective quarters and a couple had made their nest which is bigger in circumference than a bushel on a dome close by our

circumstantial accounts of what they conceive to have been the temple of belus the tower of nimrod or babel is situate on that side of tygris that arabia is and in a very great plaine distant from babylon seven or eight miles which tower is ruinated on every side and with the falling of it there is made a great mountaine so that it hath no forme at all yet there is a great part of it standing which is compassed and almost covered with the aforesayd fallings this tower was builded and made of fouresquare brickes which brickes were made of earth and dried in the sunne in maner and forme following first they layed a lay of brickes then a mat made of canes square as the brickes and instead of lime they daubed it with earth these mats of canes are at this time so strong that it is a thing woonderfull to beholde being of such great antiquity i have gone round about it and have not found any place where there hath bene any doore or entrance it may be in my judgement in circuit about a mile and rather lesse than more this tower in effect is contrary to all other things which are seene afar off for they seeme small and the more nere a man commeth to them the bigger they be but this tower afar off seemeth a very great thing and the nerer you come to it the lesser my judgement and reason of this is that because the tower is set in a very great plaine and hath nothing more about to make any shew saving the ruines of it which it hath made round about and for this respect descrying it afarre off that piece of the tower which yet standeth with the mountaine that is made of the substance that hath fallen from it maketh a greater shew than you shall finde comming neere to it cæsar frederick john eldred mentions the same deception being upon a plaine grounde it seemeth afarre off very great but the nerer you come to it the lesser and lesser it appeareth sundry times i have gone thither to see it and found the remnants yet standing about a quarter of a mile in

in that place runs westward appears a heap of ruined buildings like a huge mountain the materials of which are so confounded together that one knows not what to make of it its figure is square and rises in form of a tower or pyramid with four fronts which answer to the four quarters of the compass but it seems longer from north to s than from e to w and is as far as i could judge by my pacing it a large quarter of a league its situation and form correspond with that pyramid which strabo calls the tower of belus and is in all likelihood the tower of nimrod in babylon or babel as that place is still called in that authors time it had nothing remaining of the stairs and other ornaments mentioned by herodotus the greatest part of it having been ruined by xerxes and alexander who designed to have restored it to its former lustre was prevented by death there appear no marks of ruins without the compass of that huge mass to convince one that so great a city as babylon had ever stood there all one discovers within or paces of it being only the remains here and there of some foundations of buildings and the country round about it so flat and level that one can hardly believe it should be chosen for the situation of so great and noble a city as babylon or that there were ever any remarkable buildings on it but for my part i am astonished there appears so much as there does considering it is at least years since that city was built and that diodorus siculus tells us it was reduced almost to nothing in his time the height of this mountain of ruins is not in every part equal but exceeds the highest palace in naples it is a mishapen mass wherein there is no appearance of regularity in some places it rises in points is craggy and inaccessible in others it is smoother and is of easier ascent there are also tracks of torrents from the top to the bottom caused by the rains and both withinside and upon it one sees parts some higher and some lower it is not to be discovered whether ever there were any steps to ascend it or any doors to enter into it whence one may easily judge that the stairs ran winding about on the outside and that being the less solid parts they were soonest demolished so that not the least sign of any appears at present withinside one finds some grottos but so ruined that one can make nothing of them whether they were built at the same time with that work or made since by the peasants for shelter which last seems to be the most likely the mohammedans believe that these caverns were appointed by god as places of punishment for harut and marut two angels who they suppose were sent from heaven to judge the armies of men but did not execute their commissions as they ought it is evident from these ruins that the tower of nimrod was built with great and thick bricks as i carefully observed causing holes to be dug in several places for the purpose but they do not appear to have been burnt but dried in the sun which is extreme hot in those parts in laying these bricks neither lime nor sand was employed but only earth tempered and petrified and in those parts which made the floors there had been mingled with that earth which served instead of lime bruised reeds or hard straw such as large mats are made of to strengthen the work afterwards one perceives at certain distances in divers places especially where the strongest buttresses were to be several other bricks of the same size but more solid and burnt in a kiln and set in good lime or bitumen nevertheless the greatest number consists of those which are only dried in the sun i make no doubt but this ruin was the ancient babel and the tower of nimrod for besides the evidence of its situation it is acknowledged to be such by the people of the country being vulgarly called babil by the arabs pietro delle valle universal hist eight towers arise each above each immeasurable height a monument at once of eastern pride and slavish superstition round a scale

that of elwend towards teheran dherbelot olearius i shall transcribe a foreign piece of superstition firmly believed in many parts of france germany and spain the account of it and the mode of preparation appears to have been given by a judge in the latter there is a striking resemblance to the charm in macbeth of the hand of glory which is made use of by housebreakers to enter into houses at night without fear of opposition i acknowledge that i never tried the secret of the hand of glory but i have thrice assisted at the definitive judgment of certain criminals who under the torture confessed having used it being asked what it was how they procured it and what were its uses and properties they answered first that the use of the hand of glory was to stupify those to whom it was presented and to render them motionless insomuch that they could not stir any more than if they were dead secondly that it was the hand of a hanged man and thirdly that it must be prepared in the manner following take the hand left or right of a person hanged and exposed on the highway wrap it up in a piece of a shroud or winding sheet in which let it be well squeezed to get out any small quantity of blood that may have remained in it then put it into an earthen vessel with zimat saltpetre salt and long pepper the whole well powdered leave it fifteen days in that vessel afterwards take it out and expose it to the noontide sun in the dog days till it is thoroughly dry and if the sun is not sufficient put it into an oven heated with fern and vervain then compose a kind of candle with the fat of a hanged man virgin wax and sisame of lapland the hand of glory is used as a candlestick to hold this candle when lighted its properties are that wheresoever any one goes with this dreadful instrument the persons to whom it is presented will be deprived of all power of motion on being asked if there was no remedy or antidote to counteract this charm they said the hand of glory would cease to take effect and thieves could not make use of it if the threshold of the door of the house and other places by which they might enter were anointed with an unguent composed of the gall of a black cat the fat of a white hen and the blood of a screech owl which mixture must necessarily be prepared during the dog days grose provincial glossary and popular superstitions the habitations of the saints are always beside the sanctuary or tomb of their ancestors which they take care to adorn some of them possess close to their houses gardens trees or cultivated grounds and particularly some spring or well of water i was once travelling in the south in the beginning of october when the season happened to be exceedingly hot and the wells and rivulets of the country were all dried up we had neither water for ourselves nor for our horses and after having taken much fruitless trouble to obtain some we went and paid homage to a saint who at first pretended a variety of scruples before he would suffer infidels to approach but on promising to give him ten or shillings he became exceedingly humane and supplied us with as much water as we wanted still however vaunting highly of his charity and particularly of his disinterestedness chenier no nation in the world is so much given to superstition as the arabs or even as the mahometans in general they hung about their childrens necks the figure of an open hand which the turks and moors paint upon their ships and houses as an antidote and countercharm to an evil eye for five is with them an unlucky number and five fingers perhaps in your eyes is their proverb of cursing and defiance those who are grown up carry always about with them some paragraph or other of their koran which like as the jews did their phylacteries they place upon their breast or sow under their caps to prevent fascination and witchcraft and to secure themselves from sickness and misfortunes the virtue of these charms and scrolls is supposed likewise to be so far universal that they suspend them upon the necks of their cattle horses and other beasts of burthen shaw the handspell is still common in portugal it is called the figa and thus

derive their origin from king solomons studs however this may be they are fit to bear the greatest fatigues and can pass whole days without food they are also said to show uncommon courage against an enemy it is even asserted that when a horse of this race finds himself wounded and unable to bear his rider much longer he retires from the fray and conveys him to a place of security if the rider falls upon the ground his horse remains beside him and neighs till assistance is brought the kochlani are neither large nor handsome but amazingly swift the whole race is divided into several families

mount ephraim we were attended for above the space of an hour with an ignis fatuus that displayed itself in a variety of extraordinary appearances for it was sometimes globular or like the flame of a candle immediately after it would spread itself and involve our whole company in its pale inoffensive light then at once contract itself and disappear but in less than a minute it would again exert itself as at other times or else running along from one place to another with a swift progressive motion would expand itself at certain intervals over more than two or three acres of the adjacent mountains the atmosphere from the beginning of the evening had been remarkably thick and hazy and the dew as we felt it upon our bridles was unusually clammy and unctuous in the like disposition of

intense heat and falls afterwards into the zenati at a small distance from these hot fountains we have others which upon comparison are of as an intense a coldness and a little below them somewhat nearer the banks of the zenati there are the ruins of a few houses built perhaps for the conveniency of such persons who came hither for the benefit of the waters besides the strong sulphureous steams of the hammamj meskouteen we are to observe farther of them that their water is of so intense a heat that the rocky ground it runs over to the distance sometimes of a hundred foot is dissolved or rather calcined by it when the substance of these rocks is soft and uniform then the water by making every way equal impressions leaveth them in the shape of cones or hemispheres which being six foot high and a little more or less of the same diameter the arabs maintain to be so many tents of their predecessors turned into stone but when these rocks besides their usual soft chalky substance contain likewise some layers of harder matter not so easy to be dissolved then in proportion to the resistance the water is thereby to meet with we are entertained with a confusion of traces and channels distinguished by the arabs into sheep camels horses nay into men women and children whom they suppose to have undergone the like fate with their habitations i observed that the fountains which afforded this water had been frequently stopped up or rather ceasing to run at one place broke out immediately in another which circumstance seems not only to account for the number of cones but for that variety likewise of traces that are continued from one or other of these cones or fountains quite down to the river zenati j they call the thermæ of this country hammams from whence our hummums this place in riding over it giveth back such a hollow sound that we were afraid every moment of sinking thro it it is probable therefore that the ground below us was hollow and may not the air then which is pent up within these caverns afford as we may suppose in escaping continually thro these fountains that mixture of shrill murmuring and deep sounds which according to the direction of the winds and the motion of the external air issue out along with the water the arabs to quote their strength of imagination once more affirm these sounds to be the music of the jenoune fairies who are supposed in a particular manner to make their abodes at this place and to be the grand agents in all these extraordinary appearances there are other natural curiosities likewise at this place for

paradise to this was no passage but by an impregnable castle and daily preaching the pleasures of this paradise to the youth which he kept in his court sometimes would minister a sleepy drinke to some of them and then conveigh them thither where being entertained with these pleasures or days they supposed themselves rapt into paradise and then being again cast into a trance by the said drink he caused them to be carried forth and then would examine them of what they had seene and by this delusion would make them resolute for any enterprize which he should appoint them as to murther any prince his enemy for they feared not death in hope of their mahumetical paradise but haslor or ulan after years siege destroyed him and this his fools paradise purchas in another place purchas tells

to invalidate its truth even were the circumstances more probable travelling on further towards the south i arrived at a certaine countrey called melistorte which is a very pleasant and fertile place and in this countrey there was a certeine aged man called senex de monte who round about two mountaines had built a wall to inclose the sayd mountaines within this wall there were the fairest and most chrystall fountaines in the whole world and about the sayd fountaines there were most beautiful virgins in great number and goodly horses also and in a word every thing that could be devised for bodily solace and delight and therefore the inhabitants of the countrey call the same place by the name of paradise the sayd olde senex when he saw any proper and valiant young man he would admit him into his paradise moreover by certaine conducts he makes wine and milke to flow abundantly this senex when he hath a minde to revenge himselfe or to slay any king or baron commandeth him that is governor of the sayd paradise to bring thereunto some of the acquaintance of the sayd king or baron permitting him awhile to take his pleasure therein and then to give him a certeine potion being of force to cast him into such a slumber as should make him quite voide of all sense and so being in a profound sleepe to convey him out of his paradise who being awaked and seeing himselfe thrust out of the paradise would become so sorrowfull that he could not in the world devise what to do or whither to turne him then would he go unto the foresaide old man beseeching him that he might be admitted againe into his paradise who saith unto him you can not be admitted thither unlesse you will slay such or such a man for my sake and if you will give the attempt onely whether you kill him or no i wil place you againe in paradise that there you may remaine alwayes then would the party without faile put the same in execution indevouring to murther all those against whom the sayd olde man had conceived any hatred and therefore all the kings of the east stood in awe of the sayd olde man and gave unto him great tribute and when the tartars had subdued a great part of the world they came unto the sayd olde man and tooke from him the custody of his paradise who being incensed thereat sent abroad divers desperate and resolute persons out of his forenamed paradise and caused many of the

respecting the object in dispute i am come to inform you replied the heavenly visitor how to discharge this important duty of your religion he then ascended to the roof of the house and declared the ezann with a loud voice and in the same words which have been ever since used to declare the canonical periods when he awoke abdullah ran to declare his vision to the prophet who loaded him with blessings and authorized that moment bilal habeschy another of his disciples to discharge on the top of his house that august office by the title of muzzinn these are the words of the ezann most high

muezzinn ought to add after the words come to the temple of salvation the following prayer is to be preferred to sleep prayer is to be preferred to sleep this addition was produced by the zeal and piety of bilal habeschy as he announced one day the ezann of the dawn in the prophets antichamber aische in a whisper informed him that the celestial envoy was still asleep this first of the muezzinns then added these words prayer is to be preferred to sleep when he awoke the prophet applauded him and commanded bilal to insert them in all the morning ezanns the words must be chanted but with deliberation and gravity those particularly which constitute the profession of the faith the muezzinn must pronounce them distinctly he must pay more attention to the articulation of the words than to the melody of his voice he must make proper intervals and pauses and not precipitate his words but let them be clearly understood by the people he must be interrupted by no other object whatever during the whole ezann he must stand with a finger in each ear and his face turned as in prayer towards the keabe of mecca as he utters these words come to prayer come to the temple of salvation he

from the mercure historique et politique octob we have had in this country a new scene of vampirism which is duly attested by two officers of the tribunal of belgrade who took cognizance of the affair on the spot and by an officer in his imperial majestys troops at gradisch in sclavonia who was an eyewitness of the proceedings in the beginning of september there died at the village of kisilova three leagues from gradisch an old man of above threescore and two three days after he was buried he appeared in the night to his son and desired he would give him somewhat to eat and then disappeared the next day the son told his neighbours these particulars that night the father did not come but the next evening he made him another visit and desired something to eat it is not known whether his son gave him any thing or not but the next morning the young man was found dead in his bed the magistrate or bailiff of the place had notice of this as also that the same day five or six persons fell sick in the village and died one after the other he sent an exact account of this to the tribunal of belgrade and thereupon two commissioners were dispatched to the village attended by an executioner with instructions to examine closely into the affair an officer in the imperial service from whom we have this relation went also from gradiseh in order to examine personally an affair of which he had heard so much they opened in the first place the graves of all who had been buried in six weeks when they came to that of the old man they found his eyes open his colour fresh his respiration quick and strong yet he appeared to be stiff and insensible from these signs they concluded him to be a notorious vampire the executioner thereupon by the command of the commissioners struck a stake thro his heart and when he had so done they made a bonfire and therein consumed the carcase to ashes there was no marks of vampirism found on his son or on the bodies of the other persons who died so suddenly thanks be to god we are as far as any people can be from giving into credulity we acknowledge that all the lights of physick do not enable us to give any account of this fact nor do we pretend to enter into its causes however we can not avoid giving credit to a matter of fact juridically attested by competent and unsuspected witnesses especially since it is far from being the only one of the kind we shall here annex an instance of the same sort in already inserted in the gleaner no in a certain town of hungary which is called in latin oppida heidonum on the other side tibiscus vulgarly called the teysse that is to say the river which washes the celebrated territory of tokay as also a part of transilvania the people known by the name of heydukes believe that certain dead persons whom they call vampires suck the blood of the living insomuch that these people appear like skeletons while the dead bodies of the suckers are so full of blood that it runs out at all the passages of their bodies and even at their very pores this odd opinion of theirs they support by a multitude of facts attested in such a manner that they leave no room for doubt we shall here mention some of the most considerable it is now about five years ago that a certain heyduke an inhabitant of the village of medreiga whose name was arnold paul was bruised to death by a haycart which ran over him thirty days after his death no less than four persons died suddenly in that manner wherein according to the tradition of the country those people generally die who are sucked by vampires upon this a story was called to mind that this arnold paul had told in his lifetime viz that at cossova on the frontiers of the turkish servia he had been tormented by a vampire now the established opinion is that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a vampire himself and sucks in his turn but that he had found a way to rid himself of this evil by eating some of the earth out of the vampires grave and rubbing himself with his blood this precaution however did not hinder his becoming a vampire insomuch that his body being taken up forty days after his death all the marks of a notorious vampire were found thereon his complexion was fresh his hair nails and beard were grown he was full of fluid blood which ran from all parts of his body upon his shroud the hadnagy or bailiff of the place who was a person well acquainted with vampirism caused a sharp stake to be thrust as the custom is through the heart of arnold paul and also quite through his body whereupon he cried out dreadfully as if he had been alive this done they cut off his head burnt his body and threw the ashes thereof into saave they took the same measures with the bodies of those persons who had died of vampirism for fear that they should fall to sucking in their turns all these prudent steps did not hinder the same mischief from breaking out again about five years afterwards when several people in the same village died in a very odd manner in the space of three months seventeen persons of all ages and sexes died of vampirism some suddenly and some after two or three days suffering amongst others there was one stanoska the daughter of a heyduke whose name was jovitzo who going to bed in perfect health waked in the middle of the night and making a terrible outcry affirmed that the son of a certain heyduke whose name was millo and who had been dead about three weeks had attempted to strangle her in her sleep she continued from that time in a languishing condition and in the space of three days died what this girl had said discovered the son of millo to be a vampire they took up the body and found him so in effect the principal persons of the place particularly the physician and surgeons began to examine very narrowly how in spite of all their precautions vampirism had again broke out in so terrible a manner after a strict inquisition they found that the deceased arnold paul had not only sucked the four persons before mentioned but likewise several beasts of whom the new vampires had eaten particularly the son of millo induced by these circumstances they took a resolution of digging up the bodies of all persons who had died within a certain time they did so and amongst forty bodies there were found seventeen evidently vampires through the hearts of these they drove stakes cut off their heads burnt the bodies and threw the ashes into the river all the informations we have been speaking of were taken in a legal way and all the executions were so performed as appears by certificates drawn up in full form attested by several officers in the neighbouring garrisons by the surgeons of several regiments and the principal inhabitants of the place the verbal process was sent towards the latter end of last january to the council of war at vienna who thereupon established a special commission to examine into these facts those just now mentioned were attested by the hadnagi barriarer the principal heyduke of the village as also by battuer first lieutenant of prince alexander of wirtemberg flickstenger surgeon major of the regiment of furstemberg three other surgeons of the same regiment and several other persons a similar superstition prevails in greece the man whose story we are going to relate was a peasant of mycone naturally ill natured and quarrelsome this is a circumstance to be taken notice of in such cases he was murdered in the fields nobody knew how or by whom two days after his being buried in a chapel in the town it was noised about that he was seen to walk in the night with great haste that he tumbled about peoples goods put out their lamps griped them behind and a thousand other monkey tricks at first the story was received with laughter but the thing was looked upon to be serious when the better sort of people began to complain of it the papas themselves gave credit to the fact and no doubt had their reasons for so doing masses must be said to be sure but for all this the peasant drove his old trade and heeded nothing they could do after divers meetings of the chief people of the city of priests and monks it was gravely concluded that twas necessary in consequence of some musty ceremonial to wait till nine days after the interment should be expired on the tenth day they said one mass in the chapel where the body was laid in order to drive out the demon which they imagined was got into it after mass they took up the body and got every thing ready for pulling out its heart the butcher of the town an old clumsy fellow first opens the belly instead of the breast he groped a long while among the entrails but could not find what he looked for at last somebody told him he should cut up the diaphragm the heart was then pulled out to the admiration of all the spectators in the mean time the corpse stunk so abominably that they were obliged to burn frankincense but the smoke mixing with the exhalations from the carcass increased the stink and began to muddle the poor peoples pericranies their imagination struck with the spectacle before them grew full of visions it came into their noddles that a thick smoke came out of the body we durst not say twas the smoke of the incense they were incessantly bawling out vroucolacas in the chapel and place before it this is the name they give to these pretended redivivi the noise bellowed thro the streets and it seemed to be a name invented on purpose to rend the roof of the chapel several there present averrd that the wretches blood was extremely red the butcher swore the body was still warm whence they concluded that the deceasd was a very ill man for not being thoroughly dead or in plain terms for suffering himself to be reanimated by old nick which is the notion they have of vroucolacas they then roard out that name in a stupendous manner just at this time came in a flock of people loudly protesting they plainly perceived the body was not grown stiff when it was carried from the fields to church to be buried and that consequently it was a true vroucolacas which word was still the burden of the song i dont doubt they would have sworn it did not stink had not we been there so mazed were the poor people with this disaster and so infatuated with their notion of the dead being reanimated as for us who were got as close to the corpse as we could that we might be more exact in our observations we were almost poisoned with the intolerable stink that issued from it when they asked us what we thought of this body we told them we believed it to be very thoroughly dead but as we were willing to cure or at least not to exasperate their prejudiced imaginations we represented to them that it was no wonder the butcher should feel a little warmth when he groped among entrails that were then rotting that it was no extraordinary thing for it to emit fumes since dung turned up will do the same that as for the pretended redness of the blood it still appeared by the butchers hands to be nothing but a very stinking nasty smear after all our reasons they were of opinion it would be their wisest course to burn the dead mans heart on the seashore but this execution did not make him a bit more tractable he went on with his racket more furiously than ever he was accused of beating folks in the night breaking down doors and even roofs of houses clattering windows tearing clothes emptying bottles and vessels twas the most thirsty devil i believe he did not spare any body but the consul in whose house we lodged nothing could be more miserable than the condition of this island all the inhabitants seemed frighted out of their senses the wisest among them were stricken like the rest twas an epidemical disease of the brain as dangerous and infectious as the madness of dogs whole families quitted their houses and brought their tent beds from the farthest parts of the town into the public place there to spend the night they were every instant complaining of some new insult nothing was to be heard but sighs and groans at the approach of night the better sort of people retired into the country when the prepossession was so general we thought it our best way to hold our tongues had we opposed it we had not only been accounted ridiculous blockheads but atheists and infidels how was it possible to stand against the madness of a whole people those that believed we doubted the truth of the fact came and upbraided us with our incredulity and strove to prove that there were such things as vroucolacasses by citations out of the buckler of faith written by f richard a jesuit missionary he was a latin say they and consequently you ought to give him credit we should have got nothing by denying the justness of the consequence it was as good as a comedy to us every morning to hear the new follies committed by this night bird they charged him with being guilty of the most abominable sins some citizens that were most zealous for the good of the public fancied they had been deficient in the most material part of the ceremony they were of opinion that they had been wrong in saying mass before they had pulled out the wretches heart had we taken this precaution quoth they we had bit the devil as sure as a gun he would have been hanged before he would ever have come there again whereas saying mass first the cunning dog fled for it awhile and came back again when the danger was over notwithstanding these wise reflections they remained in as much perplexity as they were the first day they meet night and morning they debate they make professions three days and three nights they oblige the papas to fast you might see them running from house to house holywaterbrush in hand sprinkling it all about and washing the doors with it nay they poured it into the mouth of the poor vroucolacas we so often repeated it to the magistrates of the town that in xtendom we should keep the strictest watch a nights upon such an occasion to observe what was done that at last they caught a few vagabonds who undoubtedly had a hand in these disorders but either they were not the chief ringleaders or else they were released too soon for two days afterwards to make themselves amends for the lent they had kept in prison they fell foul again upon the wine tubs of those who were such fools as to leave their houses empty in the night so that the people were forced to betake themselves again to their prayers one day as they were hard at this work after having stuck i know not how many naked swords over the grave of this corpse which they took up three or four times a day for any mans whim an albaneze that happened to be at mycone took upon him to say with a voice of authority that it was to the last degree ridiculous to make use of the swords of xtians in a case like this can you not conceive blind as ye are says he that the handles of these swords being made like a cross hinders the devil from coming out of the body why do you not rather take the turkish sabres the advice of this learned man had no effect the vroucolacas was incorrigible and all the inhabitants were in a strange consternation they knew not now what saint to call upon when of a sudden with one voice as if they had given each other the hint they fell to bawling out all thro the city that it was intolerable to wait any longer that the only way left was to burn the vroucolacas intire that after so doing let the devil lurk in it if he could that twas better to have recourse to this extremity than to have the island totally deserted and indeed whole families began to pack up in order to retire to syre or tinos the magistrates therefore ordered the vroucolacas to be carryed to the point of the island st george where they prepared a great pile with pitch and tar for fear the wood as dry as it was should not burn fast enough of itself what they had before left of this miserable carcass was thrown into this fire and consumed presently twas on the first of january we saw the flame as we returned from delos it might justly be called a bonfire of joy since after this no more complaints were heard against the vroucolacas they said that the devil had now met with his match and some ballads were made to turn him into ridicule tournefort in these lines i have versified a passage in bishop taylors sermons altering as little as possible his unimproveable language for so have i known a luxuriant vine swell into irregular twigs and bold excrescencies and spend itself in leaves and little rings and afford but trifling clusters to the winepress and a faint return to his heart which longed to be refreshed with a full vintage but when the lord of the vine had caused the dressers to cut the wilder plant and made it bleed it grew temperate in its vain expence of useless leaves and knotted into fair and juicy branches and made accounts of that loss of blood by the return of fruit my readers will recollect the lenora the unwilling resemblance has been forced upon me by the subject i could not turn aside from the road because burger had travelled it before the old woman of berkely has been foolishly called an imitation of that inimitable ballad the likeness is of the same kind as between macedon and monmouth both are ballads and there is a horse in both how came mohareb to be sultan of this island every one who has read don quixote knows that there are always islands to be had by adventurers he killed the former sultan and reigned in his stead what could not a domdanielite perform the narration would have

a brace of the nearest greyhounds are slipped and the falconer galloping after them throws off his hawk the hare can not run long where the hawk behaves properly but sometimes getting the start of the dogs she gains the next hill and escapes it now and then happens when the hawk is fierce and voracious in an unusual degree that the hare is struck dead at the first stroke but that is very uncommon for the hawks preferred for hare hunting are taught to pounce and buffet the game not to seize it and they rise a little between each attack to descend again with fresh force in this manner the game is confused and retarded till the greyhounds come in russell the shaheen or falcon gentle flies at a more dangerous game were there not says the elder russell several gentlemen now in england to bear witness to the truth of what i am going to relate i should hardly venture to assert that with this bird which is about the size of a pigeon they sometimes take large eagles the hawk in former times was taught to seize the eagle under his pinion and thus depriving him of the use of one wing both birds fell to the ground together but i am informed the present mode is to teach the hawk to fix on the back between the wings which has the same effect only that the bird tumbling down more slowly the falconer has more time to come in to his hawks assistance but in either case if he be not very expeditious the falcon is inevitably destroyed dr patrick russell says this sport was disused in his time probably from its ending more frequently in the death of the falcon than of the eagle but he had often seen the shaheen take herons and storks the hawk when thrown off flies for some time in a horizontal line not six feet from the ground then mounting perpendicularly with astonishing swiftness he seizes his prey under the wing and both together come tumbling to the ground if the falconer is not expeditious the game soon disengages itself we saw about twenty antelopes which however were so very shy that we could not get near enough to have a shot nor do i think it possible to take them without hawks the mode usually practised in those countries the swiftest greyhounds would be of no use for the antelopes are much swifter of foot than any animal i ever saw before jacksons journey over land the persians train their hawks thus they take the whole skin of a stag of the head body and legs and stuff it with straw to the shape of the animal after fixing it in the place where they usually train the bird they place his food upon the head of the stuffed stag and chiefly in the two cavities of the eyes that the bird may strike there having accustomed him for several days to eat in this manner they fasten the feet of the stag to a plank which runs upon wheels which is drawn by cords from a distance and from day to day they draw it faster insensibly to accustom the bird not to quit his prey and at last they draw the stag by a horse at full speed they do the same with the wild boar the ass the fox the hare and other beasts of chasethey are even taught to stop a horseman at full speed nor will they quit him till the falconer recalls them and shows them their food tavernier as the persians are very patient and not deterred by difficulty they delight in training the crow in the same manner as the hawk tavernier i do not recollect in what history or romance there is a tale of two dogs trained in this manner to destroy a tyrant but i believe it is an historical fiction the farmers in norway believe that the eagle will sometimes attack a deer in this enterprize he makes use of this stratagem he soaks his wings in water and then covers them with sand and gravel with which he flies against the deers face and blinds him for a time the pain of this sets him running about like a distracted creature and frequently he tumbles down a rock or some steep place and breaks his neck thus he becomes a prey to the eagle pontoppidan i saw this appearance of death at a bullfightthe detestable amusement of the spaniards and portugueze to the honour of our country few englishmen visit these spectacles a second time they have a beast called an ounce spotted like a tyger but very gentle and tame a horseman carries it and on perceiving the gazelle lets it loose and tho the gazelle is incredibly swift it is so nimble that in three bounds it leaps upon the neck of its prey the gazelle is a sort of small antelope of which the country is full the ounce immediately strangles it with its sharp talons but if unluckily it misses its blow and the gazelle escapes it remains upon the spot ashamed and confused and at that moment a child might take or kill it without its attempting to defend itself tavernier the kings of persia are very fond of the chase and it is principally in that that they display their magnificence it happened one day that chasefi wished to entertain all the ambassadors who were at his court and there were then ministers there from tartary muscovy and india he led them to the chase and having taken in their presence a great number of large animals stags does hinds and wild boars he had them all dressed and eat the same day and while they were eating an architect was ordered to erect a tower in the middle of ispahan only with the heads of these animals the remains of it are yet to be seen when the tower was raised to its proper height the architect came exultingly to the king who was then at the banquet with the ambassadors and informed him that nothing was wanting to finish the work well but the head of some large beast for the point the prince in his drunkenness and with a design of showing the ambassadors how absolute he was over his subjects turned sternly to the architectyou are right said he and i do not know where

the persians are strangely superstitious about the burial of their kings for fearing lest by some magical art any enchantments should be practised upon their bodies to the prejudice of their children

preliminary discourse this mohammedan tale may be traced to the scripture whose worm dieth not the night léïlethulcadr is considered as being particularly consecrated to eneffable mysteries there is a prevailing opinion that a thousand secret and invisible prodigies are performed on this night that all the inanimate beings then pay their adoration to god that all the waters of the sea lose their saltness and become fresh at these mysterious moments that such in fine is its sanctity that prayers said during this night are equal in value to all those which can be said in a thousand successive months it has not however pleased god says the author of the celebrated theological work entitled ferkann to reveal it to the faithful no prophet no saint has been able to discover it hence this night

a physician of ragusa was deputed by that little republic to negotiate with the emperor of the turks before he embarked on this voyage he took into his service a boy of a red complection the only son of a widow a poor woman but a woman of honour and virtuous this envoy on his arrival at constantinople immediately addressed himself to the first physician of his imperial highness that thro his favour he might have more access to negociate for his country the mahometan had no sooner set eyes on the young ragusan than he employed every artifice to induce his master to leave him the boy himself at last wishing to remain at constantinople flattered by the fair prospects that were held out to him and touched with a tender and heroic compassion for her who had given him birth prayed his protector to leave him with the barbarian and carry to his mother the money which on that account he would receive so that the ragusan physician left his servant to the byzantian and received from him a purse of a thousand sequins after some days the italian went to take leave of the mohammedan physician and to thank him for his favours and he requested earnestly to see the redheaded boy before his departure the turk was obliged to own he had made poison of him and led him into a chamber where the naked body of the boy was still suspended by the feet the first master of the redheaded boy was greatly surprized at the sight and still more so when he heard that the boy had been beaten upon the belly for six hours by slaves who relieved one another till he died and that a poison was made of the last foam that came from his mouth so penetrating that if the stirrup of a horse were touched with the point of a pin that had been dipt in it he who should mount would immediately die plaidoyers historiques par m tristan in this volume the pleadings of the mother against the ragusan physician and his defence are given the mother says it is impossible that he being a physician himself should not have known for what the infidel physician wanted to purchase a redheaded boy as he himself would have made the same use of him had he not been afraid of the laws the rest is in the usual stile of tristans rhetoric as the moslem employed a redheaded christian in this manufactory it should seem that a turk ought to be used in christendom but as turks are not easily caught a jew might do in the islands of barlovento and in all the country of brazil in santa marta and in the new kingdom and in other countries where a cruel sort of indians inhabited they used another sort of poison for they would take the leg of an indian whom they had killed and hang it up in the air against the sun and fill it with many barbs of poisoned arrows which were taken out of the flesh of an indian which after some days they took out and without cleansing of them they dried them in the air where the sun did not come and then they headed their arrows with them and that became the most malevolent poison and the most hard to be cured in the world after the spaniards came into that country and waged war upon the indians they then made it with the flesh of spaniards whom they killed or took but more particularly they desired the flesh of some redheaded spaniard whose hairs were of a deep saffron colour for they were of opinion that there was more heat in that flesh and consequently more virulency in the poison which it produced but perhaps they may have heard it often said amongst the spaniards themselves that redheaded men are fit to make a composition of poison garcilassos royal commentaries of peru three ounces of a redhaired wench were among the ingredients of the witchcaldron in macbeth why redhair was supposed to be a symptom of leprosy was one of the questions proposed by michaelis to niebuhr and his fellowtravellers for investigation it is singular that at the time when these opinions prevailed universally golden locks should enter into almost every description of female beauty

than eastern gold and annual as he cropt the envied hair was yearly sold to ornament the fair the javanese had a method of procuring poison similar to the turkish receipt which i have employed the cameleon or indian salamander otherwise called gekko this creature which is not only found in brasil but also in the isle of java belonging to the east indies and which by our people is called gekko from its constant cry like among us that of the cuckoe is properly an indian salamander it is about a foot long its skin of of a pale or sea green colour with red spots the head is not unlike that of a tortoise with a streight mouth the eyes are very large starting out of the head with long and small eyeapples the tail is distinguished by several white rings its teeth are so sharp as to make an impression even upon steel each of its four legs had five crooked claws aimed on the end with nails its gait is very slow but wherever it fastens it is not easily removed it dwells commonly upon rotten trees or among the ruines of old houses and churches it oftentimes settles near the bedsteads which makes sometimes the moors pull down their huts its constant cry is gekko but before it begins it makes a kind of hissing noise the sting of this creature is so venomous that the wound proves mortal unless it be immediately burnt with a red hot iron or cut off the blood is of a palish colour resembling poison itself the javanese use to dip their arrows in the blood of this creature and those who deal in poisons among them an art much esteemed in the island of java by both sexes hang it up with a string tied to the tail on the cieling by which means it being exasperated to the highest pitch sends forth a yellow liquor out of its mouth which they gather in small pots set underneath and afterwards coagulate into a body in the sun this they continue for several months together by giving daily food to the creature it is unquestionably the strongest poison in the world its urine being of so corrosive a quality that it not only raises blisters wherever it touches the skin but turns the flesh black and causes a gangrene nieuhoff is there any analogy between a foam thus procured and the saliva of a mad dog the fiction of the upas is too well known from the botanic garden to need repetition suffice it here to remark that the tree is said to have sprung up as a punishment to the guilty islanders none of our early travellers mention this tree and they were too fond of wonders to omit so monstrous a tale had it been true it is curious that such a story should have been invented by a dutchman perhaps the seed of the upas is contained in the following passage neere unto the said iland java is another countrey called panten or tathalamasin in this land there are trees yeelding

danger thereof let him temper the dung of aman in water and so drinke a good quantity thereof and it expels the poyson immediately odoricus the minorite frier in hakluyt when any person is to be buried it is usual to bring the corpse at midday or afternoon prayers to one or other of these mosques from whence it is accompanied by the greatest part of the congregation to the grave their processions at these times are not so slow and solemn as in most parts of christendom for the whole company make what haste they can singing as they go along some select verses of their coran that absolute submission which they pay to the will of god allows them not to use any consolatory words upon these occasions no loss or misfortune is to be hereupon regretted or complained of instead likewise of such expressions of sorrow and condolence as may regard the deceased the compliments turn upon the person who is the nearest concerned a blessing say his friends be upon your head shaw all

chenier this custom of crowding about a funeral contributes to spread the plague in turkeyit is not many years since in some parts of worcestershire the mourners were accustomed to kneel with their heads upon the coffin during the burial service the fullest account of a mohammedan funeral is in the lettres sur la grece of m guys chance made him the spectator of a ceremony which the moslem will not suffer an infidel to prophane by his presence about ten in the morning i saw the gravedigger at work the slaves and the women of the family were seated in the burial ground many other women arrived and then they all began to lament after this prelude they one after the other embraced one of the little pillars which are placed upon the graves crying out ogloum ogloum soena mussaphir gueldi my son my son a guest is coming to see thee at these words their tears and sobs began anew but the storm did not continue long they all seated themselves and entered into conversation at noon i heard a confused noise and cries of lamentation it was the funeral which arrived a turk preceded it bearing upon his head a small chest four other turks carried the bier upon their shoulders then came the father the relations and the friends of the dead in great numbers their cries ceased at the entrance of the burial ground but then they quarrelledand for this the man who bore the chest opened it it was filled with copies of the koran a croud of turks young and old threw themselves upon the books and scrambled for them those who succeeded ranged themselves around the iman and all at once began to recite the koran almost as boys say their lesson each of the readers received ten parats about fifteen sols wrapt in paper it was then for these fifteen pence that these pious assistants had quarrelled and in our own country you might have seen them fight for less the bier was placed by the grave in which the gravedigger was still working and perfumes were burnt by it after the reading of the koran the iman chanted some arabic prayers and his fullchant would no doubt have appeared to you as it did to me very ridiculous all the turks were standing they held their hands open over the grave and answered amen to all the prayers which the iman addressed to god for the deceased the prayers finished a large chest was brought about six feet long and three broad its boards were very thick the coffin is usually made of cypress thus literally is verified the phrase of horace that the cypress is our last possession neque harum quas colis arborum te præter invisas cupressus ulla brevem dominum sequetur the cemeteries of the turks are usually planted with these trees to which they have a religious attachment the chest which was in loose pieces having been placed in the grave the coffin was laid in it and above planks with other pieces of wood then all the turks taking spades cast earth upon the grave to cover it this is a part of the ceremony at which all the bystanders assisted in their turn before the corpse is buried it is carried to the mosque then after having recited the fatka a prayer very similar to our lords prayer which is repeated by all present the iman asks the congregation what they have to testify concerning the life and morals of the deceased each then in his turn relates those good actions with which he was acquainted the body is then washed and wrapped up like a mummy so that it can not be seen drugs and spices are placed in the bier with it and it is carried to interment before it is lowered into the grave the iman commands silence saying cease your lamentations for a moment and let me instruct this moslem how to act when he arrives in the other world then in the ear of the corpse he directs him how to answer the evil spirit who will not fail to question him respecting his religion c this lesson finished he repeats the fatka with all the assistants and the body is let down into the grave after they have thrown earth three times upon the grave as the romans used they retire the iman only remains he approaches the grave stoops down inclines his ear and listens to hear if the dead disputes when the angel of death comes to take him then he bids him farewell and in order to be well paid never fails to report to the family the best news of the dead the turks bury not at all within the walls of the city but the great turkish emperors themselves with their wives and children about them and some few other of their great bassaes and those only in chappels by themselves built for that purpose all the rest of the turks are buried in the fields some of the better sort in tombs of marble but the rest with tombstones laid upon them or with two great stones one set up at the head and the other at the feet of every grave the greatest part of them being of white marble brought from the isle of marmora they will not bury any man where another hath been buried accounting it impiety to dig up another mans bones by reason whereof they cover all the best ground about the city with such great white stones which for the infinite number of them are thought sufficient to make another wall about the city knolles the turks bury by the wayside believing that the passengers will pray for the souls of the dead tavernier all that day we travelled over plains all covered with snow as the day before and indeed it is not only troublesome but very dangerous to travel thro these deep snows the mischief is that the beams of the sun which lie all day long upon it molest the eyes and face with such a scorching beat as very much weakens the sight whatever remedy a man can apply by wearing as the people of the country do a thin handkerchief of green or black silk which no way abates the annoyance chardin when they have to travel many days thro a country covered with snow travellers to preserve their sight cover the face with a silk kerchief made on purpose like a sort of black crape others have large furred bonnets bordered with goat skin and the long goathair hanging over the face is as serviceable as the crape tavernier an abyssinian historian says that the village called zinzenam rain upon rain has its name from an extraordinary circumstance that once happened in these parts for a shower of rain fell which was not properly of the nature of rain as it did not run upon the ground but remained very light having scarce the weight of feathers of a beautiful white colour like flower it fell in showers and occasioned a darkness in the air more than rain and liker to mist it covered the face of the whole country for several days retaining its whiteness the whole time then went away like dew without leaving any smell or unwholsome effect behind it so the dutch were formerly expelled from an east indian settlement because their consul in narrating to the prince of the country the wonders of europe chanced to say that in his own country water became a solid body once a year for some time when men or even horses might pass over it without sinkingthe prince in a rage said that he had hitherto listened to his tales with patience but this was so palpable a lie that he would never more be connected with europeans who only could assert such monstrous falshoods a strange account of the cedars of lebanon is given by de la roque voyage de syrie du mont liban this little forest is composed of twenty cedars of a prodigious size so large indeed that the finest planes sycamores and other large trees which we had seen could not be compared with them besides these principal cedars there were a great number of lesser ones and some very small mingled with the large trees or in little clumps near them they differed not in their foliage which resembles the juniper and is green throughout the year but the great cedars spread at their summit and form a perfect round whereas the small ones rise in a pyramidal form like the cypress both diffuse the same pleasant odour the large ones only yield fruit a large cone in shape almost like that of the pine but of a browner colour and compacter shell it gives a very pleasant odour and contains a sort of thick and transparent balm which oozes out thro small apertures and falls drop by drop this fruit which it is difficult to separate from the stalk contains a nut like that of the cypress it grows at the end of the boughs and turns its point upwards the nature of this tree is not to elevate its trunk or the part between the root and the first branches for the largest cedars which we saw did not in the height of their trunks exceed six or seven feet from this low but enormously thick body prodigious branches rise spreading as they rise and forming by the disposition of their boughs and leaves which point upward a sort of wheel which appears to be the work of art the bark of the cedar except at the trunk is smooth and shining of a brown colour its wood white and soft immediately under the bark but hard and red within and very bitter which renders it incorruptible and almost immortal a fragrant gum issues from the tree the largest cedar which we measured was seven feet in circumference wanting two inches and the whole extent of its branches which it was easy to measure from their perfect roundness formed a circumference of about feet the patriarch of the maronites fully persuaded of the rarity of these trees and wishing by the preservation of those that remain to shew his respect for a forest so celebrated in scripture has pronounced canonical pains and even excommunication against any christians who shall dare to cut them scarcely will he permit a little to be sometimes taken for crucifixes and little tabernacles in the chapels of our missionaries the maronites themselves have such a veneration for these cedars that on the day of transfiguration they celebrate the festival under them with great solemnity the patriarch officiates and says mass pontifically and among other exercises of devotion they particularly honour the virgin mary there and sing her praises because she is compared to the cedars of lebanon and lebanon itself used as a metaphor for the mother of christ the maronites say that the snows have no sooner begun to fall than these cedars whose boughs in their infinite number are all so equal in height that they appear to have been shorn and form as we have said a sort of wheel or parasolthan these cedars i say never fail at that time to change their figure the branches which before spread themselves rise insensibly gathering together it may be said and turn their points upward towards heaven forming altogether a pyramid it is nature they say who inspires this movement and makes them assume a new shape without which these trees never could sustain the immense weight of snow remaining for so long a time i have procured more particular information of this fact and it has been confirmed by the testimony of many persons who have often witnessed it this is what the secretary of the maronite patriarch wrote to me in one of his letters which i think it right to give in his own words cedri libani quas plantavit deus ut psalmist loquitur sitae sunt in planitie quâdam aliquantulum infra altissimum montislibani cacumen ubi tempore hyemali maxima nivium quantitas descendit tribusque ultra mensibus mordaciter dominatur cedri in altum ascendunt extensis tamen ramis in gyrum solo parallelis confioientibus suo gyro fere umbellam solarem sed superveniente nive quia coacervaretur in magnâ quantitate eos desuper neque possent pati tantum pondus tanto tempore premens sine certo fractionis discrimine natura rerum omnium provida mater ipsis concessit ut adveniente hyeme descendente nive statim rami in altum assurgant secum invicem uniti constituant quasi conum ut melius sese ab adveniente hoste tueantur naturá enim ipsâ verum est virtutem quamlebet unitam simul reddi fortiorem the cedars of lebanon which as the psalmist says god himself planted are situated in a little plain somewhat below the loftiest summit of mount lebanon where in the winter a great quantity of snow falls and continues for three months or longer the cedars are high but their boughs spread out parallel with the ground into a circle forming almost a shield against the sun but when the snow falls which would be heaped upon them in so great a quantity that they could not endure such a weight so long a time without the certain danger of breaking nature the provident mother of all has endued them with power that when the winter comes and the snow descends their boughs immediately rise and uniting together form a cone that they may be the better defended from the coming enemy for in nature itself it is true that virtue as it is united becomes stronger the coffee plant is about the size of the orange tree the flower in colour size and smell resembles the white jessamine the berry is first green then red in which ripe state it is gathered oleariuss description of coffee is amusing they drink a certain black water which they call cahwa made of a fruit brought out of egypt and which is in colour like ordinary wheat and in taste like turkish wheat and is of the bigness of

crust and is not pleasant to the palate amb travels it is well known how much the orientalists are addicted to this pretended science there is a curious instance of public folly in sir john chardins travels sephiemirza was born in the year of the egire for the superstition of the persians will not let us know the month or the day their addiction to astrology is such that they carefully conceal the moments of their princes birth to prevent the casting their nativities where they might meet perhaps with something which they should be unwilling to know at the coronation of this prince two astrologers were to be present with an astrolabe in their hands to take the fortunate hour as they term it and observe the lucky moments that a happy constellation should point out for proceedings of that importance sephiemirza having by debauchery materially injured his health the chief physician was greatly alarmed in regard his life depended upon the kings or if his life were spared yet he was sure to lose his estate and his liberty as happens to all those who attend the asiatic sovereigns when they die under their care the queen mother too accused him of treason or ignorance believing that since he was her sons physician he was obliged to cure him this made the physician at his wits end so that all his receipts failing him he bethought himself of one that was peculiarly his own invention and which few physicians would ever have found out as not being to be met with neither in galen nor hippocrates what does he then do but out of an extraordinary fetch of his wit he begins to lay the fault upon the stars and the kings astrologers crying out that they were altogether in the wrong that if the king lay in a languishing condition and could not recover his health it was because they had failed to observe the happy hour or the aspect of a fortunate constellation at the time of his coronation the stratagem succeeded the king was recrowned and by the new name of solyman chardin we have now to refute their errour who are persuaded that brazen heads made under certain constellations may give answers and be as it were guides and counsellors upon all occasions to those that had them in their possession among these is one yepes who affirms that henry de villeine made such a one at madrid broken to pieces afterwards by order of john king of castile the same thing is affirmed by bartholomew sibillus and the author of the image of the world of virgil by william of malmsbury of sylvester by john gower of robert of lincoln by the common people of england of roger bacon and by tostatus bishop of avilla george of venice delrio sibillus raguseus delancre and others too many to mention of albertus magnus who as the most expert had made an entire man of the same metal and had spent thirty years without any interruption in forming him under several aspects and constellations for example he formed the eyes according to the said tostatus in his commentaries upon exodus when the sun was in a sign of the zodiac correspondent to that part casting them out of divers metals mixt together and markd with the characters of the same signs and planets and their several and necessary aspects the same method he observed in the head neck shoulders thighs and legs all which were fashioned at several times and being put and fastened together in the form of a man had the faculty to reveal to the said albertus the solutions of all his principal difficulties to which they add that nothing be lost of the story of the statue that it was battered to pieces by st thomas meerely because he could not endure its excesse of prating but to give a more rational account of this androides of albertus as also of all these miraculous heads i conceive the original of this fable may well be deduced from the teraph of the hebrews by which as mr selden affirms many are of opinion that we must understand what is said in genesis concerning labans gods and in the first book of kings concerning the image which michol put into the bed in davids place for r eleazar holds that it was made of the head of a male child the first born and that deadborn under whose tongue they applyed a lamen of gold whereon were engraved the characters and inscriptions of certain planets which the jews superstitiously wandered up and down with instead of the urim and thummim or the ephod of the high priest and that this original is true and well deduced there is a manifest indicium in that henry dassia and bartholomæus sibillus affirm that the androides of albertus and the head made by virgil were composed of flesh and bone yet not by nature but by art but this being judged impossible by modern authors and the vertue of images annulets and planetary sigills being in great reputation men have thought ever since taking their opinion from trismegistus affirming in his asclepion that of the gods some were made by the sovereign god and others by men who by some art had the power to unite the invisible spirits to things visible and corporeal as is explained at large by st augustine that such figures were made of copper or some other metal whereon men had wrought under some favourable aspects of heaven and the planets my design is not absolutely to deny that he might compose some head or statue of man like that of memnon from which proceeded a small sound and pleasant noise when the rising sun came by his heat to rarify and force out by certain small conduits the air which in the cold of the night was condensed within it or haply they might be like those statues of boetius whereof cassiodorus speaking said metalla mugiunt diomedis in ære grues buccinant ænus anguis insibilat aves simulatæ fritinniunt et quæ propriam vocem nesciunt ab ære dulcedinem

the angel of death gives up also his records and receives another book in which are written the names of all those destined to die in the following year dohsson the balance of the dead is an article in almost every creed mohammed borrowed it from the persians i know not from whence the monks introduced it probably they were ignorant enough to have invented the obvious fiction in the vision of thurcillus the ceremony is accurately described at the end of the north wall within the church sate st paul and opposite him without was the devil and his angels at the feet of the devil a burning pit flamed up which was the mouth of the pit of hell a balance equally poised was fixed upon the wall between the devil and the apostle one scale hanging before each the apostle had two weights a greater and a less all shining and like gold and the devil also had two smoky and black ones therefore the souls that were all black came one after another with great fear and trembling to behold the weighing of their good and evil works for these weights weighed the works of all the souls according to the good or evil which they had done when the scale inclined to the apostle he took the soul and introduced it thro the eastern gate into the fire of purgatory that there it might expiate its crimes but when the scale inclined and sunk towards the devil then he and his angels snatched the soul miserably howling and cursing the father and mother that begot it to eternal torments and cast it with laughter and grinning into the deep and fiery pit which was at the feet of the devil of this balance of good and evil much may be found in the writings of the holy fathers matthew paris concerning the salvation of charlemagne archbishop turpin a man of holy life wrote thus i turpin archbishop of rheims being in my chamber in the city of vienna saying my prayers saw a legion of devils in the air who were making a great noise i adjured one of them to tell me from whence they came and wherefore they made so great an uproar and he replied that they came from aix la chapelle where a great lord had died and that they were returning in anger because they had not been able to carry away his soul i asked him who the great lord was and why they had not been able to carry away his soul he replied that it was charlemagne and that saint jago had been greatly against them and i asked him how st jago had been against them and he replied we were weighing the good and the evil which he had done in this world and saint jago brought so much timber and so many stones from the churches which he had founded in his name that they greatly overbalanced all his evil works and so we had no power over his soul and having said this the devil disappeared we must understand from this vision of archbishop turpin that they who build or repair churches in this world erect resting places and inns for their salvation historia do imperador carlos magno dos doze pares de frança two other

board capt coxon in company with three or four more privateers about four leagues to the east of portobel we took the packets bound thither from carthagena we opened a great quantity of the merchants letters and found the contents of many of them to be very surprizing the merchants of several parts of oldspain thereby informing their correspondents of panama and elsewhere of a certain prophecy that went about spain that year the tenor of which was that there would be english privateers that year in the westindies who would make such great discoveries as to open a door into the southseas which they supposed was fastest shut and the letters were accordingly full of cautions to their friends to be very watchful and careful of their coasts this door they spake of we all concluded must be the passage over land through the country of the indians of darien who were a little before this become our friends and had lately fallen out with the spaniards breaking off the intercourse which for some time they had with them and upon calling also to mind the frequent invitations we had from those indians a little before this time to pass through their country and fall upon the spaniards in the southseas we from henceforward began to entertain such thoughts in earnest and soon came to a resolution to make those attempts which we afterwards did with capt sharp coxon c so that the taking these letters gave the first life to those bold undertakings and we took the advantage of the fears the spaniards were in from that prophecy or probable conjecture or whatever it were for we sealed up most

allusion in the moallakat then i knew with certainty that in so fierce a contest with them many a heavy blow would make the perched birds of the brain fly quickly from every skull poem of antara in the bahardanush parrots are called the greenvested resemblers of heavens dwellers the following passages in the same work may perhaps allude to the same superstition or perhaps are merely metaphorical in the usual stile of its true oriental bombast the bird of understanding fled from the nest of my brain my joints and members seemed as if they would separate from each other and the bird of life would quit the nest of my body the bird of my soul became a captive in the net of her glossy ringlets i remember in a european magazine two similar lines by the author of the lives of the admirals my beating bosom is a wellwrought cage whence that sweet goldfinch hope shall neer elope the grave of francisco jorge the maronite martyr was visited by two strange birds of unusual size no one knew whence they came they emblemed says vasconcellos the purity and the indefatigable activity of his soul the inhabitants of otaheite have assigned a less respectable part of the body as the seat of the soul the disembowelling of the body there is always performed in great secrecy and with much religious superstition the bowels are by these people considered as the immediate organs of sensation where the first impressions are received and by which all the operations of the mind are carried on it is therefore natural to conclude that they may esteem and venerate the intestines as bearing the greatest affinity to the immortal part i have frequently held conversations on this subject with a view to convince them that all intellectual operations were carried on in the head at which they would generally smile and intimate that they had frequently seen men recover whose skulls had been fractured and whose heads had otherways been much injured but that in all cases in which the intestines had been wounded the persons on a certainty died other arguments they would also advance in favour of their belief such as the effect of fear and other passions which caused great agitation and uneasiness and would sometimes produce sickness at the stomach which they attributed intirely to the action of the bowels vancouver when hosein the son of ali was sick of a grievous disorder he longed for a pomegranate tho that fruit was not then in season ali went out and diligently enquiring found a single one in the possession of a jew as he returned with it a sick man met him and begged half the pomegranate saying it would restore his health ali gave him half and when he had eaten it the man requested he would give him the other half the sooner to complete his recovery ali benignantly complied returned to his son and told him what had happened and hosein approved what his father had done immediately behold a miracle as they were talking together the door was gently knocked at he ordered the woman servant to go there and she found a man of all men the most beautiful who had a plate in his hand covered with green silk in which were ten pomegranates the woman was astonished at the beauty of the man and of the pomegranates and she took one of them and hid it and carried the other nine to aly who kissed the present when he had counted them he found that one was wanting and said so to the servant she confessed that she had taken it on account of its excellence and ali gave her her liberty the pomegranates were from paradise hosein was cured of his disease only by their odour and rose up immediately recovered and in full strength maracci i suspect says maracci that this is a true miracle wrought by some christian saint and falsely attributed to ali however this may be it does not appear absurd that god should by some especial favour reward an act of remarkable charity even in an infidel as he has sometimes by a striking chastisement punished enormous crimes but the assertion that the pomegranates were sent from paradise exposes the fable maracci after detailing and ridiculing the mohammedan miracles contrasts with them in an appendix a few of the real and permanent miracles of christianity which are proved by the testimony of the whole world he selects five as examples the chapel of loretto brought by angels from nazareth to illyricum and from illyricum to italy faithful messengers having been sent to both places and finding in both its old foundations in dimensions and materials exactly corresponding the cross of st thomas in urbe malipuritana masulipatan in the e indies a bramin as the saint was extended upon his cross in prayer slew him on the anniversary of his martyrdom during the celebration of mass the cross gradually becomes luminous till it shines one white glory at elevating the host it resumes its natural colour and sweats blood profusely in which the faithful dip their clothes by which many miracles are wrought certissimum quia evidentissimumat barii bari on the adriatic in apulia a liquor flows from the bones of st nicholas they call it st nicholass manna which being preserved in

of the mohammedan ones that they are tricks of the devil in the bahardanush the simorg is mentioned as a genusnot an individual this is heresythe unity of the simorg being expressed in all the books of canonical romance the simorg is a monstrous bird like a griffin in the history of caherman he is made to say that he had existed through all the revolutions of ages and of created things which passed before the time of adam these created things were reasonable beings but had not human shape they were governed by the various solomons mentioned in the note vol i page araf is a place between the paradise and the hell of the mohammedans some deem it a veil of separation some a strong wall others hold it to be a purgatory in which those believers will remain whose good and evil works have been so equal that they were neither virtuous enough to enter paradise nor guilty enough to be condemned to the fire of hell from thence they see the glory of the blessed and are near enough to congratulate them but their ardent desire to partake the same happiness becomes a great pain at length at the day of judgement when all men before they are judged shall be cited to render homage to their creator those who are here confined shall prostrate themselves before the face of the lord in adoration and by this act of religion which shall be accounted a merit the number of their good works will exceed their evil ones and they will enter into glory saadi says that araf appears a hell to the happy and a paradise to the damned dherbelot
