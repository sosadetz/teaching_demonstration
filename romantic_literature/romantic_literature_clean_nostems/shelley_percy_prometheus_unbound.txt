modified by edition and by the bodleian fair copy in the following notes b the bodleian manuscript the editio princeps printed by marchant for c and j ollier london and the text as edited by mrs shelley in the poetical works st and nd editions the reader should consult the notes on the play at the end of the volume preface the greek tragic writers in selecting as their subject any portion of their national history or mythology employed in their treatment of it a certain arbitrary discretion they by no means conceived themselves bound to adhere to the common interpretation or to imitate in story as in title their rivals and predecessors such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition the agamemnonian story was exhibited on the athenian theatre with as many variations as dramas i have presumed to employ a similar license the prometheus unbound of aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of jupiter with his victim as the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by the consummation of his marriage with thetis thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art it creates but it creates by combination and representation poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both every mans mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age from this subjection the loftiest do not escape there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model the having spoken of myself with unaffected freedom will need little apology with the candid and let the uncandid consider that they injure me less than their own hearts and minds by misrepresentation whatever talents a person may possess to amuse and instruct others be they ever so inconsiderable he is yet bound to exert them if his attempt be ineffectual let the punishment of an unaccomplished purpose have been sufficient let none trouble themselves to heap the dust of oblivion upon his efforts the pile they raise will betray his grave which might otherwise have been unknown dramatis personae prometheus demogorgon jupiter the

slaves whom thou requitest for kneeworship prayer and praise and toil and hecatombs of broken hearts with fear and selfcontempt and barren hope whilst me who am thy foe eyeless in hate hast thou made reign and triumph to thy scorn oer mine own misery and thy vain revenge three thousand years of sleepunsheltered hours and moments aye divided by keen pangs till they seemed years torture and solitude scorn and despairthese are mine empire more glorious far than that which thou surveyest from thine unenvied throne o mighty god almighty had i deigned to share the shame of thine ill tyranny and hung not here nailed to this wall of eaglebaffling mountain black wintry dead unmeasured without herb insect or beast or shape or sound of life ah me alas pain pain ever for ever no change no pause no hope yet i endure i ask the earth have not the mountains felt i ask yon heaven the allbeholding sun has it not seen the sea in storm or calm heavens everchanging shadow spread below have its deaf waves not heard my agony ah me alas pain pain ever for ever the crawling glaciers pierce me with the spears of their moonfreezing crystals the bright chains eat with their burning cold into my bones heavens winged hound polluting from thy lips his beak in poison not his own tears up my heart and shapeless sights come wandering by the ghastly people of the realm of dream mocking me and the earthquakefiends are charged to wrench the rivets from my quivering wounds when the rocks split and close again behind while from their loud abysses howling throng the genii of the storm urging the rage of whirlwind and afflict me with keen hail and yet to me welcome is day and night whether one breaks the hoarfrost of the morn or starry dim and slow the other climbs the leadencoloured east for then they lead the wingless crawling hours one among whom as some dark priest hales the reluctant victim shall drag thee cruel king to kiss the blood from these pale feet which then might trample thee if they disdained not such a prostrate slave disdain ah no i pity thee what ruin will hunt thee undefended through wide heaven how will thy soul cloven to its depth with terror gape like a hell within i speak in grief not exultation for i hate no more as then ere misery made me wise the curse once breathed on thee i would recall ye mountains whose manyvoiced echoes through the mist of cataracts flung the thunder of that spell ye icy springs stagnant with wrinkling frost which vibrated to hear me and then crept shuddering through india thou serenest air through which the sun walks burning without beams and ye swift whirlwinds who on poised wings hung mute and moveless oer yon hushed abyss as thunder louder than your own made rock the orbed world if then my words had power though i am changed so that aught evil wish is dead within although no memory be of what is hate let them not lose it now what was that curse for ye all heard me speak note thro wide b thro the wide first voice from the mountains thrice three hundred thousand years oer the earthquakes couch we stood oft as men convulsed with fears we trembled in our multitude second voice from the springs thunderbolts had parched our water we had been stained with bitter blood and had run mute mid shrieks of slaughter thro a city and a solitude third voice from the air i had clothed since earth uprose its wastes in colours not their own and oft had my serene repose been cloven by many a rending groan fourth voice from the whirlwinds we had soared beneath these mountains unresting ages nor had thunder nor yon volcanos flaming fountains nor any power above or under ever made us mute with wonder first voice but never bowed our snowy crest as at the voice of thine unrest second voice never such a sound before to the indian waves we bore a pilot asleep on the howling sea leaped up from the deck in agony and heard and cried ah woe is me and died as mad as the wild waves be third voice by such dread words from earth to heaven my still realm was never riven when its wound was closed there stood darkness oer the day like blood fourth voice and we shrank back for dreams of ruin to frozen caves our flight pursuing made us keep silencethusand thus though silence is a hell to us the earth the tongueless caverns of the craggy hills cried misery then the hollow heaven replied misery and the oceans purple waves climbing the land howled to the lashing winds and the pale nations heard it misery note as hell b a hell prometheus i hear a sound of voices not the voice which i gave forth mother thy sons and thou scorn him without whose allenduring will beneath the fierce omnipotence of jove both they and thou had vanished like thin mist unrolled on the morning wind know ye not me the titan he who made his agony the barrier to your else allconquering foe oh rockembosomed lawns and snowfed streams now seen athwart frore vapours deep below through whose oershadowing woods i wandered once with asia drinking life from her loved eyes why scorns the spirit which informs ye now to commune with me me alone who checked as one who checks a fienddrawn charioteer the falsehood and the force of him who reigns supreme and with the groans of pining slaves fills your dim glens and liquid wildernesses why answer ye not still brethren the earth they dare not prometheus who dares for i would hear that curse again ha what an awful whisper rises up tis scarce like sound it tingles through the frame as lightning tingles hovering ere it strike speak spirit from thine inorganic voice i only know that thou art moving near and love how cursed i him the earth how canst thou hear who knowest not the language of the dead prometheus thou art a living spirit speak as they the earth i dare not speak like life lest heavens fell king should hear and link me to some wheel of pain more torturing than the one whereon i roll subtle thou art and good and though the gods hear not this voice yet thou art more than god being wise and kind earnestly hearken now prometheus obscurely through my brain like shadows dim sweep awful thoughts rapid and thick i feel faint like one mingled in entwining love yet tis not pleasure the earth no thou canst not hear thou art immortal and this tongue is known only to those who die prometheus and what art thou o melancholy voice the earth i am the earth thy mother she within whose stony veins to the last fibre of the loftiest tree whose thin leaves trembled in the frozen air joy ran as blood within a living frame when thou didst from her bosom like a cloud of glory arise a spirit of keen joy and at thy voice her pining sons uplifted their prostrate brows from the polluting dust and our almighty tyrant with fierce dread grew pale until his thunder chained thee here then see those million worlds which burn and roll around us their inhabitants beheld my sphered light wane in wide heaven the sea was lifted by strange tempest and new fire from earthquakerifted mountains of bright snow shook its portentous hair beneath heavens frown lightning and inundation vexed the plains blue thistles bloomed in cities foodless toads within voluptuous chambers panting crawled when plague had fallen on man and beast and worm and famine and black blight on herb and tree and in the corn and vines and meadowgrass teemed ineradicable poisonous weeds draining their growth for my wan breast was dry with grief and the thin air my breath was stained with the contagion of a mothers hate breathed on her childs destroyer ay i heard thy curse the which if thou rememberest not yet my innumerable seas and streams mountains and caves and winds and yon wide air and the inarticulate people of the dead preserve a treasured spell we meditate in secret joy and hope those dreadful words but dare not speak them note and love and lovest cj swinburne prometheus venerable mother all else who live and suffer take from thee some comfort flowers and fruits and happy sounds and love though fleeting these may not be mine but mine own words i pray deny me not the earth they shall be told ere babylon was dust the magus zoroaster my dead child met his own image walking in the garden that apparition sole of men he saw for know there are two worlds of life and death one that which thou beholdest but the other is underneath the grave where do inhabit the shadows of all forms that think and live till death unite them and they part no more dreams and the light imaginings of men and all that faith creates or love desires terrible strange sublime and beauteous shapes there thou art and dost hang a writhing shade mid whirlwindpeopled mountains all the gods are there and all the powers of nameless worlds vast sceptred phantoms heroes men and beasts and demogorgon a tremendous gloom and he the supreme tyrant on his throne of burning gold son one of these shall utter the curse which all remember call at will thine own ghost or the ghost of jupiter hades or typhon or what mightier gods from allprolific evil since thy ruin have sprung and trampled on my prostrate sons ask and they must reply so the revenge of the supreme may sweep through vacant shades as rainy wind through the abandoned gate of a fallen palace prometheus mother let not aught of that which may be evil pass again my lips or those of aught resembling me phantasm of jupiter arise appear ione my wings are folded oer mine ears my wings are crossed oer mine eyes yet through their silver shade appears and through their lulling plumes arise a shape a throng of sounds may it be no ill to thee o thou of many wounds near whom for our sweet sisters sake ever thus we watch and wake panthea the sound is of whirlwind underground earthquake and fire and mountains cloven the shape is awful like the sound clothed in dark purple starinwoven a sceptre of pale gold to stay steps proud oer the slow cloud his veined hand doth hold cruel he looks but calm and strong like one who does not suffers wrong phantasm of jupiter why have the secret powers of this strange world driven me a frail and empty phantom hither on direst storms what unaccustomed sounds are hovering on my lips unlike the voice with which our pallid race hold ghastly talk in darkness and proud sufferer who art thou prometheus tremendous image as thou art must be he whom thou shadowest forth i am his foe the titan speak the words which i would hear although no thought inform thine empty voice the earth listen and though your echoes must be mute grey mountains and old woods and haunted springs prophetic caves and islesurrounding streams rejoice to hear what yet ye can not speak phantasm a spirit seizes me and speaks within it tears me as fire tears a thundercloud panthea see how he lifts his mighty looks the heaven darkens above ione he speaks o shelter me prometheus i see the curse on gestures proud and cold and looks of firm defiance and calm hate and such despair as mocks itself with smiles written as on a scroll yet speak oh speak phantasm fiend i defy thee with a calm fixed mind all that thou canst inflict i bid thee do foul tyrant both of gods and humankind one only being shalt thou not subdue rain then thy plagues upon me here ghastly disease and frenzying fear and let alternate frost and fire eat into me and be thine ire lightning and cutting hail and legioned forms of furies driving by upon the wounding storms ay do thy worst thou art omnipotent oer all things but thyself i gave thee power and my own will be thy swift mischiefs sent to blast mankind from yon ethereal tower let thy malignant spirit move in darkness over those i love on me and mine i imprecate the utmost torture of thy hate and thus devote to sleepless agony this undeclining head while thou must reign on high but thou who art the god and lord o thou who fillest with thy soul this world of woe to whom all things of earth and heaven do bow in fear and worship allprevailing foe i curse thee let a sufferers curse clasp thee his torturer like remorse till thine infinity shall be a robe of envenomed agony and thine omnipotence a crown of pain to cling like burning gold round thy dissolving brain heap on thy soul by virtue of this curse ill deeds then be thou damned beholding good both infinite as is the universe and thou and thy selftorturing solitude an awful image of calm power though now thou sittest let the hour come when thou must appear to be that which thou art internally and after many a false and fruitless crime scorn track thy lagging fall through boundless space and time prometheus were these my words o parent the earth they were thine prometheus it doth repent me words are quick and vain grief for awhile is blind and so was mine i wish no living thing to suffer pain the earth misery oh misery to me that jove at length should vanquish thee wail howl aloud land and sea the earths rent heart shall answer ye howl spirits of the living and the dead your refuge your defence lies fallen and vanquished first echo lies fallen and vanquished second echo fallen and vanquished ione fear not tis but some passing spasm the titan is unvanquished still but see where through the azure chasm of yon forked and snowy hill trampling the slant winds on high with goldensandalled feet that glow under plumes of purple dye like roseensanguined ivory a shape comes now stretching on high from his right hand a serpentcinctured wand panthea tis joves worldwandering herald mercury ione and who are those with hydra tresses and iron wings that climb the wind whom the frowning god represses like vapours steaming up behind clanging loud an endless crowd panthea these are joves tempestwalking hounds whom he gluts with groans and blood when charioted on sulphurous cloud he bursts heavens bounds ione are they now led from the thin dead on new pangs to be fed panthea the titan looks as ever firm not proud first fury ha i scent life second fury let me but look into his eyes third fury the hope of torturing him smells like a heap of corpses to a deathbird after battle first fury darest thou delay o herald take cheer hounds of hell what if the son of maia soon should make us food and sportwho can please long the omnipotent mercury back to your towers of iron and gnash beside the streams of fire and wail your foodless teeth geryon arise and gorgon chimaera and thou sphinx subtlest of fiends who ministered to thebes heavens poisoned wine unnatural love and more unnatural hate these shall perform your task first fury oh mercy mercy we die with our desire drive us not back mercury crouch then in silence awful sufferer to thee unwilling most unwillingly i come by the great fathers will driven down to execute a doom of new revenge alas i pity thee and hate myself that i can do no more aye from thy sight returning for a season heaven seems hell so thy worn form pursues me night and day smiling reproach wise art thou firm and good but vainly wouldst stand forth alone in strife against the omnipotent as yon clear lamps that measure and divide the weary years from which there is no refuge long have taught and long must teach even now thy torturer arms with the strange might of unimagined pains the powers who scheme slow agonies in hell and my commission is to lead them here or what more subtle foul or savage fiends people the abyss and leave them to their task be it not so there is a secret known to thee and to none else of living things which may transfer the sceptre of wide heaven the fear of which perplexes the supreme clothe it in words and bid it clasp his throne in intercession bend thy soul in prayer and like a suppliant in some gorgeous fane let the will kneel within thy haughty heart for benefits and meek submission tame the fiercest and the mightiest prometheus evil minds change good to their own nature i gave all he has and in return he chains me here years ages night and day whether the sun split my parched skin or in the moony night the crystalwinged snow cling round my hair whilst my beloved race is trampled down by his thoughtexecuting ministers such is the tyrants recompense tis just he who is evil can receive no good and for a world bestowed or a friend lost he can feel hate fear shame not gratitude he but requites me for his own misdeed kindness to such is keen reproach which breaks with bitter stings the light sleep of revenge submission thou dost know i can not try for what submission but that fatal word the deathseal of mankinds captivity like the sicilians hairsuspended sword which trembles oer his crown would he accept or could i yield which yet i will not yield let others flatter crime where it sits throned in brief omnipotence secure are they for justice when triumphant will weep down pity not punishment on her own wrongs too much avenged by those who err i wait enduring thus the retributive hour which since we spake is even nearer now but hark the hellhounds clamour fear delay behold heaven lowers under thy fathers frown mercury oh that we might be spared i to inflict and thou to suffer once more answer me thou knowest not the period of joves power prometheus i know but this that it must come mercury alas thou canst not count thy years to come of pain prometheus they last while jove must reign nor more nor less do i desire or fear mercury yet pause and plunge into eternity where recorded time even all that we imagine age on age seems but a point and the reluctant mind flags wearily in its unending flight till it sink dizzy blind lost shelterless perchance it has not numbered the slow years which thou must spend in torture unreprieved prometheus perchance no thought can count them yet they pass mercury if thou mightst dwell among the gods the while lapped in voluptuous joy prometheus i would not quit this bleak ravine these unrepentant pains mercury alas i wonder at yet pity thee prometheus pity the selfdespising slaves of heaven not me within whose mind sits peace serene as light in the sun throned how vain is talk call up the fiends ione o sister look white fire has cloven to the roots yon huge snowloaded cedar how fearfully gods thunder howls behind mercury i must obey his words and thine alas most heavily remorse hangs at my heart panthea see where the child of heaven with winged feet runs down the slanted sunlight of the dawn ione dear sister close thy plumes over thine eyes lest thou behold and die they come they come blackening the birth of day with countless wings and hollow underneath like death first fury prometheus second fury immortal titan third fury champion of heavens slaves prometheus he whom some dreadful voice invokes is here prometheus the chained titan horrible forms what and who are ye never yet there came phantasms so foul through monsterteeming hell from the allmiscreative brain of jove whilst i behold such execrable shapes methinks i grow like what i contemplate and laugh and stare in loathsome sympathy first fury we are the ministers of pain and fear and disappointment and mistrust and hate and clinging crime and as lean dogs pursue through wood and lake some struck and sobbing fawn we track all things that weep and bleed and live when the great king betrays them to our will prometheus oh many fearful natures in one name i know ye and these lakes and echoes know the darkness and the clangour of your wings but why more hideous than your loathed selves gather ye up in legions from the deep second fury we knew not that sisters rejoice rejoice prometheus can aught exult in its deformity second fury the beauty of delight makes lovers glad gazing on one another so are we as from the rose which the pale priestess kneels to gather for her festal crown of flowers the aereal crimson falls flushing her cheek so from our victims destined agony the shade which is our form invests us round else we are shapeless as our mother night prometheus i laugh your power and his who sent you here to lowest scorn pour forth the cup of pain first fury thou thinkest we will rend thee bone from bone and nerve from nerve working like fire within prometheus pain is my element as hate is thine ye rend me now i care not second fury dost imagine we will but laugh into thy lidless eyes prometheus i weigh not what ye do but what ye suffer being evil cruel was the power which called you or aught else so wretched into light third fury thou thinkst we will live through thee one by one like animal life and though we can obscure not the soul which burns within that we will dwell beside it like a vain loud multitude vexing the selfcontent of wisest men that we will be dread thought beneath thy brain and foul desire round thine astonished heart and blood within thy labyrinthine veins crawling like agony prometheus why ye are thus now yet am i king over myself and rule the torturing and conflicting throngs within as jove rules you when hell grows mutinous chorus of furies from the ends of the earth from the ends of the earth where the night has its grave and the morning its birth come come come oh ye who shake hills with the scream of your mirth when cities sink howling in ruin and ye who with wingless footsteps trample the sea and close upon shipwreck and famines track sit chattering with joy on the foodless wreck come come come leave the bed low cold and red strewed beneath a nation dead leave the hatred as in ashes fire is left for future burning it will burst in bloodier flashes when ye stir it soon returning leave the selfcontempt implanted in young spirits senseenchanted miserys yet unkindled fuel leave hells secrets half unchanted to the maniac dreamer cruel more than ye can be with hate is he with fear come come come we are steaming up from hells wide gate and we burthen the blast of the atmosphere but vainly we toil till ye come here ione sister i hear the thunder of new wings panthea these solid mountains quiver with the sound even as the tremulous air their shadows make the space within my plumes more black than night first fury your call was as a winged car driven on whirlwinds fast and far it rapped us from red gulfs of war second fury from wide cities faminewasted third fury groans half heard and blood untasted fourth fury kingly conclaves stern and cold where blood with gold is bought and sold fifth fury from the furnace white and hot in which a fury speak not whisper not i know all that ye would tell but to speak might break the spell which must bend the invincible the stern of thought he yet defies the deepest power of hell fury tear the veil another fury it is torn chorus the pale stars of the morn shine on a misery dire to be borne dost thou faint mighty titan we laugh thee to scorn dost thou boast the clear knowledge thou wakendst for man then was kindled within him a thirst which outran those perishing waters a thirst of fierce fever hope love doubt desire which consume him for ever one came forth of gentle worth smiling on the sanguine earth his words outlived him like swift poison withering up truth peace and pity look where round the wide horizon many a millionpeopled city vomits smoke in the bright air mark that outcry of despair tis his mild and gentle ghost wailing for the faith he kindled look again the flames almost to a glowworms lamp have dwindled the survivors round the embers gather in dread joy joy joy past ages crowd on thee but each one remembers and the future is dark and the present is spread like a pillow of thorns for thy slumberless head note hark b mark semichorus drops of bloody agony flow from his white and quivering brow grant a little respite now see a disenchanted nation springs like day from desolation to truth its state is dedicate and freedom leads it forth her mate a legioned band of linked brothers whom love calls children semichorus tis anothers see how kindred murder kin tis the vintagetime for death and sin blood like new wine bubbles within till despair smothers the struggling world which slaves and tyrants win all the furies vanish except one ione hark sister what a low yet dreadful groan quite unsuppressed is tearing up the heart of the good titan as storms tear the deep and beasts hear the sea moan in inland caves darest thou observe how the fiends torture him panthea alas i looked forth twice but will no more ione what didst thou see panthea a woful sight a youth with patient looks nailed to a crucifix ione what next panthea the heaven around the earth below was peopled with thick shapes of human death all horrible and wrought by human hands and some appeared the work of human hearts for men were slowly killed by frowns and smiles and other sights too foul to speak and live were wandering by let us not tempt worse fear by looking forth those groans are grief enough note and tho b fury behold an emblem those who do endure deep wrongs for man and scorn and chains but heap thousandfold torment on themselves and him prometheus remit the anguish of that lighted stare close those wan lips let that thornwounded brow stream not with blood it mingles with thy tears fix fix those tortured orbs in peace and death so thy sick throes shake not that crucifix so those pale fingers play not with thy gore o horrible thy name i will not speak it hath become a curse i see i see the wise the mild the lofty and the just whom thy slaves hate for being like to thee some hunted by foul lies from their hearts home an earlychosen latelamented home as hooded ounces cling to the driven hind some linked to corpses in unwholesome cells somehear i not the multitude laugh loud impaled in lingering fire and mighty realms float by my feet like seauprooted isles whose sons are kneaded down in common blood by the red light of their own burning homes fury blood thou canst see and fire and canst hear groans worse things unheard unseen remain behind prometheus worse fury in each human heart terror survives the ravin it has gorged the loftiest fear all that they would disdain to think were true hypocrisy and custom make their minds the fanes of many a worship now outworn they dare not devise good for mans estate and yet they know not that they do not dare the good want power but to weep barren tears the powerful goodness want worse need for them the wise want love and those who love want wisdom and all best things are thus confused to ill many are strong and rich and would be just but live among their suffering fellowmen as if none felt they know not what they do note ravin b edition ruin prometheus thy words are like a cloud of winged snakes and yet i pity those they torture not fury thou pitiest them i speak no more vanishes prometheus ah woe ah woe alas pain pain ever for ever i close my tearless eyes but see more clear thy works within my woeillumed mind thou subtle tyrant peace is in the grave the grave hides all things beautiful and good i am a god and can not find it there nor would i seek it for though dread revenge this is defeat fierce king not victory the sights with which thou torturest gird my soul with new endurance till the hour arrives when they shall be no types of things which are panthea alas what sawest thou more note thou more b thou prometheus there are two woes to speak and to behold thou spare me one names are there natures sacred watchwords they were borne aloft in bright emblazonry the nations thronged around and cried aloud as with one voice truth liberty and love suddenly fierce confusion fell from heaven among them there was strife deceit and fear tyrants rushed in and did divide the spoil this was the shadow of the truth i saw the earth i felt thy torture son with such mixed joy as pain and virtue give to cheer thy state i bid ascend those subtle and fair spirits whose homes are the dim caves of human thought and who inhabit as birds wing the wind its worldsurrounding aether they behold beyond that twilight realm as in a glass the

they faded through the sky and one sound above around one sound beneath around above was moving twas the soul of love twas the hope the prophecy which begins and ends in thee second spirit a rainbows arch stood on the sea which rocked beneath immovably and the triumphant storm did flee like a conqueror swift and proud between with many a captive cloud a shapeless dark and rapid crowd each by lightning riven in half i heard the thunder hoarsely laugh mighty fleets were strewn like chaff and spread beneath a hell of death oer the white waters i alit on a great ship lightningsplit and speeded hither on the sigh of one who gave an enemy his plank then plunged aside to die third spirit i sate beside a sages bed and the lamp was burning red near the book where he had fed when a dream with plumes of flame to his pillow hovering came and i knew it was the same which had kindled long ago pity eloquence and woe and the world awhile below wore the shade its lustre made it has borne me here as fleet as desires lightning feet i must ride it back ere morrow or the sage will wake in sorrow fourth spirit on a poets lips i slept dreaming like a loveadept in the sound his breathing kept

the world with light but as i passed twas fading and hollow ruin yawned behind great sages bound in madness and headless patriots and pale youths who perished unupbraiding gleamed in the night i wandered oer till thou o king of sadness turned by thy smile the worst i saw to recollected gladness sixth spirit ah sister desolation is a delicate thing it walks not on the earth it floats not on the air but treads with lulling footstep and fans with silent wing the tender hopes which in their hearts the best and gentlest bear who soothed to false repose by the fanning plumes above and the

snowstorms flee from spring gathering up beneath whose mild winds shake the elderbrake and the wandering herdsmen know that the whitethorn soon will blow wisdom justice love and peace when they

music when the inspired voice and lute languish ere yet the responses are mute which through the deep and labyrinthine soul like echoes through long caverns wind and roll prometheus how fair these airborn shapes and yet i feel most vain all hope but love and thou art far asia who when my being overflowed wert like a golden chalice to bright wine which else had sunk into the thirsty dust all things are still alas how heavily this quiet morning weighs upon my heart though i should dream i could even sleep with grief if slumber were denied not i would fain be what it is my destiny to be the saviour and the strength of suffering man or sink into the original gulf of things there is no agony and no solace left earth can console heaven can torment no more panthea hast thou forgotten one who

looks white and asia waits in that far indian vale the scene of her sad exile rugged once and desolate and frozen like this ravine but now invested with fair flowers and herbs and haunted by sweet airs and sounds which flow among the woods and waters from the aether of her transforming presence which would fade if it were mingled not with thine farewell end of act act scene morning a lovely vale in the indian caucasus asia alone asia from all the blasts of heaven thou hast descended yes like a spirit like a thought which makes unwonted tears throng to the horny eyes and beatings haunt the desolated heart which should have learnt repose thou hast descended cradled in tempests thou dost wake o spring o child of many winds as suddenly thou comest as the memory of a dream which now is sad because it hath been sweet like genius or like joy which riseth up as from the earth clothing with golden clouds the desert of our life this is the season this the day the hour at sunrise thou shouldst come sweet sister mine too long desired too long delaying come how like deathworms the wingless moments crawl the point of one white star is quivering still deep in the orange light of widening morn beyond the purple mountains through a chasm of winddivided mist the darker lake reflects it now it wanes it gleams again as the waves fade and as the burning threads of woven cloud unravel in pale air tis lost and through yon peaks of cloudlike snow the roseate sunlight quivers hear i not the aeolian music of her seagreen plumes winnowing the crimson dawn panthea enters i feel i see those eyes which burn through smiles that fade in tears like stars half quenched in mists of silver dew beloved and most beautiful who wearest the shadow of that soul by which i live how late thou art the sphered sun had climbed the sea my heart was sick with hope before the printless air felt thy belated plumes panthea pardon great sister but my wings were faint with the delight of a remembered dream as are the noontide plumes of summer winds satiate with sweet flowers i was wont to sleep peacefully and awake refreshed and calm before the sacred titans fall and thy unhappy love had made through use and pity both love and woe familiar to my heart as they had grown to thine erewhile i slept under the glaucous caverns of old ocean within dim bowers of green and purple moss our young iones soft and milky arms locked then as now behind my dark moist hair while my shut eyes and cheek were pressed within the folded depth of her lifebreathing bosom but not as now since i am made the wind which fails beneath the music that i bear of thy most wordless converse since dissolved into the sense with which love talks my rest was troubled and yet sweet my waking hours too full of care and pain asia lift up thine eyes and let me read thy dream panthea as i have said with our seasister at his feet i slept the mountain mists condensing at our voice under the moon had spread their snowy flakes from the keen ice shielding our linked sleep then two dreams came one i remember not but in the other his pale woundworn limbs fell from prometheus and the azure night grew radiant with the glory of that form which lives unchanged within and his voice fell like music which makes giddy the dim brain faint with intoxication of keen joy sister of her whose footsteps pave the world with lovelinessmore fair than aught but her whose shadow thou artlift thine eyes on me i lifted them the overpowering light of that immortal shape was shadowed oer by love which from his soft and flowing limbs and passionparted lips and keen faint eyes steamed forth like vaporous fire an atmosphere which wrapped me in its alldissolving power as the warm ether of the morning sun wraps ere it drinks some cloud of wandering dew i saw not heard not moved not only felt his presence flow and mingle through my blood till it became his life and his grew mine and i was thus absorbed until it passed and like the vapours when the sun sinks down gathering again in drops upon the pines and tremulous as they in the deep night my being was condensed and as the rays of thought were slowly gathered i could hear his voice whose accents lingered ere they died like footsteps of weak melody thy name among the many sounds alone i heard of what might be articulate though still i listened through the night when sound was none ione wakened then and said to me canst thou divine what troubles me tonight i always knew what i desired before nor ever found delight to wish in vain but now i can not tell thee what i seek i know not something sweet since it is sweet even to desire it is thy sport false sister thou hast discovered some enchantment old whose spells have stolen my spirit as i slept and mingled it with thine for when just now we kissed i felt within thy parted lips the sweet air that sustained me and the warmth of the lifeblood for loss of which i faint quivered between our intertwining arms i answered not for the eastern star grew pale but fled to thee asia thou speakest but thy words are as the air i feel them not oh lift thine eyes that i may read his written soul panthea i lift them though they droop beneath the load of that they would express what canst thou see but thine own fairest shadow imaged there asia thine eyes are like the deep blue boundless heaven contracted to two circles underneath their long fine lashes dark far measureless orb within orb and line through line inwoven panthea why lookest thou as if a spirit passed asia there is a change beyond their inmost depth i see a shade a shape tis he arrayed in the soft light of his own smiles which spread like radiance from the cloudsurrounded moon prometheus it is thine depart not yet say not those smiles that we shall meet again within that bright pavilion which their beams shall build oer the waste world the dream is told what shape is that between us its rude hair roughens the wind that lifts it its

follow follow asia as you speak your words fill pause by pause my own forgotten sleep with shapes methought among these lawns together we wandered underneath the young gray dawn and multitudes of dense white fleecy clouds were wandering in thick flocks along the mountains shepherded by the slow unwilling wind and the white dew on the newbladed grass just piercing the dark earth hung silently and there was more which i remember not but on the shadows of the morning clouds athwart the purple mountain slope was written follow o follow as they vanished by and on each herb from which heavens dew had fallen the like was stamped as with a withering fire a wind arose among the pines it shook the clinging music from their boughs and then low sweet faint sounds like the farewell of ghosts were heard o follow follow follow me and then i said panthea look on me but in the depth of those beloved eyes still i saw follow follow note these b the echo follow follow panthea the crags this clear

voices fade away scene a forest intermingled with rocks and caverns asia and panthea pass into it two young fauns are sitting on a rock listening semichorus of spirits the path through which that lovely twain have passed by cedar pine and yew and each dark tree that ever grew is curtained out from heavens wide blue nor sun nor moon nor wind nor rain can pierce its interwoven bowers nor aught save where some cloud of dew drifted along the earthcreeping breeze between the trunks of the hoar trees hangs each a pearl in the pale flowers of the green laurel blown anew and bends and then fades silently one frail and fair anemone or when some star of many a one that climbs and wanders through steep night has found the cleft through which alone beams fall from high those depths upon ere it is borne away away by the swift heavens that can not stay it scatters drops of golden light like lines of rain that neer unite and the gloom divine is all around and underneath is the mossy ground semichorus there the voluptuous nightingales are awake through all the broad noonday when one with bliss or sadness fails and through the windless ivyboughs sick with sweet love droops dying away on its mates musicpanting bosom another from the swinging blossom watching to catch the languid close of the last strain then lifts on high the wings of the weak melody till some new strain of feeling

soft emotion attracts impels them those who saw say from the breathing earth behind there steams a plumeuplifting wind which drives them on their path while they believe their own swift wings and feet

we haunt within the least frequented caves and closest coverts and we know these wilds yet never meet them though we hear them oft where may they hide themselves second faun tis hard to tell i have heard those more skilled in spirits say the bubbles which the enchantment of the sun sucks from the pale faint waterflowers that pave the oozy bottom of clear lakes and pools are the pavilions where such dwell and float under the green and golden atmosphere which noontide kindles through the woven leaves and when these burst and the thin fiery air the which they breathed within those lucent domes ascends to flow like meteors through the night they ride on them and rein their headlong speed and bow their burning crests and glide in fire under the waters of the earth again first faun if such live thus have others other lives under pink blossoms or within the bells of meadow flowers or folded violets deep or on their dying odours when they die or in the sunlight of the sphered dew note on

from the links of the great chain of things to every thought within the mind of man sway and drag heavily and each one reels under the load towards the pit of death abandoned hope and love that turns to hate and selfcontempt bitterer to drink than blood pain whose unheeded and familiar speech is howling and keen shrieks day after day and hell or the sharp fear of hell demogorgon he reigns asia

wind or sun has withered them and semivital worms but he refused the birthright of their being knowledge power the skill which wields the elements the thought which pierces this dim universe like light selfempire and the majesty of love for thirst of which they fainted then prometheus gave wisdom which is strength to jupiter and with this law alone let man be free clothed him with the dominion of wide heaven to know nor faith nor love nor law to be omnipotent but friendless is to reign and jove now reigned for on the race of man first famine and then toil and then disease strife wounds and ghastly death unseen before fell and the unseasonable seasons drove with alternating shafts of frost and fire their shelterless pale tribes to mountain caves and in their desert hearts fierce wants he sent and mad disquietudes and shadows idle of unreal good which levied mutual war so ruining the lair wherein they raged prometheus saw and waked the legioned hopes which sleep within folded elysian flowers nepenthe moly amaranth fadeless blooms that they might hide with thin and rainbow wings the shape of death and love he sent to bind the disunited tendrils of that vine which bears the wine of life the human heart and he tamed fire which like some beast of prey most terrible but lovely played beneath the frown of man and tortured to his will iron and gold the slaves and signs of power and gems and poisons and all subtlest forms hidden beneath the mountains and the waves he gave man speech and speech created thought which is the measure of the universe and science struck the thrones of earth and heaven which shook but fell not and the harmonious mind poured itself forth in allprophetic song and music lifted up the listening spirit until it walked exempt from mortal care godlike oer

see reflected in their race behold and perish he told the hidden power of herbs and springs and disease drank and slept death grew like sleep he taught the implicated orbits woven of the widewandering stars and how the sun changes his lair and by what secret spell the pale moon is transformed when her broad eye gazes not on the interlunar sea he taught to rule as life directs the limbs the tempestwinged chariots of the ocean and the celt knew the indian cities then were built and through their snowlike columns flowed the warm winds and the azure ether shone and the blue sea and shadowy hills were seen such the alleviations of his state prometheus gave to man for which he hangs withering in destined pain but who rains down evil the immedicable plague which while man looks on his creation like a god and sees that it is glorious drives him on the wreck of his own will the scorn of earth the outcast the abandoned the alone not jove while yet his frown shook heaven ay when his

plants which curtain out the day with leaves and flowers and paved with veined emerald and a fountain leaps in the midst with an awakening sound from its curved roof the mountains frozen tears like snow or silver or long diamond spires hang downward raining forth a doubtful light and there is heard the evermoving air whispering without from tree to tree and birds and bees and all around are mossy seats and the rough walls are clothed with long soft grass a simple dwelling which shall be our own where we will sit and talk of time and change as the world ebbs and flows ourselves unchanged

mild shall clothe the forests and the fields ay even the cragbuilt deserts of the barren deep with everliving leaves and fruits and flowers and thou there is a cavern where my spirit was panted forth in anguish whilst thy pain made my heart mad and those who did inhale it became mad too and built a temple there and spoke and were oracular and lured the erring nations round to mutual war and faithless faith such as jove kept with thee which breath now rises as amongst tall weeds a violets exhalation and it fills with a serener light and crimson air intense yet soft the rocks and woods around it feeds the quick growth of the serpent vine and the dark linked ivy tangling wild and budding blown or odourfaded blooms which star the winds with points of coloured light as they rain through them and bright golden globes of fruit suspended in their own green heaven and through their veined leaves and amber stems the flowers whose purple and translucid bowls stand ever mantling with aereal dew the drink of spirits and it circles round like the soft waving wings of noonday dreams inspiring calm and happy thoughts like mine now thou art thus restored this cave is thine arise appear a spirit rises in the likeness of a winged child this is my torchbearer who let his lamp out in old time with gazing on eyes from which he kindled it anew with love which is as fire sweet daughter mine for such is that within thine own run wayward and guide this company beyond the peak of bacchic nysa maenadhaunted mountain and beyond indus and its tribute rivers trampling the torrent streams and glassy lakes with feet unwet unwearied undelaying and up the green ravine across the vale beside the windless and crystalline pool where ever lies on unerasing waves the image of a temple built above distinct with column arch and architrave and palmlike capital and overwrought and populous with most living imagery praxitelean shapes whose marble smiles fill the hushed air with everlasting love it is deserted now but once it bore thy name prometheus there the emulous youths bore to thy honour through the divine gloom the lamp which was thine emblem even as those who bear the untransmitted torch of hope into the grave across the night of life as thou hast borne it most triumphantly to this far goal of time depart farewell beside that temple is the destined cave note with most b most with scene a forest in the background a cave prometheus asia panthea ione and the spirit of the earth ione sister it is not earthly how it glides under the leaves how on its head there burns a light like a green star whose emerald beams are twined with its fair hair how as it moves the splendour drops in flakes upon the grass knowest thou it panthea it is the delicate spirit that guides the earth through heaven from afar the populous constellations call that light the loveliest of the planets and sometimes it floats along the spray of the salt sea or makes its chariot of a foggy cloud or walks through fields or cities while men sleep or oer the mountain tops or down the rivers or through the green waste wilderness as now wondering at all it sees before jove reigned it loved our sister asia and it came each leisure hour to drink the liquid light out of her eyes for which it said it thirsted as one bit by a dipsas and with her it made its childish confidence and told her all it had known or seen for it saw much yet idly reasoned what it saw and called her for whence it sprung it knew not nor do i mother dear mother the spirit of the earth running to asia mother dearest mother may i then talk with thee as i was wont may i then hide my eyes in thy soft arms after thy looks have made them tired of joy may i then play beside thee the long noons when work is none in the bright silent air asia i love thee gentlest being and henceforth can cherish thee unenvied speak i pray thy simple talk once solaced now delights spirit of the earth mother i am grown wiser though a child can not be wise like thee within this day and happier too happier and wiser both thou knowest that toads and snakes and loathly worms and venomous and malicious beasts and boughs that bore ill berries in the woods were ever an hindrance to my walks oer the green world and that among the haunts of humankind hardfeatured men or with proud angry looks or cold staid gait or false and hollow smiles or the dull sneer of selfloved ignorance or other such foul masks with which ill thoughts hide that fair being whom we spirits call man and women too ugliest of all things evil though fair even in a world where thou art fair when good and kind free and sincere like thee when false or frowning made me sick at heart to pass them though they slept and i unseen well my path lately lay through a great city into the woody hills surrounding it a sentinel was sleeping at the gate when there was heard a sound so loud it shook the towers amid the moonlight yet more sweet than any voice but thine sweetest of all a long long sound as it would never end and all the inhabitants leaped suddenly out of their rest and gathered in the streets looking in wonder up to heaven while yet the music pealed along i hid myself within a fountain in the public square where i lay like the reflex of the moon seen in a wave under green leaves and soon those ugly human shapes and visages of which i spoke as having wrought me pain passed floating through the air and fading still into the winds that scattered them and those from whom they passed seemed mild and lovely forms after some foul disguise had fallen and all were somewhat changed and after brief surprise and greetings of delighted wonder all went to their sleep again and when the dawn came wouldst thou think that toads and snakes and efts could eer be beautiful yet so they were and that with little change of shape or hue all things had put their evil nature off i can not tell my joy when oer a lake upon a drooping bough with nightshade twined i saw two azure halcyons clinging downward and thinning one bright bunch of amber berries with quick long beaks and in the deep there lay those lovely forms imaged as in a sky so with my thoughts full of these happy changes we meet again the happiest change of all asia and never will we part till thy chaste sister who guides the frozen and inconstant moon will look on thy more warm and equal light till her heart thaw like flakes of april snow and love thee spirit of the earth what as asia loves prometheus asia peace wanton thou art yet not old enough think ye by gazing on each others eyes to multiply your lovely selves and fill with sphered fires the interlunar air spirit of the earth nay mother while my sister trims her lamp tis hard i should go darkling asia listen look the spirit of the hour enters prometheus we feel what thou hast heard and seen yet speak spirit of the hour soon as the sound had ceased whose thunder filled the abysses of the sky and the wide earth there was a change the impalpable thin air and the allcircling sunlight were transformed as if the sense of love dissolved in them had folded itself round the sphered world my vision then grew clear and i could see into the mysteries of the universe dizzy as with delight i floated down winnowing the lightsome air with languid plumes my coursers sought their birthplace in the sun where they henceforth will live exempt from toil pasturing flowers of vegetable fire and where my moonlike car will stand within a temple gazed upon by phidian forms of thee and asia and the earth and me and you fair nymphs looking the love we feel in memory of the tidings it has borne beneath a dome fretted with graven flowers poised on twelve columns of resplendent stone and open to the bright and liquid sky yoked to it by an amphisbaenic snake the likeness of those winged steeds will mock the flight from which they find repose alas whither has wandered now my partial tongue when all remains untold which ye would hear as i have said i floated to the earth it was as it is still the pain of bliss to move to breathe to be i wandering went among the haunts and dwellings of mankind and first was disappointed not to see such mighty change as i had felt within expressed in outward things but soon i looked and behold thrones were kingless and men walked one with the other even as spirits do none fawned none trampled hate disdain or fear selflove or selfcontempt on human brows no more inscribed as oer the gate of hell all hope abandon ye who enter here none frowned none trembled none with eager fear gazed on anothers eye of cold command until the subject of a tyrants will became worse fate the abject of his own which spurred him like an outspent horse to death none wrought his lips in truthentangling lines which smiled the lie his tongue disdained to speak none with firm sneer trod out in his own heart the sparks of love and hope till there remained those bitter ashes a soul selfconsumed and the wretch crept a vampire among men infecting all with his own hideous ill none talked that common false cold hollow talk which makes the heart deny the yes it breathes yet question that unmeant hypocrisy with such a selfmistrust as has no name and women too frank beautiful and kind as the free heaven which rains fresh light and dew on the wide earth past gentle radiant forms from customs evil taint exempt and pure speaking the wisdom once they could not think looking emotions once they feared to feel and changed to all which once they dared not be yet being now made earth like heaven nor pride nor jealousy nor envy nor ill shame the bitterest of those drops of treasured gall spoiled the sweet taste of the nepenthe love thrones altars judgementseats and prisons wherein and beside which by wretched men were borne sceptres tiaras swords and chains and tomes of reasoned wrong glozed on by ignorance were like those monstrous and barbaric shapes the ghosts of a nomoreremembered fame which from their unworn obelisks look forth in triumph oer the palaces and tombs of those who were their conquerors mouldering round these imaged to the pride of kings and priests a dark yet mighty faith a power as wide as is the world it wasted and are now but an astonishment even so the tools and emblems of its last captivity amid the dwellings of the peopled earth stand not oerthrown but unregarded now and those foul shapes abhorred by god and man which under many a name and many a form strange savage ghastly dark and execrable were jupiter the tyrant of the world and which the nations panicstricken served with blood and hearts broken by long hope and love dragged to his altars soiled and garlandless and slain among mens unreclaiming tears flattering the thing they feared which fear was hate frown mouldering fast oer their abandoned shrines the painted veil by those who were called life which mimicked as with colours idly spread all men believed and hoped is torn aside the loathsome mask has fallen the man remains sceptreless free uncircumscribed but man equal unclassed tribeless and nationless exempt from awe worship degree the king over himself just gentle wise but man passionlessno yet free from guilt or pain which were for his will made or suffered them nor yet exempt though ruling them like slaves from chance and death and mutability the

visions of strange radiance float upon the oceanlike enchantment of strong sound which flows intenser keener deeper yet under the ground and through the windless air ione i see a chariot like that thinnest boat in which the mother of the months is borne by ebbing light into her western cave when she upsprings from interlunar dreams oer which is curved an orblike canopy of gentle darkness and the hills and woods distinctly seen through that dusk aery veil regard like shapes in an enchanters glass its wheels are solid clouds azure and gold such as the genii of the thunderstorm pile on the floor of the illumined sea when the sun rushes under it they roll and move and grow as with an inward wind within it sits a winged infant white its countenance like the whiteness of bright snow its plumes are as feathers of sunny frost its limbs gleam white through the windflowing folds of its white robe woof of ethereal pearl its hair is white the brightness of white light scattered in strings yet its two eyes are heavens of liquid darkness which the deity within seems pouring as a storm is poured from jagged clouds out of their arrowy lashes tempering the cold and radiant air around with

other with a thousand motions upon a thousand sightless axles spinning and with the force of selfdestroying swiftness intensely slowly solemnly roll on kindling with mingled sounds and many tones intelligible words and music wild with mighty whirl the multitudinous orb grinds the bright brook into an azure mist of elemental subtlety like light and the wild odour of the forest flowers the music of the living grass and air the emerald light of leafentangled beams round its intense yet selfconflicting speed seem kneaded into one aereal mass which drowns the sense within the orb itself pillowed

your words fall like the clear soft dew shaken from a bathing woodnymphs limbs and hair panthea peace peace a mighty power which is as darkness is rising out of earth and from the sky is showered like night and from within the air bursts like eclipse which had been gathered up into the pores of sunlight the bright visions wherein the singing spirits rode and shone gleam like pale meteors through a watery night ione there is a sense of words upon mine ear panthea an universal sound like words oh list demogorgon thou earth calm empire of a happy soul sphere of divinest shapes and harmonies beautiful orb gathering as thou dost roll the love which paves thy path along the skies the earth i hear i am as a drop of dew that dies demogorgon thou moon which gazest on the nightly earth with wonder as it gazes upon thee whilst each to men and beasts and the swift birth of birds is beauty love calm harmony the moon i hear i am a leaf shaken by thee demogorgon ye kings of suns and stars daemons and gods ethereal dominations who possess elysian windless fortunate abodes beyond heavens constellated wilderness a voice from above our great republic hears we are blest and bless demogorgon ye happy dead whom beams of brightest verse are clouds to hide not colours to portray whether your nature is that universe which once ye saw and suffered a voice from beneath or as they whom we have left we change and pass away demogorgon ye elemental genii who have homes from mans high mind even to the central stone of sullen lead from heavens starfretted domes to the dull weed some seaworm battens on a confused voice we hear thy words waken oblivion demogorgon spirits whose homes are flesh ye beasts and birds ye worms and fish ye living leaves and buds lightning and wind and ye untameable herds meteors and mists which throng airs solitudes note throng cancelled for feed b a voice thy voice to us is wind among still woods demogorgon man who wert once a despot and a slave a dupe and a deceiver a decay a traveller from the cradle to the grave through the dim night of this immortal day all speak thy strong words may never pass away demogorgon this is the day which down the void abysm at the earthborns spell yawns for heavens despotism and conquest is dragged captive through the deep love from its awful throne of patient power in the wise heart from the last giddy hour of dread endurance from the slippery steep and narrow verge of craglike agony springs and folds over the world its healing wings gentleness virtue wisdom and endurance these are the seals of that most firm assurance which bars the pit over destructions strength and if with infirm hand eternity mother of many acts and hours should free the serpent that would clasp her with his length these are the spells by which to reassume an empire oer the disentangled doom to suffer woes which hope thinks infinite to forgive wrongs darker than death or night to defy power which seems omnipotent to love and bear to hope till hope creates from its own wreck the thing it contemplates neither to change nor falter nor repent this like thy glory titan is to be good great and joyous beautiful and free this is alone life joy empire and victory
