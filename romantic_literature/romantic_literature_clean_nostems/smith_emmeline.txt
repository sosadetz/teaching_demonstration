castle chapter i in a remote part of the county of pembroke is an old building formerly of great strength and inhabited for centuries by the ancient family of mowbray to the sole remaining branch of which it still belonged tho it was at the time this history commences inhabited only by servants and the greater part of it was gone to decay a few rooms only had been occasionally repaired to accommodate the proprietor when he found it necessary to come thither to receive his rents or to inspect the condition of the estate which however happened so seldom that during the twelve years he had been master of it he had only once visited the castle for a few days the business that related to the property round it which was very considerable was conducted by a steward grown grey in the service of the family and by an attorney from london who came to hold the courts and an old housekeeper a servant who waited on her the steward and a labourer who was kept to look after his horse and work in that part of the garden which yet bore the vestige of cultivation were now all its inhabitants except a little girl of whom the housekeeper had the care and who was believed to be the natural daughter of that elder brother by whose death lord montreville the present possessor became entitled to the estate this nobleman while yet a younger son was by the partiality of his mother who had been an heiress and that of some other female relations master of a property nearly equal to what he inherited by the death of his brother mr mowbray he had been originally designed for the law but in consequence of being entitled to the large estate which had been his mothers and heir by will to all her opulent family he had quitted that profession and at the age of about four and twenty had married lady eleonore delamere by whom he had a son and two daughters the illustrious family from which lady eleonore descended became extinct in the male line by the premature death of her two brothers and her ladyship becoming sole heiress her husband took the name of delamere and obtaining one of the titles of the ladys father was at his death created viscount montreville mr mowbray died before he was thirty in italy and lord montreville on taking possession of mowbray castle found there his infant daughter her mother had died soon after her birth and she had been sent from france where she was born and put under the care of mrs carey the housekeeper who was tenderly attached to her having been the attendant of mr mowbray from his earliest infancy lord montreville suffered her to remain in the situation in which he found her and to go by the name of mowbray he allowed for the trifling charge of her board and necessary cloaths in the stewards account the examination of which was for some years the only circumstance that reminded him of the existence of the unfortunate orphan with no other notice from her fathers family emmeline had attained her twelfth year an age at which she would have been left in the most profound ignorance if her uncommon understanding and unwearied application had not supplied the deficiency of her instructors and conquered the disadvantages of her situation mrs carey could indeed read with tolerable fluency and write an hand hardly legible and mr williamson the old steward had been formerly a good penman and was still a proficient in accounts both were anxious to give their little charge all the instruction they could but without the quickness and attention she shewed to whatever they attempted to teach such preceptors could have done little emmeline had a kind of intuitive knowledge and comprehended every thing with a facility that soon left her instructors behind her the precarious and neglected situation in which she lived troubled not the innocent emmeline having never experienced any other she felt no uneasiness at her present lot and on the future she was not yet old enough to reflect mrs carey was to her in place of the mother she had never known and the old steward she was accustomed to call father the death of this venerable servant was the first sorrow emmeline ever felt returning late one evening in the winter from a neighbouring town he attempted to cross a ford where the waters being extremely out he was carried down by the rapidity of the current his horse was drowned and tho he was himself rescued from the flood by some peasants who knew him and carried to the castle he was so much bruised and had suffered so much from cold that he was taken up speechless and continued so for the few hours he survived the accident mrs carey who had lived in the same house with him near forty years felt the sincerest concern at his death with which it was necessary for her immediately to acquaint lord montreville his lordship directed his attorney in london to replace him with another to whom mrs carey with an aching heart delivered the keys of the stewards room and drawers her health which was before declining received a rude shock from the melancholy death of mr williamson and she and her little ward had soon the mortification of seeing he was forgotten by all but themselves frequent and severe attacks of the gout now made daily ravages in the constitution of mrs carey and her illness recurred so often that emmeline now almost fourteen began to reflect on what she should do if mrs carey died and these reflections occasionally gave her pain but she was not yet of an age to consider deeply or to dwell long on gloomy subjects her mind however gradually expanded and her judgment improved for among the deserted rooms of this once noble edifice was a library which had been well furnished with the books of those ages in which they had been collected many of them were in black letter and so injured by time that the most indefatigable antiquary could have made nothing of them from these emmeline turned in despair to some others of more modern appearance which tho they also had suffered from the dampness of the room and in some parts were almost effaced with mould were yet generally legible among them were spencer and milton two or three volumes of the spectator an old edition of shakespeare and an odd volume or two of pope these together with some tracts of devotion which she knew would be very acceptable to mrs carey she cleaned by degrees from the dust with which they were covered and removed into the housekeepers room where the village carpenter accommodated her with a shelf on which with great pride of heart she placed her new acquisitions the dismantled windows and broken floor of the library prevented her continuing there long together but she frequently renewed her search and with infinite pains examined all the piles of books some of which lay tumbled in heaps on the floor others promiscuously placed on the shelves where the swallow the sparrow and the daw had found habitations for many years for as the present proprietor had determined to lay out no more than was absolutely necessary to keep one end of the castle habitable the library which was in the most deserted part of it was in a ruinous state and had long been entirely forsaken emmeline however by her unwearied researches nearly completed several sets of books in which instruction and amusement were happily blended from them she acquired a taste for poetry and the more ornamental parts of literature as well as the grounds of that elegant and useful knowledge which if it rendered not her life happier enabled her to support with the dignity of conscious worth those undeserved evils with which many of her years were embittered mrs carey now far advanced in life found her infirmities daily increase she was often incapable of leaving her chamber for many weeks during which emmeline attended her with the solicitude and affection of a daughter scorned not to perform the most humble offices that contributed to her relief and sat by her whole days or watched her whole nights with the tenderest and most unwearied assiduity on those evenings in summer when her attendance could for a few hours be dispensed with she delighted to wander among the rocks that formed the bold and magnificent boundary of the ocean which spread its immense expanse of water within half a mile of the castle simply dressed and with no other protection than providence she often rambled several miles into the country visiting the remote huts of the shepherds among the wildest mountains during the life of mrs mowbray a small stipend had been annually allowed for the use of the poor this had not yet been withdrawn and it now passed thro the hands of mrs carey whose enquiries into the immediate necessities of the cottagers in the neighbourhood of the castle devolved to emmeline when she was herself unable to make them the ignorant rustics who had seen emmeline grow up among them from her earliest infancy and who now beheld her with the compassion as well as the beauty of an angel administering to their necessities and alleviating their misfortunes looked upon her as a superior being and throughout the country she was almost adored perfectly unconscious of those attractions which now began to charm every other eye emmeline had entered her sixteenth year and the progress of her understanding was equal to the improvement of her person which tho she was not perfectly handsome could not be beheld at first without pleasure and which the more it was seen became more interesting and engaging her figure was elegant and graceful somewhat exceeding the middling height her eyes were blue and her hair brown her features not very regular yet there was a sweetness in her countenance when she smiled more charming than the effect of the most regular features could have given her countenance open and ingenuous expressed every emotion of her mind it had assumed rather a pensive cast and tho it occasionally was lighted up by vivacity had been lately frequently overclouded when the sufferings of her only friend called forth all the generous sympathy of her nature and now the first severe misfortune she had known was about to overtake her early in the spring of that year which was the sixteenth from her birth mrs carey had felt an attack of the gout which however was short and her health seemed for some time afterwards more settled than it had been for many months she was one evening preparing to go down to the village leaning on the arm of emmeline when she suddenly complained of an acute pain in her head and fell back into a chair the affrighted girl called for assistance and endeavoured by every means in her power to recover her but it was impossible the gout had seized her head and casting on emmeline a look which seemed to express all she felt at leaving her thus desolate and friendless her venerable friend after a short struggle breathed her last what should emmeline now do in this distress the first she had ever known how should she act she saw in the lifeless corpse before her the person on whom she had from her first recollection been accustomed to rely who had provided for all her wants and prevented every care for herself and now she was left to perform for this dear friend the last sad offices and knew not what would hereafter be her own lot in strong and excellent understandings there is in every period of life a force which distress enables them to exert and which prevents their sinking under the pressure of those evils which overwhelm and subdue minds more feeble and unequal the spirits of emmeline were yet unbroken by affliction and her understanding was of the first rank she possessed this native firmness in a degree very unusual to her age and sex instead therefore of giving way to tears and exclamations she considered how she should best perform all she now could do for her deceased friend and having seen every proper care taken of her remains and given orders for every thing relative to them with the solemn serenity of settled sorrow she retired to her room where she began to reflect on her irreparable loss and the melancholy situation in which she was left which she never had courage to consider closely till it was actually before her painful indeed were the thoughts that now crouded on her mind encreasing the anguish of her spirit for her recent misfortune she considered herself as a being belonging to nobody as having no right to claim the protection of any one no power to procure for herself the necessaries of life on the steward maloney she had long looked with disgust from the assured and forward manner in which he thought proper to treat her the freedom of his behaviour which she could with difficulty repress while mrs carey lived might now she feared approach to more insulting familiarity to be exposed to which entirely in his power and without any female companion filled her with the most alarming apprehensions and the more her mind dwelt on that circumstance the more she was terrified at the prospect before her insomuch that she would immediately have quitted the housebut whither could she go by abruptly leaving the asylum lord montreville had hitherto allowed her she feared she might forfeit all claim to his future protection and unknown as she was to the principal inhabitants of the country who were few and their houses at a great distance she could hardly hope to be received by any of them she had therefore no choice left but to remain at the castle till she heard from lord montreville and she determined to acquaint his lordship of the death of mrs carey and desire to receive his commands as to herself fatigued and oppressed she retired to bed but not to sleep the image of her expiring protectress was still before her eyes and if exhausted nature forced her to give way to a momentary forgetfulness she soon started from her imperfect slumber and fancied she heard the voice of mrs carey calling on her for help and her last groan still vibrated in her earswhile the stillness of the night interrupted only by the cries of the owls which haunted the ruins added to the gloomy and mournful sensations of her mind at length however the sun arosethe surrounding objects lost the horror that darkness and silence had lent themand emmeline fell into a short but refreshing repose chapter ii as soon as emmeline arose the next morning she addressed the following letter to lord montreville my lord in the utmost affliction i address myself to your lordship to acquaint you with the death of mrs carey after an illness of a very few moments by which unhappy event i have lost a friend who has indeed been a mother to me and am now left at the castle ignorant of your lordships pleasure as to my future residence you will my lord i doubt not recollect that it is at my time of life improper for me to reside here with mr maloney and if it be your lordships intention for me to continue here i hope you will have the goodness to send down some proper person to fill the place of the worthy woman i have lost on your lordships humanity and consideration i depend for an early answer in which hope i have the honor to remain your lordships dutiful and most humble servant emmeline mowbray mowbray castle st may the same post carried a letter from mr maloney informing lord montreville of the housekeepers death and desiring directions about miss as he elegantly termed emmeline to these letters no answers were returned for upwards of a fortnight during which melancholy interval emmeline followed to the grave the remains of the friend of her infancy and took a last farewel of the only person who seemed interested for her welfare then returning with streaming eyes to her own room she threw herself on the bed and gave way to a torrent of tears for her spirits were overcome by the mournful scene to which she had just been a witness and by the heavy forebodings of future sorrow which oppressed her heart the troublesome civilities of the steward maloney she soon found the difficulty of evading fearful of offending him from whom she could not escape yet unable to keep up an intercourse of civility with a man who would interpret it into an encouragement of his presumptuous attentions she was compelled to make use of an artifice and to plead ill health as an excuse for not dining as usual in the stewards room and indeed her uneasiness and grief were such as hardly made it a pretence after many days of anxious expectation the following letter arrived from the housesteward of lord montreville as on such an occasion his lordship did not think it necessary to write himself berkeleysquare june miss my lord orders me to acquaint you that in consequence of yours of the st ult informing his lordship of the old housekeepers mrs careys decease he has directed mrs grant his lordships town housekeeper to look out for another and mrs grant has agreed with a gentlewoman accordingly who will be down at the castle forthwith my lord is gone to essex but has directed me to let mr maloney know that he is to furnish you with all things needful same as before by my lords command from miss your very humble servant richard maddox while emmeline waited the expected arrival of the person to whose care she was now to be consigned the sister of mrs carey who was the only relation she had sent a nephew of her husbands to take possession of what effects had belonged to her in doing which a will was found in which she bequeathed fifty pounds as a testimony of her tender affection to miss emmeline mowbray the daughter of her late dear master together with all the contents of a small chest of drawers which stood in her room the rest of her property which consisted of her cloaths and about two hundred pounds which she had saved in service became her sisters and were delivered by maloney to the young man commissioned to receive them in the drawers given to her emmeline found some fine linen and laces which had belonged to her mother and two little silk boxes covered with nuns embroidery which seemed not to have been opened for many years emmeline saw that they were filled with letters some of them in a hand which she had been shewn as her fathers but she left them uninspected and fastened up the caskets her mind being yet too much affected with her loss to be able to examine any thing which brought to her recollection the fond solicitude of her departed friend the cold and mechanical terms in which the stewards letter was written encreased all her uneasy fears as to her future prospects lord montreville seemed to feel no kindness for her nor to give any consideration to her forlorn and comfortless situation the officious freedoms of maloney encreased so much that she was obliged to confine herself almost entirely to her own room to avoid him and she determined that if after the arrival of the companion she expected he continued to besiege her with so much impertinent familiarity she would quit the house tho compelled to accept the meanest service for a subsistence after a fortnight of expectation notice was received at the castle that mrs garnet the housekeeper was arrived at the market town the labourer with an horse was dispatched for her and towards evening she made her entry to emmeline who had from her earliest remembrance been accustomed only to the plainest dress and the most simple and sober manners the figure and deportment of this woman appeared equally extraordinary she wore a travelling dress of tawdrycoloured silk trimmed with bright green ribbands and her head was covered with an immense black silk hat from which depended many yellow streamers while the plumage with which it was plentifully adorned hung dripping over her face from the effects of a thunder shower thro which she had passed her hair tho carefully curled and powdered on her leaving london had been also greatly deranged in her journey and descended in knotty tufts of a dirty yellow over her cheeks and forehead adding to the vulgar ferocity of a harsh countenance and a coarse complexion her figure was uncommonly tall and boney and her voice so discordant and shrill as to pierce the ear with the most unpleasant sensation and compleat the disagreeable idea her person impressed emmeline saw her enter handed by the officious maloney and repressing her astonishment she arose and attempted to speak to her but the contrast between the dirty tawdry and disgusting figure before her and the sober plainness and neat simplicity of her lost friend struck so forcibly on her imagination that she burst into tears and was altogether unable to command her emotion the steward having with great gallantry handed in the newly arrived lady she thus began oh lord a marcy on meto be shore i be got here at last but indeed if i had a known whereabout i was a coming to tis not a double the wagers as should a hired me lord why what a ramshakel ould place it isand then such a monstrous long way from london i suppose sir to maloney as you be the steward and you miss i reckon be the young miss as i be to have the care on why to be sure i didnt much expect to see a christian face in such an out of the way place i dont bleve i shall stay howsomdever do let me have some tea and do you miss shew me whereabout i be to sleep emmeline struggling with her dislike or at least desirous of concealing it did not venture to trust her voice with an answer for her heart was too full but stepping to the door she called to the female servant and ordered her to shew the lady her room she had herself been used to share that appropriated to mrs carey but she now resolved to remove her bed into an apartment in one of the turrets of the castle which was the only unoccupied room not wholly exposed to the weather this little room had been sashed by mrs mowbray on account of the beautiful prospect it commanded between the hills where suddenly sinking to the south west they made way through a long narrow valley fringed with copses for a small but rapid river which hurrying among immense stones and pieces of rock that seemed to have been torn from the mountains by its violence rushed into the sea at the distance of a mile from the castle this room now for many years neglected was much out of repair but still habitable and tho it was at a great distance from the rooms yet occupied emmeline chose rather to take up her abode in it than partake of the apartment which was now to belong to mrs garnet and she found reason to applaud herself for this determination when she heard the exclamation mrs garnet made on entering it lord why tis but a shabbyish place and here is two beds i see but that wont suit me i asshore you i chuses to have a room to myself if it be ever so be not in any pain on that account madam said emmeline who had now collected her thoughts it is my intention to remove my bed and i have directed a person to do it immediately she then returned into the stewards room where maloney thus addressed her sarvent again pretty miss pray how dye like our new housekeeper a smartish piece of goods upon my word for pembrokeshire quite a london lady eh miss it is impossible for me sir to judge of her yet why ay miss as you justly observes tis full early to know what people be but i hope we shall find her quite the thing and if so be as shes but good tempered and agreeable and the like why i warrant we shall pass this here summer as pleasant as any thing can be and now my dear miss perhaps maynt be so shy and distant as she have got another woman body to keep her company this eloquent harangue was interrupted by the return of mrs garnet full of anxiety for her tea and in the bustle created by the desire of the maid and maloney to accommodate her emmeline retired to her new apartment where she was obliged to attend to the removal of her bed and other things and excusing herself under the pretence of fatigue from returning to the stewards room she passed some time in melancholy recollection and more melancholy anticipation and then retired to rest some days passed in murmurs on the part of mrs garnet and in silence on that of emmeline who as soon as she had finished her short repasts always went to her own room after a few weeks she discovered that the lady grew every day more reconciled to her situation and from the pleasures she apparently took in the gallantries of maloney and his constant assiduities to her the innocent emmeline supposed there was really an attachment forming between them which would certainly deliver her from the displeasing attentions of the steward occupied almost entirely by her books of which she every day became more enamoured she never willingly broke in upon a tête à tête which she fancied was equally agreeable to all parties and she saw with satisfaction that they regretted not her absence but the motives of maloneys attention were misunderstood insensible as such a man must be supposed to the charms of the elegant and selfcultivated mind of emmeline her personal beauty had made a deep impression on his heart and he had formed a design of marrying her before the death of mrs carey to whom he had once or twice mentioned something like a hint of his wishes but she had received all his discourse on that topic with so much coldness and ever so carefully avoided any conversation that might again lead to it that he had been deterred from entirely explaining himself now however he thought the time was arrived when he might make a more successful application for he never doubted but that mrs garnet would obtain over the tender and ingenuous mind of emmeline an influence as great as had been possessed by mrs carey nor did he apprehend that a friendless orphan without fortune or connections would want much persuasion to marry a young man of handsome figure as he conceived himself to be who was established in a profitable place and had some dependance of his own the distance which emmeline had always obliged him to observe he imputed to the timidity of her nature which he hoped would be lessened by the free and familiar manners of her present companion whose conversation was very unlike what she had before been accustomed to hear from mrs carey impressed with these ideas he paid his court most assiduously to the housekeeper who put down all his compliments to the account of her own attractions and was extremely pleased with her conquest which she exhausted all her eloquence and all her wardrobe to secure chapter iii in this situation were the inhabitants of mowbray castle when in the beginning of july orders were received from lord montreville to set workmen immediately about repairing the whole end of the castle which was yet habitable as his son mr delamere intended to come down early in the autumn to shoot for some weeks in wales his lordship added that it was possible he might himself be there also for a few weeks and therefore directed several bedchambers to be repaired for which he would send down furniture from london no time was lost in obeying these directions workmen were immediately procured and the utmost expedition used to put the place in a situation to receive its master while emmeline who foresaw that the arrival of lord montreville would probably occasion some change in regard to herself and who thought that every change must be for the better beheld these preparations with pleasure all had been ready some weeks and the time fixed for mr delameres journey elapsed but he had yet given no notice of his arrival at length towards the middle of september they were one evening alarmed by the noise of horses on the ascent to the castle emmeline retired to her own room fearful of she knew not what while mrs garnet and maloney flew eagerly to the door where a french valet and an english groom with a led horse presented themselves and were ushered into the old kitchen the dimensions of which blackened as it was with the smoke of ages and provided with the immense utensils of ancient hospitality failed not to amaze them both the frenchman expressed his wonder and dislike by several grimaces and then addressing himself to mrs garnet exclaimedpeste milor croitil quon peut subsister dans cette espece denfer montré moi les apartements de monsieur oh your name is mounseer is it answered sheaye i thought sowhat would you please to have mounseer diable cried the distressed valet voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu quelle habite com com you jean groom speak littel to dis voman pour moi with the help of john who had been some time used to his mode of explaining himself mrs garnet understood that mounseer desired to be shewn the apartments destined for his master which he assiduously assisted in preparing and then seeing the women busied in following his directions he attempted to return to his companion but by missing a turning which should have carried him to the kitchen he was bewildered among the long galleries and obscure passages of the castle and after several efforts could neither find his way back to the women nor into the kitchen but continued to blunder about till the encreasing gloom which approaching night threw over the arched and obscure apartments through windows dim with painted glass filled him with apprehension and dismay and he believed he should wander there the whole night in which fear he began to make a strange noise for assistance to which nobody attended for indeed nobody for some time heard him his terror encreasing he continued to traverse one of the passages when a door at the corner of it opened and emmeline came out the man whose imagination was by this time filled with ideas of spectres flew back at her sudden appearance and added the contortions of fear to his otherwise grotesque appearance in a travelling jacket of white cloth laced and his hair in papillotes emmeline immediately comprehending that it was one of mr delameres servants enquired what he wanted and the man reassured by her voice and figure which there was yet light enough to discern approached her and endeavoured to explain that he had lost himself in a language which though emmeline did not understand she knew to be french she walked with him therefore to the gallery which opened to the great staircase from whence he could hardly mistake his way where having pointed it to him she turned back towards her own room but millefleur who had now had an opportunity to contemplate the person of his conductress was not disposed so easily to part with her by the extreme simplicity of her dress he believed her to be only some fair villager or an assistant to the housekeeper and therefore without ceremony he began in broken english to protest his admiration and seized her hand with an impertinent freedom extremely shocking to emmeline she snatched it from him and flying hastily back through those passages which all his courage did not suffice to make him attempt exploring again she regained her turret the door of which she instantly locked and bolted then breathless with fear and anger she reflected on the strange and unpleasant scene she had passed through and felt greatly humbled to find that she was now likely to be exposed to the insolent familiarity of servants from which she knew not whether the presence of the master would protect her while she suffered the anguish these thoughts brought with them millefleur travelled back to the kitchen where he began an oration in his own language on the beauty of the young woman he had met with neither mrs garnet nor maloney understood what he was saying but john who had been in france and knew a good deal of the language told them that he had seen a very pretty girl in whose praise he was holding forth why lord exclaimed mrs garnet tis our miss as mounseer means i had a quite forgot the child ill go call her but howsomdever mounseer wont be able to get a word out of her if shes a beauty i asshore you tis a dumb beauty maloney by no means pleased with millefleurs discovery would willingly have prevented the housekeepers complaisance but not knowing how to do it he was obliged to let her ascend to emmeline whose door she found locked miss miss cried she rapping loudly you must come down is my lord or mr delamere arrived enquired emmeline no replied mrs garnet neither of em bent come yet but heres my lords waley de sham and another sarvent and youll come down to tea to be sure no said emmeline you must excuse me mrs garnet i am not very well and if i were should decline appearing to these people with whom perhaps it may not be my lords design that i should associate people exclaimed mrs garnet as to people i do suppose that for all one of them is a frenchman they be as good as other folks and if i am agreeable to let them drink tea in my room sure you miss midnt be so squeamish but do as you please for my part i shant court beauties so saying the angry housekeeper descended to her companions to whom she complained of the pride and ill manners of miss while maloney rejoiced at a reserve so favourable to the hopes he entertained emmeline determined to remain as much as possible in her own room till lord montreville or mr delamere came and then to solicit her removal she therefore continued positively to refuse to appear to the party below and ordered the maid servant to bring her dinner into her own room which she never quitted till towards evening to pursue her usual walks on the third afternoon subsequent to the arrival of mr delameres avantcouriers emmeline went down to the sea side and seating herself on a fragment of rock fixed her eyes insensibly on the restless waves that broke at her feet the low murmurs of the tide retiring on the sands the sighing of the wind among the rocks which hung over her head cloathed with long grass and marine plants the noise of the sea fowl going to their nests among the cliffs threw her into a profound reverie she forgot awhile all her apprehended misfortunes a sort of stupor took possession of her senses and she no longer remembered how the time had passed there which already exceeded two hours though the moon yet in its encrease was arisen and threw a long line of radience on the water thus lost in indistinct reflections she was unconscious of the surrounding objects when the hasty tread of somebody on the pebbles behind her made her suddenly recollect herself and though accustomed to be so much alone she started in some alarm in remembering the late hour and the solitary place where she was a man approached her in whom with satisfaction she recollected a young peasant of the village who was frequently employed in messages from the castle miss emmy said the lad you are wanted at home for there is my lord his own self and the young lord and more gentlefolks come so madam garnet sent me to look for you all about emmeline hurried by this intelligence walked hastily away with the young villager and soon arrived at the castle the wind had blown her beautiful hair about her face and the glow of her cheeks was heightened by exercise and apprehension a more lovely figure than she now appeared could hardly be imagined she had no time to reflect on the interview but hastened immediately into the parlour where lord montreville was sitting with his son mr fitzedward who was a young officer his friend distantly related to the family and mr headly a man celebrated for his knowledge of rural improvements whom lord montreville had brought down to have his opinion of the possibility of rendering mowbray castle a residence fit for his family for a few months in the year lord montreville was about five and forty years old his general character was respectable he had acquitted himself with honor in the senate and in private life had shewn great regularity and good conduct but he had basked perpetually in the sunshine of prosperity and his feelings not naturally very acute were blunted by having never suffered in his own person any uneasiness which might have taught him sensibility for that of others to this cause it was probably owing that he never reflected on the impropriety of receiving his niece before strangers and that he ordered emmeline to be introduced into the room where they were all sitting together having once seen emmeline a child of five or six years old he still formed an idea of her as a child and adverted not to the change that almost nine years had made in her person and manners it was therefore with some degree of surprize that instead of the child he expected he saw a tall elegant young woman whose air though timidity was the most conspicuous in it had yet much of dignity and grace and in whose face he saw the features of his brother softened into feminine beauty the apathy which prosperity had taught him gave way for a moment to his surprize at the enchanting figure of his niece he arose and approached her miss mowbray how amazingly you are grown i am glad to see you he took her hand while emmeline trembling and blushing endeavoured to recollect herself and said i thank you my lord and i am happy in having an opportunity of paying my respects to your lordship he led her to a seat and again repeated his wonder to find her so much grown delamere who had been standing at the fire conversing with fitzedward now advanced and desired his father to introduce him which ceremony being passed he drew a chair close to that in which emmeline was placed and fixing his eyes on her face with a look of admiration and enquiry that extremely abashed her he seemed to be examining the beauties of that lovely and interesting countenance which had so immediately dazzled and surprized him fitzedward a young soldier related to the family of lady montreville was almost constantly the companion of delamere and had expectations that the interest lord montreville possessed would be exerted to advance him in his profession his manner was very insinuating and his person uncommonly elegant he affected to be a judge as well as an admirer of beauty and seemed to behold with approbation the fair inhabitant of the castle who with heightened blushes and averted looks waited in silence till lord montreville should again address her which he at length did i was sorry miss mowbray to hear of the death of old carey the tears started into the eyes of emmeline she was an excellent servant and served the family faithfully many years poor emmeline felt the tears fall on her bosom but however she was old and had been i suppose long infirm i hope the person who now fills her place has supplied it to your satisfaction yes yes my lord inarticulately sobbed emmeline quite overcome by the mention of her old friend i dare say she does resumed his lordship for grant of whom lady montreville has a very high opinion assured her ladyship she was well recommended emmeline now found her emotion very painful she therefore rose to go and curtseying to lord montreville tried to wish him good night a good night to you miss mowbray said he rising delamere started from his chair and taking her hand desired to have the honor of conducting her to her room but this was a gallantry his father by no means approved no frederic said he taking himself the hand he held you will give me leave to see miss mowbray to the door he led her thither and then bowing wished her again good night emmeline hurried to her room where she endeavoured to recollect her dissipated spirits and to consider in what way it would be proper for her to address lord montreville the next day to urge her request of a removal from the castle mrs carey had a sister who resided at swansea in glamorganshire where her husband had a little place in the excise and where she had a small house part of which she had been accustomed to let to those who frequented the place for the benefit of seabathing she was old and without any family of her own and emmeline to whom she was the more agreeable as being the sister of mrs carey thought she might reside with her with propriety and comfort if lord montreville would allow her a small annual stipend for her cloaths and board while she was considering in what manner to address herself to his lordship the next day the gentlemen were talking of the perfections of the nymph of the castle by which name delamere toasted her at supper lord montreville who did not seem particularly delighted with the praise his son so warmly bestowed said why surely frederic you are uncommonly eloquent on behalf of your welch cousin faith my lord answered delamere i like her so well that i think its a little unlucky i did not come alone my welch cousin is the very thing for a tête à tête yes said lord montreville carelessly she is really grown a good fine young woman dont you think so george addressing himself to fitzedward i do indeed my lord answered he and heres mr headly tho an old married man absolutely petrified with admiration upon my soul headly continued delamere i already begin to see great capabilities about this venerable mansion i think i shall take to it as my father offers it me especially as i suppose miss emmeline is to be included in the inventory come come frederic said lord montreville gravely no light conversation on the subject of miss mowbray she is under my care and i must have her treated with propriety his lordship immediately changed the discourse and soon after complaining of being fatigued retired to his chamber chapter iv lord montreville whose first object was his son had observed with some alarm the immediate impression he seemed to have received from the beauty of emmeline the next day he made some farther remarks on his attention to her when they met at dinner which gave him still more uneasiness and he accused himself of great indiscretion in having thrown an object whose loveliness he could not help acknowledging in the way of delamere whose ardent and impetuous temper he knew so well this gave his behaviour to emmeline an air of coldness and even of displeasure which prevented her summoning courage to speak to him in the morning of the day after his arrival and the evening afforded her no opportunity for lord montreville determined to keep her as much as possible out of the sight of delamere did not send for her down to supper and had privately resolved to remove her as soon as possible to some other residence thus his apprehensions lest his son should form an attachment prejudicial to his ambitious views produced in his lordships mind a resolution in regard to placing more properly his orphan niece which no consideration had it related merely to herself would probably have effected at supper delamere enquired eagerly for his lovely cousin to which lord montreville drily answered that she did not he believed sup below but the manner of this enquiry and the anxious looks delamere directed towards the door together with his repeated questions increased all lord montrevilles fears he went to bed out of humour rather with himself than his son and rising early the next morning enquired for miss mowbray miss mowbray was walked out as was her custom very early no one knew whither he learned also that mr delamere was gone out with his gun without fitzedward who not being very fond of field sports had agreed to join him at a later hour he immediately fancied that delamere and emmeline might meet and the pain such a suspicion brought with it was by him who had hardly ever felt an hours uneasiness considered as so great an evil that he determined to put an end to it as soon as possible after an hasty breakfast in his own room he summoned maloney to attend him and went over the accounts of the estates entrusted to him with the state of which his lordship declared himself well contented and not knowing to whom else he could apply to enquire for a situation for emmeline he told maloney that as miss mowbray was now of an age to require some alteration in her mode of life he was desirous of finding for her a reputable house in some town in wales where she might lodge and board maloney encouraged by being thus consulted by his lord ventured with many bows blushes and stammering apologies to disclose to lord montreville his partiality to miss mowbray and this communication he so contrived to word that his lordship had no doubt of emmelines having allowed him to make it lord montreville listened therefore in silence and without any marks of disapprobation to the account maloney proceeded to give of his prospects and property while he was doing so family pride made a faint struggle in his lordships breast on behalf of his deserted ward he felt some pain in determining that a creature boasting a portion of the mowbray blood should sink into the wife of a man of such inferior birth as maloney but when the advantages of so easily providing for her were recollected when he considered that maloney would be happy to take her with a few hundred pounds and that all apprehensions in regard to his son would by that means for ever be at an end avarice and ambition two passions which too much influenced lord montreville joined to persuade him of the propriety of the match and became infinitely too powerful to let him listen to his regard to the memory of his brother or his pity for his deserted ward he thought that as the existence of emmeline was hardly known beyond the walls of the castle he should incur no censure from the world if he consigned her to that obscurity to which the disadvantages of her birth seemed originally to have condemned her these reflections arose while maloney charmed to find himself listened to was proceeding in his discourse lord montreville tho too much used to the manners of politicians to be able to give a direct answer at length put an end to it by telling him he would consider of what he had said and talk to him farther in a few days in the mean time his lordship desired that no part of their conversation might transpire maloney transported at a reception which seemed to prognosticate the completion of his wishes retired elated with his prospects and lord montreville summoning mr headly to attend him mounted his horse to survey the ground on which he meditated improvements round the castle the cold and almost stern civility of lord montreville for the little time emmeline had seen him had created despondence and uneasiness in her bosom she fancied he disliked her unoffending as she was and would take the first opportunity of shaking her off an idea which together with the awe she could not help feeling in his presence made her determine as much as possible to avoid it till he should give her a proper opportunity to speak to him or till she could acquire courage to seek it at seven in the morning she arose after an uneasy night and having taken an early breakfast betook herself to her usual walk carrying with her a book the sun was hot and she went to a wood which partly cloathed an high hill near the boundary of the estate where intent only on her own sorrows she could not beguile them by attending to the fictitious and improbable calamities of the heroine of a novel which mrs garnet probably forgetting to restore it to the library of some former mistress had brought down among her cloaths and which had been seized by emmeline as something new at least to her but her mind overwhelmed with its own anxiety refused its attention and tired with her walk she sat down on a tree that had been felled reflecting on what had passed since lord montrevilles arrival and considering how she might most effectually interest him in her behalf delamere attended by a servant had gone upon the hills in pursuit of his game and having had great success for some hours he came down about eleven oclock into the woods to avoid the excessive heat which was uncommon for the season the noise he made in brushing through the underwood with his gun and rustling among the fading leaves alarmed her he stepped over the timber and seating himself by her seized her hands oh my charming cousin cried he i think myself one of the most fortunate fellows on earth thus to meet you emmeline would have risen oh no continued he indeed you do not go till we have had a little conversation i can not stay indeed sir said emmeline i must immediately go home by no means i can not part with youcome come sit down and hear what i have to say it was to no purpose to resist the impetuous vehemence of delamere was too much for the timid civility of emmeline and not believing that any thing more than common conversation or a few unmeaning compliments would pass she sat down with as much composure as she could command but delamere who was really captivated at the first and who now thought her more beautiful than he had done in their former interviews hesitated not to pour forth the most extravagant professions of admiration in a style so unequivocal that emmeline believing he meant to insult her burst into a passion of tears and besought him in a tremulous and broken voice not to be so cruel as to affront her but to suffer her to return home delamere could not see her terror without being affected he protested that so far from meaning to give her pain he should think himself too happy if she would allow him to dedicate his whole life to her service poor emmeline however continued to weep and to beseech him to let her go to which as her distress arose almost to agony he at length consented and taking her arm within his he said he would walk home with her himself to this emmeline in vain objected to escape was impossible to prevail on him to leave her equally so she was therefore compelled to follow him which she did with reluctance while he still continued to profess to her the most violent and serious attachment they proceeded in this manner along the nearest path to the castle which lay principally among copses that fringed the banks of the river they had just passed through the last and entered the meadows which lay immediately under the castle walls when lord montreville and headly on horseback appeared from a woody lane just before them at the noise of horses so near them emmeline looked up and seeing lord montreville again struggled but without success to disengage her hand delamere continued to walk on and his lordship soon came up to them he checked his horse and said somewhat sternly so sir where have you been delamere without the least hesitation answeredshooting my lord the early part of the morning and since that making love to my cousin who was so good as to sit and wait for me under a tree for mercys sake mr delamere cried emmeline consider what you say waiting for you under a tree cried lord montreville in amazement do miss mowbray be so good as to return homeand you frederic will i suppose be back by dinner time yes answered delamere when i have conducted my cousin home i shall go out again perhaps for an hour before dinner he was then walking on without noticing the stern and displeased looks of his father or the terror of poor emmeline who saw too evidently that lord montreville was extremely angry his lordship after a moments pause dismounted gave his horse to a servant and joined them telling delamere he had some business with miss mowbray and would therefore walk with her towards the castle himself delamere kissed her hand gayly and assuring his father that for the first time in his life he felt an inclination to take his business off his hands he beckoned to his servant to follow with his dogs and then leaping over the hedge that separated the meadow from the hollow lane he disappeared emmeline trembling with apprehension walked with faultering steps by the side of lord montreville who for some time was silent he at length saidyour having been brought up in retirement miss mowbray has perhaps prevented your being acquainted with the decorums of the world and the reserve which a young woman should ever strictly maintain you have done a very improper thing in meeting my son and i must desire that while you are at the castle no such appointments may take place in future tho she saw from the first moment of his meeting them that he had conceived this idea and was confirmed in it by delameres speech yet she was so much shocked and hurt by the address that as she attempted to answer her voice failed her the tears however which streamed from her eyes having a little relieved her she endeavoured to assure his lordship that till she met mr delamere in the wood that morning she did not know even of his having left the castle and how happened you to be where he found you miss mowbray i went thither my lord with a book which i was eager to finish oh i remember that maloney told me you was a great reader and from some other discourse he held relative to you i own i was the more surprised at your indiscretion in regard to my son they were by this time arrived at the castle and lord montreville desired emmeline to follow him into the parlour where they both sat down his lordship renewed the discourse this morning maloney has been talking to me about you and from what he said i concluded you had formed with him engagements which should have prevented you from listening to the boyish and improper conversation of mr delamere engagements with mr maloney my lord surely he could never assert that i have ever formed engagements with him why not absolutely soi think he did not say that but i understood that you was by no means averse to his informing me of his attachment and was willing if my consent was obtained to become his wife perhaps he has no very great advantages yet considering your situation which is you know entirely dependent i really think you do perfectly right in designing to accept of the establishment he offers you to become the wife of maloneyto accept of the establishment he offers me i am humbled i am lost indeed no my lord unhappy as i am i can claim nothing it is true but if the support of an unfortunate orphan thrown by providence into your care is too troublesome suffer me to be myself a servant and believe i have a mind which tho it will not recoil from any situation where i can earn my bread by honest labour is infinitely superior to any advantages such a man as maloney can offer me she wept too much to be able to proceed and sat overwhelmed with grief and mortification while lord montreville continued to speak why distress yourself in this manner miss mowbray i can not see any thing which ought to offend you if maloney has misrepresented the matter and if he has not your extraordinary emotion must look like a consciousness of having altered your mind your motive for doing so can not be mistaken but let me speak to you explicitlyto mr delamere my son the heir to a title and estate which makes him a desirable match for the daughters of the first houses in the kingdom you can have no pretensions therefore never do yourself so much prejudice as to let your mind glance that way maloney tells me he has some property and still better expectations he is established here in an excellent place and should he marry you it shall be still more advantageous you are i am sorry to be obliged to repeat it without any dependance but on my favour you will therefore do wisely to embrace a situation in which that favour may be most effectually exerted on your behalf as you have undoubtedly encouraged maloney the aversion you now pretend towards him is artifice or coquetry consider before you decide consider thoroughly what is your situation and what your expectations and recollect that as my son now means to be very frequently at mowbray castle you can not remain with propriety but as the wife of maloney neither as the wife of maloney nor as emmeline mowbray will i stay my lord another day answered she assuming more spirit than she had yet shewn i wished for an interview to entreat your lordship would allow me to go to some place less improper for my abode than mowbray castle has long been and whither would you go miss mowbray on that my lord i wished to consult you but since it is perhaps a matter unworthy your attention since it seems to signify little what becomes of me i must determine to hazard going to mrs watkinss who will probably give me an asylum at least till i can find some one who will receive me or some means of providing for myself the necessaries of life you then positively reject the overtures of maloney positively my lordand for ever i beg it may not be mentioned to me again and who is mrs watkins the sister of mrs carey my lord where does she live at swansea in glamorganshire where she is accustomed to take in boarders she would i believe receive me after a moments consideration lord montreville said that perhaps may do since you absolutely refuse the other plan i would have you therefore prepare to go thither but i must insist on no more morning interviews with mr delamere and that whither you are going may be kept unknown to him but tell me continued he what i am to say to poor maloney that you are astonished at his insolence in daring to lift his eyes to a person bearing the name of mowbray and shocked at his falsehood in presuming to assert that i ever encouraged his impertinent pretensions this effort of spirit exhausted all the courage emmeline had been able to raise she arose and attempted to reach the door but overcome by the violence of her agitation was obliged to sit down in a chair near it she could no longer restrain the tears which were extorted from her by the mortifying scene she had passed through and her deep sighs which seemed ready to burst her heart excited the compassion of lord montreville who where his ambition was not in question was not void of humanity the violent and artless sorrow of a beautiful young woman whose fate seemed to be in his power affected him he took her hand with kindness and told her he was sorry to have said any thing that appeared harsh his lordship added that he would have her write to mrs watkins that a servant should be sent with the letter and that on condition of her concealing her abode from delamere she should be supplied with an annual income equal to all her wants then hearing delameres gun which he always discharged before he entered the house he hastened emmeline away desiring she would remain in her own apartment where every thing necessary should be sent to her chapter v delamere and fitzedward soon after entered the parlour where lord montreville remained he received his son with a coldness to which tho little accustomed to it delamere paid no attention despotic as this beloved son had always been in the family he felt not the least apprehension that he had really offended his father or feeling it knew that his displeasure would be so short livd that it was not worth any concern here fitzedward said hehere is my father angry with me for making love to my cousin emmy faith sir turning to lord montreville i think i have the most reason to be angry at being brought into such dangerous company tho your lordship well knows how devilishly susceptible i am and that ever since i was ten years old i have been dying for some nymph or other i know that you are a strange inconsiderate boy answered lord montreville very gravelybut i must beg frederic to hear no more idle raillery on the subject of miss mowbray to this delamere gave some slight answer and the discourse was led by his lordship to some other topic fitzedward who was about five years older than delamere concealed under the appearance of candour and nonchalance the libertinism of his character he had entered very young into the army the younger son of an irish peer and had contracted his loose morals by being thrown too early into the world for his heart was not originally bad with a very handsome person he had the most insinuating manners and an address so truly that of a man of fashion as immediately prejudiced in his favour those by whom he wished to be thought well of where he desired to please he seldom failed of pleasing extremely and his conversation was in the general commerce of the world elegant and attractive delamere was very fond of his company and lord montreville encouraged the intimacy for of whatever fashionable vices fitzedward was guilty he contrived by a sort of sentimental hypocrisy to prevent their being known to or at least offensive to those whose good opinion it was his interest to cultivate delamere was of a character very opposite accustomed from his infancy to the most boundless indulgences he never formed a wish the gratification of which he expected to be denied and if such a disappointment happened he gave way to an impetuosity of disposition that he had never been taught to restrain and which gave an appearance of ferocity to a temper not otherwise bad he was generous candid and humane and possessed many other good qualities but the defects of his education had obscured them lady montreville who beheld in her only son the last male heir of a very ancient and illustrious house and who hoped to see all its glories revive in him could never be prevailed upon to part with him he had therefore a tutor in the house and his parents themselves accompanied him abroad and the weakness of lady montreville in regard to her son encreased rather than diminished with his encreasing years her fondness was gratified in seeing the perfections of his person which was a very fine one while to the imperfections of his temper she was entirely blind his father was equally fond of him and looked up to the accumulated titles and united fortunes of his own and his wifes families as the point where all his ambitious views would attain their consummation to watch over the conduct of this only son seemed now to be the sole business of his lordships life and till now he had no reason to fear that his solicitude for his final establishment would be attended with so little effect except a few youthful indiscretions which were overlooked or forgiven delamere had shewn no inclinations that seemed inimical to his fathers views and lord montreville hoped that his present passion for emmeline would be forgotten as easily as many other transient attachments which his youth and warmth of temper had led him into at dinner delamere enquired whether his charming cousin was always to remain a prisoner in her own room to which lord montreville answered that it had been her custom and as there was no lady with them it was better she should continue it he then changed the discourse and contrived to keep delamere in sight the whole afternoon and by that means prevented any further enquiries after emmeline who now entirely confined to her turret impatiently awaited the return of the messenger who had been sent to swansea delamere in the mean time had lingered frequently about the housekeepers room in hopes of seeing emmeline but she never appeared he applied to mrs garnet for intelligence of her but she had received orders from lord montreville not to satisfy his enquiries he employed his servants therefore to discover where she was usually to be found and by their means was at length informed in what part of the castle her apartment lay and that there was a design actually on foot to send her away but whither he could not learn the answer brought from mrs watkins by the man who had been sent to swansea expressed her readiness to take the boarder offered her this intelligence lord montreville communicated himself to emmeline who received it with such artless satisfaction that his lordship who had before doubted whether some degree of coquetry was not concealed under the apparent ingenuous innocence of his niece now believed he had judged too hastily it remained to be considered how she could be conveyed from mowbray castle without the knowledge of delamere she was herself ignorant of every thing beyond its walls and could therefore be of no use in the consultation his lordship had however entrusted fitzedward with his uneasiness about delamere at which the former only laughed and said he by no means believed that any serious consequences were to be apprehended that it was mere badinage of which he was sure delamere would think no more after they left mowbray castle and that it was not a matter which his lordship should allow to make him uneasy lord montreville however who thought he could not too soon remedy his own indiscretion in introducing emmeline to his son determined to embrace the opportunity of putting an end to any future correspondence between them he therefore insisted on a promise of secresy from fitzedward and had recourse to headly who from a frequent residence among the great was the most accommodating and obsequious of their servants as he was about to leave the castle in a few days he offered his services to convey miss mowbray from thence in a chaise of which he was master this proposal was eagerly accepted by lord montreville and enjoining mr headly also to secresy it was fixed that their journey should begin the next morning save one emmeline had notice of this arrangement which she received with the liveliest joy she immediately set about such preparations as were necessary for her journey in which she employed that and the remaining day which had been destined by lord montreville to visit another estate that he possessed at the distance of about twelve miles whither delamere and the whole party accompanied him delamere had discovered by his servants that to remove emmeline was in agitation and he determined to see her again in spite of his fathers precaution which in fact only served to encrease his desire of declaring his sentiments but he had no idea that she was to depart so soon and therefore was content to go with his father at his particular request it was late in the evening preceding that on which emmeline was to leave the castle before they returned to it and she was still busied in providing for her journey in doing which she was obliged to open one of the caskets left her by mrs carey it contained miniatures of her father and her mother which had been drawn at paris before her birth and several letters written by mrs mowbray her grandmother to her mother in consequence of the fatal step she had taken in quitting the protection of that lady who had brought her up to accompany mr mowbray abroad these emmeline had never yet seen nor had she now courage entirely to peruse them the little she read however filled her heart with the most painful sensations and her eyes with tears while she was employed in her little arrangements time passed insensibly away she heard the hollow sound of shutting the great doors at the other end of the castle as was usual before the servants retired for the night but attentive only to what was at present her greatest concern making room for some favourite books in the box she meant to take with her she heeded not the hour a total silence had long reigned in the castle and her almost extinguished candle told her it was time to take some repose when as she was preparing to do so she thought she heard a rustling and indistinct footsteps in the passage near her room she startedlistenedbut all was again profoundly silent and she supposed it had been only one of those unaccountable noises which she had been used to hear along the dreary avenues of the castle she began anew to unpin her hair when a second time the same noise in the passage alarmed her she listened again and while she continued attentive the great clock struck two amazed to find it so late her terror encreased yet she endeavoured to reason herself out of it and to believe that it was the effect of fancy she heard it no more and had almost determined to go out into the passage to satisfy herself that her fears were groundless when just as she approached the door the whispers were renewed she saw the lock move and heard a violent push against it the door however was locked which was no sooner perceived by the assailant than a violent effort with his foot forced the rusty decayed work to give way and mr delamere burst into the room emmeline was infinitely too much terrified to speak nor could her trembling limbs support her she sat downthe colour forsook her cheeksand she was not sensible that delamere had thrown himself at her feet and was pouring forth the most vehement and incoherent expressions that frantic passion could dictate recovering her recollection she beheld delamere kneeling before her holding her hands in his and millefleur standing behind him with a candle she attempted to speak but the words died away on her lips while delamere shocked at the situation into which he had thrown her protested that he meant her not the smallest offence but that having learnt by means of his valet that she was to go the next morning and that his father intended to keep him ignorant of her future destiny he could not bear to reflect that he might lose her for ever and had therefore taken the only means in his power to speak to her in hopes of engaging her pity for which he would hazard every thing leave me sir leave me said emmeline in a voice scarcely articulate leave me instantly or i will alarm the house that is almost impossible replied delamere but i will not terrify you more than i have done already no emmeline i wish not to alarm you and will quit you instantly if you will tell me that wheresoever you are you will permit me to see you and will remember me with pity and regard my father shall notcannot controul my conduct nor shall all the power on earth prevent my following you if you will yourself permit me tell me emmelinetell me you will not forget me as what sir should i remember you but as my persecutor as one who has injured me beyond reparation by your wild and cruel conduct and who has now dared to insult me by a most unparallelled outrageleave me sir i repeat to you that you must instantly quit the room she arose and walked with tottering steps to the end of it delamere followed her she turned and came towards the door which was still open and then recollected that as she knew the passages of the castle which she was convinced neither delamere or his servant did she might possibly escape and find lord montrevilles room which she knew to be at the end of the east gallery delamere was a few steps behind her when she reached the door which hastily throwing quite open she ran lightly thro the passage which was very long and dark he pursued her imploring her to hear him but a moment and the frenchman as hastily followed his master with the candle but at the end of the passage a flight of broken steps led to a brick hall which opened to other staircases and galleries a gust of wind blew out the candle and emmeline gliding down the steps turned to the right and opening a heavy nailed door which led by a narrow stairs to the east gallery she let it fall after her delamere now in total darkness tried in vain to follow the sound he listenedbut no longer heard the footsteps of the trembling fugitive and cursing his fate and the stupidity of millefleur he endeavoured to find his way back to emmelines room where he thought a candle was still burning but his attempt was vain he walked round the hall only to puzzle himself for the door by which he had entered it he could not regain in the mean time emmeline breathless with fear had reached the gallery and feeling her way till she came as she supposed to the door of the room where lord montreville slept she tapped lightly at it a mans voice asked who it was it is i my lord cried emmeline hardly able to make herself heardmr delamere pursues me somebody opened the doorbut there was no light and emmeline retiring a step from it the person again asked who it was it is emmeline replied she who now first recollected that the voice was not that of lord montrevilleshe flew therefore towards the next door with exclamations of encreased terror but lord montreville who was now awakened appeared at it with a lamp in his hand and emmeline in answer to his question of what is the matter endeavoured to say that she was pursued by mr delamere but fear had so entirely overcome her that she could only sigh out his name and gasping like a dying person sat down on a bench which was near the door fitzedward who was the person she had first spoken to had by this time dressed himself and came to her with a glass of water out of his room while lord montreville hearing his sons name so inarticulately pronounced and seeing the speechless affright in which emmeline sat before him conceived the most alarming apprehensions and believed that his son was either dead or dying with great difficulty he summoned up courage enough again to beg for heavens sake she would tell him what had occasioned her to leave her room at such an hour she again exclaimed it is mr delamere my lord what of mr delamerewhat of my son cried he with infinite agitation save me from him my lord answered emmeline a little recovered by the water she had drank where is he then said his lordship i know not replied emmeline but he came to my room with his servant and i flew hither to implore your protection fitzedward intreated lord montreville to be more calm and to give miss mowbray time to recollect herself he offered to go in search of delamere but his lordship was in too much anxiety to be satisfied with any enquiries but his own he therefore said he would go down himself but emmeline catching his hand entreated him not to leave her at this moment the voices of delamere and his man were heard echoing through the whole side of the castle for wearied with their fruitless attempts to escape they both called for lights in no very gentle tone lord montreville easily distinguished from whence the noise came and followed by emmeline whom fitzedward supported he descended into the brick hall from whence emmeline had effected her escape where he found delamere trembling with passion and millefleur with fear lord montreville could not conceal his anger and resentment how comes it sir cried he addressing himself to his son that you dare thus to insult a person who is under my protection what excess of madness and folly has tempted you to violate the retirement of miss mowbray i mean not my lord answered delamere to attempt a concealment of my sentiments i love miss mowbray passionately love her and scorn to dissimulate i know you had a design to send her from hence clandestinely to send her and i determined that she should not go till i had declared my attachment to her which i found you endeavoured assiduously to prevent you may certainly remove her from hence but i protest to you that wherever she is there i will endeavour to see her in spite of the universe lord montreville now felt all the force of the error he had committed in that boundless indulgence to which he had accustomed his son in the first instance of any consequence in which their wishes differed he saw him ready to throw off the restraint of paternal authority and daring to avow his resolution to act as he pleased this mortifying reflection arose in his mind while with a look of mingled anger and amazement he beheld delamere who having ordered millefleur to light his candle snatched it from him and hastily retired emmeline who had stood trembling the whole time behind lord montreville besought him to ring up the housekeeper and direct her to stay with her for the rest of the night for she declared she would on no account remain in her own room alone his lordship recommending her to the care of fitzedward went himself in search of the housekeeper and emmeline refusing to seek a more commodious apartment sat down in one of the windows of the hall to wait his return fitzedward to whom she had yet hardly spoken now entertained her with a profusion of compliments almost as warm as those she had heard from delamere but her spirits quite exhausted by the terror which had so lately possessed them could no longer support her she was unable to give an answer of common civility and was very glad to see lord montreville return with mrs garnet who extremely discomposed at being disturbed and obliged to appear in her nightcap followed her grumbling into her room where as emmeline refused to go to it herself she took possession of her bed and soon falling into a profound sleep left its melancholy owner to her sad reflections she had not been many minutes indulging them and wishing for the return of light before somebody was again at the door emmeline still apprehending delamere stepped to it and was astonished to see lord montreville himself he entered the room and told her that as his son knew of her journey in the morning he would probably try some means to prevent it or at least to trace out her abode that it was therefore absolutely necessary for her to be ready by day break or before for which he had prepared mr headly who was up and getting ready to set out as soon as there was light enough to make it safe emmeline who thought she could not be gone too soon now hastily finished the remainder of her packing and having dressed herself for her journey which notwithstanding her sleepless night she rejoiced to find so near she waited with impatience till mr headly summoned her to go chapter vi the sun no sooner appeared above the horizon than her conductor was ready with his onehorse chair and emmeline being seated in it and her little baggage adjusted she left the door of the castle where maloney who saw his favourite hopes vanish as he feared for ever stood with a rueful countenance to behold her departure however desirous she was of quitting a residence which had long been uneasy to her and which was now become so extremely improper such is the force of early habit that she could not bid it adieu without being greatly affected there she had passed her earliest infancy and had known in that period of unconscious happiness many delightful hours which would return no more it was endeared to her by the memory of that good friend who had supplied to her the place of a parent from whom alone she had ever heard the soothing voice of maternal solicitude and as she passed by the village church which had been formerly the chapel of the monastery and joined the castle walls she turned her eyes filled with tears towards the spot where the remains of mrs carey were deposited and sighed deeply a thousand tender and painful recollections crouding on her heart as she left the village several women and children who had heard she was going that day were already waiting to bid her farewell considering her as the last of that family by whom they had been employed when in health and relieved when in sickness they lamented her departure as their greatest misfortune the present possessor of the castle bore not the name of mowbray and was not at all interested for the peasantry among whom he was a stranger they therefore in losing emmeline seemed to lose the last of the race of their ancient benefactors emmeline affected by their simple expressions of regret returned their good wishes with tears and as soon as the chaise drove out of the village again fixed her eyes on the habitation she had quitted its venerable towers rising above the wood in which it was almost embosomed made one of the most magnificent features of a landscape which now appeared in sight the road lay along the side of what would in england be called a mountain at its feet rolled the rapid stream that washed the castle walls foaming over fragments of rock and bounded by a wood of oak and pine among which the ruins of the monastery once an appendage to the castle reared its broken arches and marked by grey and mouldering walls and mounds covered with slight vegetation it was traced to its connection with the castle itself still frowning in gothic magnificence and stretching over several acres of ground the citadel which was totally in ruins and covered with ivy crowning the whole farther to the west beyond a bold and rocky shore appeared the sea and to the east a chain of mountains which seemed to meet the clouds while on the other side a rich and beautiful vale now variegated with the mellowed tints of the declining year spread its enclosures till it was lost again among the blue and barren hills headly declaimed eloquently on the charms of the prospect which gradually unveiled itself as the autumnal mist disappeared but emmeline tho ever alive to the beauties of nature was too much occupied by her own melancholy reflections to attend to the animadversions of her companion she saw nothing but the castle of which she believed she was now taking an eternal adieu and her looks were fixed on it till the road winding down the hill on the other side concealed it from her sight headly imputed her sadness to a very different cause than that of an early and long attachment to a particular spot he supposed that regret at being obliged to leave delamere to whose passion he could not believe her insensible occasioned the melancholy that overwhelmed her he spoke to her of him and affected to lament the uneasiness which so violent and ungovernable a temper in an only son might occasion to his family he then talked of the two young ladies his sisters whom he described as the finest young women in the country and as highly accomplished emmeline sighed at the comparison between their situation and her own after some hours travelling through roads which made it very fatigueing they arrived at a little obscure house of entertainment and after some refreshment continued their journey unmolested delamere arose early and calling for millefleur enquired at what hour miss mowbray was to go on hearing that she had left the castle more than an hour his rage and vexation broke through all the respect he owed his father who being acquainted by his valet of his resolution immediately to follow the chaise entered the room he remonstrated with him at first with great warmth but delamere irritated by contradiction obstinately adhered to his resolution of immediately pursuing the travellers lord montreville finding that opposition rather encreased than remedied the violence of his sons passionate sallies determined to try what persuasion would do and delamere whose temper was insensible to the threats of anger yielded to remonstrance when softened by paternal affection and consented to forego his intention if lord montreville would tell him where emmeline was gone his lordship who probably thought this one of those instances in which falsehood is excuseable if not meritorious told him with affected reluctance that she was gone to board at bridgenorth with mrs watkins the sister of old carey as this account was extremely probable delamere readily believed it and having with some difficulty been prevailed upon to pass his word that he would not immediately take any steps to see her tranquillity was for the present restored to the castle emmeline in the mean time after a long and weary journey arrived at swansea mrs watkins who expected her received her in a little but very neat habitation which consisted of a small room by way of parlour not unlike the cabin of a packet boat and a bedchamber over it of the same dimensions of these apartments emmeline took possession her conductor took leave of her and she now wished to be able to form some opinion of her new hostess whose countenance which extremely resembled that of mrs carey had immediately prejudiced her in her favour being assured by lord montreville of every liberal payment for the board and lodging of miss mowbray she received her with a degree of civility almost oppressive but emmeline who soon found that she possessed none of that warmth of heart and lively interest in the happiness of others which so much endeared to her the memory of her former friend was very glad when after a few days the good woman returned with her usual avidity to the regulation of her domestic matters and suffered emmeline to enjoy that solitude which she knew so well how to employ delamere still lingering at the castle where he seemed to stay for no other reason than because he had there seen emmeline was pensive restless and absent and lord montreville saw with great alarm that this impression was less likely to be effaced by time and absence than he had supposed fitzedward obliged to go to ireland to his regiment for some time had taken leave of them and the impatience of lord montreville to return to town was encreased by repeated letters from his wife delamere however still evaded it hoping that his father would set out without him and that he should by that means have an opportunity of going to bridgenorth where he determined to solicit emmeline to consent to a scottish expedition and persuaded himself he should not meet a refusal at length lady montreville yet more alarmed at the delay directed her eldest daughter to write to his lordship and to give such an account of her health as should immediately oblige the father and son to return delamere after such a letter could not refuse to depart and comforting himself that he might be able soon to escape from the observation of his family and put his project in execution he consented to begin his journey he determined however to write to miss mowbray and to desire her to direct her answer under cover to a friend in london he did so and addressed it to her at mrs watkinss at bridgenorth but soon after his arrival in town the letter was returned to the place from which it was dated having been opened at the office in consequence of no such person as miss mowbray or mrs watkins being to be found there delamere saw he had been deceived but to complain was fruitless he had therefore no hope of discovering where emmeline was but by lying in wait for some accidental intelligence the family usually passed the christmas recess at their seat in norfolk whither delamere who at first tried to avoid being of the party at length agreed to accompany them on condition of his being allowed to perform an engagement he had made with mr percival for a fortnight part of this time he determined to employ in seeing headly who did not live above thirty miles from thence hoping from him to obtain intelligence of emmelines abode and that no suspicion might remain on the mind of his father he affected to reassume his usual gaiety and was to all appearance as volatile and dissipated as ever while the family were in norfolk their acquaintance was warmly renewed with that of sir francis devereux who was lately returned from a residence on the continent whither he had been to compleat the education of his two daughters heiresses to his fortune on the embellishment of whose persons and manners all the modern elegancies of education had been lavished they were rather pretty women and of a family almost as ancient and illustrious as that of mr delamere their fortunes were to be immense and either of them would have been a wife for delamere the choice of whom would greatly have gratified the families on both sides infinite pains were taken to bring the young people frequently together and both the ladies seemed to allow that delamere was a conquest worthy their ambition as he never refused to entertain them with every appearance of gallantry and vivacity lord montreville flattered himself that at length emmeline was forgotten and ventured to propose to his son a marriage with whichever of the miss devereuxs he should prefer to which delamere who had long foreseen the proposal answered coldly that he was not inclined to marry at all or if he did it should not be one of those overeducated puppets so far were their acquisitions from having made any impression on his heart that the frivolous turn of their minds the studied ornaments of their persons and the affected refinement of their manners made him only recollect with more passionate admiration that native elegance of person and mind which he had seen only in the orphan of mowbray castle chapter vii there was in the person and manner of emmeline something so interesting that those who were little accustomed to attach themselves to any one were insensibly disposed to love her and to become solicitous for her welfare even the insensibility with which long and uninterrupted prosperity had encased the heart of lord montreville was not entirely proof against her attractive powers and when he no longer apprehended the effect of her encreasing charms on his son he suffered himself to feel a degree of pity and even of affection for her he therefore heard with pleasure that she was contented in her present situation and was convinced she had kept her word in not giving any intelligence of her residence to delamere to shew his approbation of her conduct he directed a person in town to send her down a small collection of books some materials for drawing and other trifles which he thought would be acceptable emmeline charmed with such acquisitions felt the most lively gratitude for her benefactor and having fitted up her little cabin extremely to her satisfaction she found in the occupation these presents afforded her all that she wished to engage her attention and gratify her taste sensible of the defects of her education she applied incessantly to her books for of every useful and ornamental feminine employment she had long since made herself mistress without any instruction she endeavoured to cultivate a genius for drawing which she inherited from her father but for want of knowing a few general rules what she produced had more of elegance and neatness than correctness and knowledge she knew nothing of the science of music but her voice was soft and sweet and her ear exquisite the simple songs therefore she had acquired by it she sung with a pathos which made more impression on her hearers than those studied graces learned by long application which excite wonder rather than pleasure time thus occupied passed lightly away spring arrived almost imperceptibly and brought again weather which enabled emmeline to reassume her walks along the shore or among the rocks and to indulge that contemplative turn of mind which she had acquired in the solitude of mowbray castle it was on a beautiful morning of the month of april that taking a book with her as usual she went down to the sea side and sat reading for some hours when just as she was about to return home she saw a lovely little boy about five years old wandering towards the place where she was picking up shells and sea weeds and appearing to be so deeply engaged in his infantine pursuit that he did not see her till she spoke to him whose sweet little boy are you my love said she the child looked at her with surprise i am my mammas boy said he and so is henry pointing towards another who now approached and who seemed hardly a year younger the second running up to his brother caught his hand and they both walked away together looking behind at the strange lady with some degree of alarm their dress convinced emmeline that they belonged to a stranger and as they seemed to have nobody with them she was under some apprehension for their safety and therefore arose to follow them when on turning round the point of a rock whose projection had concealed the shore to the left she saw a lady walking slowly before her whom the two little boys had now rejoined in her hand she held a little girl who seemed only learning to walk and she was followed by a nursery maid who held in her arms another yet an infant at the breast the stranger near whom emmeline was obliged to pass curtsyed to her as she went by and if emmeline was surprised at the early appearance of company at a time when she knew it to be so unusual the stranger was much more so at the uncommon elegance of her form and manner she was almost tempted to believe the fable of the sea nymphs and to fancy her one of them emmeline on regaining her apartment heard from the hostess whom she found with another neighbour that the lady she had seen arrived the evening before and had taken lodgings at the house of the latter with an intention of staying great part of the summer the next day emmeline again met the stranger who accosting the fair orphan with all that ease which characterises the address of those who have lived much in good company they soon entered into conversation and emmeline almost as soon discovered that her new acquaintance possessed an understanding as excellent as her person and address were captivating she appeared to be not more than five or six and twenty but her person seemed to have suffered from sorrow that diminution of its charms which time could not yet have effected her complexion was faded and wan her eyes had lost their lustre and a pensive and languid expression sat on her countenance after the first conversation the two ladies found they liked each other so well that they met by agreement every day emmeline generally went early to the lodgings of mrs stafford and stayed the whole day with her charmed to have found in her new friend one who could supply to her all the deficiencies of her former instructors to a very superior understanding mrs stafford added the advantages of a polished education and all that ease of manner which the commerce of fashion can supply she had read a great deal and her mind originally elegant and refined was highly cultivated and embellished with all the knowledge that could be acquired from the best authors in the modern languages her disposition seemed to have been naturally chearful for a ray of vivacity would frequently light up her countenance and a lively and agreeable conversation call forth all its animated gaiety but it seldom lasted long some settled uneasiness lay lurking in her heart and when it recurred forcibly to her as it frequently did in the midst of the most interesting discourse a cloud of sorrow obscured the brilliancy of her countenance and language and she became pensive silent and absent emmeline observed this with concern but was not yet intimate enough with her to enquire or discover the cause sometimes when she was herself occupied in drawing or some other pursuit in which mrs stafford delighted to instruct her she saw that her friend believing herself unobserved gave way to all the melancholy that oppressed her heart and as her children were playing round her she would gaze mournfully on them till the tears streamed down her cheeks by degrees the utmost confidence took place between them on every subject but one mrs stafford never dwelt on the cause whatever it was which occasioned her to be so frequently uneasy nor did she ever complain of being so but she listened with the warmest interest to the little tale emmeline had to relate and told her in return as much of her own history as she thought it necessary for her to know emmeline found that she was not a widow as she had at first supposed for she spoke sometimes of her husband and said she expected him at swansea she had been married at a very early age and they now generally resided at an house which mr staffords father who was still living had purchased for them in dorsetshire i came hither said she thus early in the year at mr staffords request who is fond of improvements and alterations and who intends this summer to add considerably to our house which is already too large i think for our present fortune i was glad to get away from the confusion of workmen to which i have an aversion and anxious to let charles and henry who had the measles in the autumn and who have been frequently ill since have a long course of seabathing i might indeed have gone to weymouth or some nearer place but i wish to avoid general company which i could not have done where i am sure of meeting so many of my acquaintance i rejoice now at my preference of swansea since it has been the means of my knowing you my dear emmeline and i madam returned emmeline have reason to consider the concurrence of circumstances that brought you here as the most fortunate for me yet i own to you that the charm of such society is accompanied with great pain in anticipating the hour when i must again return to that solitude i have till now considered as my greatest enjoyment ah my dear girl replied mrs stafford check in its first appearance a propensity which i see you frequently betray to anticipate displeasing or unfortunate events when you have lived a few years longer you will i fear learn that every day has evils enough of its own and that it is well for us we know nothing of those which are yet to come i speak from experience for i when not older than you now are had a perpetual tendency to fancy future calamities and embittered by that means many of those hours which would otherwise have been really happy yet has not my presentiments tho most of them have been unhappily verified enabled me to avoid one of those thorns with which my path has been thickly strewn emmeline hoped now to hear what hand had strewn them mrs stafford sighing deeply fell into a reverie and continuing long silent emmeline could not resolve to renew a conversation so evidently painful to her it was now six weeks since she had first seen mrs stafford and the hours had passed in a series of felicity of which she had till then formed no idea mrs stafford delighted with the lively attachment of her young friend was charmed to find herself capable of adorning her ingenuous and tender mind with all that knowledge which books or the world had qualified her to impart they read together every day emmeline under the tuition of her charming preceptress had made some progress in french and italian and she was amazed at her own success in drawing since she had received from mrs stafford rules of which she was before ignorant as the summer advanced a few stragglers came in and it was no longer wonderful to see a stranger but mrs stafford and miss mowbray perfectly satisfied with each other sought not to enlarge their society they sometimes held short conversations with the transient visitants of the place but more usually avoided those walks where it was likely they should meet them early one morning they were returning from the bathing place together muffled up in their morning dresses they had seen at a distance two gentlemen whom they did not particularly notice and emmeline leaning on the arm of her friend was again anticipating all she should suffer when the hour came which would separate them and recollecting the different company and conversation to which she had been condemned from the death of mrs carey to her quitting mowbray castle you have not only taught me my dear mrs stafford said she to dread more than ever being thrown back into such company but you have also made me fear that i shall never relish the general conversation of the world as i disliked the manners of an inferior description of people when i first knew them because they did not resemble those of the dear good woman who brought me up so i shall undoubtedly be disappointed and dissatisfied with the generality of those acquaintance i may meet with for i am afraid there are as few mrs staffords in your rank of life as there were mrs careys in hers however there is no great likelihood i believe at present of my being convinced how little they resemble you for it is not probable i shall be taken from hence perhaps answered mrs stafford you might be permitted to stay some months next winter with me i shall pass the whole of it in the country the greatest part of it probably alone and such a companion would assist in charming away many of those hours which now tho i have more resources than most people sometimes are heavy and melancholy my children are not yet old enough to be my companions and i know not how it is but i have often more pain than pleasure in being with them when i remember or when i feel how little happiness there is in the world i tremble for their future destiny and in the excess of affection regret having introduced them into a scene of so much pain as i have hitherto found it but tell me emmeline do you think if i apply to lord montreville he will allow you to pass some time with me dear madam said emmeline eagerly what happiness do you offer me lord montreville would certainly think me highly honoured by such an invitation shall i answer for lord montreville said a voice behind them as his immediate representative emmeline started and turning quickly beheld mr delamere and fitzedward delamere caught her hands in his have i then found you my lovely cousin cried heoh happiness unexpected he was proceeding with even more than his usual vehemence but fitzedward thought it necessary to stop him you promised frederic before i consented to come with you that you would desist from these extravagant flights come i beg miss mowbray may be permitted to speak to her other acquaintance and that she will do us both the honour to introduce us to her friend emmeline had lost all courage and recollection on the appearance of delamere mrs stafford saw her distress and assuming a cold and distant manner she saidmiss mowbray i apprehend from what this gentleman has said that he has a message to you from lord montreville has my lord sir said emmeline to delamerehas my lord montreville been so good as to honour me with any commands cruel girl answered he you know too well that my father is not acquainted with my being here then you certainly ought not to be here said emmeline coolly and you must excuse me sir if i beg the favor of you not to detain me nor attempt to renew a conversation so very improper indeed so cruelly injurious to me mrs stafford had emmelines arm within her own from the commencement of this conversation and she now walked hastily on with her delamere followed them intreating to be heard and fitzedward addressing himself on the other side to mrs stafford besought her in a half whisper to allow his friend only a few moments to explain himself to miss mowbray no sir i must be excused answered sheif miss mowbray does me the honour to consult me i shall certainly advise her against committing such an indiscretion as listening to mr delamere ah madam said the colonel throwing into his eyes and manner all that insinuation of which he was so perfect a master is it possible that with a countenance where softness and compassion seem to invite the unhappy to trust you with their sorrows you have a cruel and unfeeling heart lay by for a moment your barbarous prudence in favour of my unfortunate friend upon my honour nothing but the conviction that his life was at stake would have induced me to accompany him hither and i pledge myself for the propriety of his conduct he only begs to be forgiven by miss mowbray for his improper treatment of her at mowbray castle to be assured she is in health and safety and to hear that she does not hate him for all the uneasiness he has given her and having done so he promises to return to his family upon my soul continued he laying his hand upon his breast i know not what would have been the consequence had i not consented to assist him in deceiving his family and coming hither but i have reason to think he would have made some wild attempt to secure to himself more frequent interviews with miss mowbray and that a total disappointment of the project he had formed for seeing her would have been attended with a violence of passion arising even to phrenzymadness or death would perhaps have been the event mrs stafford turned her eyes on fitzedward with a look sufficiently expressive of incredulitydoes a modern man of fashion pretend to talk of madness and death you certainly imagine sir that you are speaking to some romantic inhabitant of a welch provincial town whose ideas are drawn from a circulating library and confirmed by the conversation of the captain in quarters ah madam said he i know not to whom i have the honour of addressing myself though he knew perfectly well but i feel too certainly that madness and death would be preferable to the misery such coldness and cruelty as yours would inflict on me was it my misfortune to love as violently as delamere and indeed i tremble lest in endeavouring to assist my friend i have endangered myself of this speech mrs stafford who believed he did not know her took very little notice and turning towards emmeline who had in the mean time been listening in trembling apprehension to the ardent declarations of delamere said it was time to return home delamere without attending to her hint renewed his importunities for her friendship and interest with miss mowbray to which as soon as he would allow her to answer she said very gravelysir as miss mowbray seems so much alarmed at your pursuing her hither and as you must be yourself sensible of its extreme impropriety i hope you will not lengthen an interview which can only produce uneasiness for you both let us go home for heavens sake whispered emmeline they are determined you see to follow us replied her friend we will however go by this time they were near the door and mrs stafford wishing the two gentlemen a good morning was hurrying with emmeline into the house but fitzedward took hold of her arm one word only madam and we will intrude upon you no farther at present say that you will suffer us to see you again tomorrow not if i can help it be assured sir then madam said delamere you must allow me to finish now what i have to say to miss mowbray good heaven sir exclaimed emmeline why will you thus persist in distressing me you are perhaps known to mrs watkins your name will be at least known to her and intelligence of your being here will be instantly sent to lord montreville emmeline by no means aware that this speech implied a desire of concealment the motives of which might appear highly flattering to delamere was soon made sensible of its import by his answer enough my adorable emmeline cried he eagerly if i am worthy of a thought of that sort i am less wretched than i believed myself i will not now insist on a longer audience but tomorrow i must see you againyour amiable friend here will intercede for mei must not be refused and will wish you a good day before you can form so cruel a resolution so saying he bowed to mrs stafford kissed emmelines hand and departed with fitzedward from the door chapter viii the two fair friends no sooner entered the house than emmeline threw herself into a chair and burst into tears ah my dear madam said she sobbing what will now become of me lord montreville will believe i have corresponded with his son he will withdraw all favour and confidence from me and i shall be undone do not thus distress yourself said mrs stafford tenderly taking her handi hope the rash and cruel conduct of this young man will not have the consequences you apprehend lord montreville from your former conduct will easily credit your not having encouraged this visit ah my dear mrs stafford replied emmeline you do not know lord montreville he hastily formed a notion that i made an appointment with mr delamere at mowbray castle when i had not even seen him above once and though from my eagerness to leave it i believe he afterwards thought he had been too hasty yet so strong was that first impression that the slightest circumstance would i know renew it as forcibly as ever for he has one of those tempers which having once entertained an idea of a persons conduct or character never really alters it though they see the most convincing evidence of its fallacy having once supposed i favoured the addresses of mr delamere as you know he did at mowbray castle the present visit will convince him he was right and that i am the most artful as well as the most ungrateful of beings mrs stafford hesitated a moment and then said i see all the evil you apprehend to convince lord montreville of your ignorance of delameres design and your total rejection of his clandestine addresses suppose i were to write to him he must be prejudiced and uncandid indeed if after such information he is not convinced of your innocence to this proposal emmeline consented with assurances of the liveliest gratitude and mrs stafford returning to her lodgings wrote the following letter to lord montreville swansea june my lord a short abode at this place has given me the pleasure of knowing miss mowbray to whose worth and prudence i am happy to bear testimony at the request of this amiable young woman i am now to address your lordship with information that mr delamere came hither yesterday with mr fitzedward and has again renewed those addresses to miss mowbray which she knows to be so disagreeable to your lordship and which can not but be extremely prejudicial to her circumstanced as she is at this place she can not entirely avoid him but she hopes your lordship will be convinced how truly she laments the pain this improper conduct of mr delamere will give you and she loses not a moment in beseeching you to write to him or otherwise to interfere in prevailing on him to quit swansea and to prevent his continuing to distress her by a pursuit so unwelcome to you and so injurious to her honour and repose i have the honour to be my lord your lordships most obedient servant c stafford this letter being extremely approved of by emmeline was put into the next days post and the two ladies set out for their walk at a very early hour flattering themselves they should return before delamere and fitzedward who was lately raised to the rank of lieutenantcolonel were abroad but in this they deceived themselves they were again overtaken by their importunate pursuers who had now agreed to vary the mode of their attack fitzedward who knew the power of his insidious eloquence over the female heart undertook to plead for his friend to emmeline while delamere was to try to interest mrs stafford and engage her good offices in his behalf they no sooner joined the ladies than delamere said to the latterafter the discouraging reception of yesterday nothing but being persuaded that your heart will refuse to confirm the rigour you think yourself obliged to adopt could make me venture madam to solicit your favour with miss mowbray i now warmly implore it and surely can you believe sir said mrs stafford interrupting him that i shall ever influence miss mowbray to listen to you knowing as i do the aversion of your family to your entertaining any honourable views and having reason to believe you have yourself formed those that are very different you have no reason to believe so madam interrupted delamere in his turn and must wilfully mistake me as an excuse for your cold and unkind manner of treating me by heaven i love emmeline with a passion as pure as it is violent and if she would but consent to it will marry her in opposition to all the world assist me then dear and amiable mrs stafford assist me to conquer the unreasonable prejudice she has conceived against a secret marriage never sir will i counsel miss mowbray to accept such a proposal never will i advise her to unite herself with one whose family disdain to receive her and by clandestinely stealing into it either disturb its peace or undergo the humiliation of living the wife of a man who dares not own her and who madam has said that i dare not own her does not the same blood run in our veins is she not worthy from her personal merit of a throne if i had a throne to offer her and do you suppose i mean to sacrifice the happiness of my whole life to the narrow policy or selfish ambition of my father wait then sir till time shall produce some alteration in your favour emmeline is yet very young too young indeed to marry perhaps when lord and lady montreville are convinced that she only can make you happy they may consent to your union you little know madam the hopelessness of such an expectation were it possible that any arguments any motives could engage my father to forego all the projects of aggrandizing his family by splendid and rich alliances my mother will i know ever be inexorable she will not hear the name of emmeline last winter she incessantly persecuted me with proposals of marriage and is now bent upon persuading me to engage my hand to miss otley a relation of her own who possesses indeed an immense fortune and is of rank but who of all women living would make me the most miserable the fatigueing arguments i have heard about this match and the fruitless and incessant solicitude of my mother convince me i can not for both our sakes too soon put an end to it mrs stafford notwithstanding the vehement plausibility of delamere still declined giving to emmeline such advice as he wished to engage her to offer and tho aware of all the advantages such a marriage would procure her friend she would not influence her to a determination her heart could not approve while delamere therefore was pleading vainly to her fitzedward was exhausting in his discourse with emmeline all that rhetoric on behalf of his friend which had already succeeded so frequently for himself tho he had given way to delameres eagerness and had accompanied him in pursuit of miss mowbray after a few feeble arguments against it he never intended to encourage him in his resolution of marrying her which he thought a boyish and romantic plan and one of which he would probably be weary before it could be executed but as it was a military maxim that in love and war all stratagems are allowable he failed not to lay as much stress on the honourable intentions of delamere as if he had really meant to assist in carrying them into effect emmeline heard him in silence or when an answer of some kind seemed to be extorted from her she told him that she referred herself entirely to mrs stafford and would not even speak upon the subject but before her and as she should dictate in this way several meetings passed between delamere the colonel and the two ladies for unless the latter had wholly confined themselves there was no possible way of avoiding the importunate assiduity of the gentlemen fitzedward had a servant who was an adept in such commissions and who was kept constantly on the watch so that they were traced and followed in spite of all their endeavours to avoid it mrs stafford however persuaded emmeline to be less uneasy at it as she assured her she would never leave her and that there could be no misrepresentation of her conduct while they were together every day they expected some consequence from mrs staffords letter to lord montreville but for ten days though they had heard nothing they satisfied themselves with conjectures ten days more insensibly passed by and they began to think it very extraordinary that his lordship should give no attention to an affair which only a few months before seemed to have occasioned him so much serious alarm in this interval delamere saw emmeline every day and fitzedward on behalf of his friends views attached himself to mrs stafford with an attention as marked and as warm as that of delamere towards miss mowbray he was well aware of the power a woman of her understanding must have over an heart like emmelines so new to the world so ingenuous and so much inclined to indulge all the delicious enthusiasm of early friendship he had had a slight acquaintance with mrs stafford when she was first married and knew enough of her husband to be informed of the source of that dejection which through all her endeavours to conceal it frequently appeared and having lived always among those who consider attachments to married women as allowable gallantries and having had but too much success among them fitzedward thought he could take advantage of mrs staffords situation to entangle her in a connection which would make her more indulgent to the weakness of her friend for delamere but such was the awful yet simple dignity of her manner and so sacred the purity of unaffected virtue that he dared not hazard offending her while aware of the tendency of his flattering and incessant assiduity she was always watchful to prevent any diminution of the respect she had a right to exact and without affecting to shun his society which was extremely agreeable she never suffered him to assume in his conversation with her those freedoms which often made him admired by others nor allowed him to avow that libertinism of principle which she lamented that he possessed fitzedward who had at first undertaken to entertain her merely with a view of favouring delameres conversation with emmeline almost imperceptibly found that it had charms on his own account he could not be insensible of the graces of a mind so highly cultivated and he felt his admiration mingled with a reverence and esteem of which he had never before been sensible but his vanity was piqued at the coldness with which she received his studied and delicate adulation and for the first time in his life he was obliged to acknowledge to himself that there might be a woman whose mind was superior to its influence not being disposed very tranquilly to submit to this mortifying conviction he became more anxious to secure that partiality from mrs stafford which since he found it so hard to acquire became necessary to his happiness and in the hope of obtaining it he would probably long have persisted had not his attention been soon afterwards diverted to another object it wanted only a few days of a month since mrs staffords letter was dispatched to lord montreville but the carelessness of the servant who was left in charge of the house in berkleysquare was the only reason of his not noticing it immediately after the birthday his lordship had quitted london on a visit to a nobleman in buckinghamshire whither his son had attended him and where they parted delamere under pretence of seeing his friend percival really went into berkshire and lord montreville having insisted on delameres joining him at the house of lady mary otley beyond durham where lady montreville and her two daughters were already gone set out himself for that place where they intended to pass the months of july and august he had many friends to visit on the road and when his lordship arrived there he found all his letters had instead of following him as he had directed been sent immediately thither and instead of finding his son or an account of his intended arrival he had the mortification of reading mrs staffords information delamere had indeed passed a few days with mr percival and had written to his father from thence but he had also seen headly from whom he had extorted the secret of emmelines residence fitzedward to whose sister mr percival was lately married had joined delamere at the house of his brotherinlaw and delamere persisting in his resolution of seeing emmeline had without much difficulty prevailed on fitzedward who had some weeks on his hands before he was to join his regiment in ireland and who had no aversion to any plan that looked like an intrigue to accompany him they contrived to gain mr percival and delamere by inclosing letters to him which were forwarded to his father as if he had been still there imagined that he had prevented all probability of discovery could he have persuaded emmeline to a scottish marriage which he very firmly believed he should he intended as soon as they were married to have taken her to the house of lady mary otley and to have presented her to his father his mother his sisters and lady mary and her daughter who were also his relations as his wife lord montreville on reading mrs staffords letter shut himself up in his own apartment to consider what was to be done he knew delamere too well to believe that writing or the agency of any other person would have on him the least effect he was convinced therefore he must go himself yet to return immediately without giving lady montreville some very good reason was impossible nor could he think of any that would content her but the truth though he would very willingly have concealed from her what had happened he was obliged to send for her and communicate to her the intelligence received from mrs stafford her ladyship whose pride was if possible more than adequate to her high blood and whose passions were as strong as her reason was feeble received this information with all those expressions of rage and contempt which lord montreville had foreseen though the conduct of emmeline was such as all her prejudice could not misunderstand she loaded her with harsh and injurious appellations and blamed his lordship for having fostered a little reptile who was now likely to disgrace and ruin the family to which she pretended to belong she protested that if delamere dared to harbour so degrading an idea as that of marrying her she would blot him for ever from her affection and if possible from her memory lord montreville was obliged to wait till the violence of her first emotion had subsided before he ventured to propose going himself to recall delamere to this proposal however her ladyship agreed and when she became a little cooler consented readily to conceal if possible from lady mary otley the reason of lord montrevilles abrupt departure which was fixed for the next day for the knowledge of it could not have any good effect on the sentiments of lady mary and her daughter the former of whom was at present as anxious as lady montreville for an union of their families after some farther reflection lord montreville thought that as delamere was extremely fond of his youngest sister her influence might be of great use in detaching him from his pursuit it was therefore settled that she should accompany his lordship making the most plausible story they could to account for a departure so unexpected and leaving lady montreville and miss delamere as pledges of their intended return lord montreville and his daughter augusta set out post for london in their way to swansea chapter ix emmeline had for some days complained of a slight indisposition and being somewhat better had determined to walk out in the evening but having rather favoured and indulged her illness as it gave her a pretext for avoiding delamere whose long and vehement assiduities began to give great uneasiness to both the ladies she still answered to their enquiries that she was too ill to leave her room and in consequence of this message she and mrs stafford who came to sit with her soon afterwards saw the colonel and delamere ride by as if for their evening airing they kissed their hands as they passed and as soon as the ladies believed them quite out of sight and had observed the way they had gone emmeline who had confined herself three days to her room and who languished for air proposed a short walk the opposite way to which mrs stafford consented and as soon as the heat was a little abated they set out and enjoyed a comfortable and quiet walk for near an hour from which they were returning when they saw delamere and fitzedward riding towards them they dismounted and giving their horses to their servants joined them delamere reproaching emmeline for the artifice she had used yet congratulating himself on seeing her again but his eyes eagerly running over her person betrayed his extreme anxiety and concern at observing her pale and languid looks and the lassitude of her whole frame fitzedward in a whisper made the same remarks on her appearance to mrs stafford who answered that if mr delamere persisted in pursuing her she did not doubt but that it would end in her going into a decline say rather answered fitzedward artfully that the interesting languor on the charming countenance of your friend arises from the sensibility of her heart she can not surely see delamere dying for her as he is without feeling some disposition to answer a passion so ardent and sincere i know it is impossible she should it is only your stoic prudence your cold and unfeeling bosom which can arm itself against all the enthusiasm of love all the tenderness of friendship miss mowbrays heart is made of softer materials and were it not for the inhuman reserve you have taught her poor delamere had long since met a more suitable return to an attachment of which almost any other woman would glory in being the object there was something in this speech particularly displeasing to mrs stafford who answered that he could not pay her a compliment more gratifying than when he told her she had been the means of saving miss mowbray from indiscretion though she was well convinced that her own excellent understanding and purity of heart made any monitor unnecessary however continued she if you think that my influence has prevented her entering into all the wild projects of mr delamere continue to believe that while i am with her the same influence will invariably be exerted to the same purpose delamere and emmeline who were a few paces before them while this dialogue was passing were now met by parkinson the colonels servant who addressing himself to delamere told him that lord montreville and one of the young ladies were that moment alighted from their carriage at the inn and had sent to his lodgings to enquire for him mrs stafford advancing heard the intelligence and looked anxiously at emmeline who turned paler than death at the thoughts of lord montreville delamere was alternately red and pale he hesitated and tried to flatter himself that parkinson was mistaken while fitzedward who found he should be awkwardly situated between the father and son silently meditated his defence mrs stafford who saw emmeline ready to sink with the apprehension of being seen walking with delamere intreated the gentlemen to leave them and go to lord montreville which she at length prevailed on them to do delamere pressing emmelines hand to his lips and protesting with a vehemence of manner particularly his own that no power on earth should oblige him to relinquish her mrs stafford got the trembling emmeline home as well as she could where she endeavoured to strengthen her resolution and restore her spirits by representing to her the perfect rectitude with which she had acted but poor delamere who had no such consolatory reflections felt very uneasy and would willingly have avoided the immediate explanation which he saw must now take place with his father he determined however to temporize no longer but being absolutely fixed in his resolution of marrying emmeline to tell his father so and to meet all the effects of his anger at once in this disposition he desired fitzedward to leave him and he entered alone the parlour of the inn where lord montreville waited for him his countenance expressed a mixture of anger and confusion while that of his lordship betrayed yet sterner symptoms of the state of his mind augusta delamere her eyes red with weeping and her voice faultering through agitation arose and met her brother halfway my dear brother said she taking his hand he kissed her cheek and bowing to his father sat down i have taken the trouble to come hither sir said lord montreville in consequence of having received information of the wicked and unworthy pursuit in which you have engaged i command you upon your duty instantly to return with me and renounce for ever the scandalous project of seducing an innocent young woman whom you ought rather to respect and whom i will protect i intend ever to do both sir and when she is my wife you will be released from the task of protecting her and will only have to love her as much as her merit deserves be assured my lord i have no such designs against the honour of miss mowbray as you impute to me it is my determined and unalterable intention to marry her would to god your lordship would conquer the unreasonable prejudice which you have conceived against the only union which will secure the happiness of your son and endeavour to reconcile my mother to a marriage on which i am resolved having pronounced these words in a resolute tone he arose from his seat bowed slightly to his father and waving his hand to his sister as if to prevent her following him he walked indignantly out of the room lord montreville made no effort to stop him but the recollection of the fatal indulgence with which he had been brought up recurred forcibly to his lordships mind and he felt his anger against his son half subdued by the reproaches he had to make himself the very sight of this darling son was so gratifying that he almost forgot his errors when he beheld him after a moments pause lord montreville said to his daughter you see augusta the disposition your brother is in violent measures will i fear only make him desperate we must try what can be done by miss mowbray herself who will undoubtedly consent to elude his pursuit and time may perhaps detach him from it entirely for this purpose i would have you see emmeline tomorrow early and having talked to her we can consider on what to determine to night try to recover your fatigue let me go to night sir said his daughterit is not yet more than eight oclock and i am sensible of no fatigue that should prevent my seeing the young lady immediately lord montreville assenting miss delamere attended by a servant walked to the house of mrs watkins the door was opened by the good woman herself and on enquiry for miss mowbray she desired the lady to walk in and sit down in her little room while she went up to let miss knowfor i cant tell said she folding up a stocking she was knitting whether she be well enough to see a strange gentlewoman she have been but poorly for this week and to night after she came from walking she was in such a taking poor thing we thought shed a had a fit and so madam stafford who is just gone bid her she should lie down a little and keep quiet this account added to the disquiet of the fair mediatrix who fancied the heart of emmeline could hardly fail of being of delameres party and that uneasiness at his fathers arrival occasioned the agitation of her spirits which mrs watkins described mrs watkins returned immediately saying that miss emmy would be down in a moment emmeline instantly guessed who it was by the description of the young lady and the livery of the servant who attended her and now with a beating heart and uncertain step she entered the room miss delamere had been prepared to see a very beautiful person but the fair figure whom she now beheld though less dazlingly handsome than she expected was yet more interesting and attractive than she would have appeared in the highest bloom of luxuriant beauty her late illness had robbed her cheeks of that tender bloom they usually boasted timidity and apprehension deprived her of much of the native dignity of her manner yet there was something in her face and deportment that instantly prejudiced miss delamere in her favour and made her acknowledge that her brothers passion had at least personal charms for its excuse a silent curtsey passed between the two ladiesand both being seated miss delamere began i believe miss mowbray you know that my father lord montreville in consequence of a letter received from mrs stafford who is he understands a friend of yours arrived here this morning the letter madam was written at my particular request that my lord did not notice it sooner has believe me given me great concern i do sincerely believe it and every body must applaud your conduct in this affair my father was by accident prevented receiving the letter for some weeks as soon as it reached him we set out and he has now sent me to you my dear cousin for be assured i am delighted with the relationship to consult with you on what we ought to do emmeline consoled yet affected by this considerate speech found herself relieved by tears though i am unable madam said she recovering herself to advise be assured i am ready to do whatever you and lord montreville shall dictate to put an end to the projects your brother so perseveringly attempts ah miss delamere my situation is singularly distressing it demands all your pity all your fathers protection you have you shall have both my dear emmeline as well as our admiration for your noble and heroic conduct and i beg you will not by being thus uneasy injure your health and depress your spirits this and many other consoling speeches delivered in the persuasive voice of friendly sympathy almost restored emmeline to her usual composure and after being together near an hour miss delamere took her leave charmed with her new acquaintance and convinced that she would continue to act with the most exact obedience to the wishes of lord montreville chapter x lord montreville on hearing from his daughter what had passed between her and emmeline was disposed to hope that since she was so willing to assist in terminating for ever the views of delamere they should be able to prevail on him to relinquish them while miss delamere was with emmeline his lordship had himself waited on mrs stafford to whom he thought himself obliged he thanked her for the letter with which she had favoured him and said that having heard of the great regard with which she honoured miss mowbray he waited on her to beg her advice in the present difficult circumstance since mr delamere has pursued her hither said his lordship she can not remain here but to find a situation that will be proper for her and concealed from him i own appears so difficult that i know not on what to determine my lord answered mrs stafford i intended to have asked your lordships permission to have been favoured with miss mowbrays company for some months and still hope to be indulged with it when i return home but could i go thither now which i can not my house not being in a condition to receive me it would be impossible to prevent mr delameres knowledge of her abode if she was with me but surely mr delamere will leave this place with you and will not oblige miss mowbray to quit her home to avoid him ah madam answered lord montreville you do not yet know my son the impetuosity of his temper which has never been restrained it is now out of my power to check whatever he determines on he will execute and i have too much reason to fear that opposition only serves to strengthen his resolution while emmeline is here it will be impossible to prevail on him to quit the place and though her behaviour has hitherto been irreproachable and meritorious how can i flatter myself that so young a woman will continue steadily to refuse a marriage which would not only relieve her at once from the difficulties and dependance of her situation but raise her to an elevated rank and a splendid fortune to which said mrs stafford she would do honour i do not however presume to offer my opinion to your lordship you have undoubtedly very strong reasons for your opposition to mr delameres wishes and his affluent fortune and future rank certainly give him a right to expect both the one and the other in whoever he shall marry but a more lovely person a better heart a more pure and elegant mind he will no where meet with miss mowbray will reflect as much credit as she can borrow on any family to which she may be allied i acknowledge madam that miss mowbray is a very amiable young woman but she never can be the wife of my son and you i am sure are too considerate to give any encouragement to so impossible an idea after some farther conversation mrs stafford promised to endeavour to recollect a proper situation for miss mowbray where she might be secured from the importunities of delamere and his lordship took his leave by six oclock the next morning delamere was at mrs watkinss door and nobody being visible but the maid servant he entered the parlour and told her he wanted to speak with miss mowbray but would wait until she arose the maid told her mistress who immediately descended and delamere who was known to her as a young lord who was in love with miss emmy was courteously invited to her own parlour and she offered to go up with any message he should be pleased to send he begged she would only say to miss mowbray that a gentleman desired to speak to her on business of consequence but the good woman who thought she could do more justice to her employer told emmeline who was dressing herself that the handsome young lord as used to walk every night with her and madam stafford was below and wanted to speak to her directly at this information emmeline was extremely alarmed she considered herself as particularly bound by what had passed the evening before between her and augusta delamere to avoid her brother and such an interview as he now demanded must have an appearance to lord montreville of which she could not bear to think she desired mrs watkins therefore to let the gentleman know that she was not well and could not see any body why lord miss exclaimed the officious landlady what can you mean now by that what go for to refuse seeing such an handsome young man who is a lord and the like of that i am sure it is so foolish that i shant carry no such message send betty with it then answered emmeline coldly let her inform the gentleman i can not be seen well said mrs watkins as she descended it is strange nonsense to my fancy but some folks never knows what they would be at she then returned to the parlour and very reluctantly delivered the answer to mr delamere who asked if emmeline was really ill ill said the complaisant hostess i see nothing that ails her last night indeed she was in a desperate taking and we had much ado to hinder her from going into a fit but to day i am sure she looks as if she was as well as ever delamere asked for a pen and ink with which she immediately furnished him and as she officiously offered to get him some breakfast he accepted it to gain time while it was preparing he sent up to emmeline the following note i came hither to entreat only one quarter of an hours conversation which you cruelly deny me you determine then emmeline to drive me to despair you may certainly still refuse to see me but you can not oblige me to quit this place or to lose sight of your abode my father will therefore gain nothing by his illjudged journey hither but if you will allow me the interview i solicit and after it still continue to desire my absence i will give you my promise to go from hence tomorrow f delamere the maid was sent up with this billet to emmeline who after a moments consideration determined to send it to miss delamere and to tell her in an envelope how she was situated having enclosed it therefore and desired the maid to go with it without saying whither she was going she bid her as she went through the house deliver to mr delamere another note which was as follows sir your request of an interview i think myself obliged on every account to refuse i am extremely sorry you determine to persevere in offering me proposals to which though they do me a very high and undeserved honour i never ought to listen and excuse me if i add that i never will emmeline mowbray emmeline had not before so positively expressed her rejection of delameres addresses the peremptory stile therefore of this billet added to his extreme vexation at being overtaken by his father and the little hope that seemed to remain for him any way operated altogether on his rash and passionate disposition and seemed to affect him with a temporary phrenzy he stamped about the room dashed his head against the wainscot and seizing mrs watkins by the arm swore with the most frightful vehemence that he would see miss mowbray though death were in the way the woman concluding he was mad screamed out to her husband who descending from his chamber in astonishment put himself between his wife and the stranger demanding his business alackaday cried mrs watkins tis the young lord he is gone mad to be sure for the love of miss up stairs emmeline who in so small a house could not avoid hearing all that passed now thought it better to go down for she knew enough of delamere to fear that the effects of his fit of passion might be very serious and was certain that nothing could be more improper than so much confusion she therefore descended the stairs with trembling feet and entered mrs watkinss parlour where she saw delamere his eyes flashing fire and his hands clenched storming round the room while watkins followed him and bowing in his awkward way begged his honour would only please to be pacified there was something so terrifying in the wild looks of the young man that emmeline having only half opened the door retreated again from it and was hastening away but delamere had seen her and darting out after her caught her before she could escape out of the passage and she was compelled to return into the room with him where on condition of his being more composed she agreed to sit down and listen to him watkins and his wife having left the room delamere again renewed his solicitations for a scottish expedition however averse said he my father and mother may at present be to our marriage i know they will be immediately reconciled when it is irrevocable but if you continue to harden your heart against me of what advantage will it be to them their ambition will still suffer for i here swear by all that is sacred that then i never will marry at all and by my dying without posterity their views will for ever be abortive and their projects disappointed to this and every other argument delamere used emmeline answered that having determined never to accept of his hand situated as she at present was nothing should induce her to break through a determination which alone could secure her the approbation of her own heart he then asked her whether if the consent of lord and lady montreville could be obtained she would continue averse to him this question she evaded by saying that it was to no purpose to consider how she should act in an event so unlikely to happen he then again exerted all the eloquence which love rather than reason lent him but emmeline combated his arguments with those of rectitude and honour by which she was resolutely bent to abide this steadiness originating from principles he could not controvert or deny seemed while it shewed him all its hopelessness to give new force to his passion he became again almost frantic and was anew acting the part of a madman when mrs stafford and miss delamere entered the house and enquiring for miss mowbray were shewn into the room where she was with delamere who almost exhausted by the violence of those emotions he had so boundlessly indulged had now thrown himself into a chair with his head leaning against the wainscot his hair was dishevelled his eyes swoln and his countenance expressed so much passionate sorrow that augusta delamere extremely shocked feared to speak to him while emmeline on the opposite side of the room sat with her handkerchief to her eyes and as soon as she saw mrs stafford she threw herself into her arms and sobbed aloud delamere looked at mrs stafford and his sister but spoke to neither till augusta approaching him would have taken his hand but he turned from her oh frederic cried she i beseech you to consider the consequence of all this i consider nothing said he starting up and going to the window his sister followed him go go said he turning angrily from hergo leave me leave me assist lord montreville to destroy his only son go and be a party in the cruel policy that will make you and fanny heiresses the poor girl who really loved her brother better than any thing on earth was quite overwhelmed by this speech and her tears now flowed as fast as those of emmeline who continued to weep on the bosom of mrs stafford delamere looked at them both with a stern and angry countenance then suddenly catching his sister by the hand which he eagerly grasped he said in a low but resolute voicetears augusta are of no use do not lament me but try to help me i am now going out for the whole day for i will not see my father only to repeat to him what i have already said before i return see what you can do towards persuading him to consent to my marriage with miss mowbray for be assured that if he does not the next meeting in which i expect his answer will be the last we shall have he then snatched up his hat and disengaging himself from his sister who attempted to detain him he went hastily out of the house leaving mrs stafford miss mowbray and his sister under great uneasiness and alarm they thought it necessary immediately to inform lord montreville of the whole conversation and miss delamere dispatched a note to fitzedward desiring him to attend to the motions of his friend fitzedward was at breakfast with lord montreville who took the first opportunity of their being alone to reproach him with some severity for what he had done the colonel heard him with great serenity and then began to justify himself by assuring his lordship that he had accompanied delamere only in hopes of being able to detach him from his pursuit and because he thought it preferable to his being left wholly to himself he declared that he meant to have given lord montreville information if there had appeared the least probability of delameres marriage but that being perfectly convinced from the character of emmeline that there was nothing to apprehend he had every day hoped his friend would have quitted a project in which there seemed not the least likelihood of success and would have returned to his family cured of his passion though this was not all strictly true fitzedward possessed a sort of plausible and insinuating eloquence which hardly ever failed of removing every impression however strong against him and lord montreville was conversing with him with his usual confidence and friendship when the note from miss delamere was brought in his lordship ever anxious for his son gazed eagerly at it while fitzedward read it and trembling asked from whom it came fitzedward put it into his hand and having ran it over in breathless terror his lordship hurried out directing all his servants to go several ways in search of delamere while he entreated fitzedward to run to whatever place he was likely to be in and went himself to mrs staffords lodging who was by this time returned home what he heard from her of the scene of the morning contributed to encrease his alarm the image of his son in all the wildness of ungovernable passion shook his nerves so much that he seemed ready to faint yet unable to move to enquire where he was as he could attend to nothing else mrs stafford told him how anxiously she had thought of a situation for emmeline and that she believed she had at length found one that would do if said she your lordship can not prevail on him to quit swansea which i think you had better attempt though from the scene of this morning i own i despair of it more than ever the person with whom i hope to be able to place miss mowbray is mrs ashwood the sister of mr stafford she has been two years a widow with three children and resides at a village near london she has a very good fortune and would be happy to have with her such a companion as miss mowbray till i am so fortunate as to be enabled to take her myself as her connections and acquaintance lie in a different set of people and in a remote part of the country from those of mr delamere it is improbable that with the precaution we shall take he will ever discover her residence lord montreville expressed his sense of mrs staffords kindness in the warmest terms he assured her that he should never forget the friendly part she had taken and that if ever it was in his power to shew his gratitude by being so happy as to have the ability to serve her or her family he should consider it as the most fortunate event of his life mrs stafford heard this as matter of course and would have felt great compassion for lord montreville whose state of mind was truly deplorable but she reflected that he had really been the author of his own misery first by bringing up his son in a manner that had given such boundless scope to his passions and now by refusing to gratify him in marrying a young woman who was in the eye of unprejudiced reason so perfectly unexceptionable she advised him to try once more to prevail on his son to leave swansea with him and he left her to enquire whether fitzedward had yet found delamere whose absence gave him the most cruel uneasiness fitzedward after a long search had overtaken delamere on an unfrequented common about a mile from the town where he was walking with a quick pace and seeing fitzedward endeavoured to escape him but when he found he could not avoid him he turned fiercely towards himwhy do you follow me sir is it not enough that you have broken through the ties of honour and friendship in betraying me to my father must you still persecute me with your insidious friendship fitzedward heard him with great coolness and without much difficulty convinced him that miss mowbray herself had given the information to lord montreville by means of mrs stafford this conviction while it added to the pain and mortification of delamere greatly reconciled him to fitzedward whom he had before suspected and after a long conversation which fitzedward so managed as to regain some degree of power over the passions of his impetuous friend he persuaded him to go and dine with lord montreville having first undertaken for his lordship that nothing should be said on the subject which occupied the thoughts of the father on which condition only the son consented to meet him chapter xi notwithstanding the steadiness emmeline had hitherto shewn in rejecting the clandestine addresses of delamere he still hoped they would succeed a degree of vanity pardonable in a young man possessing so many advantages of person and fortune made him trust to those advantages and to his unwearied assiduity to conquer her reluctance he determined therefore to persevere and did not imagine it was likely he could again lose sight of her by a stratagem against which he was now on his guard as he fancied lord montreville and his sister designed to carry her with them when they went he kept a constant eye on their motions and set his own servant and fitzedwards valet to watch the servants of lord montreville fitzedward who had been so near losing the confidence of both the father and son found it expedient to observe a neutrality which it required all his address to support being constantly appealed to by them both lord montreville he advised to adhere to moderate measures and gentle persuasions and to trust to emmelines own strength of mind and good conduct while to delamere he recommended dissimulation and advised him to quit swansea at present which would prevent emmelines being removed from thence and leave it in his power at any time to see her again lord montreville on cooler reflection was by no means satisfied with fitzedward to encourage his sons project and even to accompany him in it in the vain hope of detaching him from emmeline before an irrevocable engagement could be formed seemed to be at least very blameable and if he had seen the connection likely to take place on a less honourable footing his conduct was more immoral if not so impolitic either way lord montreville felt it so displeasing that he determined not to trust fitzedward in what he now meditated which was to remove emmeline from swansea before he and his daughter quitted it and to place her with the sister of mr stafford who being now arrived had engaged to obtain his sisters concurrence with their plan a female council therefore was held on the means of emmelines removal and it was settled that a postchaise should on the night fixed be in waiting at the distance of half a mile from the town where emmeline should meet it and that a servant of mr stafford should accompany her to london who was from thence to return to his masters house in dorsetshire this arrangement being made three days after the arrival of lord montreville and his faithful old valet being employed to procure the chaise the hour arrived when poor emmeline was again to abandon her little home where she had passed many tranquil and some delightful days and where she was to bid adieu to her two beloved friends uncertain when she should see them again her friendship for mrs stafford was enlivened by the warmest gratitude to her she owed the acquisition of much useful knowledge as well as instruction in those elegant accomplishments to which she was naturally so much attached but which she had no former opportunity of acquiring the charms of her conversation the purity of her heart and the softness of her temper made her altogether a character which could not be known without being beloved and emmeline whose heart was open to all the enchanting impressions of early friendship loved her with the truest affection the little she had seen of augusta delamere had given that young lady the second place in her heart they were of the same age within a few weeks augusta delamere extremely resembled the mowbray family and there was in figure and voice a very striking similitude between her and emmeline mowbray lady montreville passionately attached to her son as the heir and representative of her family and partial to her eldest daughter for her great resemblance to herself seemed on them to have exhausted all her maternal tenderness and to have felt for augusta but a very inferior share of affection of the haughty and supercilious manners which made lady montreville feared and disliked she had communicated no portion to her younger daughter and if she had acquired something of the family pride her good sense and the sweetness of her temper had so much corrected it that it was by no means displeasing elegantly formed as she was and with a face which tho less fair than that of emmeline was almost as interesting her mother had yet always expressed a disapprobation of her person and she had therefore herself conceived an indifferent opinion of it and being taught to consider herself inferior in every thing to her elder sister she never fancied she was superior to others nor though highly accomplished and particularly skilled in music did she ever obtrude her acquisitions on her friends or anxiously seek opportunities of displaying them her heart was benevolent and tender and her affection for her brother the first of its passions she could never discover that he had a fault and the error in regard to emmeline which his father so much dreaded appeared to his sister a virtue she was deeply read in novels almost the only reading that young women of fashion are taught to engage in and having from them acquired many of her ideas she imagined that delamere and emmeline were born for each other though she dared not appear to encourage hopes so totally opposite to those of her family she found after she had once seen and conversed with emmeline that she never could warmly oppose an union which she was convinced would make her brother happy she fancied that emmeline could not be insensible to delameres love she even believed she saw many symptoms of regard for him in her manner and that she made the most heroic sacrifice of her love to her duty when she resigned him a sacrifice which heightened almost to enthusiasm the pity and esteem felt for her by augusta delamere and though they had known each other only a few days a sisterly affection had taken place between them but from these two friends so tenderly and justly beloved emmeline was now to depart and to be thrown among strangers where it was improbable she would meet with any who would supply the loss of them her duty however demanded this painful effort and she determined to execute it with courage and resolution delamere was so perpetually about his father that it was judged improper for him to hold any private conference with emmeline lest something should be suspected his lordship therefore sent her by mrs stafford a bank note of fifty pounds with his thanks for the propriety of her conduct and an assurance that while she continued to merit his protection he should consider her as his daughter and take care to supply her with money and every thing else she might wish for he desired she would not write lest her hand should be known and her abode traced but said that in a few weeks he would see her himself and wished her all possible health and happiness on the night of her departure instead of retiring to rest at the usual hour emmeline dressed herself in a travelling dress and passed some melancholy hours waiting for the signal of her departure at half past two in the morning every thing being profoundly quiet she saw from her window her two friends who had declared they would not leave her till they saw her in the chaise she took with her only a small parcel of linen mrs stafford having engaged to forward the rest to an address agreed upon and softly descending the stairs for fear of alarming mrs watkins she opened the door and each of her friends taking an arm they passed over two fields into a lane where the chaise was waiting with the servant who was to go with her the tears had streamed from her eyes during the little walk and she was unable to speak the servant now opened the chaise door and let down the step and emmeline kissing the hand of mrs stafford and then that of augusta delamere went hastily into itgod bless you both said she in a faint and inarticulate voice the servant shut the door mounted a post horse and the chaise was in an instant out of sight while the two ladies who at any other time would have been alarmed at being obliged to take so late a walk thought not of themselves but full of concern for poor emmeline went back in tears and miss delamere who had agreed to remain the rest of that night at the lodgings of mrs stafford retired not to rest but to weep for the departure of her friend and the distress of her brother emmeline thus separated from every body she loved pursued her journey melancholy and repining the first hour she wept bitterly and accused her destiny of caprice and cruelty but tho to the unfortunate passion of delamere she owed all the inconvenience she had lately experienced she could not resolve to hate him but found a degree of pity and regard perpetually mingled itself with his idea in her heart yet she was not in love and had rather the friendship of a sister for him than any wish to be his wife had there been no impediments to their union she would have married him rather to make him happy than because she thought it would make herself so but she would have seen him married to another and have rejoiced at it if he had found felicity an attachment like his which had resisted long absence and was undiminished by insuperable difficulties could hardly fail of having its effect on the tender and susceptible mind of emmeline but whatever affection she felt it by no means arose to what a romantic girl would have perhaps fancied it and she was much more unhappy at quitting the dear augusta than at the uncertainty she was in whether she should ever again see delamere the parting was extremely embittered by the prohibition she had received in regard to writing to her but painful as it was she determined to forbear and steadily to adhere to that line of duty however difficult to practice that only could secure the peace of her mind by the acquittal of her conscience which as she had learned from mrs stafford as well as from her own experience short as it was could alone support her in every trial to which she might be exposed she reflected on her present situation compared to what it would have been had she been prevailed upon to become the wife of delamere against the consent of his family splendid as his fortune was and high as his rank would raise her above her present lot of life she thought that neither would reconcile her to the painful circumstance of carrying uneasiness and contention into his family of being thrown from them with contempt as the disgrace of their rank and the ruin of their hopes and of living in perpetual apprehension lest the subsiding fondness of her husband should render her the object of his repentance and regret the regard she was sensible of for delamere did not make her blind to his faults and she saw with pain that the ungovernable violence of his temper frequently obscured all his good qualities and gave his character an appearance of ferocity which offered no very flattering prospect to whosoever should be his wife by thus reasoning with herself she soon became more calm and more reconciled to that destiny which seemed not to design her for delamere she met with no remarkable occurrence in her journey and on the evening of the third day arrived in town where the servant who attended her was ordered to dismiss the chaise and to procure her an hackney coach in which she proceeded to the house of mrs ashwood this residence situated in a populous village three miles from london bore the appearance of wealth and prosperity the iron gate which gave entrance into a large court was opened by a servant in a laced livery to whom emmeline delivered the letter she had brought from mrs stafford and after a moments waiting the lady herself came out to receive her emmeline by the splendour of her dress concluded she had left a large company but being ushered into a parlour found she had been drinking tea alone of which or of any other refreshment miss mowbray was desired to partake her reception of her visitor was perfectly cordial and emmeline soon recovering her easy and composed manner mrs ashwood seemed very much pleased with her guest for there was in her countenance a passport to all hearts mrs ashwood tho not in the bloom of life and tho she never had been handsome was so unconscious of her personal disadvantages that she imagined herself the object of admiration of one sex and of the imitation of the other with the most perfect reliance on the graces of a figure which never struck any other person as being at all remarkable she dressed with an exuberance of expence and kept all the company her neighbourhood afforded where her ruling passions the love of admiration and excessive vanity did not interfere she was sometimes generous and sometimes friendly but her ideas of her own perfections both of person and mind far exceeding the truth she had often the mortification to find that others by no means thought of them as she did and then her good humour was far from invincible though emmeline soon found her conversation very inferior to what she had of late been accustomed to she thought herself fortunate in having found an asylum the mistress of which seemed desirous of making it agreeable and to which she was introduced by the kindness of her beloved mrs stafford but while serenity was returning to the bosom of emmeline that of poor delamere was torn with the cruellest tempest the morning after emmelines departure delamere who expected no such thing arose at his usual hour and rode out alone as he had frequently done as he passed her window he looked up to it and seeing it open concluded she was in her room on his return his father met him and asked him to breakfast but he designed to attend the teatable of mrs stafford where he thought he should meet emmeline and therefore excused himself and lord montreville who wished the discovery to be delayed to as late an hour of the day as possible let him go thither where he breakfasted and then proposed a walk to mrs stafford which he hoped would include a visit to emmeline or at least that mrs stafford would not walk without her she excused herself however on pretence of having letters to write and delamere went in search of fitzedward whom he could not find it was now noon and he grew impatient at not having had even a glimpse of emmeline the whole morning when he met fitzedwards man and asked him hastily where his master was the man hesitated and looked as if he had a secret which he contained with some uneasiness sir said he have you seen miss mowbray today nowhy do you ask because sir said the fellow i shrewdly suspect that she went away from here last night i cant tell your honour why i thinks so but you may soon know the truth ont the ardent imagination of delamere instantly caught fire he took it for granted that fitzedward had carried her off and without staying to reflect a moment he flew to the inn where his horses were and ordered them to be saddled then rushing into the room where his father and sister were sitting together he exclaimedshe is gone siremmeline is gonebut i will soon overtake her and the infamous villain who has torn her from me lord montreville scorned to dissimulate he answered i know she is gone and it was by my directions she went you can not overtake her nor is it probable you will ever see her again endeavour therefore to recollect yourself and do not forget what you owe to your family and yourself delamere attended but little to this remonstrance but still prepossessed with the idea of fitzedwards being gone with her he swore perpetual vengeance against him and that he would pursue him through the world with this resolution on his lips and fury in his eyes he quitted his fathers apartment and at the door met fitzedward himself coming to enquire after him he was somewhat ashamed of the hasty conclusion he had made and was therefore more disposed to hear what fitzedward had to say who presently convinced him that he was entirely ignorant of the flight of emmeline delamere now insisted that as a proof of his friendship he would instantly set out with him in pursuit of her fitzedward knew not what to do but however seemed to consent and saying he would order his servant to get his horse left him and went to lord montreville to whom he represented the impracticability of stopping delamere his lordship almost certain that emmeline was out of the possibility of his overtaking her as she had now been gone thirteen hours thought it better for fitzedward if he could not prevent his departure to go with him but he desired him to make as many artificial delays as possible delamere in the mean time had been to mrs stafford and tried to force from her the secret of emmelines route but she was inexorable and proof against his phrenzy as well as his persuasion she held him however as long as she could in discourse but when he found she only tried to make him lose time he left her in an agony of passion and mounting his horse while his trembling servants were ordered to follow him on pain of instant dismission he rode out of the town without seeing his father leaving a message for fitzedward that he had taken the london road and expected he would come after him instantly lord montreville intreated fitzedward to lose not a moment and bidding an hasty adieu to his lordship he ordered his horses to the door of mrs stafford where he took a formal leave of her and her husband entreating permission to renew his acquaintance hereafter then getting on horseback he made as much speed as possible after delamere whom with difficulty he overtook some miles forward on the london road this way delamere had taken on conjecture only but after proceeding some time he had met a waggoner whom he questioned the man told him of a post chaise he had met at four oclock in the morning and encouraged by that to proceed he soon heard from others enough to make him believe he was right the horses however at the end of forty miles were too much fatigued to keep pace with delameres impatience he was obliged to wait three hours before post horses could be found for himself and fitzedward his servants were obliged to remain yet longer and the horses which were at length procured were so lame and inadequate to the journey that it was six hours before they reached the next stage where the same difficulty occurred and delamere between the fatigue of his body and anxiety of his mind found himself compelled to take some rest the next day he still traced emmeline from stage to stage and imagined himself very near her but the miserable horse on which he rode being unable to execute his wish as to speed and urged beyond his strength fell with him in a stage about sixty miles from london by which accident he received a contusion on his breast and was bruised so much that fitzedward insisted on his being blooded and put to bed and then went to the apothecary of the village near which the accident happened and procuring a phial of laudanum infused it into the wine and water which delamere drank and by that artifice obtained for him the repose he otherwise would not have been prevailed on to take after having slept several hours he desired to pursue his journey in a post chaise but fitzedward had taken care that none should be immediately to be had by these delays only it was that emmeline reached london some hours before him however when he renewed his journey he still continued to trace her from stage to stage till the last postillion who drove her was found he said that he was ordered to stop at the first stand of coaches into one of which the lady went and with the servant behind drove away but the lad neither knew the number of the coach or recollected the coachman or did he remember whither the coach was ordered to go delamere passed two days questioning all the coachmen on the stand and in consequence of information pretended to be given by some of them he got into two or three quarrels by going to houses they pointed out to him and after offering and giving rewards which only seemed to redouble his difficulties he appeared to be farther than ever from any probability of finding the fair fugitive he so anxiously sought lord montreville and his daughter staid only two days at swansea after his departure they travelled in very indifferent spirits to london where they found delamere ill at the lodgings of fitzedward in hillstreet lord montreville found there was nothing alarming in his sons indisposition but could not persuade him to accompany him to lady mary otleys his lordship and miss augusta delamere set out therefore for that place leaving delamere to the care of fitzedward who promised not to quit him till he had agreed either to go to the norfolk estate or to mr percivals lord montreville was tolerably satisfied that he could not discover emmeline and delamere having for above a fortnight attended at all public places without seeing her and having found every other effort to meet her fruitless reluctantly agreed to go to his fathers estate in norfolk it was now almost the end of august and fitzedward after seeing him part of the way took his leave of him and again went to attend his duty in the north of ireland chapter xii while delamere in the deepest despondence which he could neither conquer or conceal made a vain effort to divert his mind with those amusements for which he no longer had any relish emmeline at her new residence attracted the attention of many of mrs ashwoods visitors a widow in possession of an handsome jointure and her children amply provided for mrs ashwood was believed to entertain no aversion to a second marriage and her house being so near london was frequented by a great number of single men many of whom came there because it was a pleasant jaunt from the city where most of them resided and others with hopes of amending their fortunes by an alliance with the lady herself these latter however were chiefly the younger sons of merchants and though pleased with their flattery and assiduity mrs ashwood who had an almost equal share of vanity and ambition had yet given no very decided preference to any for she imagined her personal attractions of which she had a very high idea added to the advantages of a good income good expectations and opulent connections entitled her to marry into an higher line of life than that in which her father had first engaged her her acquaintance however was yet very limited among persons of fashion and it was not wholly without hopes of encreasing it that she had consented to receive miss mowbray whose relationship to lord montreville would she imagined be the means of introducing her to his lordships notice and to that of his family her civility and kindness to emmeline were unbounded for some time and as she was not easily convinced of her own want of beauty she never apprehended that she ran some risk of becoming a foil instead of the first figure as she expected generally to be the extreme simplicity of emmelines appearance who notwithstanding the remonstrances of mrs ashwood continued to dress nearly as she did in wales and her perfect ignorance of fashionable life and fashionable accomplishments gave her in the eyes of many of mrs ashwoods visitors the air of a dependant and those who visited with a view to the fortune of the latter carefully avoided every appearance of preference to emmeline and kept her friend in good humour with herself but there were among those who frequented her house some men of business who being rather in middle life and immensely rich had no other views in going thither than to pass a few hours in the country when their mercantile engagements prevented their leaving london entirely and who loved pleasure better than any thing but money with one or two of these mrs ashwood and her father had at different times encouraged overtures of marriage but they knew and enjoyed the pleasure their fortune and single state afforded them too well to give those indulgences up for the advantage of increasing their incomes unless the object had possessed greater attractions than fell to the share of mrs ashwood and her father could not be prevailed upon to give her at least while he lived a sum of money large enough to tempt their avarice these overtures therefore had ended in nothing more than an intercourse of civility but emmeline no sooner appeared than one of these gentlemen renewed his visits with more than his original assiduity the extreme beauty of her person and the naivetè of her manners gave her to him the attractive charms of novelty while the mystery there seemed to be about her piqued his curiosity it was known that she was related to a noble family but mrs ashwood had been so earnestly entreated to conceal as much as possible her real history lest delamere should hear of and discover her that she only told it to a few friends and it had not yet reached the knowledge of mr rochely who had become the attendant of mrs ashwoods tea table from the first introduction of emmeline mr rochely was nearer fifty than forty his person heavy and badly proportioned was not relieved by his countenance which was dull and illformed his voice monotonous and guttural was fatiguing to the ear and the singularity of his manners as well as the oddness of his figure often excited a degree of ridicule which the respect his riches demanded could not always stifle with a person so ill calculated to inspire affection he was very desirous of being a favourite with the ladies and extremely sensible of their attractions in the inferior ranks of life his money had procured him many conquests tho he was by no means lavish of it and much of the early part of his time had been passed in low amours which did not however impede his progress to the great wealth he possessed he had always intended to marry but as he required many qualifications in a wife which are hardly ever united he had hesitated till he had long been looked upon as an old bachelor he was determined to chuse beauty but expected also fortune he desired to marry a woman of family yet feared the expensive turn of those brought up in high life and had a great veneration for wit and accomplishments but dreaded lest in marrying a woman who possessed them he should be liable to be governed by superior abilities or be despised for the mediocrity of his own understanding with such ideas his relations saw him perpetually pursuing some matrimonial project but so easily frightened from his pursuit that they relied on his succession with the most perfect confidence when first he beheld emmeline he was charmed with her person her conversation at once innocent and lively impressed him with the most favourable ideas of her heart and understanding and brought up at a great distance from london she had acquired no taste for expences no rage for those amusements and dissipations which he so much apprehended in a wife when he came to mrs ashwoods which was almost every afternoon emmeline who was generally at work or drawing in the dressingroom never discomposed herself but sat quietly to what she was doing listening with the most patient complaisance to the long and uninteresting stories with which he endeavoured to entertain her an attention which greatly contributed to win the heart of rochely and he was as much in love as so prudent a man could be before he ventured to ask himself what he intended or what was the family and what the fortune of the person who now occupied most of his time and a great portion of his thoughts mrs ashwood frequently engaged at the neighbouring cardtables from which emmeline almost always excused herself often left her and mr rochely to drink tea together and when she was at home would sometimes make her party in another room where the subject of laughter with her own admirers was the growing passion of the rich banker for the fair stranger emmeline did not when present escape ridicule on this subject but as she had not the least idea that a man so much older than herself had any intention of offering himself as an husband she bore it with great tranquillity and continued to behave to mr rochely with the attentive civility dictated by natural good breeding while she heard without any concern but on his account the perpetual mirth and loud bursts of laughter which followed his compliments and attentions to her if he was absent a few days the door of mrs ashwood was crouded with servants and porters with game from mr rochely and his assiduities became at every visit more marked as it was now late in the autumn mrs ashwood was desirous of shewing miss mowbray some of those public places she had not yet seen and emmeline not apprehending there was any reason to fear meeting mr delamere at a season when she knew field sports kept him altogether in the country made no difficulty to accompany her mr rochely no sooner heard a party to the play proposed than he desired to join it and mrs ashwood miss galton an intimate friend of hers with miss mowbray mr hanbury one of mrs ashwoods admirers and mr rochely met at drurylane theatre where emmeline was extremely well entertained when the play was over the box was filled with several of mrs ashwoods acquaintance who talked to her while their eyes were fixed on her young friend an observation that did not greatly lighten up her countenance the most conspicuous among these was a tall thin but extremely awkward figure which in a most fashionable undress and with a glass held to his eye strided into the box and bowing with a strange gesture to mrs ashwood exclaimedoh my dear mrs ahere i amreturned from spa only last night and already at your feet so here you are and not yet enchained by that villainous fellow hymen you are a good soul not to give yourself away while i was at spa i was horridly afraid my dear widow you would not have waited even to have given me a wedding favour to this speech as it required no answer mrs ashwood gave very little for besides that she was not pleased with the matter the manner delighted her still less the speaker had during the whole of it leaned almost across the person who was next to him to bring his glass nearly close to emmelines face emmeline extremely discomposed drew back and mr rochely who sat near her putting away the glass softly with his hand said very calmly to the leaning beausir is there any occasion to take an account of this ladys features ah my friend rochely answered he familiarly what are you the ladys cicisbeo as we say in italy here is indeed beauty enough to draw you from the contemplation of three per cent consols india bonds omnium scrip and douceurs but prithee my old friend is this young lady your ward my ward no answered rochely how came you to think she was mr elkerton who fancied he had vastly the advantage in point of wit as well as of figure over his antagonist now desired to know whether the lady was his niece though if i had not recollected said he that you never was married i should have taken her for your grand daughter this sarcasm had on the features of rochely all the effect the travelled man expected but while he was preparing an answer at which he was never very prompt the coach was announced to be ready and emmeline extremely weary of her situation and disgusted even to impatience with her new acquaintance hastily arose to go elkerton offered to take her hand which she drew from him without attempting to conceal her dislike and accepting the arm of rochely followed mrs ashwood while elkerton determined not to lose sight of her seized the hand of miss galton who being neither young handsome or rich had been left to go out alone they followed the rest of the party to the coach where mrs ashwood and miss mowbray were already seated with mr hanbury who as he resided with his mother in the village where mrs ashwood lived was to accompany them home the coach being full seemed to preclude all possibility of elkertons admittance but he was not so easily put off and telling mrs ashwood he intended to go home to sup with her he stepped immediately in and ordered his servant who waited at the coach door with a flambeau to direct his visavis to follow rochely who meant to have wished them a good night after seeing them to their carriage was too much hurt by this happy essay of assurance not to resolve to counteract its consequences elkerton though not a very young man was near twenty years younger than rochely besides the income of his business for he was in trade he had a large independent fortune of which he was extremely lavish his equipages were splendid his house most magnificently furnished and his cloaths the most expensive that could be bought rochely whose ideas of elegance manners or taste were not very refined had no notion that the absurdity of elkerton or his disagreeable person would prevent his being a very formidable rival he therefore saw him with great pain accompany emmeline home and though he had formed no positive designs himself he could not bear to suppose that another might form them with success directing therefore his chariot to follow the coach he was set down at the door a few minutes after mrs ashwood and her party where emmeline still more displeased with elkerton and having been teized by his impertinent admiration the whole way looked as if she could have burst into tears mrs ashwood in a very ill humour hardly attended to his flourishing speeches with common civility he had therefore recourse to miss galton to whom he was giving the history of his travels which seemed to take up much of his thoughts miss galton who by long dependance and repeated disappointments had acquired the qualifications necessary for a patient hearer acquiesced in smiling silence to all his assertions looked amazed in the right place and heard with great complacency his wonderful success at cards and the favour he was in with women of the first fashion at spa the entrance of mr rochely gave no interruption to his discourse he bowed slightly to him without rising and then went on observing that he had now seen every part of europe worth seeing and meant at least for some years to remain in england the ladies of which country he preferred to every other and therefore intended taking a wife among them fortune was he declared to him no object but he was determined to marry the handsomest woman he could meet with for whom he was now looking out as he said this he turned his eyes towards emmeline who affecting not to hear him tho he spoke in so loud a tone as to make it unavoidable was talking in a low voice to mr rochely rochely placing himself close to her had thrown his arm over the back of her chair and leaning forward attended to her with an expression in his countenance of something between apprehension and hope that gave it the most grotesque look imaginable mrs ashwood who had been entertained apart by mr hanbury now hurried over the supper during which elkerton still full of himself engrossed almost all the conversation gave a detail of the purchases he had made abroad and the trouble he had to land them interspersed with bon mots of french marquises and german barons and witty remarks of an english duke with whom he had crossed the water on his return but whatever story he told himself was still forwardest in the picture his project of marrying an handsome wife was again repeated and he told the party how charming a house he had bought in kent and how he had furnished his library rochely who lay in wait to revenge himself for all the mortifications he had suffered from him during the evening took occasion to say in his grave cold manner to be sure a man of your taste and erudition mr elkerton can not do without a library but for my part i think you will find no books can say so much to the purpose as those kept by your late father in milkstreet cheapside elkerton turned pale at this sneer but forcing a smile of contempt answered you bankers have no ideas out of your comptinghouses and rich as ye are will never be any thing but des bourgeois les plus grossieres for my part i see no reason whywhy a mans being in business should prevent his enjoying the elegancies and agréments of life especially if he can afford it as it is well known i believe even to you sir that i can oh sir replied rochely i know your late father was reputed to have died rich and that no body has made a better figure about town than you have ever since as to figure sir returned the other it is true i like to have every thing about me comme il faut and though i dont make fifty per cent of money as some gentlemen do in your way of business i assure you sir i do nothing that i can not very well afford mrs ashwood who thought it very likely a quarrel might ensue here endeavoured to put an end to such very unpleasant discourse and prevented mr hanbury who equally hated them both from trying to irritate them farther to which he maliciously inclined the hints however of fatigue given by her and miss mowbray obliged mr rochely to ring that his chariot might be called which had waited at the door while elkerton who had a pair of beautiful pied horses in his visàvis desired to have them sent for from a neighbouring innfor i said he rising and strutting round the room never suffer my people or my horses to wait in the streets he then leant over emmelines chair and began in a court tone to renew his compliments but she suddenly arose and begging mrs ashwood would give her leave to retire wished mr rochely and ladies a good night and slightly curtseying to elkerton who was putting himself into the attitude for a speech and a bow she tripped away rochely as soon as she was gone hastened to his chariot and elkerton whose people were in no haste to leave the alehouse begged to sit down till they came mrs ashwood had been the whole evening particularly out of humour and being no longer able to command it answered peevishly that her house was much at his service but that she was really so much fatigued she must retirehowever said she miss galton you will be so good as to stay with mr elkertongood night to you sir he was no sooner alone with miss galton than he desired her after a speech which he endeavoured to season with as much flattery as it would bear to tell him who emmeline was upon my word sir answered she it is more than i know her name is mowbray and she is somehow connected with the family of lord montreville but what relation sneeringly answered she i really can not pretend even to guess a relation of lord montreville cried elkerton why i knew his lordship intimately when i was abroad three or four years ago he was at naples with his son his lady and two daughters and i was domesticated absolutely domesticated among them but pray what relation to them can this miss mowbray be probably said miss galton as you know his lordship you may know what connections and family he has i suppose she may be his cousinor his nieceor his here she hesitated and smiled and elkerton whose carriage was now at the door and who had a clue which he thought would procure him all the information he wanted took leave of miss galton desiring her to tell mrs ashwood that he should wait upon her again in a few days chapter xiii delamere continued in norfolk only a few weeks after his father and the family came thither during that time he appeared restless and dissatisfied his former vivacity was quite lost he shunned society and passed almost all his time in the fields under pretence of hunting or shooting tho the greatest satisfaction those amusements now afforded him was the opportunity they gave him of absenting himself from home he seldom returned thither till six or seven oclock dined alone in his own apartment and affected to be too much fatigued to be able to meet the party who assembled to cards in the evening lady mary otley and her daughter a widow lady of small fortune in the neighbourhood with lord and lady montreville and their eldest daughter made up a party without him augusta delamere had been left in their way from the north with a relation of his lordships who lived near scarborough with whom she was to remain two months the party at audleyhall was soon encreased by sir richard crofts and his eldest son who came every autumn on a visit to lord montreville and who was his most intimate friend lord montreville during the short time he studied at the temple became acquainted with sir richard then clerk to an attorney in the city who tho there was a great difference in their rank had contrived to gain the regard and esteem of his lordship then mr frederic mowbray and was when he came to his estate entrusted with its management a trust which he appeared to execute with such diligence and integrity that he soon obtained the entire confidence of his patron and by possessing great ductility and great activity he was soon introduced into a higher line of life and saw himself the companion and friend of those to whom at his setting out he appeared only an humble retainer born in scotland he boasted of his ancestry tho his immediate predecessors were known to be indigent and obscure and tho he had neither eminent talents nor any other education than what he had acquired at a freeschool in his native town he had by dint of a very common understanding steadily applied to the pursuit of one point and assisted by the friendship of lord montreville acquired not only a considerable fortune but a seat in parliament and a great deal of political interest together with the title of a baronet he had less understanding than cunning less honesty than industry and tho he knew how to talk warmly and plausibly of honour justice and integrity he was generally contented only to talk of them seldom so imprudent as to practice them when he could get place or profit by their sacrifice he had that sort of sagacity which enabled him to enter into the characters of those with whom he conversed he knew how to humour their prejudices and lay in wait for their foibles to turn them to his own advantage to his superiors the cringing parasite to those whom he thought his inferiors proud supercilious and insulting and his heart hardening as his prosperity encreased he threw off as much as he could every connection that reminded him of the transactions of his early life and affected to live only among the great whose luxuries he could now reach and whose manners he tried to imitate he had two sons by an early marriage with a woman of small fortune who was fortunately dead for had she lived she would probably have been concealed lest she should disgrace him to his sons however he had given that sort of education which was likely to fit them for places under government and he had long secretly intended the eldest for one of the miss delameres delamere all warmth and openness himself detested the narrowminded and selfish father and had shewn so much coolness towards the sons that sir richard foresaw he would be a great impediment to his designs and had therefore the strongest motive for trying to persuade lord montreville that to send him on another tour to the continent would be the best means of curing him of what this deep politician termed a ridiculous and boyish whim which his lordship ought at all events to put an end to before it grew of a more dangerous consequence mr crofts as he was no sportsman passed his mornings in riding out with miss delamere and miss otley or attending on the elder ladies in their airings while delamere who wished equally to shun miss otley whom he determined never to marry and crofts whom he despised and hated lived almost alone notwithstanding the entreaties of his father and the anger of his mother her ladyship who had never any command over her passions harrassed him whenever they met with sarcasms and reflections lady mary scorning to talk to a young man who was blind to the merits of her daughter talked at him whenever she found an opportunity and exclaimed against the disobedience dissipation and illbreeding of modern young men while miss otley affected a pretty disdain and flirted violently with mr crofts as if to shew him that she was totally indifferent to his neglect the temper of delamere was eager and irritable and he bore the unpleasantness of this society whenever he was forced to mix in it with a sort of impatient contempt but as he hourly found it more irksome and the idea of emmeline press every day more intensely on his heart he determined at the end of the third week to go to london not chusing to have any altercation with either lord or lady montreville he one evening ordered his man to have his horses ready at five oclock the next day saying he was to meet the foxhounds at some distance from home and having written a letter to his lordship in which he told him he was going to london for a fortnight which letter he left on the table in his dressingroom he mounted his horse and was soon in town but instead of going to the house of his father in berkleysquare he took lodgings in pallmall every night he frequented those public places which were yet open in hopes of finding emmeline and his servant was constantly employed for the same purpose but as he had no trace of her all his enquiries were fruitless on the night that emmeline was at the play he had been at coventgarden theatre and meant to have looked into the other house but was detained by meeting a young foreigner from whom he had received civilities at turin till the house was empty so narrowly did he miss finding her he so anxiously sought elkerton in looking about for the happy woman who was worthy the exalted situation of being his wife had yet seen none whom he thought so likely to succeed to that honour as miss mowbray and if she was on enquiry found to be as she was represented related to lord montreville it would be so great an additional advantage that he determined in that case to lay himself and his pied horses his house in kent his library and his fortune all at her feet immediately nor did he once suffer himself to suspect that there was a woman on earth who could withstand such a torrent of good fortune in pursuance therefore of this resolution he determined to make enquiry of lord montreville himself of whom he had just known so much at naples as to receive cards of invitation to lady montrevilles conversationes there he mingled with the croud and was slightly noticed as an englishman of fortune smiled at for his affectation of company and manners which seemed foreign to his original line of life and then forgotten but elkerton conceived this to be more than introduction enough and dressing himself in what he thought un disabille la plus imposante and with his servants in their morning liveries he stopped at the door of lord montreville lord montreville was not at home when was he expected it was uncertain his lordship was at audleyhall and might be in town in a fortnight or might not come up till the meeting of parliament and are all the family there enquired elkerton of the porter no sir mr delamere is in town and when can i see mr delamere the porter could not tell as he did not live in berkleysquare where then is he at lodgings in pallmall for delamere had left his direction with his fathers servants elkerton therefore took the address with a pencil and determined without farther reflection to drive thither it was about four oclock and in the middle of november when delamere had just returned to his lodgings to dress before he met his foreign friend and some other young men to dine at a tavern in st jamessstreet when a loud rap at the door announced a visitor millefleur having no orders to the contrary and being dazzled with the splendour of elkertons equipage let him in and he was humming an italian air out of tune in delameres drawingroom when the latter came out in his dressinggown and slippers to receive him delamere on seeing the very odd figure and baboonish face of elkerton instead of that of somebody he knew stopped short and made a grave bow elkerton advancing towards him bowed also profoundly and said i am charmed sir with being permitted the honour of paying you my devoirs delamere concluded from his look and bow as well as from a foreign accent which elkerton had affected till it was become habitual that the man was either a dancing master or a quack doctor sent to him by some of his companions who frequently exercised on each other such efforts of practical wit he therefore being not without humour bowed again more profoundly than before and answered that the honour was entirely his tho he did not know how he had deserved it i was so fortunate sir resumed elkerton so fortunate as tohave the honourthe happinessof knowing lord montreville and lady montreville a few years ago at naples delamere still confirmed in his first idea answered very probably sir and sir continued elkerton i now waited upon you as his lordship is not in town indeed sir you are too obliging to ask sir a question which i hope will not be deemedbe deemed a word did not immediately occur be deemedimproperintrusiveimpertinentinquisitivepresuming i dare say sir nothing improper intrusive impertinent inquisitive or presuming is to be apprehended from a gentleman of your appearance delamere expected something very ridiculous to follow this ridiculous introduction and with some difficulty forbore laughing elkerton went on it relates sir to a lady pray sir proceed i am really impatient where a lady is concerned you are acquainted sir with a lady of the name of ashwood who lives at clapham no really sir i am not so happy i fancy then sir i have been misinformed and beg pardon for the trouble i have presumed to give but i understood that the young lady who lives with her was a relation of lord montreville a ray of fire seemed to flash across the imagination of delamere and to inflame all his hopes he blushed deeply and his voice faultering with anxiety he cried whatwho sira young ladywhat young lady miss mowbray they tell me is her name and i understand sirbut i dare say from mistakethat she is of your family delamere could hardly breathe he seemed as if he was in a dream and dared not speak for fear of awaking elkerton led on by the questions delamere at length summoned resolution to ask proceeded to inform him of all he knew how where and how often he had seen emmeline and of his intentions to offer himself a candidate for her favourfor notwithstanding sir said he that mr rochely seems to be fort avant en ses bon graces i thinki hopei believe that his fortuneand yet his fortune does not perhaps so much exceed mine as many supposehis fortune will hardly turn the balance against me especially if i have the sanction of lord montreville to whom i suppose as you seem to acknowledge some affinity between miss mowbray and his lordship it will be no harm if i apply thro the mind of delamere a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed he was divided between his joy at having found emmeline his vexation at knowing she was surrounded by rivals and his fear that his father might by the application of elkerton to him know that emmelines abode was no longer a secret and amidst these various sensations he was able only to express his dislike of elkerton whose presumption in thinking of emmeline appeared to cancel the casual obligation he owed to him for discovering her sir said he haughtily as soon as he could a little recover his recollection i am very well assured that lord montreville will not hear any proposals for miss mowbray his lordship has in fact no authority over her and besides he is at present about to leave his house in norfolk and i know not when he will be in town perhaps not the whole winter he is now going to visit some friends and it will be impossible you can have any access to him for some months as to myself you will excuse me i am engaged to dine out he rang the bell and ordered the servant who entered to enquire for the gentlemans carriage then bowing coolly to him he went into his dressing room and left the mortified elkerton to regret the little success of an attempt which he doubted not would have excited in the hearts of all those related to miss mowbray admiration at his generosity and joy for the good fortune of emmeline for he concluded by her being a companion to mrs ashwood that she had no fortune or any dependance but on the bounty of lord montreville delamere whose ardent inclinations whatever turn they took were never to be a moment restrained rang for his servants and dispatching one of them with an excuse to his friends he sent a second for an hackneycoach then ordering up a cold dinner which he hardly staid to eat he got into the coach and directed it to be driven as fast as possible to clapham common where he asked for the house of mrs ashwood and was presently at the door the servant had that moment opened the iron gate to let out a person who had been to his mistress upon business delamere therefore enquiring if miss mowbray was at home entered without ringing and telling the servant that he had occasion to speak to miss mowbray only the man answered that she was alone in the dressing room thither therefore he desired to be shewn and without being announced he entered the room instead of finding her alone he saw her sit at work by a little table on which were two wax candles and by her side with his arm as usual over the back of her chair and gazing earnestly on her face sat mr rochely emmeline did not look up when he came in supposing it was the servant with tea delamere therefore was close to the table when she saw him the work dropped from her hands she grew pale and trembled but not being able to rise she only clasped her hands together and said faintly oh heavenmr delamere yes emmeline it is mr delamere and what is there so extraordinary in that i was told you were alone may i beg the favour of a few minutes conversation emmeline knew not what to reply she saw him dart an angry and disdainful look at poor rochely who alarmed by the entrance of a stranger that appeared on such a footing of familiarity and who possessed the advantages of youth and a handsome person had retreated slowly towards the fire and now surveyed delamere with scrutinizing and displeased looks while delamere said to emmelineif you have no particular business with this gentleman will you go into some other room that i may speak to you on an affair of consequence sit down said emmeline recovering her surprize sit down and i will attend you presently tell me how is your sister augusta i know not she is in yorkshire and lord montreville well i believe but what is all this to the purpose can i not speak to you but in the presence of a third person unequivocal as this hint was rochely seemed determined not to go and delamere as resolutely bent to affront him if he did not emmeline therefore who knew not what else to do was going to comply with his request of a private audience when she was luckily relieved by the entrance of mrs ashwood and the tea table mrs ashwood surprized at seeing a stranger and a stranger whose appearance had more fashion than the generality of her visitors was introduced to mr delamere a ceremony he would willingly have dispensed with and having made his bow and muttered something about having taken the liberty to call on his relation he sat down by emmeline and in a whisper told her he must and would speak to her alone before he went emmeline to whose care the tea table was allotted when miss galton happened not to be at mrs ashwoods now excused herself under pretence of being obliged to make tea and while it was passing mrs ashwood made two or three attempts to introduce general conversation but it went no farther than a few insignificant sentences between her and mr rochely delamere wholly engrossed by the tumultuous delight of having recovered emmeline and by contriving how to speak to her alone thought nothing else worthy his attention and sat looking at her with eyes so expressive of his love that rochely who anxiously watched him was convinced his solicitude was infinitely stronger than his relationship only would have produced he had at length learned by constant attention to every hint and every circumstance that related to emmeline who she was and had even got from mrs ashwood a confused idea of delameres attachment to her which the present scene at once elucidated rochely saw in him not only a rival but a rival so dangerous that all his hopes seemed to vanish at once unconscious till then how very indiscreetly he was in love he was amazed at the pain he felt from this discovery and with a most rueful countenance sat silent and disconcerted mrs ashwood used to be flattered and attended to was in no good humour with mr delamere who gave her so little of his notice and never perhaps were a party more uncomfortable till they were enlivened by the entrance of miss galton and mr hanbury with another gentleman they were hardly placed and had their tea sent round before a loud ring was heard and the servant announced mr elkerton mr elkerton came dancing into the room and having spoken to mrs ashwood and emmeline he slightly surveyed the company and sat down he was very near sighted and affected to be still more so and delamere having drawn his chair out of the circle sat almost behind emmeline while the portly citizen who had accompanied mr hanbury sat forward near the table delamere was therefore hardly seen elkerton began to tell them how immoderately he was fatigued i have been over the whole town said he today in the morning i was obliged to attend a boring appointment upon business relative to my estate in kent and to meet my tenants who disagreed with my steward and then i went to call upon my old friend delamere lord montrevilles son in pallmall we passed a very chearful hour discoursing of former occurrences when we were together at turin upon my word he is a good sensible young man we have renewed our intimacy and he has insisted upon my going down with him to his fathers house in norfolk emmeline suspended her tea making and looked astonished mrs ashwood seemed surprized but delamere who had at first felt inclined to be angry at the folly and forwardness of elkerton was now so struck with the ridicule of the circumstance that he broke into a loud laugh the eyes of the company were turned towards him and elkerton with great indignation took his glass to survey who it was that had thus violated the rules of good breeding but great was his dismay and astonishment when he beheld the very delamere of whom he had spoken with so much assurance rise up and advancing towards him make a grave bow sir said delamere very solemnly i can not sufficiently express my gratitude for your good opinion of me nor my happiness to hear you intend to honour me with a visit at audley hall upon my word you are too obliging and i know not how i shall shew my gratitude the ironical tone in which this was delivered and the discomposed looks of the distressed elkerton explained the matter to the whole company and the laugh became general elkerton tho not easily disconcerted could not stand it after a sort of apology to delamere he endeavoured to reassume his consequence but he had been too severely mortified and in a few minutes arose and under pretence of being engaged to a rout in town went away nobody attempting to stop him rochely who hated elkerton could not forbear to triumph in this discomfiture he spoke very severely of him as a forward impertinent silly fellow who was dissipating his fortune the old citizen heartily joined in exclaiming against such apostates from the frugality of their ancestors sir said he to rochely we all know that you are a prudent man and that cash at your house is as it were in the bank sir you do honour to the city but as to that there mr elkerton one must be cautious but for my part i wonder how some people go on to my certain knowledge his father didnt die so rich as was supposednonot by a many thousands sir i remember himand i am not ashamed to say it for every body knows i have got my money honestly and that its all of my own gettingbut sir i remember that mans father and not a many years ago neither carrying out parcels and sweeping the shop for old jonathan huggins you knew old jonathan huggins he did not die i think till about the year fortyone or two you remember him to be sure rochely ever tremblingly alive when his age was called in question yet fearing to deny a fact which he apprehended the other would enter into a convincing detail to prove answered that he slightly remembered him when he was quite a boy but his evasion availed him nothing the old citizen mr rugby was now got upon his own ground and most inhumanly for the feelings of poor rochely began to relate in whose mayoralty old jonathan huggins was sheriff and when he was mayor who he married who married his daughters and how he acquired an immense fortune all by frugality at setting out and how one of his daughters who had married a lord against the old mans will had spent more in one night than his father did in a twelvemonth delamere who sat execrating both jonathan huggins and his historian at length lost all patience and said to emmeline in an half whisper i can bear this no longer leave these tedious old fools and let me speak to you for two minutes only emmeline knew not how to refuse without hazarding some extravagance on the part of delamere but as she did not like the appearance of leaving the room abruptly she desired mrs ashwood would give her permission to order candles in the parlour as mr delamere wished to speak with her alone as soon as the servant informed her they were ready she went down and delamere followed her having first wished mrs ashwood a good night who was too much displeased with the little attention he had shewn her to ask him to supper tho she was very desirous of having a man of his fashion in the list of her acquaintance delamere and emmeline were no sooner alone than he began to renew with every argument he thought likely to move her his entreaties for a private marriage he swore that he neither could or would live without her and that her refusal would drive him to some act of desperation emmeline feared her resolution would give way for the comparison between the people she had lately been among and delamere was infinitely favourable to him such unabated love in a man who might chuse among the fairest and most fortunate of women was very seducing and the advantages of being his wife instead of continuing in the precarious situation she was now in would have determined at once a mind more attentive to pecuniary or selfish motives but emmeline unshaken by such considerations was liable to err only from the softness of her heart delamere unhappydelamere wearing out in hopeless solicitude the bloom of life was the object she found it most difficult to contend with and feeble would have been her defence had she not considered herself as engaged in honour to lord montreville to refuse his son and still more engaged to respect the peace of the family of her dear augusta strengthened by these reflections she refused tho in the gentlest manner to listen to such proposals reproached him tho with more tenderness in her voice and manner than she had yet shewn for having left audley hall without the concurrence of lord montreville and entreated him to return and try to forget her let me perish if i do eagerly answered delamere no emmeline if you determine to push me to extremities to you only will be the misery imputable when my mistaken parents in vain repentance hang over the tomb of their only son and see the last of his family in an early grave it is in your power only to save meyou refusefarewel theni wish no future regret may embitter your life and that you may find consolation in being the wife of some one of those persons who are i see offering you all that riches can bestow farewel lovely inhuman girl be happy if you canafter having sacrificed to a mistaken point of honour the repose and the life of him who lived only to adore you so saying he suddenly opened the door and was leaving the room but emmeline who shuddered at the picture he had drawn of his despair and saw such traces of its reality on his countenance caught his arm stay mr delamere cried she stay yet a moment for what purpose answered he since you refuse to hear me he turned back however into the room and emmeline who fancied she saw him the victim of his unfortunate love could no longer command her tears delamere threw himself at her feet and embraced her knees oh emmeline cried he weeping also hear me for the last time either consent to be mine or let me take an eternal adieu what would you have me do good god what is it you expect of me to go with me to scotland tomorrowto nightdirectly oh no nodoes not lord montreville depend upon my honourcan i betray a trust reposed in me chimeras all founded in tyranny on his part and weakness on yours he had no right to exact such a promise you had no right to give it but however send to him again to say i have seen yousummons him hither to divide usyou may certainly do so if you please but lord montreville will no longer have a son at least england nor europe will contain him no longeri will go where my father shall hear no more of me will it content you if i promise you not to write to lord montreville nor to cause him to be written to and to see you again when tomorrowwhenever you please delamere catching at this faint ray of hope promised if she would allow him to come thither when he would he would endeavour to be calm he made her solemnly protest that she would neither write to lord montreville or procure another to do it and that she would not leave mrs ashwood without letting him know when and whither she went and if by any accident his father heard of his having found her that she would enter into no new engagements to conceal herself from him having procured from her these assurances which he knew she would not violate and having obtained her consent to see him early the next morning he at her request agreed to take his leave which he did with less pain than he had ever before felt at quitting her carrying with him the delightful hope that he had made an impression on her heart and secure of seeing her the next day he went home comparatively happy emmeline who had wept excessively was very unfit to return to the company but she thought her not appearing again among them would be yet more singular she therefore composed herself as well as she could and after staying a few minutes to recollect her scattered spirits she entered the room where they were at cards rochely who was playing at whist with mrs ashwood mr rugby and mr hanbury looked anxiously at her eyes and presently losing all attention to what he was about and forgetting his game he played so extremely ill that he lost the rubber the old cit who had three half crowns depending and who was a determined grumbler at cards fell upon him without mercy and said so many rude things that rochely could not help retorting and it was with some difficulty mrs ashwood prevented the grossest abuse being lavished from the enraged rugby on the enamoured banker who desiring to give his cards to miss galton got up and ordered his carriage emmeline sat near the fire with her handkerchief in her hand which was yet wet with tears rochely with a privilege he had been used to and which emmeline from a man old enough to be her father thought very inconsequential took her hand and the handkerchief it held so miss mowbray said he mr delamere is your near relation yes sir and he has brought you i fear some ill news of your family no sir sighed emmeline no death i hope no sir whence then these tears emmeline drew her hand away what a strange young man this is to make you cry what has he been saying to you nothing sir ah miss mowbray such a lad as that is but an indifferent guardian pray where does his father live miss mowbray not aware of the purpose of this enquiry and glad of any thing that looked like common conversation answered at audley hall in norfolk and in berkleysquare some other questions which seemed of no consequence rochely asked and emmeline answered till hearing his carriage was at the door he went away i dont like your mr delamere at all miss mowbray said mrs ashwood as soon as the game ended i never saw a prouder more disagreeable young man in my life emmeline smiled faintly and said she was sorry he did not please her no nor me neither said miss galton such haughtiness indeedyet i was glad he mortified that puppy elkerton emmeline who found the two friends disposed to indulge their good nature at the expence of the company of the evening complained of being fatigued and asked for a glass of wine and water which having drank she retired to bed leaving the lady of the house who had invited mr hanbury and his friend to supper to enjoy more stories of jonathan huggins and the pretty satyrical efforts of miss galton who made her court most effectually by ridiculing and villifying all their acquaintance whenever it was in her power chapter xiv when rochely got home he set about examining the state of his heart exactly as he would have examined the check book of one of his customers he found himself most miserably in love but avarice said miss mowbray had no fortune by what had passed in his bosom that evening he had discovered that he should be wretched to see her married to another but avarice enquired how he could offer to marry a woman without a shilling love represented that her modest reserved and unambitious turn would perhaps make her in the end a more profitable match than a woman educated in expence who might dissipate more than she brought avarice asked whether he could depend on modesty reserve and a retired turn in a girl not yet eighteen after a long discussion love very unexpectedly put to flight the agent of plutus who had with very little interruption reigned despoticly over all his thoughts and actions for many years and rochely determined to write to lord montreville to lay his circumstances before him and make a formal proposal to marry miss mowbray in pursuance of this resolution he composed with great pains for he was remarkably slow in whatever he undertook the following epistle my lord this serves to inform your lordship that i have seen miss mowbray and like her well enough to be willing to marry her if you my lord have not any other views for her and as to fortune i will just give your lordship a memorandum of mine i have sixty thousand pounds in the stocks viz eighteen in the three per cent consols twenty in bank stock ten in east india stock and twelve in south sea annuities i have about forty thousand on different mortgages all good as i will be ready at any time to shew you i have houses worth about five more and after the death of my mother who is near eighty i shall have an estate in middlesex worth ten more the income of my business is near three thousand pounds a year and my whole income near ten thousand my character my lord is well known and you will find if we agree that i shall not limit miss mowbrays settlement to the proportion of what your lordship may please to give her for i suppose you will give her something but to what she ought to have as my widow if it should so happen that she survives me i have reason to believe miss mowbray has no dislike to this proposal and hope to hear from your lordship thereon by return of post i am my lord your lordships very humble servant humphrey rochely lombardstreet nov th this was going to the point at once the letter arrived in due time at audleyhall and was received by lord montreville with surprise and satisfaction the hint of miss mowbrays approbation made him hope she was yet concealed from delamere and as he determined to give the earliest and strongest encouragement to this overture from a man worth above an hundred thousand pounds he called a council with sir richard crofts who knew rochely and who kept cash with him and it was determined that lord montreville should go to town not only to close at once with the opulent banker but to get delamere out of the way while the marriage was in agitation which it would otherwise be impossible to conceal from him to persuade him to another continental tour was what sir richard advised and agreed to go to town with his lordship in order to assist in this arduous undertaking lord montreville however failed not immediately to answer the letter he had received from mr rochely in these terms sir this days post brought me the honour of your letter if miss mowbray is as sensible as she ought to be of so flattering a distinction be assured it will be one of the most satisfactory events of my life to see her form a connection with a gentleman truly worthy and respectable to hasten the completion of an event so desirable i fully intend being in town in a very few days when i will with your permission wait on you in lombardstreet i have the honour to be with great esteem sir your most devoted and most obedient servant montreville audleyhall nov the haughty peer who derived his blood from the most antient of the british nobility thus condescended to flatter opulence and to court the alliance of riches nor did he think any advances he could make beneath him when he hoped at once to marry his niece to advantage and what was yet more material put an invincible bar between her and his son while this correspondence so inimical to delameres hopes was passing between his father and mr rochely he was every hour with emmeline intoxicated with his passion indulging the most delightful hopes and forgetting every thing else in the world he had found it his interest to gain by a little more attention and some fine speeches about elegance and grace the good opinion of mrs ashwood who now declared she had been mistaken in her first idea of him and that he was not only quite a man of fashion but possessed an excellent understanding and very refined sentiments the sudden death of her father had obliged her to leave home some days before but as soon as she was gone emmeline who foresaw that delamere would be constantly with her sent for miss galton no remonstrance of hers could prevent his passing every day at the house from breakfast till a late hour in the evening on the last of these days he was there as usual and it was past eight at night when emmeline who had learned to play on the harp by being present when mrs ashwood received lessons on that instrument was singing to delamere a little simple air of which he was particularly fond and into which she threw so much pathos that lost in fond admiration he hung over her enamoured when she was interrupted by the entrance of a servant who said that a lord but he forgot the name was below and desired to speak with miss mowbray if emmeline was alarmed at the sight of lord montreville at swansea when she had acted with the strictest attention to his wishes she had now much more reason to be so when she felt herself conscious of having given encouragement to delamere and had reason to fear her motives for doing so would be misbelieved or misunderstood tho the servant had forgotten his name emmeline doubted not but it was lord montreville and she had hardly time to think how she should receive him before his lordship who had impatiently followed the servant up stairs entered the room delamere immovable behind emmelines chair was the first object that struck him he had hoped that her residence was yet unknown to his son and surprise vexation and anger were marked in his countenance and attitude miss mowbray advancing towards her is it thus you fulfil the promise you gave me and you mr delameredo you still obstinately persist in this ridiculous this unworthy attachment i left you my lord answered delamere without deceiving you as to my motives for doing so i came in search of miss mowbray by a fortunate accident i found her i have never dissimulated nor ever mean it in whatever relates to her nothing has prevented my making her irrevocably mine but her too scrupulous adherence to a promise she ought never to have given and which your lordship ought never to have extorted emmeline gentle as she was had yet that proper spirit which conscious worth seldom fails of inspiring and knowing that she had already sacrificed much to the respect she thought lord montreville entitled to she was hurt at finding from his angry and contemptuous tone as well as words that she was condemned unheard and treated with harshness where she deserved only kindness and gratitude the courage of which her first surprise had deprived her was restored by these sensations and she said with great coolness yet with less timidity than usual my lord i have yet done nothing in violation of the promise i gave you but the moment your lordship doubts my adherence to it from that moment i consider it as dissolved delamere encouraged by an answer so flattering to his hopes now addressed himself to his father who was by this time seated and spoke so forcibly of his invincible attachment and his determined purpose never to marry any other woman that the resolution of lord montreville was shaken and would perhaps have given way if the violent and clamorous opposition of his wife on one hand and the ambitious projects and artful advice of sir richard crofts on the other had not occurred to him he commanded himself so far as not to irritate delamere farther by reflections on the conduct of emmeline which he found would not be endured and trying to stifle his feelings under the dissimulation of the courtier he heard with patience all he had to urge he even answered him with temper made an apology to emmeline for any expressions that might have given her offence and at length threw into his manner a composure that elated delamere to a degree of hope hitherto unfelt he fancied that his father weary of hopeless opposition and convinced of the merit of emmeline would consent to his marriage and his quick spirit seizing with avidity on an idea so flattering converted into a confirmation of it all lord montrevilles discourse for the remainder of the visit in which by dissimulation on one part and favourable expectations on the other they both seemed to return to some degree of good humour delamere agreed to go home with his father and lord montreville having determined to return the next day to speak to emmeline on the proposals of rochely they parted his lordship meditating as he went home how to prevent delameres interrupting the conference he wished to have on a subject which was so near his heart on his arrival at his own house he found sir richard crofts waiting for him whom he detained to supper delamere as soon as it was over went to his lodgings which lord montreville did not oppose as he wished to be alone with sir richard but he desired that after that evening delamere would return to his apartments in berkleysquare which he partly promised to do lord montreville related to sir richard what had passed and the uneasiness he was under to find that delamere far from relaxing in his determination had openly renewed his addresses and that emmeline seemed much less disposed to sacrifice his wishes to those of his family than he had yet found her sir richard himself wholly insensible to the feelings of a father discouraged in lord montreville every tendency to forgive or indulge this indiscreet passion and equally incapable of the generous sentiments of a gentleman towards a woman young helpless dependant and unfortunate he tried to harden the heart of lord montreville against his orphan niece and advised him peremptorily to insist on her marrying rochely immediately or as the alternative to declare to her that from the moment of her refusal she must expect from him neither support or countenance this threat on one hand and the affluence offered her by rochely on the other must he thought oblige her to embrace his proposals the greatest difficulty seemed to be to prevent delameres impetuosity from snatching her at once out of the power of his father by an elopement to which if she preferred him to rochely it was very probable she might be driven by harsh measures to consent and that delamere must have in her heart a decided preference there could be little doubt lord montreville was apprehensive that delamere who had he found for many days lived entirely at mrs ashwoods would be there before him in the morning and preclude all possibility of a private conversation with emmeline fitzedward who could and from the duplicity of his character would perhaps have made a diversion in his favour was not in town and to both the mr crofts delamere had an antipathy which he took very little pains to conceal they therefore could not be employed to engage him in this difficulty sir richard offered to go himself to miss mowbray that lord montreville might be at liberty to detain his son pretences for which could not be wanting his lordship closed with this offer with pleasure and felt himself relieved from a painful task his heart though greatly changed by a long course of good fortune and by the habit of living among the great was yet not quite lost to the feelings of nature his brother than whom he was only a year younger and whom he had loved thro childhood and youth with singular attachment was not wholly forgotten and the softened likeness in the countenance of emmeline to one whom he had so long been used to look up to with tenderness frequently said as much for her to his affection as her unprotected and helpless state did to his honour and his compassion nor whatever pains he took to stifle his pity for his son could he entirely reconcile to his own heart the part he was acting but of these feelings meritorious as they were he was ashamed and dared not avow them even to himself while he was intimidated by the supercilious spirit and unconquerable pride of lady montreville and tempted by the visions of encreasing splendour and accumulated riches which sir richard perpetually presented to his imagination and which there was indeed but little doubt of realizing the mowbray family were known to possess abilities those of the deceased mr mowbray were remarkably great tho he had thrown away his time and health in a course of dissipation which had made them useless the talents of lord montreville tho less brilliant were more solid and now in the meridian of life with powerful connections and extensive interest he was courted to accept an eminent post in administration with a promise of a marquisate being restored to him which had long lain dormant in his own family and of the revival of which he was extremely ambitious to support such a dignity his sons future fortune ample as it must be would not he thought be adequate and could only be made so by his marrying miss otley or some woman of equal fortune this therefore was the weight which entirely overbalanced all his kindness for his niece and confirmed his resolution to tear her from delamere at whatever price chapter xv it was much earlier than the usual hour for morning visits when sir richard crofts was at the door of mrs ashwood miss mowbray had given no orders to be denied and he was on enquiring for her shewn into the parlour as soon as the servant informed her a gentleman was below whom she found was not delamere she concluded it was lord montreville and with a fearful and beating heart went down she saw with some surprise a middleaged man of no very pleasant countenance and person to whom she was an entire stranger and concluding his business was with mrs ashwood she was about to retreat when the gentleman advancing towards her told her he waited on her commissioned by lord montreville emmeline sat down in silence and sir richard began miss mowbray i have the honour to be connected with lord montreville and entirely in his lordships confidence you will please therefore to consider what i shall say to you as coming immediately directly and absolutely from himself and as his lordships decided and unalterable and irrevocable intentions the abruptness of this speech shocked and distressed emmeline she grew very pale but bowing slightly to the speaker he went on my lord montreville hopes and supposes and is willing to believe that you have not in direct violation of your promise solemnly given encouraged mr delamere in the absurd and impossible and impracticable project of marrying you but however that may have been as it is his lordships firm resolution and determination never to suffer such a connection you have i suppose too much sense not to see the mischief you must occasion and bring on and cause to yourself by encouraging a giddy and infatuated and ignorant and rash young man to resist paternal authority emmeline was still silent now here is an opportunity of establishing yourself in affluence and reputation and fortune beyond what your most sanguine hopes could offer you and i am persuaded you will eagerly and readily and immediately embrace it lord montreville insists upon it the world expects it and mr delameres family demand it of you sir said emmeline astonished at the peremptory tone and strange purport of these words it is my custom resumed sir richard when i am upon business to speak plainly and straitly and to the point this then is what i have to proposeyou are acquainted with mr rochely the great banker yes sir he offers to my lord montreville to marry you and to make settlements on you equal to what you might have claimed had you a right to be considered as a daughter of the house of mowbray his real fortune is very great his annual income superior to that of many of the nobility and there can be no reason indeed none will be allowed or listened to or heard of why you should not eagerly and instantly and joyfully accept a proposal so infinitely superior to what you have any claim or right or pretence to this was almost too much for poor emmeline anger and disdain which she found fast rising in her bosom restrained her tears but her eyes flashed indignantly on the unfeeling politician who thus so indelicately addressed her he would not give her time to speak but seemed determined to overwhelm her imagination at once with the contrast he placed before her if continued he you will agree to become the wife of mr rochely as soon as settlements can be prepared my lord montreville of whose generosity and greatness of mind and liberality too much can not be said offers to consider you as being really his niece as being really a daughter of the mowbray family and that being so considered you may not be taken by any man portionless he will on the day of marriage present and settle on and give you three thousand pounds now miss mowbray consider and weigh and reflect on this well and give me leave in order that you may form a just judgment to tell you the consequence of your refusal my lord montreville who is not obliged to give you the least assistance or support or countenance does by me declare that if you are so weak to call it by no harsher name as to refuse this astonishing and amazing and singular good fortune he shall consider you as throwing off all duty and regard and attention to him and as one with whose fate it will be no longer worth his while to embarrass perplex and concern himself from that moment therefore you must drop the name of mowbray to which in fact you have no right and take that of your mother whatever it be and you must never expect from my lord montreville or the mowbraydelamere family either countenance or support or protection now miss mowbray your answer the proposition can not admit of deliberation or doubt or hesitation and my lord expects it by me the presence of mind which a very excellent understanding and a very innocent heart gave to emmeline was never more requisite than on this occasion the rude and peremptory manner of the speaker the dreadful alternative of rochely on one side and indigence on the other thus suddenly and unexpectedly brought before her was altogether so overcoming that she could not for a moment collect her spirits enough to speak at all she sighed but her agitation was too great for tears and at length summoning all her courage she replied my lord montreville sir would have been kinder had he delivered himself his wishes and commands such however as i now receive them they require no deliberation i will not marry mr rochely tho instead of the fortune you describe he could offer me the worldlord montreville may abandon me but he shall not make me wretched tell him therefore sir her spirit rose as she spoke that the daughter of his brother unhappy as she is yet boasts that nobleness of mind which her father possessed and disclaims the mercenary views of becoming from pecuniary motives the wife of a man whom she can not either love or esteem tell him too that if she had not inherited a strong sense of honour of which at least her birth does not deprive her she might now have been the wife of mr delamere and independant of his lordships authority and it is improbable that one who has sacrificed so much to integrity should now be compelled by threats of indigence to the basest of all actions that of selling her person and her happiness for a subsistence i beg that you sir who seem to have delivered lord montrevilles message with such scrupulous exactness will take the trouble to be as precise in my answer and that his lordship will consider it as final having said this with a firmness of voice and manner which resentment as well as a noble pride supplied she arose curtseyed composedly to sir richard and went out of the room leaving the unsuccessful ambassador astonished at that strength of mind and dignity of manner which he did not expect in so young a woman and somewhat mortified that his masculine eloquence on which he was accustomed to pride himself and which he thought generally unanswerable had so entirely fallen short of the effect he expected unwilling however to return to lord montreville without hopes of success he thought he might obtain at least some information from mrs ashwood of the likeliest means to move her untractable and high spirited friend he therefore rang the bell and desired to speak with that lady but as she was not yet returned from the house of her father where a family meeting was held to inspect his will sir richard failed of attempting to secure her agency and was obliged however reluctantly to depart emmeline whose command of herself was exerted with too much violence not to shake her whole frame with its effects no sooner reached her own chamber than she found all her courage gone and a violent passion of tears succeeded her deep convulsive sighs reached the ears of miss galton who entered the room and began in the common mode of consolation first to enquire why she wept emmeline answered only by weeping the more miss galton enquired if that gentleman was lord montreville emmeline was unable to reply and miss galton finding no gratification to her curiosity which mingled with envious malignity had long been her ruling passion was obliged to quit the unhappy emmeline which was indeed the only favour she could do her the whole morning had passed before miss mowbray was able to come down stairs and when she did her languor and dejection were excessive miss galton only dined with her if it might be called dining for she eat nothing but just as the cloth was removed a coach stopped and mrs ashwood appeared led by her brother mr stafford emmeline who had not very lately heard from her beloved friend now eagerly enquired after her and learned that the illness of one of her children had together with her being far advanced in her pregnancy prevented her coming to london with mr stafford who tho summoned thither immediately on his fathers death had only arrived the evening before the messenger that went having missed him at his own house and having been obliged to follow him into another county he delivered to miss mowbray a letter from mrs stafford with which emmeline eager to read it retired trust me emmeline no abatement in my tender regard has occasioned my omitting to write to you but anxiety of mind so great as to deprive me of all power to attend to any thing but its immediate objectyour poor little friend harry who looked so much recovered and so full of health and spirits when you left him at swansea was three weeks ago seized again with one of those fevers to which he has so repeatedly been liable and for many days his life appeared to be in the most immediate danger you know how far we are from a physician and you know my anxiety for this first darling of my heart judge then my emmeline of the miserable hours i have known between hope and fear and the sleepless nights i have passed at the bed side of my suffering cherub and in my present state i doubly feel all this anxiety and fatigue and am very much otherwise than well of myself however i think not since harry is out of danger and dr farnaby thinks will soon be entirely restored but he is still so very weak that i never quit him even a moment the rest of my children are well and all who are capable of recollection remember and love you and now my dear miss mowbray as the visitors who have been with me ever since my return from swansea are happily departed and no others expected and as mr stafford will be engaged in town almost all the winter in consequence of his fathers death will you not come to me you only can alleviate and share a thousand anxieties that prey on my spirits you only can sweeten the hour of my confinement which will happen in january and before you only i can sigh at liberty and be forgiven ah emmelinethe death of mr staffords father far from producing satisfaction as increasing our fortune brings to me only regret and sorrow he loved me with great affection and i owe him a thousand obligations the family will have reason to regret his loss tho the infirmities of the latter part of his life were not much alleviated by their attendance or attention come to me emmeline if possible come if you can with mr stafford or if he is detained long in town come without him i will send my postchaise to meet you at basingstoke lord montreville can not object to it and delamere whom you have never mentioned has i conclude given way to the peremptory commands of his father and has determined to forget my emmeline is it then probable any one can forget her i know not of what the volatile and thoughtless delamere may be capable but i know that of all things it would be the most impossible to her truly attached and affectionate c stafford woodfield nov this letter gave great relief to the mind of the dejected emmeline that her first and dearest friend opened at this painful crisis her consolatory bosom to receive and pity her and that she should have the power to share her fatigue and lessen the weight of her anxiety during the slow recovery of her child seemed to be considerations which softened all the anguish she had endured during the day she was however too much disordered to go down to tea and told mrs ashwood who civilly came up to enquire after her that she had a violent pain in her head and would go to bed mrs ashwood full of her increased fortune and busied in studying to make her deep mourning as becoming as possible let her do as she would and thought no more about her she had therefore time to meditate at leisure on her wayward fate and some surprise that delamere had not appeared the whole day mingled itself with her reflections poor delamere was not to blame lord montreville had sent him very early in the morning to desire to see him for five minutes on business of consequence delamere who from what had passed the evening before had indulged during the night the fondest dreams of happiness obeyed the summons not without some hopes that he should hear all his favourable presages confirmed when he came however his father waving all discourse that related to emmeline or himself affected to consult him on a proposal he had received for his eldest sister which the family were disposed to promote and after detaining him as long as he could on this and on other subjects he desired him to send to his lodgings for millefleur and to dress as expeditiously as possible in order to accompany him to dine at lord dornocks a scottish nobleman with whom his lordship was deeply engaged in the depending negociation with ministry and who was at his seat about nine miles from london delamere reluctantly engaged in such a party but however short his fathers discourse fell of what he hoped he yet determined to get the better of his repugnance and obey him still flattering himself that lord montreville would lead to the subject nearest his heart or that in the course of the day he should at least have an opportunity of introducing it they therefore set out together on the most amicable terms in lord montrevilles coach but as they had taken up on their way a gentleman who held a place under lord dornock his presence prevented any conversation but on general subjects during their short journey the dinner passed as such dinners generally dotoo much in the secret to touch on politics all such discourse was carefully avoided at the table of lord dornock in literature they had no resource and therefore the conversation chiefly turned on the pleasure they were then enjoyingthat of the luxuries of the table they determined on the merits of the venison of the past season settled what was the best way of preparing certain dishes and whose domain produced the most exquisite materials for others and on these topics a society of cooks could not have more learnedly descanted delamere not yet of an age to be initiated into the noble science of eating and among whose ideas of happiness the delights of gratifying his palate had not yet been numbered heard them with impatience and disgust he was obliged however to stay while the wines were criticised as eloquently as the meats had been and to endure a long harangue from the master of the house on cote roti and lacryma christi and after the elder part of the company had adjusted their various merits and swallowed a sufficient quantity the two noblemen retired to a private conference and delamere obliged to move into a circle of insipid women took refuge in cards which he detested almost as much as the entertainment he had just quitted the hours however slowly wore away and his patience was almost exhausted soon after ten oclock he ventured to send to his father to know whether he was ready to return to town but he received a message in reply that he had determined to stay all night where he was vexed and angry delamere began to suspect that his father had some design in thus detaining him at a distance from emmeline and fired by indignation at this idea equally scorning to submit to restraint or to be detained by finesse he disengaged himself from the card table fetched his hat and without speaking to any body walked to the next village where he got into a postchaise and was presently in london but as it was almost twelve oclock he forbore to visit emmeline that night chapter xvi as soon as there was any probability of emmelines being visible the next morning delamere was at clapham the servant of whom he enquired for her told him that miss mowbray had not yet rung her bell and that as it was later than her usual hour she was afraid it was owing to her being ill alarmed at this intelligence delamere eagerly questioned her further and learned that the preceding morning a gentleman who had never been there before had been to see miss mowbray and had staid with her about three quarters of an hour during which he had talked very loud and that after he was gone she had hastened to her own room crying sadly and had seemed very much vexed the whole day afterwards that when she went to bed which was early in the evening she had sighed bitterly and said she was not well the servants won by the sweetness and humanity with which emmeline treated them all seemed to consider her health and happiness as their own concern and the girl who delivered this intelligence to delamere had been very much about her and knowing her better loved her more than the others delamere could not doubt the truth of this account yet he could not conjecture who the stranger could be in whose power it was thus to distress emmeline but dreading lest some scheme was in agitation to take her from him he sat in insupportable anxiety till she should summons the maid her music book lay open on a piano forte in the breakfast parlour a song which he had a few days before desired her to learn as being one which particularly charmed him seemed to have been just copied into it and he fancied the notes and the writing were executed with more than her usual elegance under it was a little porte feuille of red morocco delamere took it up it was untied and two or three small tinted drawings fell out he saw the likeness of mrs stafford done from memory one yet more striking of his sister augusta and two or three unfinished resemblances of persons he did not know touched with less spirit than the other two a piece of silver paper doubled together enclosed another he opened itit was a drawing of himself done with a pencil and slightly tinged with a crayon strikingly like but it seemed unfinished and somewhat effaced though among so many other portraits this could not be considered as a very flattering distinction delamere on seeing it was not master of his transports he now believed emmeline whom he could never induce to own that her partiality for him exceeded the bounds of friendship yet cherished in her heart a passion she would not avow while he was indulging these sanguine and delicious hopes he heard a bell ring and flew to enquire if it was that of emmeline the maid who crossed the hall to attend its summons told him it was he stepped softly up stairs behind the servant and waited at the door of the chamber while she went in to the question from the maid how she did emmeline answered much better mr delamere is here madam and begs to know whether he may see you emmeline had expected him all the day before and was not at all surprised at his coming now but she knew not what she should say to him to dissimulate was to her almost impossible yet to tell him what had passed between her and sir richard crofts was to create dissentions of the most alarming nature between him and his father for she knew delamere would immediately and warmly resent the harshness of lord montreville she could not however determine to avoid seeing delamere and she thought his lordship was not entitled to much consideration after the indelicate and needless shock he had given her by employing the peremptory insolent and unfeeling sir richard crofts after a moments hesitation she told nanny to let mr delamere know that as soon as she was dressed she would be with him in the parlour delamere who heard the message stepped softly down stairs replaced the drawings and waited the entrance of emmeline who neither requiring or accustoming herself to borrow any advantage from art or ornament was soon dressed in her usual simple undress but to give some appearance of truth to what she intended to alledge a cold in excuse for her swollen eyes and languid looks she wrapt a gauze hood over her head and tied a black ribband round her throat for tho she could not wholly conceal the truth from delamere she wished to prevent his seeing how much it had affected her when she entered the room delamere who was at the door to meet her was astonished at the alteration he saw in her countenance you are ill emmeline said he taking her hand i am not quite welli have a violent cold coming a cold eagerly answered delamere you have been cryingwho was the person who called on you yesterday it was now in vain to attempt concealment if she had intended it he did not tell me his name for our conversation was very short but his servants told those of mrs ashwood that his name is sir richard crofts and what business could sir richard crofts possibly have with you emmeline related the conversation with great fidelity and without comment delamere had hardly patience to hear her out he protested he would immediately go to sir richard crofts and not only force him to apologize for what had passed but promise never again to interfere between lord montreville and his family from executing this violent measure emmeline by earnest entreaty diverted him she had not yet recovered the shock given her by the unwelcome interview of the preceding day and though she had a very excellent constitution her sensibility of mind was so great that when she suffered any poignant uneasiness it immediately affected her frame in the present state of her spirits she could not hear delameres vehement and passionate exclamations without tears and when he saw how much she was hurt he commanded himself spoke more calmly and by a rapid transition from rage to tenderness he wept also and bathed her hands with his tears he was not without hopes that this last effort of lord montreville would effect a change in his favour and he pleaded again for an elopement with the warmest eloquence of love but emmeline though she felt all the force of his arguments had still the courage to resist them and all he could obtain from her was a renewal of her former promise neither to leave mrs ashwood unknown to him or to conceal the place of her residence to consent to see him wherever she should be and positively to reject mr rochelys offer in return she expected from delamere some concessions which nothing but the sight of her uneasiness would have induced him to grant at length she persuaded him to promise that he would not insult sir richard crofts or commit any other rashness which might irritate lord montreville nothing was a stronger proof of the deep root which his passion had taken in his heart than the influence emmeline had obtained over his ungovernable and violent spirit hitherto unused to controul and accustomed from his infancy to exert over his own family the most boundless despotism emmeline tranquillized and consoled by his promises then entreated him to go as the state of mrs ashwoods family made visitors improper in this too he obeyed her and as soon as he was gone emmeline sat down to write to mrs stafford related briefly what had lately happened and told her that as soon as lord montreville could be induced to settle some yearly sum for her support which notwithstanding his threats she still thought he would do on condition of her engaging never without his consent to marry delamere she would set out for woodfield lord montreville absorbed in politics and in a negociation with ministry had on the evening when he and his son were at lord dornocks forgotten the impatient temper and particular situation of delamere his non appearance at supper occasioned an enquiry and it was found he had left the house it was too late for lord montreville to follow him that night and would indeed have been useless but early the next morning he was in berkleysquare where he heard nothing of his son he received a letter from sir richard crofts relating the ill success of his embassy but adding that he would bring rochely to his lordship the next day to consider together what was next to be done a letter also soon after arrived from lady montreville to let his lordship know that herself and her daughter with lady mary and miss otley were coming to town the next evening delamere the tumult of whose spirits was too great immediately to subside took for the first time in his life some pains to conquer their violence in consideration of emmeline he sent his servants to berkleysquare to enquire among the domestics what had passed he thence learned that his father had returned in the morning from lord dornocks in very ill humour and that his mother was expected in town an interview with either would he was conscious only be the occasion of that dissention he had promised emmeline to avoid his mother he knew came to town determined to keep no terms with him and that she would incessantly harrass him with reproaches or teize him with entreaties he therefore determined to avoid entirely all conversation with both and after a short reflection on the best means to do so he ordered millefleur to discharge the lodgings told him and his other two servants that he was going out of town and should not take either them or his horses therefore would have them go to berkleysquare and wait there his return he bade his valet tell lord montreville that he should be absent ten days or a fortnight then ordering an hackney coach he directed it to drive to westminster bridge as if he meant there to take post instead of which he dismissed it at the end of bridgestreet and walking over to the surry side he presently provided himself with lodgings under the name of mr oswald a gentleman just come from ireland and all traces of mr delamere were lost end of the first volume volume ii chapter i sir richard crofts brought mr rochely to lord montreville at the time appointed and in consequence of the conversation then held his lordship was confirmed in his resolution of persisting in the plan sir richard had laid down to force emmeline to accept the good fortune offered her lord montreville had sent as soon as he got to town to delameres lodgings whose servants said that he had slept there but was then gone out his lordship concluded he was gone to clapham but as he could not remedy his uneasiness on that head he was obliged to endure it about twelve oclock delamere had arranged matters for his concealment and about three as lord montreville was dressing to go out millefleur together with delameres footman and groom came as they had been ordered to berkleysquare this circumstance was no sooner related to lord montreville by his valet de chambre than he ordered millefleur to be sent up the frenchman related to his lordship that his master was certainly gone to mr percivals but lord montreville concluded he was gone to scotland and in a tempest of anger and vexation cursed the hour when he had listened to the advice of sir richard crofts the harshness of whose proceedings had he imagined precipitated the event he had so long dreaded he was so entirely persuaded that this conjecture was the truth that he first gave orders for a postchaise and four to be ready directly then recollecting that if he overtook his son he had no power to force him back he thought it better to take with him some one who could influence emmeline his youngest daughter was still in yorkshire mrs stafford he knew not where to find but he supposed that mrs ashwood with whom she had lived some months might have power to persuade her and not knowing what else to do indeed hardly knowing what he expected from the visit he ordered his coachman to be as expeditious as possible in conveying him to the house of that lady mrs ashwood her brother and four or five other persons related to the family were at dinner lord montreville entered the room spoke to those he knew with as much civility as he could but not seeing emmeline among them his apprehensions were confirmed he desired they would not disturb themselves and declined sharing their repast but being unable to conceal his emotion till it was over he said to mrs ashwoodi am sorry madam to trouble you on this unhappy business i did hope you would have had the goodness at least to inform me of it what can i do exclaimed he breaking suddenly from his discourse and risinggood god what can i do the company were silent and amazed mrs ashwood however said i am sorry that any thing my lord has disturbed your lordship i am sure i should have been happy my lord could i have been of any service to your lordship in whatever it is disturbed cried he striking his forehead with his hand i am distracted when did she go how long has she been gone who my lord miss mowbrayemmelineoh it will be impossible to overtake them gone my lord gone with delameregone to scotland miss mowbray was however in the house not an hour ago said miss galton i saw her myself go up the garden just as we sat down to dinner then she went to meet himthen they went togetherexclaimed lord montreville walking round the room an assertion so positive staggered every one they rose from table in confusion let us go up said mrs ashwood i can hardly think it possible my lord that miss mowbray is gone unless your lordship absolutely saw them yet mrs ashwood remembered that delamere had been there in the morning and that emmeline had dined early alone and had remained by herself all the rest of the day under pretence of sickness and she began to believe that all this was done to give her time to elope with delamere she went up stairs and lord montreville without knowing what he did followed her the stairs were carpetted any one ascending was hardly heard and mrs ashwood suddenly throwing open the door of her chamber lord montreville saw her with her handkerchief held to her face hanging over a packet of papers which lay on the table before her emmeline did not immediately look upan exclamation from lord montreville made her take her handkerchief from her eyes she arose tried to conceal the sorrow visible in her countenance yet wet with tears and assuming as much as she could her native ease and sweetness she advanced towards his lordship who still stood at the door amazed and asked him if he would pardon her for desiring him to sit down in a bedchamber if not she would wait on him below she then went back to the table threw the papers into the casket that was on it and placing a chair between that and the fire again asked him if he would do her the honour to sit down lord montreville did so but said nothing he was ashamed of his precipitancy yet as emmeline did not know it he would not mention it and was yet too full of the idea to speak of any thing else mrs ashwood had left thememmeline continued silent lord montreville after a long pause at length said with a stern and displeased countenance i understand miss mowbray that my son was here this morning yes my lord pray do you know where he now is i do not indeed is he not at your lordships house no i am told by his servants that he is gone to mr percivalsbut youcontinued he laying a strong emphasis on the word you miss mowbray are i dare say better informed of his intentions than any one else upon my word my lord answered emmeline astonished i do not know he said nothing to me of an intention to go any where on the contrary he told me he should be here again tomorrow and is it possible you are ignorant of his having left london this morning immediately after he returned from visiting you my lord i have never yet stooped to the meanness of a falsehood why should your lordship now suppose me guilty of it i repeatand i hope you will do me the justice to believe meupon my honour i do not know whither mr delamere is gonenor do i know that he has left london lord montreville could not but believe her but while his fears were relieved as to the elopement they were awakened anew by the uncertainty of what was become of his son and what his motive could be for this sudden disappearance he thought however the present opportunity of speaking to emmeline of his resolution was not to be neglected however ignorant you may be miss mowbray said he of the reason of his having quitted his lodgings you are not to learn that his motive for estranging himself from his family and becoming a stranger to his fathers house originates in his inconsiderate attachment to you contrary to the assurances you gave me at swansea you have encouraged this attachment and as i understand from sir richard crofts you peremptorily and even rudely refuse the opportunity now offered you of establishing yourself in rank and affluence which no other young woman would a moment hesitate to accept such a refusal can not be owing to mere caprice nor could it possibly happen had you not determined in despite of every objection and of bringing discord into my family to listen to that infatuated and rash young man your lordship does not treat me with your usual candour i have promised you voluntarily promised you not to marry mr delamere without your lordships consent to prevent his coming here was out of my power but if i really aspired to the honour of which your lordship thinks me ambitious what has prevented me from engaging at once with mr delamere who has i own to you pressed me repeatedly to elope my lord while i am treated with kindness and confidence i can rely upon my own resolution to deserve it but when your lordship on suspicion or misrepresentation is induced to withdraw that kindness and confidencewhy should i make a point of honour where you no longer seem to expect it the truth of this answer as well as its spirit at once hurt and irritated lord montreville determined to separate emmeline from his son he was mortified to be forced to acknowledge in his own breast that she merited all his affection and angry that she should be in the right when he wished to have found something to blame in her conduct pride and selflove seemed to resent that a little weak girl should pretend to a sense of rectitude and a force of understanding greater than his own miss mowbray said his lordship sharply i will be very explicit with youeither consent to marry mr rochely whose affection does you so much honour or expect from me no farther kindness your lordship knows answered emmeline that i have no friend on whom i have the least claim but you if you abandon mebut my lord ought you to do iti am indeed most friendless she could no longer command her tearssobs obliged her to cease speaking lord montreville thought her resolution would give way and trying to divest himself of all feeling with an effort truly political he determined to press his point it is in your power resumed he not only to place yourself above all fear of such desertion but to engage my affection and that of my whole family you will be in a situation of life which i should hardly refuse for one of the miss delameres you will possess the most unbounded affluence and a husband who adores you a man unexceptionable in character of a mature age and whose immense fortune is every day encreasing you will be considered by me and by lady montreville as a daughter of the house of mowbray the blemish of your birth will be wiped off and forgotten emmeline wept more than before and his lordship continued if you absurdly refuse an offer so infinitely above your expectations i shall consider myself as having more than done my duty in putting it in your way and that your folly and imprudence dissolve all obligation on my part you must no longer call yourself mowbray and you must forget that you ever were allowed to be numbered among the relations of my family nor shall i think myself obliged in any manner to provide for a person who in scorn of gratitude prudence and reputation throws from her an opportunity of providing for herself emmeline regained some degree of resolution she looked up her eyes streaming with tears and said well my lord to the lowest indigence i must then submit for to marry mr rochely is not in my power we will suppose for a moment resumed lord montreville that you could realize the visionary hopes you have presumed to indulge of uniting yourself to mr delamere dear as he is to me and his mother we are determined from that moment to renounce himnever shall the rebellious son who has dared to disobey us be again admitted to our presencenever will we acknowledge as his wife a person forced upon us and introduced into our family in despite of our commands and in violation of duty honour and affection you will be the occasion of his being loaded with the curses of both his parents and of introducing misery and discord into his family can you yourself be happy under such circumstances in point of fortune too you will find yourself deceivedwhile we live mr delamere can have but a very slender income and of every thing in our power we shall certainly deprive him both while we live and at our decease consider well what i have said and make use of your reason begin by giving up to me the ridiculous witnesses of a ridiculous and boyish passion which must be no longer indulged to keep a picture of delamere is discreditable and indelicateyou will not refuse to relinquish it he reached over the table and took from among two or three loose papers which yet lay before emmeline a little blue enamelled case which he concluded contained a miniature of delamere of whom several had been drawn emmeline absorbed in tears did not oppose it the spring of the case was defective it opened in his hand and presented to his view not a portrait of his son but of his brother drawn when he was about twenty and at a period when he was more than a brotherwhen he was the dearest friend lord montreville had on earth a likeness so striking which he had not seen for many years had an immediate effect upon him his brother seemed to look at him mournfully a melancholy cast about the eyebrows diminished the vivacity of the countenance and the faded colour for the picture had been painted seven and twenty years gave it a look of languor and ill health such perhaps as the original wore before his death when a ruined constitution threatened him for some months tho his life terminated by a malignant fever in a few hours the poor distrest emmeline was the only memorial left of him and lord montreville felt her tears a reproach for his cruelty in thus threatening to abandon to her fate the unhappy daughter of this once loved brother sir richard crofts and lady montreville were not by to intercept these sentiments of returning humanity he found the tears fill his eyes as he gazed on the picture emmeline insensible of every thing saw it not and not conscious that he had taken it the purport of his last words she believed to relate to a sketch she had herself made of delamere she was therefore surprized when lord montreville arising took her hand and in a voice that witnessed the emotion of his soul saidcome my dear emmeline pardon me for thus distressing you you shall not be compelled to marry mr rochely if you have so great a dislike to him you shall still have an adequate support and i trust i shall have nothing to fear from your indiscretion in regard to delamere your lordship answered emmeline without taking her handkerchief from her eyes has never yet found me capable of falsehood i will repeat if you desire it the promise i gave youi will even take the most solemn oath you shall dictate never to be the wife of mr delamere unless your lordship and lady montreville consent i take your promise answered his lordship and shall rely firmly upon it but emmeline you must go from hence for your own sake your peace and reputation require it delamere must not frequent the house where you are you must conceal from him the place of your abode my lord i will be ingenuous with you to go from hence is what i intend and with your lordships permission i will set out immediately for mrs staffords but to conceal from mr delamere where i am is not in my power for i have given him a solemn promise to see him if he desires it wherever i shall be and as i hope you depend on my honour it must be equally sacred whether given to him or you you will therefore not insist on my breaking this engagement and i promise you again never to violate the other with this compromise lord montreville was obliged to be content he entreated emmeline to see rochely again and hear his offers but she absolutely refused assuring lord montreville that were his fortune infinitely greater she would not marry him tho servitude should be the alternative his lordship therefore forbore to press her farther he desired that if delamere wrote to her or saw her she would let him know which she readily agreed to and he told her that so long as she was single and did nothing to disoblige him he would pay her an hundred guineas a year in quarterly payments he gave her a bank note of fifty pounds and recommending it to her to go as soon as possible to mrs staffords he kissed her cheek with an appearance of affection greater than he had yet shewn and then went home to prepare for the reception of lady montreville whose arrival he did not greatly wish for dreading lest her violence and illtemper should drive his son into some new extravagance but as her will was not to be disputed he submitted without remonstrance to the alteration of the plan he had proposed which was that his family should pass their christmas in norfolk whither he intended to have returned the next day delamere was again at clapham very early emmeline the additional agitation of whose mind had prevented her sleeping during the night appeared more indisposed than she had done the day before delamere very much alarmed at her altered looks anxiously enquired the cause and without hesitation she told him simply all that had passed the promise she had given to his father to which she intended strictly to adhere and the arrangement she had agreed to on condition of being persecuted no more on the score of mr rochely it is impossible to describe the grief and indignation of delamere at hearing this relation he saw all the hopes frustrated which he had been so long indulging he saw between him and all he loved a barrier which time only could remove he dared not hope that emmeline would ever be induced to break an engagement which she considered as binding he dared not flatter himself with the most distant prospect of procuring the consent of lord and lady montreville and therefore by their deaths only could he obtain her which if he had been unnatural enough to wish was yet in all probability very distant as lord montreville was not more than seven and forty and of an excellent constitution and lady montreville three years younger passion and resentment for some moments stifled every other sentiment in the heart of delamere but the impediments that thus arose to his wishes were very far from diminishing their violence the more impossible his union with emmeline seemed to be the more ardently he desired it the difficulties that might have checked or conquered an inferior degree of passion served only to strengthen his and to render it insurmountable it was some moments before emmeline could prevail upon him to listen to her she then enquired why he had concealed himself from his father and where he had been he answered that he had avoided lord montreville because had he met him he found himself incapable of commanding his temper and of forbearing to resent his sending sir richard crofts to her which he had promised her not to do that therefore he had taken other lodgings in another part of the town where he intended to remain emmeline exhorted and implored him to return to berkleysquare he positively refused he refused also to tell her where he lodged and complaining loudly of her cruelty and coldness yet tenderly entreating her to take care of her health he left her having first procured permission to see her the next day and every day till she set out for woodfield when he was gone miss mowbray wrote to lord montreville my lord in pursuance of the word i passed to your lordship i have the honour to acquaint you that mr delamere has just left me i endeavoured to prevail on him to inform me where he lodges but he refuses to give me the least information if it be your lordships wish to see him you will probably have an opportunity of doing it here as he proposed being here tomorrow but refused to name the hour apprehending perhaps that you might meet him as i did not conceal from him that i should acquaint you with my having seen him i have the honour to be my lord your lordships most obedient servant emmeline mowbray clapham dec lord montreville received this letter in her ladyships dressingroom the servant who brought it in said it came from clapham and lady montreville insisted on seeing its contents she had been before acquainted with what had passed and bestowed on her son the severest invectives for his obstinacy and folly poor emmeline however who was the cause of it was the principal object of her resentment and disdain even this last instance of her rectitude could not diminish the prejudice which embittered the mind of lady montreville against her she lamented whenever she deigned to speak of her that the laws of this country unlike those of better regulated kingdoms did not give people of fashion power to remove effectually those who interfered with their happiness or were inimical to their views if this little wretch said she was in france it would not be difficult to put an end to the trouble she has dared to give us a letter de cachet would cure the creature of her presumption and place her where her art and affectation should not disturb the peace of families of high rank lord montreville heard these invectives without reply but not without pain augusta delamere who arrived in berkleysquare the same morning that lady montreville did felt still more hurt by her mothers determined hatred to emmeline whom she languished to see and had never ceased to love miss delamere inheriting all the pride of her mother and adding to it a sufficient share of vanity and affectation of her own had taken a dislike to the persecuted emmeline if possible more inveterate than that of lady montreville tho she had never seen her she detested her and exerted all her influence on her mother to prevent her being received into the family as her fathers relation fitzedward had praised her as the most interesting woman he had ever seen miss delamere had no aversion to fitzedward and tho he had never seemed sensible of the honour she did him she could not divest herself wholly of that partiality towards him which made her heartily abhor any woman he seemed to admire when to this cause of dislike was added what she called the insolent presumption of the animal in daring to attempt inveigling her brother into the folly of marrying she thought she might indulge all the rancour envy and malignity of her heart when lady montreville had read the letter she threw it down on the table contemptuously it requires no answer said she to the servant who waited the man left the room well my lord continued she addressing herself to her husband what do you intend to do about this unhappy infatuated boy i really know not answered his lordship i will tell you then resumed shego to this girl and let her know that you will abandon her pennyless force her to accept the honour mr rochely offers her and by shewing a little strength of mind and resolution break these unworthy chains with which your own want of prudence has fettered your son it has already been tried madam without success consider that if i am bound by no obligations to support this young person i am also without any power over her to force her to marry mr rochely is impossible i have however her promise that she will not enter into any clandestine engagement with delamere her promise exclaimed lady montrevilleand are you weak enough my lord to trust to the promise of an artful designing creature who seems to me to have already won over your lordship to her party what want of common sense is this if you will not again speak to her and that most decisively i will do it myself send her to me i will force her not only to tell me where delamere has had the meanness to conceal himself but also oblige her to relinquish the hopes she has the insolence to indulge miss delamere who wanted to see the wonderful creature that had turned her brothers head and who was charmed to think she should see her humbled and mortified promoted this plan as much as possible augusta dreading her brothers violence dared not and lord montreville would not oppose it as he believed her ladyships overwhelming rhetoric to which he was himself frequently accustomed to give way might produce on emmeline the effect he had vainly attempted he therefore asked lady montreville whether she really wished to see miss mowbray and when i am engaged tomorrow answered she all day but however as she is a sort of person whom it will be improper to admit at any other time let her be here at ten oclock in the morning she may come up before i breakfast into my dressingroom shall i send one of the carriages for her enquired his lordship by no means replied the lady they will be all wanted let her borrow a coach of the people she lives with i suppose all city people now keep coaches or if she can not do that a hack may be had then turning to her woman who had just brought her her snuffbox brackley said she dont forget to order the porter to admit a young woman who will be here tomorrow at ten oclock tho she may perhaps come in a hack lord montreville who grew every hour more uneasy at delameres absence now set out in search of him himself he called at fitzedwards lodgings but he was not yet come to town tho hourly expected his lordship then went to clapham where he hoped to meet his son but instead of doing so emmeline put into his hands the following letter i intended to have seen you again today but the pain i felt after our interview yesterday has so much disordered me that it is better not to repeat it cruel emmelineto gratify my father you throw me from you without remorse without pity i shall be the victim of his ambition and of your false and mistaken ideas of honour ah emmeline will the satisfaction that you fancy will arise from this chimerical honour make you amends for the loss of such an heart as mine yet think not i can withdraw it from you cold and cruel as you are alas it is no longer in my power but my passions the violence of which i can not mitigate prey on my frame and will conduct to the grave this unhappy son who is to be sacrificed to the cursed politics of his family i can not see you emmeline without a renewal of all those sensations which tear me to pieces and which i know affect you though you try to conceal it for a day or two i will go into the country remember your promise not to remove any where but to mrs staffords and to let me know the day and hour when you set out you plead to me that your promise to my father is sacred i expect that those you have passed to me shall be at least equally so farewel till we meet again you know that seeing you and being permitted to love you is all that renders supportable the existence of your unhappy f d this letter my lord said emmeline was delivered by a porter i spoke to the man and asked him from whence he brought it he said from a coffeehouse at charingcross did you answer it no my lord said emmeline blushing i think it required no answer he then told her that lady montreville expected to see her the next day and named the hour emmeline terrified as she was at the idea of such an interview was forced to assure him she would be punctual to it and his lordship took an hasty leave still hoping he might meet his son he was hardly gone before another porter brought to emmeline a second letter it was from augusta delamere at length my dear emmeline i am near you and can tell you i still love you tho even that satisfaction i am forced to snatch unknown to my mother oh emmeline i tremble for your situation tomorrow the dislike that both my mother and sister have taken to you is inconceivable and i am afraid that you will have a great deal of rudeness and unkindness to encounter i write this to prepare you for it and hope that your conscious innocence and the generosity with which you have acted will support you i have been taken to task most severely by my mother for my partiality to you and my sister in her contemptuous way calls you my sweet sentimental friend to be sure my brothers absence is a dreadful thing and great allowances are to be made for my mothers vexation tho i own i do not see why it should prevent her being just i will try to be in the room tomorrow tho perhaps i shall not be permitted dont say you have heard from me for the world but be assured i shall always love you as you deserve and be most truly your affectionate and faithful a delamere berkleysquare dec chapter ii emmeline had the convenience of mrs ashwoods carriage who agreed to set her down in berkleysquare she was herself sitting for her picture and told miss mowbray she would send the chariot back for her when she got to the house of the painter exactly at ten oclock they arrived at the door of lord montreville and emmeline who had been arguing herself into some degree of resolution as she went along yet found her courage much less than she thought she should have occasion for and with faultering steps and trembling nerves she went up stairs the man who conducted her told her that his lady was not yet up and desired her to wait in an antiroom which was superbly furnished and covered with glasses in which emmeline had leisure to contemplate her pale and affrighted countenance the longer the interview was delayed the more dreadful it appeared she dared not ask for miss augusta yet at every noise she heard hoped that amiable girl was coming to console and befriend her but no augusta appeared a servant came in mended the fire and went down again then miss delameres maid under pretence of fetching something took a survey of her in order to make a report to her mistress and emmeline found that she was an object of curiosity to the domesticks who had heard from millefleur and from the other servants who had been at swansea that this was the young woman mr delamere was dying for an hour and a half was now elapsed and poor emmeline whose imagination had been busied the whole time in representing every form of insult and contempt with which she expected to be received began to hope that lady montreville had altered her intention of seeing her at length however mrs brackley her ladyships woman was heard speaking aloud to a footmanwalter tell that young woman she may be admitted to see my lady and shew her up walter delivered his message and the trembling emmeline with some difficulty followed him she entered the dressingroom her ladyship in a morning dress sat at a table on which was a salver with coffee her back was to the door where stood mrs brackley who as emmeline hesitating seemed ready to shrink back said with a sort of condescending nod there you may go in miss emmeline entered but did not advance lady montreville without rising or speaking turned her head and looked at her with a scowling and disdainful countenance humph said she looking at her eldest daughter who sat by the fire with a newspaper in her handhumph as much as to say i see no such great beauty in this creature miss delamere whose countenance wore a sort of disdainful sneer smiled in answer to her mothers humph and said would you have her sit down madam aye said lady montreville turning again her head towards emmelineyou may sit down there was a sofa near the door emmeline hardly able to stand went to it a silence ensued lady montreville sipped her coffee and miss delamere seemed intent upon the newspaper so cried her ladyship my son has absented himself upon my word miss whatdyecallit for mowbray i dont allow that your name is you have a great deal to answer for pray what amends can you ever hope to make to my lord and me for the trouble you have been the cause of i sincerely lament it madam answered emmeline forcing herself to speak and do assure you it has been on my part involuntary oh no doubt ont your wonderful beauty is the fatal cause you have used no art i dare say no pretty finesse learned from novels to inveigle a silly boy to his undoing if i had been disposed madam to take advantage of mr delameres unhappy partiality for me oh dear what you was coy you knew your subject no doubt and now make a merit of what was merely a piece of art i detest such demure hypocrites tell mewhy if you are not disposed to take advantage of mr delameres folly you do not accept the noble offer made you by this banker or whatever he is that my lord says is worth above an hundred thousand pounds the reason is evident a little obscure creature bred on the welch mountains and who was born nobody knows how does not so easily refuse a man of fortune unless she has some other views you would like a handsome young man with a title yes you would like to hide your own obscurity in the brilliant pedigree of one of the first families in europe but know presumptuous girl that the whole house shall perish ere it shall thus be contaminatedknow she grew inarticulate with passion pride and malignity seemed to choak her and she stopped as if to recover breath to give vent to her rage miss delamere took the opportunity to speak indeed child said she it is hurting yourself extremely and i am really sorry you should be so deceived my brother can never marry you and as lord montreville has brought you up under the notion of your belonging to a part of his family we are really interested my mother and i in your not going into a bad course of life if you do not marry this rich cityman what do you think is to become of you my lord montreville has been so good as to assure me said emmelineher words were so faint that they died away upon her lips what does she say fanny asked lady montreville something of my fathers having assured her madam dont flatter yourself girl resumed her ladyship dont deceive yourself if you refuse to marry this man who offers to take you not one shilling shall you ever receive from this family determine therefore at once send to the person in question let him come here and let an agreement for a settlement be directly signed between lord montreville and him lord montreville will in that case give you a fortune i will hear no objection i will have the affair closed this morning i will have it so lady montreville accustomed to undisputed power in her own family expected from every body an acquiescence as blind as she found from her tradesmen and servants who endured her illhumour and gave way to her caprices but she forgot that emmeline was equally unaccustomed to her commands and free from the necessity of obeying them the gentlest and mildest temper will revolt against insolence and oppression and the cruelty and unfeminine insults she had received concluded by this peremptory way of forcing her into a marriage from which her whole soul recoiled at length restored to her some portion of that proper spirit and presence of mind which had been frightened from her conscious that she deserved none of these ungenerous insults and feeling herself superior to her who could cruelly and wantonly inflict them she regained her courage if your ladyship has nothing more to say said she rising i shall have the honour to wish you a good morning for i believe mrs ashwood has been waiting for me some time dont tell me of mrs ashwoodbut tell me where is my son where is delamere i know not answered emmeline i have already told my lord montreville that i am entirely ignorant nobody believes it said miss delamere i am sorry for it replied emmeline coolly if however i did know it is not such treatment madam that should compel me to give any information she then opened the door and walked down stairs a footman met her whom she desired to enquire for mrs ashwoods carriage before the man could descend to obey her a violent ringing was heard the footman said it was his ladys bell and ran up to answer it while emmeline still descending heard somebody softly calling her she looked up and saw augusta delamere leaning over the bannisters she put up her finger as if to prevent emmelines speaking threw her a letter and immediately disappeared the spirits of emmeline were again greatly hurried by this transient view of her friend she put the letter hastily into her pocket and was got down into the hall where she spoke to another footman to see for her carriage but the man whom she had met on the stairs now came to say his lady must see her again emmeline answered that she had already made her friend wait and must beg to be excused returning to her ladyship this morning the man however said that he dared not disobey his lady nor call up the chariot emmeline alarmed at the idea of being detained advanced towards the door told the porter who had not heard this dialogue to open it and walked resolutely into the street the two footmen followed her to the door but contented themselves with looking after her without attempting to stop her she is pretty enough however said one to the other to excuse our young lord the devils int if she is not answered the other emmeline heard this and between vexation at their impertinence and fear of their following her she found her whole strength again forsake her she walked on however towards charlesstreet looking round for mrs ashwoods carriage but could not see it she was totally unacquainted with the streets where she had never been on foot before but recollected that she might get an hackneycoach which was the more necessary as snow was falling fast and her muslin cloaths were already wet almost through she was picking her way still in some hopes of seeing the carriage when an hackneycoach passed empty emmeline looked wishfully towards it the man stopped and asked if she wanted a coach she answered yes as eagerly as if she had been afraid of a disappointment and hurrying into it told the man to drive to clapham just as he was mounting the box another hack passed and a young officer who was in it looked earnestly into that where emmeline sat then calling to his driver to stop he leaped out and emmeline saw fitzedward at the door of her coach miss mowbray said heis it possible alone and in this equipage in berkleysquare where is delamere before emmeline had time to answer him he had opened the coach door it snows too much said he for a comfortable conference unless you will give me leave to sit by you where are you going to to clapham answered emmeline oh take me with you said he i have a thousand things to say to you he gave her no time to refuse but flinging half a crown to the man who had driven him he got into the coach which she was in and ordered the man to shut the door and go where he had been directed emmeline was vexed at this incident as she was too uneasy to wish for the presence of any one and impatient to open the letter in her pocket but fitzedward was not easily discouraged and possessed together with perfect good breeding a fortunate sort of assurance with which nobody was ever long displeased he enquired after mrs stafford with a degree of interest for which emmeline felt inclined to love him she related all she knew of her and her eyes reassumed their lustre while she told him how soon she was likely to see her he then renewed his questions about delamere emmeline could not dissemble and indeed saw in this case no reason why she should she therefore told him ingenuously all that had happened since they met at swansea most of which he already knew from delamere he watched her looks however while she was speaking and by her blushes her manner and the softness of her eyes he thought he saw evidently enough that delamere was no longer indifferent to her her indignation at the treatment she had just received from his mother and sister dyed her cheeks with crimson while she related it but when she returned to speak of delamere she forgot her anger and seemed to feel only pity and tenderness fitzedward a most perfect judge of female hearts made his observations on all this with which he knew he should most effectually gratify his friend and in his insinuating way he said all he could think of to encrease her compassion for her lover and inflame her resentment against those who impeded a union which he was pretty sure emmeline now wished for as well as delamere chapter iii when they arrived at clapham emmeline found mrs ashwood was not yet returned fitzedward entreated her to sing to him and either was or pretended to be in raptures at her improvement since they had met in the summer about half an hour after four mrs ashwood came in and throwing open the parlour door asked emmeline in no very sweet accent why she had given her the trouble to go in her carriage to berkleysquare if she intended going home by any other conveyance mrs ashwood was subject to causeless fits of illhumour to which emmeline was a good deal accustomed and concluding she was now seized with some sudden discomposure of temper mildly answered that she supposed there had been a mistake for that the chariot did not come for her at the appointed time mistake replied the other lady sharply i dont know as to mistake but if you had chosen it you might have staid dinner with lady montreville emmeline without seeming to attend to the asperity of the address desired to introduce colonel fitzedward as this short dialogue had passed without mrs ashwoods having entered the room she had not seen the stranger who now advanced towards her the title of colonel added to his military air and handsome figure seemed to gain at once her favourable opinion and her countenance losing the unpleasing expression of illtemper immediately put on its best smile and an affectation of softness and complacency with which she frequently adorned it she seemed to consider the handsome young soldier as a conquest worthy all her ambition and finding he was the most intimate friend of delamere had no apprehension that his admiration would be diverted by the youth and attractions of emmeline fitzedward presently understood her character and with admirable adroitness acted the part of a man afraid of being too much charmed he cast an arch look at emmeline then made to the lady of the house some compliments so extravagant that only the weakest vanity could prevent her seeing its ridicule but fitzedward who found in a moment that nothing was too gross to be believed fearlessly repeated the dose and before dinner came in she was in the best humour imaginable and pressed him so earnestly to partake of it that after an apology for sitting down in his morning dishabille he consented the same unlimited flattery was continued during dinner by fitzedward and received by the lady with the same avidity and emmeline tho halfangry with him for the pleasure he seemed to take in making mrs ashwood absurd could not help being amused with the scene before their repast ended she was so much charmed with her new acquaintance and so much longed to shew him to her female friends and her other admirers that she could not forbear pressing him to stay to a card party which she was to have in the evening he loved the ridiculous and influenced by a vanity as silly as that he delighted to expose he took pleasure in shewing how extremely absurd he could make women appear who were not on other occasions void of understanding tho he had really business with lord montreville who had left several messages at his lodgings desiring to see him and was going thither when emmeline met him yet he accepted mrs ashwoods invitation on condition of being allowed to go home to dress he was no sooner gone than she flew to her toilet and emmeline to a second perusal of the letter she had received from augusta delamere i am forbidden to see you my dearest emmeline and perhaps may not have an opportunity of giving you this my heart bleeds for you my sweet friend i fear my father will be prevailed upon wholly to abandon you they are all inventing schemes to force you into a marriage with that oddlooking old rochely he has been here once or twice and closetted with my father and part of the scheme of today is to persuade you to dine here with him but i am almost sure you will not stay for unless my mother can command herself more before you than she does when she is talking about you i think you will be frightened away i am certain my dear emmeline from what i have heard tho they say but little before me that no endeavours will be omitted to drive you to marry rochely and that they will persecute you every way both by persuasions and by distressing you but be assured that while augusta delamere has any thing you shall share it indeed i love you not only as if you were my sister but i think better ah why are there such unhappy impediments to your being really so at present i foresee nothing but perplexity and have no dependance but on you i know you will act as you ought to do and that you will at last prevail with delamere to act right too whoever loves you can not long persist in doing ill and surely it is very ill done and very cruel for delamere to make us all so unhappy i need not tell you to arm yourself with fortitude against the attacks that will be made upon you you have more fortitude and resolution than i have situated as you have been i know not what i should have done but i fear it would not have been so worthy of praise as the noble and disinterested part you have acted which tho unaccompanied with the thousand amiable qualities of heart and understanding you possess would ever command the esteem and admiration of your faithful and affectionate augusta delamere do not write to me till you hear from me again as i should incur great displeasure if known to correspond with you a d charmed as emmeline was by the tender solicitude and affectionate simplicity of her beloved friend the pleasure this letter gave her was very much abated by learning that the domestic infelicity of lord montrevilles family fell particularly heavy on her she now recollected what mrs ashwood had said on her first entrance into the room when she returned home and concluded from thence that she had seen lady montreville tho her whole attention was so immediately engrossed by the colonel that she had no more named it she therefore grew anxious to hear what had been said and her own toilet being very soon over she sent to desire admittance to that of mrs ashwood on receiving which she attended her and begged to know whether she had seen lady montreville and what had passed mrs ashwood was in so happy a disposition that she hesitated not to oblige her and while she finished the important business of accommodating a pile of black feathers jet and crape upon her head the mockery of woe which she did not even affect to feel she gave emmeline the following account interlarded with directions to her woman why my dear you must know that when i got to gainsboroughs more to the left he had unluckily a frightful old judge or a bishop or some tedious old man with him and i was forced to wait i can not tell what possessed me but i entirely forgot that i was to send the chariot back for you so the chariot put it a little forwarder staid i thought the tiresome man whoever he was would never have gone however he went at last raise the lower curl and then i sot you can not think how much the likeness is improved so when i had done give me the scraper here is some powder on my eyebrow i went away thinking to call on you but as i went by butlers i remembered that i wanted some pearlcoloured twist to finish the purse i am doing for hanbury i was almost an hour matching it well then i thought as i was so near frivolités door i might as well call and see whether she had put the trimming on the white bombazeen as you know we agreed would be most the thing there were a thousand people in the house you know there is never any possibility of getting out of that creatures room under an hour oh heaven thought emmeline nor is there any end to the importance you affix to trifles which interest nobody else so however at last i got to berkleysquare and stopped at the door the man at the door said you was gone i thought that very odd and desired another servant go up and see for i concluded it was some mistake after a moment or two the footman came down again and said if i was the lady miss mowbray lived with his lady desired i would walk up upon my word it is a noble house when i got into the room there was lady montreville and her daughters her ladyship was extremely polite indeed and after some discourse mrs ashwood said she you know miss mowbrays situation i assure you i sent for her today with no other view in the world but for her own good and you know dear me here is a pimple on my chin that is quite hideous give me a patch you know that for her to refuse mr rochely is being absolutely blind to her own interest because you must suppose mrs ashwood that she is only deceiving herself when she entertains any thoughts of my son for that is a thing that never can happen nor ever shall happen and besides to give my lord and me all this trouble is a very ungrateful return to us for having brought her up and many other obligations she has received at our hands and will be the ruin of herself and the greatest perverseness in the world you mrs ashwood are i hear a very sensible woman where is the rouge box and i dare say now you know how agreeable it would be to me and my lord to have miss emmeline come to her senses about mr rochely you will do your endeavours to persuade her to act reasonably and then tho she has behaved very disrespectful and very ill which is only to be forgiven on account of her knowing no better i shall countenance her and so will my lord this was as near as i remember emmeline what my lady said to me you know the milk of roses is almost out you know i could not refuse to tell her i would certainly talk to you i was surprised to find her ladyship so obliging and affable as you had told me she is reckoned so very proud she ordered her gentleman to give me a ticket for a rout and a supper her ladyship gives on tuesday three weeks and she said that as she did not doubt but that you would discover your own interest by that time i should take one for you look you here it is i shall be in dorsetshire i hope long before tuesday sennight said emmeline laying the card coolly on the toilet she found mrs ashwood had nothing more material to say and being apprehensive that she impeded the last finish which her dress and person required she thanked her and went back into her own room the eagerness and resolution with which lady montreville opposed her sons marriage appeared from nothing more evidently than from her thus endeavouring to solicit the assistance of mrs ashwood and humbling herself to use flattery and insinuation towards a person to whom it is probable nothing else could have induced her to speak with persons in trade or their connections or even with gentlemen unless of very ancient and honourable families she seldom deigned to hold any communication and if she had occasion to speak to them individually it was generally under the appellation of mr or mrs i forget the name for to remember the particular distinctions of such inferior beings was a task too heavy for right honourable intellects when she spoke of such collectively it was under the denomination of the people or the folks with that sort of condescension that seems to say i will humble myself to your level and which is in fact more insolent than the most offensive haughtiness her ladyship had behaved to mrs ashwood who took it for extreme politeness and was charmed on any terms to obtain admission to the house of a woman of such high fashion and who was known to be so very nice in the choice of her company in return for so much favour she had been lavish of her assurances that she would influence miss mowbray and came home fully determined to talk to her sharply believing too that to make her feel the present dependance and uncertainty of her situation by forcing her to bear a fit of illhumour might help to determine her to embrace the affluent fortune that would set her above it this it was that occasioned her harsh address to emmeline which would have been followed by acrimonious reflections and rude remonstrances under the denomination of necessary truths and friendly advice had not the presence of fitzedward and his subsequent enchanting conversation driven all that lady montreville had said out of her mind and left it open only to the delightful prospect which his compliments and praises afforded her the company assembled to cards at the usual hour rochely was among them who had not seen emmeline since the rejection of his proposal with which sir richard crofts was obliged to acquaint him tho he had softened the peremptory terms in which it had been given he had this evening adorned himself in a superb suit of cut velvet of many colours lined with sables which tho not in the very newest mode had been reckoned very magnificent at several city assemblies and he had put it on as well in honour of lord montreville with whom he had dined as in hopes of moving the perverse beauty for whom he languished but so far was this display of clumsy affluence from having any effect on the hard heart of emmeline that it rather excited her mirth and when with a grave and solemn aspect he advanced towards her she felt herself so much disposed to laugh at his figure that she was forced to avoid him and took refuge at the table round which the younger part of the company assembled to play mrs ashwood had fixed fitzedward to that where she herself presided and where she sat triumphantly enjoying his highseasoned flattery while her female competitors hearing he was the son of an irish earl and within three of being a peer himself contemplated her supposed conquest with envy and vexation which they could not conceal and which greatly added to her satisfaction several persons were invited to stay supper among whom were fitzedward and rochely about half an hour before the cardtables broke up a servant brought a note to emmeline and told her that it required an answer the hand was delameres for two days i have forborne to see you emmeline and have endeavoured to argue myself into a calmer state of mind but it avails nothing hopeless when with you yet wretched without you i see no end to my sufferings i have been about the door all the evening but find by the carriages that you are surrounded by fools and coxcombs ah emmeline that time you owe only to me those smiles to which only i have a right are lavished on them and i am left to darkness and despair there is a door from the garden into the stableyard which opens into the fields as i can not come to the house where i find there are people who would inform lord montreville that i am still about london for pitys sake come down to that door and speak to me i ask only one moment surely you will not deny me so small a favour and add to the anguish which consumes me i write this from the neighbouring publichouse and wait your answer f delamere emmeline shuddered at this note it was more incoherent than usual and seemed to be written with a trembling and uncertain hand she had left the cardtable to read it and was alone in the antiroom where while she hesitated over it rochely whose eyes were ever in search of her followed her she saw him not but wholly occupied by the purport of the note he approached close to her unheeded are you determined miss mowbray said he to give me no other answer than you sent somewhat hastily to lord montreville by my friend sir richard crofts may i ask are you quite determined quite sir replied she starting without considering and hardly knowing what she said but feeling he was at that moment more odious to her than ever she snatched away the hand he attempted to take and flew out of the room like a lapwing the dismayed lover shook his head surveyed his cut velvet in the glass and stroaked his point ruffles while he was trying to recollect his scattered ideas emmeline who had taken refuge in her bedchamber sat there in breathless uncertainty and unable to determine what to do about delamere at length she concluded on desiring fitzedward to go down to him but knew not how to speak to the colonel on such a subject before so many witnesses nor did she like to send for him out of the room she rung for a candle and wrote on a slip of paper delamere is waiting at a door which opens into the fields and insists upon speaking to me pray go down to him and endeavour to prevail on him to return to his father i can think of no other expedient to prevent his engaging in some rash and improper attempt therefore i beseech you to go down when she had written this she knew not how to deliver it and for the first time in her life had recourse to an expedient which bore the appearance of art and dissimulation she did not chuse to send it to fitzedward by a servant but went down with it herself and approaching the table where he was settling his winnings here colonel said she is the charade you desired me to write out for you oh read it colonel pray read it cried mrs ashwood i doat upon a charade of all things in nature he answered that he would reserve it for a bon bouche after supper then looking significantly at emmeline to say he understood and would oblige her he strolled into the antiroom emmeline saying to him as he passed her that she would wait his return in the parlour below fitzedward disappeared and emmeline in hopes of escaping observation joined the party of some young ladies who were playing at a large table and affected to enter into their conversation but she really knew nothing that was passing and as soon as they rose on finishing their game she escaped in the bustle and ran down into the parlour where in five or six minutes fitzedward found her he wore a look of great concern and laid down his hat as he came in without seeming to know what he did have you seen mr delamere sir said emmeline seen him answered he i have seen him but to no manner of purpose his intellects are certainly deranged he raves like a madman and absolutely refuses to leave the place till he has spoken to you why will he not come in then said emmeline because said fitzedward rochely is here who will relate it to that meddling fellow sir richard crofts and by that means it will get to his father i said every thing likely to prevail on him to be more calm but he will hear nothing i know not what to do continued he rising and walking about the room i am convinced he has something in his head of fatal consequence to himself he protests he will stay all night where he is in short he is in an absolute frenzy with the idea of rochelys success and his own despair you frighten me to death said emmeline tell me colonel what ought i to do go to him returned fitzedward speak to him only a moment and i am persuaded he will be calm i will go with you and then there can be nothing wrong in it i will go then said she rising and giving fitzedward her hand which trembled extremely but it is very cold remarked he had not you better take a cloak there is my long pelisse in the back parlour answered she fitzedward fetched it wrapt her in it and led her down stairs and by a garden door they reached a sort of back stableyard where rubbish and stablelitter was usually thrown and which opened into a byelane where the gardenwall formed a sudden angle delamere received her with transport which he tried to check and reproached her for refusing to come down to him seizing the opportunity as soon as he would give her leave to speak she very forcibly represented to him the distress of his family at his absence and the particular uneasiness it inflicted on his sister augusta i knew not said delamere that she was come home emmeline told him she was and related the purport of her letter and again besought him to put an end to the uncertainty and anxiety of his family delamere heard her with some impatience and holding her hands in his vehemently answeredit is to no purpose that my father either threatens or persuades me he has long known my resolution and the unhappiness which you so warmly describe arises solely from his and my mothers own unreasonable and capricious prejudiceprejudice founded in pride and avarice i do not think myself accountable for distress to which they may so easily put an end but as to augusta who really loves me i will write to her to make her easy now emmeline since i have listened to you and answered all you have to urge hear my final determinationif you still continue firm in your chimerical and romantic obstinacy which you call honour i go from hence this evening never to returnyou condemn me to perpetual exileyou give me up to despair he called aloud and a postchaise and four which had been concealed by the projection of the wall attended by two servants drove round there continued delamere there is the vehicle which i have prepared to carry me from hence you know whether i easily relinquish a resolution once formed if then you wish to save my father and mother from the anguish of repentance when there will be no remedyif you desire to save from the frenzy of desperation the brother of your augusta and to snatch from the extremity of wretchedness the man who lives but to adore you go with mego with me to scotland astonished and terrified at the impetuosity with which he pressed this unexpected proposal emmeline would have replied but words were a moment wanting fitzedward taking advantage of her silence used every argument which delamere had omitted to determine her no no cried shenever never i have passed my honour to lord montreville it is sacredi can not i will not forfeit it the time will come said fitzedward believe me it will when lord montreville will not only be reconciled to you but and what shall reconcile me to myself let me go back to the house mr delamere or from this moment i shall consider you as having taken advantage of my unprotected state and even of my indiscreet confidence to offer me the grossest outrage let me go sir struggling to get her hand from fitzedward let me go mr delamere what to be driven into the arms of rochely no never emmeline never i know i am not indifferent to you i feel that i can not live without you nay by heaven i will not but if i suffer this opportunity to escape i deserve indeed to lose you they all this while approached the chaise delamere had hired servants whom he had instructed what to do they were ready at the door of the carriage emmeline attempted in vain to retreat delamere threw his arms around her and assisted by fitzedward lifted her into it with a sort of gentle violence he leaped in after her and the chaise was driven away instantly fitzedward to whom this scene was wholly unexpected returned to the company he had left with mrs ashwood he had not any notion of delameres design when he went to him but heartily concurred in its execution and tho he did not believe delamere intended to marry emmeline yet his morals were such that he congratulated himself on the share he had had in putting her into his power and went back with the air of a man vastly satisfied with the success of his exploit goodness colonel exclaimed mrs ashwood supper has been waiting for you this half hour upon my word we began to suspect that you and miss mowbray were gone together but pray where is she miss mowbray madam i really have not been so happy as to be of her party why where in the world can she be continued mrs ashwood however as the colonel is come we will go to supper the company were standing round the table i suppose miss mowbray will come presently she has a pretty romantic notion of contemplation by moonlight supper however was almost over and miss mowbray did not appear mrs ashwood engaged wholly by the gallant colonel thought not of her but rochely remarked that her absence was somewhat singular so it is i declare said miss galton do mrs ashwood send and enquire for her again the chambers the drawingroom dressingroom closets and garden were again searched miss mowbray was not to be found mrs ashwood was alarmedrochely in dismayand the whole company confusedly broke up each retiring with their several conjectures on the sudden disappearance of the fair emmeline chapter iv for some moments after emmeline found herself in the chaise astonishment and terror deprived her of speech and even of recollection while delamere no longer able to command his transports at having at length as he hoped secured her gave way to the wildest joy and congratulated himself that he had thus forced her to break a promise which only injustice he said could have extorted and only timidity and illgrounded prejudice have induced her to keep do you then hope sir said emmeline that i shall patiently become the victim of your rashness is this the respect you have sworn ever to observe towards me is this the protection you have so often told me i should find from you and is it thus you intend to atone for all the insults of your family which you have so repeatedly protested you would never forgive by inflicting a far greater insult by ruining my character by degrading me in my own eyes and forcing me either to violate my word solemnly given to your father or be looked upon as a lost and abandoned creature undone by your inhuman art i must now indeed seem to deserve your mothers anger and the scorn of your sister and must be supposed every way wretched and contemptible a shower of tears fell from her eyes and her heart seemed bursting with the pain these cruel reflections gave her delamere by all the soothing tenderness of persuasion by all the rhetoric of ardent passion tried to subdue her anger and silence her scruples but the more her mind dwelt on the circumstances of her situation the more it recoiled from the necessity of entering under such compulsion into an indissoluble engagement the rash violence of the measure which had put her in delameres power while it convinced her of his passion yet told her that a man who would hazard every thing for his own gratification now would hardly hereafter submit to any restraint and that the bonds in which he was so eager to engage would with equal violence be broken when any new face should make a new impression or when time had diminished the influence of those attractions that now enchanted him formed of the softer elements and with a mind calculated for select friendship and domestic felicity rather than for the tumult of fashionable life and the parade of titled magnificence emmeline coveted not his rank nor valued his riches no woman perhaps can help having some regard for a man who she knows ardently and sincerely loves her and emmeline had felt all that sort of weakness for delamere who in the bloom of life with fortune title person and talents that might have commanded the loveliest and most affluent daughter of prosperity had forsaken every thing for her and even secluded himself from the companions of his former pleasures and the indulgences his fortune and rank afforded him to pass his youth in unsuccessful endeavours to obtain her the partiality this consideration gave her towards him and the favourable comparison she was perpetually making between him and the men she had seen since her residence near london had created in her bosom a sentiment warmer perhaps than friendship yet it was not that violent love which carrying every thing before it leaves the mind no longer at liberty to see any fault in the beloved object or any impropriety in whatever can secure its success and which scorning future consequences risks every thing for its present indulgence still artless and ingenuous as when she first left the remote castle where she had been brought up emmeline had not been able to conceal this affection from delamere her eyes her manner the circumstance of the picture and a thousand nameless inadvertences had told it him repeatedly but now when he seemed to have taken an ungenerous advantage of that regard it lost much of its force and resentment and disdain succeeded delamere tried to appease her by protestations of inviolable respect of eternal esteem and unalterable love but there was something of triumph even in his humblest entreaties that served but to encrease the anger emmeline felt and she told him that the only way to convince her he had for her those sentiments he pretended was to carry her back immediately to mrs ashwoods or rather to lord montreville there to acknowledge the attempt he had made and that its failure had been solely owing to her determined adherence to her word delamere presuming on his ascendancy over her attempted to interest her passions rather than tranquillize her reason he represented to her how great would be her triumph when he presented her as his wife to the imperious lady montreville who had treated her with so much unmerited scorn and set her above the haughty fanny delamere who had insulted her with fancied superiority but emmeline had in her breast none of those passions that find their gratification in humbling an enemy too generous for revenge too gentle for premeditated resentment she saw these circumstances in a very different light and felt that she should be rather mortified than elated by being forced into a family who wished to reject her sir richard crofts the object of delameres hatred and detestation was the subject of those acrimonious reflections that his respect for his father and mother prevented his throwing on them the influence of this man had he said made lord montreville deaf to the voice of nature and forgetful of his own honour while he was plunged into the dark and discreditable labyrinth of political intrigue and acquired an habit of subterfuge and duplicity unworthy a nobleman a gentleman or a man emmeline cared nothing about sir richard crofts and could not enter into the bitterness of his resentment towards him nothing he had yet been able to urge had shaken her resolution not to become his wife even tho he should oblige her to go with him into scotland the ruder passions of anger and resentment had no influence over her mind while he argued with warmth or ran into reproaches emmeline found she had nothing to fear but tho he could not rouse her pride or awaken her dislike against his family but rather found them recoil on himself he hoped in that sensibility of temper and that softness of heart to which he owed all the attention she had ever shewn him he should find a sure resource in her pity an advocate for his faultin her love an inducement not only to forgive but to reward him and when he pleaded for compassion and forgiveness the heart of emmeline felt itself no longer invulnerable but against this dangerous attack she endeavoured to fortify that sensible heart by considering the probable event of her yielding to it if i marry delamere contrary to the consent of his family who shall assure me that his violent and haughty spirit will bear without anguish and regret that inferior and confined fortune to which his fathers displeasure will condemn him his love too ardent perhaps to last will decline while the inconveniences of a narrow fortune will encrease and i who shall be the cause of these inconveniences shall also be the victim he will lament the infatuation which has estranged him from his family and thrown him for some years at least out of the rank in which he has been used to appear and recovered from the delirium of love will behold with coldness perhaps with hatred her to whom he will impute his distresses to whom can i then appeal not to my own heart for it will condemn me for suffering myself to be precipitated into a measure against my judgment nor to his family who may answer thy folly be upon thine own head and i have no father no brother to console and receive me if he should drive me from him as impetuously as now he would force me to be his i shall be deprived even of the melancholy consolation of knowing i have not deserved the neglect which i fear i shall never be able to bear but if my steady refusal now induces him to return it is possible that lord montreville convinced at once of my adherence to the promise given him and of the improbability of delameres desisting may consent to receive me into his family or if the inveterate prejudice of his wife still prevents his doing so i shall surely regain his confidence and esteem he will not refuse to consider me as his brothers daughter and as such he will enable me to pass my days in easy competence with mrs stafford a prospect infinitely preferable in my eyes to the splendid visions offered me by delamere if they can not be realized but at the expence of truth and integrity confirmed in her determination by reflections like these emmeline was able to hear without betraying any symptoms of the emotion she felt the animated and passionate protestations of her lover she assumed all the coldness and reserve which his headlong and inconsiderate attempt deserved she told him that his want of respect and consideration had forfeited all the claim he might otherwise have had to her regard and esteem that she certainly would quit him the moment she was able and that tho she might not be fortunate enough to do so before they reached scotland yet it would not be in his power to compel her to be his wife delamere for some time imputed this language to sudden resentment and again by the humblest submissions sought to obtain her forgiveness and to excite her pity but having nearly exhausted her spirits by what she had already said she gave very little reply to his entreaties her silence was however more expressive than her words she took from him her hand as often as he attempted to hold it and would not suffer him to wipe away the tears that fell from her eyes while to his arguments and persuasions she coldly answered when she answered at all that she was determined and they arrived at barnet before he had obtained the smallest concession in his favour delamere had undertaken this enterprize rather in despair than from any hope of its success since he did not believe emmeline would come out to him when he requested it and had she been either alone or only with mrs ashwood she certainly had not done it chance had befriended him in collecting a room full of company and still more in sending rochely among them his abrupt approach while she read delameres note had hurried her out of her usual presence of mind and fitzedward whom mere accident had brought to mrs ashwoods house and whom she had taken with her in hopes of his influencing delamere to return to his father had contributed to her involuntary error chapter v delamere had taken no precaution to secure horses on the road and it was not till after waiting some hours that he procured four from barnet when they arrived there it was past one oclock and emmeline who had gone thro a very fatigueing day and was now overcome with the terror and alarm of being thus hastily snatched away could hardly sit up she was without an hat and having no change of cloaths urged the inconvenience she must endure by being forced to go a long journey so situated she wished to have stopped at the first stage but delamere thought that in her present temper to hesitate was to lose her he consented however to go for a moment into the house where while he gave a servant orders to go on to hatfield to bespeak four horses she drank a glass of water and then delamere intreating her to return to the chaise she complied for there was nobody visible at the inn but the maid and ostler and she saw no likelihood of any assistance had she applied for it they hastened with great expedition to stevenage but before they reached that place emmeline who had ceased either to remonstrate or complain was so entirely overwhelmed and exhausted that she could no longer support herself his fears for her health now exceeded his fears for losing her and he determined to stop for some hours but when she made an effort to leave the chaise she was unable and he was obliged to lift her out of it he then ordered the female servants to be called up recommended her to their care and entreated her to go to bed for some hours long darkness and excessive weeping had almost deprived her of sight her whole frame was sinking under the fatigue she had undergone both of body and mind and unable to struggle longer against it she lay down in her cloaths desiring one of the maids to sit by her delamere came to the door of the room to enquire how she did the woman told him what she had requested and desiring they would obey her in every thing and keep her as quiet as possible he went not to repose himself but to write to fitzedward dear george while my angelic emmeline sleeps i who am too happy to sleep myself write to desire you will go to berkleysquare and keep the good folks there from exposing themselves or making a great bustle about what has happened which they will soon know as my lord has long been prepossessed with the idea of a scottish jaunt it is very likely he may attempt to pursue us say what you will to put such plans out of his head i shall be in london again in a very short time farewell dear george yours ever f d emmeline in the mean time fell into a sleep but it was broken and interrupted her spirits had been so thoroughly discomposed that rest was driven from her she dozed a moment then suddenly started up forgot where she was and looked wildly round the room an halfformed recollection of the events of the preceding day then seemed to recur and she besought the maid who sat by her to go to mr delamere and tell him she must be directly carried to mrs staffords and having said this and sighed deeply she sunk again into short insensibility thus past the remainder of the night and before seven in the morning delamere was at the door impatient to know how she had rested the maid admitted him and told him in a low voice that the lady was in a quieter sleep than she had been the whole night he softly approached the bed and started in terror when he saw how ill she looked her cheek robbed of its bloom rested on her arm which appeared more bloodless than her cheek her hair which had been dressed without powder had escaped from the form in which it had been adjusted and half concealed her face in disordered luxuriance her lips were pale and her respiration short and laborious he stood gazing on her a moment and then shocked at these symptoms of indisposition his rapid imagination immediately magnified them all he concluded she was dying and in an agony of fear which deprived him of every other idea he took up in breathless apprehension her other hand which lay on the quilt it was hot and dry and her pulse seemed rather to flutter than to beat against his pressure his moving her hand awakened her she opened her eyes but they had lost their lustre and were turned mournfully towards him delamere said she in a low and tremulous voice delamere why is all this i believe you have destroyed me my head is so extremely painful oh delamerethis is cruelvery cruel let me go for advice cried he eagerly wretch that i am what will now become of me he ran down stairs and emmeline making an effort to recover her recollection tried to sit up but her head was so giddy and confused that it was not till after several attempts she left the bed even with the assistance of the servant she then drank a glass of water and desiring to have more air would have gone to the window but could only reach a chair near it where she sat down and throwing her arm on a table rested her head upon it in a few moments delamere returned up stairs his wild looks and quick halfformed questions explained what passed in his mind she told him faintly she was better shall i bring up a gentleman to see you who i am assured is able in his profession i fear you are very ill she answered no pray suffer him to come he will give you something to relieve your head no do not emmelinedo not i conjure you refuse me this favour he took her hand but when he found how feverish she was he started away cryingoh let him let him come he ran down stairs to fetch him and returned instantly with the apothecary a sensible wellbehaved man of fifty whose appearance indicated feeling and judgement he approached emmeline who still sat with her head reclined on the table and felt her pulse here is too much fever indeed sir said he the young lady has been greatly hurried but whatwhat is to be done sir said delamere eagerly interrupting him quiet seems absolutely necessary pardon me sir but unless i know your situation in regard to her i can not possibly advise sir said emmeline who had been silent rather from inability to contend than from unconsciousness of what was passing round herif you could prevail with mr delamere to restore me to my friends come with me sir cried delamere let me speak to you in another room when they were alone he conjured mr lawson to tell him what he thought of the lady upon my word sir she is in a very high fever and it seems to be occasioned by extreme perturbation of spirits and great fatigue forgive sir if i ask what particular circumstance has been the cause of the uneasiness under which she appears to labour if it is any little love quarrel you can not too soon adjust it delamere stopped his conjectures by telling him who he was and gave him in a few words the history of their expedition mr lawson protested to him that if she was hurried on in her present state it would be surprising if she survived the journey she shall stay here then replied delamere till she recovers her fatigue but sir enquired mr lawson after what you have told me of your father have you no apprehension of a pursuit his terror at emmelines immediate danger had obliterated for a moment every other fear it now recurred with redoubled violence he remembered that rochely was at mrs ashwoods on the evening of emmelines departure and he knew that from him sir richard crofts and consequently lord montreville would have immediate intelligence he struck his hands together exclaiming she will be every way lostlost irretrievably if my father overtakes us she will return with him and i shall see her no more he now gave way to such unbounded passion walking about the room and striking his forehead that lawson began to believe his intellects were as much deranged as the frame of the fair sufferer he had left for some moments he attended to nothing but mr lawson accustomed to make allowances for the diseases of the mind as well as those of the body did not lose his patience and at length persuaded him to be calmer by representing that he wasted in fruitless exclamation the time which might be employed in providing against the apprehended evil good god sir cried he at length what would you have me do what i would earnestly recommend sir is that you quiet the young ladys mind by telling her you will carry her whither she desires to go and at present desist from this journey which i really believe you can not prosecute but at the hazard of her life at present farther agitation may and probably will be fatal and so you advise me to let her stay till my father comes to tear her from me for ever or carry her back by the same road where it is probable he will meet me impossible impossiblebut is she really so very ill upon my life she is at this moment in a high fever why should i deceive you trust me it would in my opinion be the height of inhumanity to carry her into scotland in such a situation if you love her if i love her sir cried delamere half frantictalk not of if i love her merciful heavenyou have no idea mr lawson of what i suffer at this moment i have a perfect idea of your distress sir and wish i knew how to relieve it give me a moments time to consider if indeed the young lady could what sir speakthink of something why i was thinking that if she is better in a few hours it might be possible for you to take her to hertford where she may remain a day or two till she is able to go farther there you would be no longer in danger of pursuit and if she should grow worse which when her mind is easier i hope will not happen you will have excellent advice perhaps when the hurry of her spirits subsides she may since this has happened consent to pursue the journey to the north or if not you can from thence carry her to the friends she is so desirous of being with and avoid the risk of meeting on the road those you are so anxious to shun tho delamere could not think without extreme reluctance of relinquishing a scheme in which he had thought himself secure of success yet as there was no alternative but what would be so hazardous to the health of emmeline he was compelled to accede to any which had a probability of restoring it without putting her into the hands of his father mr lawson told him it was only fifteen miles from stevenage to hertfordbut how said he will you sir prevent your fathers following you thither if he should learn at this place that you are gone there delamere was wholly at a loss but mr lawson who seemed to be sent by his good genius saidwe must get you from hence immediately if miss mowbray is able to go you shall pass here as my visitors you shall directly go to my house and there be supplied with horses from another inn this will at least make it more difficult to trace your route and if any enquiry should be made of me i shall know what to say delamere catching at any thing that promised to secure emmeline from the pursuit of lord montreville went to her to enquire whether she was well enough to walk to mr lawsons house he found her trying to adjust her hair but her hands trembled so much it was with difficulty she could do it he desired her to dismiss the maid who was in the room then throwing himself on his knees before her and taking her burning hands in his he saidarbitress of my destinymy emmeline thou for whom only i exist be tranquili beseech you be tranquil since you determine to abide by your cruel resolution i will not i dare not persist in asking you to break it no emmeline i come only to entreat that you would quiet your too delicate mind and dispose of me as you please since you can not resolve to be mine now i will learn to submiti will try to bear any thing but the seeing you unhappy or losing you entirely tell me only that you pardon what is past and you shall go to mrs staffords or whithersoever you will emmeline beheld and heard him with astonishment but at length comprehending that he repented of his wild attempt and would go back she said hastily as she arose from her chairlet us go then delamere let us instantly go thank god your heart is changed but every hour i continue with you is an additional wound to my character and my peace she attempted to reach her cloak but could not her strength forsook her her head became more giddy she staggered and would have fallen had not delamere caught her in his arms and supported her to the chair she had left hurry not yourself thus my emmeline cried he in mercy to me try to compose yourself and spare me the sight of all this terror for which believe me you have no reason he sat down by her and drawing her gently towards him her languid head reposed on his shoulder and he contemplated in silent anguish the ravage which only a few hours severe anxiety had made on that beauteous and expressive countenance he called to the maid who waited in the next room and desired her to send up mr lawson before whose entrance a shower of tears the first she had shed for some hours a little relieved the full heart of emmeline mr lawson desired delamere would not check her tears and in a friendly and consolatory manner told her what delamere proposed to do emmeline after this explanation was still more anxious to depart but mr lawson greatly doubted whether she was able i can walk indeed i can said she if you will each lend me an arm mr lawson then gave her a few drops in a glass of water which seemed to revive her and delamere wrapping her carefully in her cloak they led her between them to a neat brick house in the town where mrs lawson a matronlike and wellbehaved woman and her daughter a genteel girl of twenty who had been apprized of emmelines situation received her with great kindness and respect breakfast was prepared for her but she could eat nothing the heaviness of her eyes her pallid countenance and the tenseness across her temples seemed to threaten the most alarming consequences mrs lawson endeavoured to persuade her to go to bed but her eagerness to be gone from thence was so great that she evidently encreased the difficulty by endeavouring to surmount it she had indeed considered that if lord montreville overtook them which was not only possible but probable all the merit of her conduct would be lostshe would appear to be carried back not by her strict adherence to her promise but by the authority of his lordship and instead of the pride and credit of a laudable and virtuous action would be liable to bear all the imputation of intentional guilt this reflection added to the sense she could not fail to have of her improper situation in being so long alone with delamere under the appearance of having voluntarily gone off with him made her so impatient to be gone that she declined any repose however necessary and mr lawson thought there was less to be feared from indulging than from opposing her lawson therefore went himself to hasten the horses and while he was absent emmeline who remained with his wife expressed so much fear that delamere might alter his intentions of returning and so much uneasiness at the thoughts of being seen at another inn in the disordered dress she now wore with a young man of delameres appearance that mrs lawson was truly concerned for her and communicated to delamere the source of the extreme anxiety she appeared to suffer he came to her and she gently reproached him for all the inconvenience and uneasiness he had brought upon her her soft complaints and the distress pictured on her speaking face he felt with a degree of anguish and selfreproach that made him happy to agree to a plan proposed by mrs lawson which was that she should be accommodated with cloaths of miss lawsons and that miss lawson herself should accompany her to hertford this latter offer emmeline eagerly accepted and delamere who saw how much it soothed and relieved her did not object to it she was therefore immediately equipped with a morning dress and her agitation of mind seemed to subside but changing her cloaths trifling as the exertion was fatigued her so much that mr lawson on his return looked very grave and delamere who watched his looks as if his existence depended upon his opinion was wild with apprehension the chaises for delamere had ordered one for himself that the ladies might suffer no inconvenience by being crouded were ready and lawson recollecting that emmeline would require a more quiet situation than an inn could afford told her that he had a sister at hertford who would receive her with pleasure and accommodate her at her house as long as she would stayand remember added he that lissy is to continue with you till you leave hertford emmeline extremely sensible of all she owed to this excellent man could only sigh her thanks and to shorten them mr lawson put her and his daughter into the travelling chaise which delamere had bought for this expedition delamere followed in another and between one and two oclock they arrived at hertford and were set down at the door of an elegant house where mrs champness the wife of a man of fortune received her niece with great affection and having heard in another room the history of the young lady she had with her immediately gave orders to have a bedchamber prepared and shewed the utmost solicitude for her accommodation delamere seeing her so well situated for the night and happy to find she bore her short journey with less increase of fatigue than he apprehended consented at her request to leave her and went to the inn where he dined and soon afterwards returned to enquire after her miss lawson came down to him and told him miss mowbray was in bed and had taken a medicine mr lawson had sent to compose her but that it was yet impossible to say much of her situation she told him he must by no means attempt to see her for the remaining part of the day and begged he would himself try to take some repose to which salutary advice delamere at length consented his haggard looks and exhausted spirits sufficiently testifying how much he wanted it chapter vi the evening on which emmeline had been so suddenly missing from the house of mrs ashwood rochely had left it in as much anguish as his nature was capable of feeling he had not for many years so seriously thought of matrimony as since he had seen miss mowbray her beauty first attracted him the natural civility of her manner was by him who had frequently met only contempt and derision from the young and beautiful construed into encouragement and though his hopes had been greatly damped by his knowledge of delameres attachment to her yet they were almost as quickly revived by the great encouragement to persevere which he had received from lord montreville he fancied that the barriers between her and delamere being insurmountable she could not fail of being dazzled by so splendid a fortune as he could himself offer her that evening she looked more than usually lovely and he determined with new ardour to pursue her but her disappearance put an end to all his brilliant visions and convinced him that his wealth on which he had so long been accustomed to value himself had failed of procuring him the favour of the only woman with whom he was disposed to share it he was too well convinced that delamere had carried her off and though deprived of all hope for himself he was too angry at the good fortune of his rival to forbear an attempt to disturb him in its possession he drove therefore from clapham to the house of sir richard crofts where he had the mortification of hearing that sir richard was gone with lord montreville to the country house of lord dornock and was not expected to return till the next day rochely aware that the only possible chance of preventing delameres marriage was by an immediate pursuit was greatly chagrined at this unavoidable delay he sat down however and with his usual laboured precision wrote to sir richard crofts informing him of what had happened this was the operation of near an hour and he then sent off a man on horseback with it who arriving at lord dornocks about three in the morning roused the family with some difficulty and delivered to sir richard the intelligence which was immediately conveyed to lord montreville who having read mr rochelys letter could not flatter himself with any hope that this alarm might be as groundless as one he had before had on the same subject the disobedience of his son the broken faith of emmeline and the rage complaints and reproaches of lady montreville all arose together in his imagination and anger vexation and regret took possession of his heart he had recourse in this as in all other emergences to sir richard crofts who advised him immediately to pursue them as soon therefore as the sleeping servants could be collected and the carriage prepared his lordship and sir richard set out for london togetherlord montreville determining to follow the fugitives as expeditiously as possible though he hoped but little success from the pursuit such was his apprehension of the clamours and passions of his wife that he could not determine to see her till he had at least done all that was possible to recover her son he therefore wrote to her a short letter stating briefly what had happened and giving her hopes that he should be able to overtake the parties before they were married this he ordered to be delivered to her in the morning and directed his servant to hasten to him with his travelling chaise and four post horses the man however who had the care of the carriages believing his lord would stay out all night had gone out also and taken with him the keys by this delay and the blunders of the affrighted servants who in their haste only impeded each other it was near nine oclock before his lordship and sir richard left london at barnet they heard of the fugitives and easily traced them from thence to hatfield after which believing all farther enquiries useless they passed through stevenage having sent on before for horses without asking any questions which might have led them to discover that delamere and emmeline had gone from thence towards hertford only an hour and an half before their arrival this was fortunate for the pursued for an enquiry would probably have led to questions which mr lawson would have found it very difficult to evade lord montreville however and sir richard hurried on to buckden where being obliged to get out for some refreshment for themselves and their servants his lordship renewed the questionat what time did a young gentleman and lady describing delamere and emmeline pass by the people told him they remembered no such persons about the time he named lord montreville then applied at the other houses and made several other enquiries but received only a general assertion that no such persons had been that way within the last four and twenty hours or even within a week sir richard crofts who piqued himself upon his sagacity told his lordship that stupidity the love of falsehood or delameres bribes might occasion this failure of intelligence but there could be no doubt of their being gratified with better information when they got to stilton to stilton therefore they went but heard exactly the same answers as they had done at the last stage sir richard was now again to seek for some plausible conjecture that might quiet the apprehensive anxiety of lord montreville who guessed and dreaded he knew not what he now said that as there could be no doubt of the young peoples having gone towards scotland from the information they had obtained at barnet and hatfield it was most likely that in the apprehension of a pursuit they had afterwards quitted the high road and were advancing to the borders of scotland across the country which must considerably lengthen and impede their journey therefore if they themselves proceeded directly to the town where these marriages are usually celebrated the probability was that they should arrive before delamere and miss mowbray and by such a circumstance the connection would be as effectually prevented as it could be by their overtaking them on the road lord montreville despairing of being able by any means to obstruct a marriage on which his son seemed to be so determined and harrassed in mind as much as he was fatigued in body suffered himself to be carried forward merely through inability to determine what he could do better and though quite hopeless of its success pursued his journey the innocent cause of all this trouble and anxiety remained in the mean time at the hospitable house of mrs champness where miss lawson attended her with all possible kindness and solicitude it was indeed impossible to be with her without loving her unless to an heart insensible like that of mrs ashwood to all but her own ideal perfections or steeled by pride like that of lady montreville a night passed in quiet sleep had greatly restored her and her fever though not gone was considerably abated every noise however trifling still made her start her nerves were by no means restored to their tone and her spirits continued to be greatly affected the idea which seemed to press most painfully on her mind was the blemish which the purity of her character must sustain by her being so long absent with delamerea blemish which she knew could hardly ever be removed but by her returning as his wife but to break her promise to lord montreville a promise so solemnly given and to be compelled into a marriage which however advantageous and fortunate it would appear under other circumstances would now bring with it a severe alloy of mortification in the displeasure of his family was a measure which she could not determine to pursue her resentment towards delamere for what was passed was not yet enough subdued by his reluctant repentance to reconcile her to the thoughts of putting herself again into his power yet she could not suppose he would suffer her to return to london alone if she had courage to attempt it or was she sure that when there mrs ashwood would receive her these reflections made her so restless and uneasy that she could not conceal their source from miss lawson who tho possessed of a very good understanding was too young and too little acquainted with the world to be able to advise her the handsome person and high rank of delamere and his violent love and concern for emmeline made her suppose it impossible that she could help returning it or be long able to resist his importunity she concluded therefore that finally it would be a match and was impressed with a sentiment that amounted almost to veneration for miss mowbray whom she considered as a prodigy of female virtue and resolution delamere had been several times to speak to miss lawson and he had pleaded the violence of his passion with so much effect that the softhearted girl became his warm advocate with emmeline and represented his tenderness and his contrition till she consented as she was now able to sit up to admit him on his entrance he said something he hardly knew what to emmeline she held out her hand to him in token of forgiveness he seized it eagerly and pressed it to his heart while he gazed on her face as if to enquire there what passed in hers remember delamere said she remember i am content to forgive your late rash and absurd attempt only on condition of your giving me the most positive assurance that you will carry me directly to mrs staffords and there leave me hard as these terms appeared after the hopes he had entertained on undertaking the journey he was forced to submit but it was evidently with reluctance i do promise then said he to take you to mrs staffords but but what asked emmeline do you not mean when you are there to exclude me for evermrs stafford is no friend of mine i have already told you mr delamere that i will see you wherever i am under certain restrictions and tho your late conduct might and indeed ought to induce me to withdraw that promise yet i now repeat it but do not believe that i will therefore be persecuted as i have been recollect that i have already been driven from mowbray castle from swansea and from mrs ashwoods wholly on your account your remedy my emmeline is to consent to inhabit a house of your own and suffer me to be the first of your servants the varying colour of her complexion to which the emotions of her mind restored for a moment the faint tints of returning health made delamere hope that her resolution was shaken and seizing with his usual vehemence on an idea so flattering he was instantly on his knees before her imploring her consent to prosecute their journey and intreating miss lawsons assistance to move her inexorable friend emmeline was too weak to bear an address of this sort the feebleness of her frame ill seconded the resolution of her mind which notwithstanding the struggles of pity and regard for delamere which she could not entirely silence was immoveably determined rallying therefore her spirits and summoning her fortitude to answer him she saidhow can you sir solicit a woman whom you wish to make your wife to break a promise so solemn as that i have given to your father could you hereafter have any dependance on one who holds her integrity so lightly and should you not with great reason suspect that with her falsehood and deception might become habitual not at all answered delamere your promise to my father is nugatory for it ought never to have been given he took an unfair advantage of your candour and your timidity and all that you said ought not to bind you since it was extorted from you by him who had no right to make such conditions what has a father no right to decide to whom he will entrust the happiness of his son and the honour of his posterity alas delamere you argue against yourself you only convince me that i ought not to put the whole happiness of my life into the hands of a man who will so readily break thro his first duties the same impatient pardon me if i say the same selfish spirit which now urges you to set paternal authority at defiance will perhaps hereafter impel you with as little difficulty to quit a wife of whom you may be weary for any other person whom caprice or novelty may dress in the perfections you now fancy i possess ah delamere shall i have a right to expect tenderness and faith from a man whom i have assisted in making his parents unhappy and who has by my means embittered the evening of their lives to whom he owes his own do you think that a rebellious and unfeeling son is likely to make a good husband a good father death and madness cried delamere relapsing into all the violence of his naturewhat do you mean by all this selfish rebellious unfeelingam i then so worthless so detestable in your eyes his extravagant expressions of passion always terrified emmeline but the paroxysm to which he now yielded alarmed her less than it did miss lawson who never having seen such frantic behaviour before thought him really mad she tremblingly besought him to sit down and be calm while the pale countenance of emmeline which she shewed him convinced him he must subdue the violence of his transports or hazard seeing her relapse into that alarming state which had forced him to relinquish his project this observation restored his senses for a momenthe besought her pardon with tears then again cursed his own folly and seemed on the point of renouncing the contrition he had just assured her he felt the scene lasted till emmeline quite overcome with it grew so faint that she said she must go to bed and then delamere again terrified at an idea which he had forgot but the moment before consented to retire if she would again repeat her forgiveness she gave him her hand languidly and in silence he kissed it and half in resentment half in sorrow left her and returned to the inn in a humour which equally unfitted him for society or solitude obliged however to remain in the latter he brooded gloomily over his disappointment and believing emmelines life no longer in danger he fancied that his fears had magnified her illness he again deprecated his folly for having consented to relinquish the prosecution of his journey and for having agreed to carry her where he feared access to her would be rendered rare and difficult by the inflexible prudence and watchful friendship of mrs stafford sometimes he formed vague projects to deceive her and carry her again towards scotland then relinquished them and formed others he passed the night however nearly without sleep and the morning found him still irresolute at eight oclock he went to the house of mrs champness and miss lawson came down to him but with a countenance in which uneasiness was so visible that delamere was almost afraid of asking how miss mowbray did she told him that she had passed a restless and uncomfortable night and that the conversation he had held the evening before had been the cause of an access of fever quite as high as the first attack and that tho she tried to conquer her weakness and affected ability to prosecute a journey for which she hourly grew more eager it was easy to see that she was as unfit for it as ever miss lawson added that if in a few hours she was not better she should send to mr lawson to come from stevenage to see her this account renewed with extreme violence all the former terrors of delamere which a few hours before he had been trying to persuade himself were groundless he now reproached himself for his thoughtless cruelty and miss lawson seized this opportunity to exhort him to be more cautious for the future which he readily and warmly protested he would be he promised never again to give way to such extravagant transports and pressed to be admitted to see emmeline but miss lawson would by no means suffer him to see her till she was more recovered from the effects of his frenzy in the afternoon he was allowed to drink tea in emmelines room and expressed his sincere concern for his indiscretion of the evening before he tried by shewing a disposition to comply with all her wishes to obliterate the memory of his former indiscretion emmeline was willing to forget the offence and pardon the offender on his renewing his promise to take her the next day towards london on her route into dorsetshire if she should be well enough to undertake the journey the spirit and fortitude of emmeline fatal as they were to his hopes commanded the respect esteem and almost the adoration of delamere while her gentleness and kindness oppressed his heart with fondness so extreme that he was equally undone by the one and the other and felt that it every hour became more and more impossible for him to live without her it was agreed that as it would be impossible to reach woodfield from hertford without stopping one night on the road they would proceed thro london to staines the first day and from thence go on early the next to the house of mrs stafford after lingering with her as long as he could delamere took his leave for the evening determined to observe the promises he had made her and never again to attempt to obtain her but by her own consent when he made these resolves he really intended to adhere to them and was confirmed in his good resolutions when he the next morning found her ready to trust herself with him calm chearful full of confidence in his promises and of gentleness and kindness towards him emmeline took an affectionate leave of her amiable acquaintance miss lawson whose uncommon kindness on so short a knowledge of her filled her heart with gratitude she promised to write to her as soon as she got to woodfield and to return the cloaths she had borrowed to which she secretly purposed adding some present to testify her sense of the civilities she had received delamere enclosed in a letter which he sent by miss lawson to her father a bank note as an acknowledgment of his extraordinary kindness they quickly arrived in london and as emmeline still remained in the resolution of avoiding a return to mrs ashwood they changed horses in piccadilly to go on tho by going to her former residence she might have escaped a longer continuation and farther journey with delamere of the impropriety of which she was very sensible yet she declined it because she knew that as her adventure might be explained several ways mrs ashwood and miss galton were very likely to put on it the construction least in her favour and she was very unwilling to be exposed to their questions and comments till she could in concert with mrs stafford and with her advice give such an account of the affair as would put it out of their power to indulge that malignity of remark at her expence of which she knew they were capable she therefore dispatched a servant to mrs ashwood with a note for her cloaths whom delamere directed to rejoin them at staines at that place they arrived early in the evening and emmeline to whom delamere had behaved with the utmost tenderness and respect bore her journey without suffering any other inconvenience than some remaining languor which was now more visible in her looks than in her spirits charmed with the thoughts of so soon seeing mrs stafford and feeling all that delight which a consciousness of rectitude inspires she was more than usually chearful and conversed with delamere with all that enchanting frankness and sweetness which made her general conversation so desireable chapter vii as they had an hour or two on their hands which emmeline wished to employ in something that might prevent delamere from entertaining her on the only subject he was ever willing to talk of when they were together she desired him to enquire for a book he went out and returned with some volumes of novels which he had borrowed of the landlords daughter of which emmeline read in some a page and in others a chapter but found nothing in any that tempted her to go regularly through the whole while she was reading delamere equally unable to occupy himself with any other object whether she was absent or present sat looking at her over the table which was between them after some time passed in this manner their supper was brought in and common conversation took place while it was passing when it was removed emmeline returned again to the books and took up one she had not before openedit was the second volume of the sorrows of werter she laid it down again with a smile sayingthat will not do for me tonight what is it cried delamere taking it from hero i have read itand if you have emmeline you might have learned the danger of trifling with violent and incurable passions tell mecould you ever be reconciled to yourself if you should be the cause of a catastrophe equally fatal still meaning to turn the conversation she answered gailyo i fancy there is very little danger of thatyou know the value of your existence too well to throw it inconsiderately away do not be too certain of that emmeline without you my life is no longer valuableif indeed it be supportable and should i ever be in the situation this melancholy tale describes how do i know that my reason would be strong enough to preserve me from equal rashness beware miss mowbraybeware of the consequence of finding an albert at woodfield it is very unlikely i should find any lover there i assure you i desire none nor have i any other wish than to pass the remainder of the winter tranquilly with my friend if then you really never wish to encourage another and if you have any sensibility for the pain i feel from uncertainty why will you not solemnly engage yourself to me by a promise which can not be broken but by mutual consent because we are both too young to form such an engagementyou are not yet quite one and twenty a time of life in which it is impossible you can be a competent judge of what will make you really happy i am more than two years younger but short as has been my knowledge of the world i have already seen two or three instances of marriages made in consequence of early engagements which have proved so little fortunate that they have determined me never to try the experiment should you bind yourself by this promise which you now think would make you easy and should you hereafter repent it which i know to be far from improbable pride obstinacy the shame of retracting your opinion would perhaps concur to prevent your withdrawing it and i should receive your hand while your heart might be attached to another the chains which you had yourself put on in opposition to the wishes of your family you would rather than own your error rivet tho your inclination prompted you to break them and we should then be both miserableno delamerelet us remain at liberty and perhaps it is impossible madam cried delamere suddenly and vehemently interrupting herit is absolutely impossible you could argue thus calmly if you had any regard for mecoldcruelinsensibleunfeeling girl oh fool fool that i am to persist in loving a woman without an heart and to be unable to tear from my soul a passion that serves only to make me perpetually wretched cursed be the hour i first indulged it and cursed the weakness of mind that can not conquer it this new instance of ungovernable temper so contrary to the promises he had given her at hertford extremely provoked emmeline who answered very gravely if you desire sir to divest yourself of this unfortunate passion the task is already half accomplished resolve then to conquer it wholly restore me to that tranquillity you have destroyedvindicate my injured reputation which your headlong ardour has blemishedgive me back to the kindness and protection of your fatherand determine to see me no more this spirited and severe answer immediately convinced delamere he had gone too far he had never before seen emmeline so much piqued and he hastened to appease her pardon meforgive me emmeline i am not master of myself when i think of losing you but you who feel not any portion of the flame that devours me can coolly argue while my heart is torn in pieces and deign not even to make any allowance for the unguarded sallies of unconquerable passionthe phrenzy of almost hopeless love sometimes when i think your coldness arises from determined and insurmountable indifferenceperhaps from dislikedespair and fury possess me would you but say that you will live only for mewould you only promise that no future rochely none of the people you have seen or may see shall influence you to forget mei should i think be easier you have a better opinion of yourself mr delamere answered emmeline calmly than to believe it probable but be that as it may i have told you that i will neither make or receive any promises of the nature you require i have already suffered too much from your extravagant passion to put it farther in your power to distress me but i shall be better able to reassume this conversation tomorrowtonight i am fatigued and it is time for us to separate and will you leave me then emmelineleave me too in anger i am not angry mr delamerehere is my hand this hand exclaimed he eagerly grasping it which ought to have been minenow even now that you are about to tear yourself from me it should have been mine for ever but i have relinquished my prize at the moment i might have secured it and if i lose it entirely my own folly only will be the cause these violent transports may terrify me but shall not alter my determination quit my hand mr delamere continued she struggling to disengage iti will not be detained she rang the bell and the waiter almost instantly entering she took a candle and went to the apartment prepared for her while delamere vexed to have commanded himself so little and to be so unable to adhere to the good resolutions he had made dared not attempt to prevent her he had now again to make his peace but would not venture to take any steps towards it that night and he retired to his own room considering how he might remain near her after she got into dorsetshire and dreading the hour of even a temporary separation the next morning emmeline impatient to be gone dressed herself early and just as she was about to go down to hasten their breakfast and departure she saw from a window that looked into the yard of the inn a phaeton and four enter it remarkable for the profusion of expensive and illfancied ornaments with which both the carriage and harness were covered in it were two gentlemen wrapped in great coats as the weather was very severe on whom emmeline casting a transient glance discovered that one of them was elkerton she was a good deal alarmed at his arrival for she had reason to fear that this man to whom she had a decided aversion would see her and know that she was travelling alone with delamere she saw him get out and give directions for putting up his horses telling the people who came out to attend him that he should breakfast and stay there some hours since his unfortunate rencontre with delamere at mrs ashwoods he had almost entirely relinquished the pursuit of emmeline he had never been able to shake off the ridicule his vanity had brought upon him and therefore had forborne to enter the circle where it had happened he had however seen miss mowbray once or twice in public and she had been too generally admired not to interest his pride in keeping up the acquaintance tho she treated him always with coldness and found it difficult to be barely civil she knew that he was severely mortified by her indifference and that in matters of scandal and gossiping no old woman could be a greater adept when therefore personal pique was added to his natural love of anecdote emmeline apprehended so much from him that she determined if possible to escape his sight to do this however was very difficult she saw him and his companion take possession of a room that had windows looking into the yard through which she must of necessity pass and where when the postchaise drew up they must see whoever got into it she wrapped herself up in her cloak pulled her hat over her eyes and holding up her handkerchief as if to guard her face from the cold she passed unobserved to the room where delamere was waiting breakfast the remembrance of his last nights behaviour was in some measure obliterated by the alarm she had felt at the sight of elkerton delamere looked melancholy and dejected emmeline speaking to him with her usual sweetness seemed to have forgotten the offence he had given her and tried to restore his good humour as if she had been the aggressor but he continued gloomy and pensive they began their breakfast and conversed on different subjects did you observe said emmeline the phaeton which drove in just now nowhat was there remarkable about it nothing but that one of the persons it contained was elkerton the poor man you made so absurd at mrs ashwoods when he boasted of knowing you i hope i shall get away without his seeing mei should extremely dislike meeting him stupid dogwhy should you care whether you meet him or no because he must think it so strange that i am here with you let himof what consequence is it to us what such a puppy thinks i can not possibly care about it but i do mr delamere said emmeline somewhat gravelyyou will recollect that i may be very much injured by the scandal such a man may circulate well well my dear emmelinewe will set out directly and you will not meet himi will order the chaise he went out for that purpose as soon as their breakfast ended but a few paces from the door was accosted by elkerton who feeling himself in point of figure equal to speak to any man addressed him with all the confident familiarity of an old acquaintance sir your most obedient humble servant your servant sir replied delamere brushing by him sir i hope you and my lord and lady montreville have been well since i had last the honour of seeing you since you oblige me sir to acknowledge the acquaintance i must remind you that our last meeting was attended with some circumstances which should make you not very desirous of recollecting it oh dear very far from not wishing to remember it i am always pleased with such agreeable badinage from my friends and some how or other contrive to be even with them prithee dear boy whither are you goingperhaps we are travelling the same road i hope not said delamere turning from him and advancing towards the bar elkerton unabashed followed him if we are continued he i think you shall take me into your postchaise i am going to pass a month with a friend in hampshire and jackman who loves driving tho he knows nothing of the matter persuaded me to use an open carriage but it is so cold that i believe i shall let him enjoy it alone the rest of the way suppose we go together if your destination is the winchester road delamere was so provoked at this forwardness that he found he should be unable to give a moderate answerhe therefore turned away without giving any pray sir said the bar maid to elkerton who is that young gentleman lord montrevilles son replied he and one of the strangest fellows in the worldsometimes we are as intimate as brothers and now you see hell hardly speak to me perhaps mr elkerton said the woman smiling the young gentleman may have very good reasons for not taking another companion in his postchaise elkerton pressed her to explain herself why you must know said she that theres a young lady with him one of the prettiest young women i ever see last night after they comed here his walet was pretty near tipsey so he come and sot down here and told me how his master had hired him to go along with em to scotland but that before they got near half way somehow or other twas settled for em to come back again but dont say as i told you mr elkerton for that would be as much as my place is worth this intelligence awakened all the curiosity of elkerton together with some hopes of being able to revenge himself on delamere for his contempt and rudeness egad cried he ill have a peep at this beauty however so saying he strutted across the yard and placed himself under a little piazza which made a covered communication between the rooms of the inn which were built round the yard and along which they were obliged to pass to get into the chaise the room door openeddelamere and emmeline appeared at it draw up postillions as close as you can cried the waiter delamere holding emmelines hand advanced but on seeing elkerton she stepped back into the room come come said delamerenever concern yourself about that impertinent fellow elkerton tho he did not distinctly hear this speech had caught a view of the person to whom it was addressed and tho her face was concealed her height and air convinced him it was miss mowbray how do you madam exclaimed he bowing and advancingmiss mowbray i hope i have the happiness of seeing you well we are in haste sir said delamere leading emmeline towards the chaise nay my good friend returned elkerton allow me i beg to pay my respects to this lady with whom i have the honour of being acquaintedmiss mowbray permit me he would have taken the hand which was disengaged but emmeline shrunk from him and stepped quickly into the chaise elkerton still advanced and leaning almost into it he saidyour long journey i hope has not too much fatigued you by heaven exclaimed delamere this is too much sir you are the most troublesome insolent fool i ever met with so saying he seized elkerton by the collar and twisting him suddenly round threw him with great violence against one of the pillars of the piazza he then got into the chaise and taking out of his pocket two or three cards on which his address was written he tossed them out of the window saying with a voice that struck terror into the overthrown knight on the groundyou know where to hear of me if you have any thing to say the chaise now drove quickly away while delamere tried to reassure emmeline who was so much terrified by the suddenness of this scuffle that she had hardly breath to reproach him for his impetuosity he answered that he had kept his temper too long with the meddling ideot and that to have overlooked such impertinence without resentment was not in his nature he tried to laugh off her apprehensions and flattered by the anxiety she felt for his safety all his gaiety and good humour seemed to return but emmeline extremely hurt to find that elkerton was informed of the journey she had taken and vexed that delamere had engaged in a quarrel the event of which if not personally dangerous to him could not fail of being prejudicial to her continued very low and uneasy the rest of their journey reflecting on nothing with pleasure but on her approaching interview with mrs stafford but this hopedfor happiness was soon converted into the most poignant uneasiness on their arrival at woodfield emmeline had the pain of hearing that mrs stafford who had two days before been delivered of a daughter had continued dangerously ill ever since the physicians who attended her had that day given them hopes that her illness might end favourably but she was still in a situation so precarious that her attendants were in great alarm as she had anxiously expected emmeline and expressed much astonishment at not having heard from her the week before which was that on which she had purposed to be with her and as she still continued earnestly to enquire for news of miss mowbray mr stafford insisted on informing her she was arrived and this intelligence seemed to give her pleasure she desired emmeline might come to her bedside but she was so weak that she could only in a faint voice express her pleasure at the sight of her and pressing her hand begged she would not leave her it was impossible emmeline could speak to her on the subject of delamere as the least emotion might have been of the most fatal consequence and tho she earnestly wished he might not have been invited to stay she was obliged to let it take its course she left her friends room no more that evening and gave her whole thoughts and attention to keeping her quiet and administering her medicines which mrs stafford seemed pleased to receive from her hands mr stafford was one of those unfortunate characters who having neither perseverance and regularity to fit them for business or taste and genius for more refined pursuits seek in every casual occurrence or childish amusement relief against the tedium of life tho married very early and tho father of a numerous family he had thrown away the time and money which should have provided for them in collecting baubles which he had repeatedly possessed and discarded till having exhausted every source that that species of idle folly offered he had been driven by the same inability to pursue proper objects into vices yet more fatal to the repose of his wife and schemes yet more destructive to the fortune of his family married to a woman who was the delight of her friends and the admiration of her acquaintance surrounded by a lovely and encreasing family and possessed of every reasonable means of happiness he dissipated that property which ought to have secured its continuance in vague and absurd projects which he neither loved or understood and his temper growing more irritable in proportion as his difficulties encreased he sometimes treated his wife with great harshness and did not seem to think it necessary even by apparent kindness and attention to excuse or soften to her his general ill conduct or his battening on the moor of low and degrading debauchery mrs stafford who had been married to him at fifteen had long been unconscious of his weakness and when time and her own excellent understanding pressed the fatal conviction too forcibly upon her she still but fruitlessly attempted to hide from others what she saw too evidently herself fear for the future fate of her children and regret to find that she had no influence over her husband together with the knowledge of connections to which she had till a few months before been a stranger had given to mrs stafford whose temper was naturally extremely chearful that air of despondence and melancholy cast of mind which emmeline had remarked with so much concern on their first acquaintance to such a man as mr stafford the arrival of delamere afforded novelty and consequently some degree of satisfaction he took it into his head to be extremely civil to him and pressed him to continue some time at his house but delamere well knew that emmeline would be made unhappy by his remaining more than one night as mr stafford entered however so warmly into his interest he begged of him to recollect whether there was not any house to be let within a few miles of woodfield mr stafford instantly named a hunting seat of sir philip carnabys which he said would exactly suit him its possessor whom some disarrangement in his affairs had obliged to go abroad for a few years had ordered it to be let ready furnished from year to year delamere went the next morning to the attorney who let it and making an agreement for it ordered in all the requisites for his immediate residence and till it was ready accepted mr staffords invitation to remain at woodfield emmeline who confined herself wholly to her friends apartment knew nothing of this arrangement till it was concluded and when she heard it remonstrance and objection were vain the illness of mrs stafford tho it did not gain ground was still very alarming and called forth to a painful excess that lively sympathy which emmeline felt for those she loved she continued to attend her with the tenderest assiduity and after five days painful suspence had the happiness to find her out of danger and well enough to hear the relation emmeline had to make of the involuntary elopement mrs stafford advised her immediately to write to lord montreville which her extreme anxiety only had occasioned her so long to delay chapter viii lord montreville and sir richard crofts after exhausting every mode of enquiry at the end of their journey without having discovered any traces of the fugitives returned to london the uncertainty of what was become of his son and concern for the fate of emmeline made his lordship more unhappy than he had yet been and the reception he met with on his return home did not contribute to relieve him he found that no intelligence had been received of delamere and lady montreville beset him with complaints and reproaches the violence of her passions had for some months subjected her to fits and the evasion of her son and her total ignorance of what was become of him had kept her in perpetual agony during lord montrevilles absence his return after so successless a journey encreased her sufferings and she was of a temper not to suffer alone but to inflict on others some part of the pain she felt herself lord montreville attempted in vain to appease and console her nothing but some satisfactory account of delamere had the least chance of succeeding and his lordship who now supposed that delamere and emmeline were concealed in the neighbourhood of london determined to persevere in every means of discovering them for this purpose he had again recourse to the crofts and sir richard and both his sons readily undertook to assist him in his search and particularly the elder undertook it with the warmest zeal this young man inherited all the cunning of his father together with a coolness of temper which supplied the place of solid understanding and quick parts since it always gave him time to see where his interest lay and steadiness to pursue it by incessant assiduity he had acquired the confidence of lady montreville to whom his attention and attendance were become almost necessary her ladyship never dreamed that a man of his rank could lift his eyes to either of her daughters and therefore encouraged his constant attendance on them both while crofts was too sensible of the value of such an alliance not to take advantage of the opportunities that were incessantly afforded him lady montreville had repeatedly declared that if delamere married emmeline all that part of the fortune which she had a right to give away should be the property of her eldest daughter this was upwards of six thousand pounds a year and whether this ever happened or not crofts knew that what was settled on younger children which must at all events be divided between the two young ladies would make either of them a fortune worth all attempts independent of the connection he would form by it with lord montreville who now began to make a very considerable figure in the political world with these views crofts had for near two years incessantly applied himself to conciliate the good opinion of the whole family with so much art that nobody suspected his designs the slight and contemptuous treatment he had always received from delamere he had affected to pass by with the calm magnanimity of a veteran statesman and emulating the decided conduct and steady indifference of age rather than yielding to the warmth of temper natural to five and twenty he was considered as a very rising and promising young man by the grave politicians with whom he associated and by those of his own age a supercilious and solemn coxcomb he had studied the characters of the two miss delameres and found that of the eldest the fittest for his purpose tho the person of the youngest and the pride which encased the heart of the other would have made a less able politician decide for augusta but he saw that the very pride which seemed an impediment to his hopes might under proper management contribute to their success he saw that she really loved nobody but herself that her personal vanity was greater than the pride of her rank and that her heart was certainly on that side assailable he therefore by distant hints and sighs affected concealment and artful speeches gave her to understand that all his prudence had not been able to defend him from the indiscretion of a hopeless passion while he was contented to call it hopeless miss delamere tho long partial to fitzedward could not refuse herself the indulgence of hearing it and at length grew so accustomed to allow him to talk to her of his unbounded and despairing love that she found it very disagreeable to be without him he saw that unless a title and great estate crossed his path his success tho it might be slow was almost certain but he was obliged to proceed with caution notwithstanding he would have been very glad to have secured his prize before the return of delamere to his family threw an obstacle in his way which was the most formidable he had to contend with he affected however the utmost anxiety to discover him and recited to lord montreville an exhortation he intended to pronounce to him if he should be fortunate enough to do so nothing could be a greater proof of his lordships opinion of crofts than his entrusting him with a commission which if successful could hardly fail of irritating the fiery and ungovernable temper of delamere and driving him into excesses which it would require all the philosophic steadiness of crofts to support without resentment while sir richard and his two sons therefore set about the difficult task of finding delamere lord montreville went himself to fitzedward but heard that for many days he had not been at his apartments that he had taken no servants with him and that they knew not whither he was gone or when he would return lord montreville who had depended more on the information of fitzedward than any other he hoped to obtain left a note at his lodgings desiring to see him as soon as he came to town and went back in encreased uneasiness to his own house but among the numberless letters which lay on his library table the directions of which he hastily read in a faint hope of news of delamere he saw one directed by the hand of emmeline he tore it eagerly openit contained an account of all that had happened written with such clearness and simplicity as immediately impressed its truth and it is difficult to say whether lord montrevilles pleasure at finding his son still unmarried or his admiration at the greatness of his nieces mind were the predominant emotion when the former sentiment a little subsided and he had time to reflect on all the heroism of her conduct he was almost ashamed of the long opposition he had given to his sons passion and would if he had not known his wifes prejudices invincible have acknowledged that neither the possession of birth or fortune could make any amends to him who saw and knew how to value the beauty of such a mind as that of emmeline the inveterate aversion and insurmountable pride of lady montreville he had no hope of conquering and she had too much in her power to suffer his lordship to think of delameres losing such a large portion of his inheritance by disobeying her for these reasons he checked the inclination he felt rising in his own heart to reward and receive his niece and thought only of taking advantage of her integrity to separate his son from her for ever he went with the letter in his hand to lady montrevilles apartment where he found mr crofts and the two young ladies he read it to them and when he had finished it expressed in the warmest terms his approbation of miss mowbrays conduct lady montreville testified nothing but satisfaction at what she called the foolish boys escape from ruin without having the generosity to applaud her whose integrity was so much the object of admiration possessing neither candour nor generosity herself she was incapable of loving those qualities in another and in answer to lord montrevilles praises of emmeline which she heard with reluctance she was not ashamed to say that perhaps were the whole truth known his lordship would find but little reason to set up his relations character higher than that of his own childrento which her eldest daughter addedwhy to be sure madam there is as my father says something very extraordinary in miss mowbrays refusing such a matchthat is if she has no other attachment augusta delamere heard all that her father said in commendation of her beloved emmeline with eyes suffused with tears which drew on her the anger of her mother and the malignant sneers of her sister the two young ladies however were sent away while a council was held between lord and lady montreville and crofts on what steps it was immediately necessary to take several ideas were started but none which his lordship approved he determined therefore to write to his son with whose residence at tylehurst the house of sir philip carnaby emmelines letter acquainted him and wait his answer before he proceeded farther with this resolution lady montreville was extremely discontented and proposed as the only plan on which they could depend that his lordship under pretence of placing her properly should send emmeline to france and there confine her till delamere hopeless of regaining her should consent to marry miss otley her ladyship urgedthat it could not possibly do the girl any harm and that very worthy people had not scrupled to commit much more violent actions where their motive was right tho less strong than that which would in this case actuate lord montreville which was she said to save the sole remaining heir of a noble house from a degrading and beggarly alliance hold madam cried lord montreville who was extremely displeased at the proposal and with the speech with which it closedremember i beg of you that when you speak of the mowbray family you speak of one very little if at all inferior to your own nor should you lady montreville forget in the heat of your resentment that you are a womana woman too whose birth should at least give you a liberal mind and put you above thinking of an action as unfeminine as inhuman surely as a mother who have daughters of your own you should have some feeling for this young woman not at all their inferior but in being born under circumstances for which she is not to blame and which mark with sufficient unhappiness a life that might otherwise have done as much honour to my family as i hope your daughters will do to yours the slightest contradiction was what lady montreville had never been accustomed to bear patiently the asperity therefore of this speech and the total rejection of her project threw her into an agony of passion which ended in an hysteric fit lord montreville less moved than usual committed her to the care of her daughters and women and continued to talk coolly to crofts on the subject they were before discussing after considering it in every point of view he determined to leave delamere at present to his own reflections only writing to him a calm and expostulatory letter such as together with emmelines steadiness on which he now relied with the utmost confidence might he thought effect more than violent measures his lordship wrote also to emmeline strongly expressing his admiration and regard and his confidence and esteem encreased her desire to deserve them mrs stafford was now nearly recovered and delamere settled at his new house where he always returned at night tho he passed almost every day at woodfield his mornings were often occupied in those amusements of which he had been so fond before his passion for emmeline became the only business of his life and secure of seeing her continually and of telling how he loved her he became more reasonable than he had hitherto been the letters however which now arrived from lord montreville a little disturbed his felicity they gave emmeline an opportunity to exhort him to return to londonto make his peace with his father and quiet the uneasiness of lady montreville which his lordship represented as excessive and as fatal to her health as to the peace of the whole family emmeline urged him by every tie of duty and affection to relieve the anxiety of his family and particularly to attend to the effect his absence and disobedience had on the constitution of his mother which had long been extremely shaken but to all her remonstrances he answeredthat he would not return till lady montreville would promise never to renew those reflections and reproaches which had driven him from audleyhall and to which he apprehended he should now be more than ever exposed as emmeline could not pretend to procure such an engagement from her ladyship all she could do was to inform lord montreville of his objection and to leave it to him to make terms between delamere and his mother near a month had now elapsed since emmelines arrival at woodfield and the returning serenity of her mind had restored to her countenance all its bloom and brilliancy she had indeed no other uneasiness than what arose from her anxiety to procure quiet to her uncles family and from her observations on the encreasing melancholy of mrs stafford for which she knew too well how to account even this however often appeared alleviated by her presence and forgotten in her conversation and she rejoiced in the power of affording a temporary relief to the sorrows of one whom she so truly loved this calm was interrupted by elkerton by whom the affront he had received at staines from delamere had not been forgotten tho he by no means relished the thoughts of resenting it in the way his friend jackman and all who heard of it proposed to risk his life and all his finery seemed a most cruel condition but jackman protested there was no other by which he could retrieve his honour and his friend at whose house he was on the borders of hampshire who had been an officer in the military service of the east india company and had acquired a princely fortune felt himself inspired with all the punctilios of a soldier and declared to elkerton that if he put up with this affront no man of honour could hereafter speak to him poor elkerton who in the article of fighting as well as many others extremely resembled le bourgeois gentilhomme made all the evasions in his power while his soi disant friends who enjoyed his distress persisted in pushing him on to demand satisfaction of delamere but after long debates he determined first to ask him for an apology there was he thought some hope of obtaining it if not he could only in the last extremity have recourse to the desperate expedient of a challenge he wrote therefore a letter to delamere requesting in the civilest and mildest terms an apology for his behaviour at staines and sent it by a servant as it was not more than twenty miles from the house where he was to that mr delamere had taken delamere returned a contemptuous refusal but neither mentioned the letter to emmeline nor thought again about its writer the unfortunate elkerton who reproached incessantly his evil stars for having thrown this hotheaded boy in his way could not conceal from his friends the unaccommodating answer he had received to his pacific overture and it was agreed that elkerton must either determine to fight him or be excluded from good company for ever the challenge therefore penned by the asiatic hero was copied with a trembling hand by elkerton and jackman who had offered to be his second set out with him for the town near tylehurst on their arrival jackman took a postchaise to carry the billet to delamere leaving the terrified elkerton to settle all his affairs both temporal and spiritual against the next morning when delamere was appointed to meet him on a heath near the town at seven oclock jackman found delamere with fitzedward who had arrived there that day he delivered his letter and delamere immediately answered it by saying he would not fail to attend the appointment with his friend colonel fitzedward during jackmans absence elkerton tried to argue himself into a state of mind fit for the undertaking of the next day but he found no arguments gave him any sort of satisfaction save two one was that as most disputes ended with firing a brace of pistols in the air the probability was that he should be as fortunate as othersthe second that if the worst should happen he should at least make a paragraph worth some hazard and that whether he killed delamere or fell himself an affair of honour with a young man of his rank would extremely contribute to his fame neither of these reflections however had force enough to prevent his heartily wishing there was no necessity to employ them and he contrived to make such a bustle with his servant about his pistols and sent forth so many enquiries for an able surgeon that it was known immediately at the inn where he was that the gentleman was come to fight young squire delamere in a country town such intelligence soon gained ground and before jackmans return every shop in it had settled the place and manner of the combat one of mr staffords servants was at the inn which was also the post house where the landlady failed not to tell him what a bloodyminded man was in the next room the servant who like all people of his station delighted in the wonderful and the terrible collected all the particulars which he retailed on his arrival at home with every exaggeration his invention would lend him chapter ix the maid who waited on emmeline had no sooner heard these particulars than conceiving her to be more interested in the fate of delamere than any other person she ran up to tell her of it and tho she had not retained the name of elkerton perfectly emmeline who instantly recollected the adventure at staines saw the truth at once and was terrified at the impending event to a degree that made her for a moment incapable of reflection to be however remotely or however innocently the cause of any mans hazarding his life was shocking to all her feelings but to suppose that lord montreville might be made by her means the most wretched of human beings by the loss of an only and beloved son was an idea which froze her blood her regard for delamere which was the affection of a sister somewhat heightened perhaps by his persevering preference of herself her friendship for augusta and her anxiety for the peace of his whole family added to her general tenderness of heart all cooperated to distress her on this occasion as soon as she could recollect what was best to be done she sought mr stafford to whom she related what she had heard which the servant who had brought the intelligence repeated before him mr stafford at emmelines earnest request set out for the house of delamere who had not that day been at woodfield because he expected fitzedward mr stafford delivered to him a pressing entreaty from emmeline that he would forbear to meet elkerton or at least delay it till she could speak to him but delamere shewing stafford the letter he had received desired him to go back and make emmeline easy as well as he could since to comply with her request was entirely out of his power to the necessity of his meeting elkerton stafford assented and returned home to relate the little success of his embassy while the terror and alarm of emmeline were only encreased by his visit such was her anxiety that she would have gone herself to tylehurst if mrs stafford had not represented to her that it would be certainly improper and probably ineffectual she passed a sleepless night tormenting herself with a thousand imaginary modes of misery which might arise from the meeting of the next day but while she continued to form and reject projects for preventing it seven oclock passed and the rencontre ended without bloodshed the cautious valour of elkerton having been so loud that a magistrate who lived in the town and who was well known to lord montreville had heard of it and with a party of constables had followed elkerton at some distance they concealed themselves by the justices order in a gravelpit near the place of combat and there saw the ground already possessed by delamere and fitzedward the trembling challenger with a face as pale as if delameres pistol had already done its worst followed by jackman on whose undaunted countenance he cast a rueful and imploring look then rode slowly up punctual to the time the usual ceremonies passed elkertons blood seemed to be all gone to his heart to encourage it to be stout and his knees which trembled most piteously appeared to resent the desertion he cast round the heath a hopeless lookno succour approached the ground was measured each took their post and his trembling encreased so violently that delamere apprehended very little from a pistol in so unsteady a hand but had he apprehended more he was of a temper to receive it unshrinkingly the moment to fire now arrived and elkerton while cocking his pistol saw the possé rise out of the gravelpit but he was too far gone to be sensible of the seasonable relief therefore without knowing what he was about he fired his pistol before they could seize his arm and then stood like a statue nearly insensible of the happiness of his deliverance the justice advancing himself on horseback now put both the gentlemen under arrest and elkerton seeing himself at length safe for the present thought he might venture to insist on standing mr delameres fire the more the worthy justice opposed it the more vehement he grew but delamere who despised him too much to be really angry with him went off the field telling elkerton that any other time when there were fewer witnesses he would give him what further satisfaction he might require he gave his honour to the justice that he would trouble himself no farther about the affair and elkerton having given jackmans bail for his present pacific intentions was suffered to go also he returned to the house of his east indian friend exulting secretly in his escape and openly in his valour to which latter jackman did not bear testimony so warmly as he thought friendship required determined however to lose no part of the glory which he thought he had dearly purchased by being frightened out of his wits he wrote in the form of a letter a most tremendous account of the duel to the daily papers in which he described all its imaginary horrors and ended with asserting very roundly that mr elkerton had the misfortune dangerously to wound the hon frederic delamere and when this account came away there were no hopes of his recovery having secured himself a fame at least for two or three days he set out for london to enjoy it never reflecting on any other consequences than those most flattering to his ridiculous vanity he knew he should be talked of and by representing what had not happened have a fair opportunity of telling what had in his own way when emmeline who had never ceased walking about and listening saw delamere and fitzedward riding quietly across the lawn which led to the house she ran eagerly down to meet them but the idea that elkerton might possibly be killed checked her joy and when they came up to her breathless agitation prevented her asking what she wanted to know delamere who saw her so pale and terrified threw himself instantly off his horse and caught her in his arms has no harm happened mr delamere none in the world my emmeline nobody is hurt so much as you are tho poor elkerton was almost as much frightened come pray compose yourselfyou have not yet the glory to boast of having a life lost about you heaven forbid that i ever should answered shei am grateful that there has been no mischiefoh if i could describe what i have suffered surely you would never terrify me so again she could not restrain her tears delamere led her into the house where while mrs stafford gave her hartshorn and water delamere at her request related exactly what had happened and having given emmeline his honour that he would think no more of the affair if elkerton did not the tranquillity of the house seemed to be restored and delamere and fitzedward were invited to dinner where great alteration in the looks of the latter was remarked by both the ladies nor was it in looks only that fitzedward was extremely changedhis chearfulness was quite gone he appeared to be ineffectually struggling with some unconquerable uneasiness and tho his soft and insinuating manners were the same he no longer sought by a thousand agreeable sallies and lively anecdotes to entertain or whatever attempt he made was so evidently forced that it lost its success remarkable for his temperance at table for which he had often endured the ridicule of his companions he now seemed to fly to the bottle against his inclination as if in hopes to procure himself a temporary supply of spirits every day after that on which emmeline and mrs stafford made this remark its justice was more evident while delamere was in the fields fitzedward would sit whole mornings with mrs stafford and emmeline leaning on their worktable or looking over emmeline busied with her pencil had his marked attention to mrs stafford continued she would have seen his behaviour with great alarm but he no longer paid her those oblique yet expressive compliments of which he used to be so lavish it seemed as if occupied by some other object he still admired and revered her and wished to make her the confidant of the sorrow that oppressed him if they were accidentally alone he appeared on the point of telling her then suddenly checking himself he changed the discourse or abruptly left her and as he was a man whom it was impossible to know without receiving some impressions in his favour she felt as well as emmeline a pity for him which they wished to be justified in feeling by hearing that whatever was the cause of his unhappiness he had not brought it on himself by any crime that would make their regard for him blameablefor emmeline tho she knew that it was with no good design he had contributed to delameres getting her off yet could not persuade herself to hate him for it when he not only humbly solicited her forgiveness but protested that he was truly rejoiced as well as astonished at her steadiness and good conduct and would be so far from encouraging any such attempt for the future that he would be the first to call delamere to an account could he suppose he harboured intentions which he now considered as ungenerous and criminal these declarations had made his peace both with emmeline and her friend and his languid and sentimental conversation tho it made him less entertaining did not make him less interesting to either of them mr stafford ever in pursuit of some wild scheme was now gone for a few days into another county to make himself acquainted with the process of manuring land with old wigsa mode of agriculture on which mr headly had lately written a treatise so convincing that mr stafford was determined to adopt it on his own farm as soon as a sufficient number of wigs could be procured for the purpose during this absence and on the fourth day after elkertons exploit a stormy morning had driven delamere from the fields who went into mrs staffords dressingroom where he found fitzedward reading cecilia to mrs stafford and miss mowbray while they sat at work mrs stafford had her two little boys at her feet and when delamere appeared she desired him to take a chair quietly and not disturb so sober a party but he had not been seated five minutes before the children who were extremely fond of him crept to him and he began to play with them and to make such a noise that mrs stafford laughingly threatened to send all the riotous boys into the nursery togetherwhen at that moment millefleur who had some time before come down to attend his master entered the room with a letter which he said came express from berkleysquare delamere saw that his fathers hand had almost illegibly directed it he opened it in fearful haste and read these words before this meets you your mother will probably be no more a paragraph in the newspaper in which you are said to have been killed in a duel threw her into convulsions i satisfied myself of your safety by seeing the man with whom you fought but your mother is incapable of hearing it unhappy boy if you would see her alive come away instantly montreville berkleysquare feb it is impossible to say whether the consternation of emmeline or that of delamere was the greatest by the dreadful idea of having occasioned his mothers death every other was for a moment absorbed he flew without speaking down stairs and into the stable where he had left his horse but the groom had carried the horse to his own stables supposing his master would stay till night without recollecting that he might take one of mr staffords he ran back into the room where emmeline was weeping in the arms of her friend and clasping her wildly to his bosom he exclaimedfarewell emmeline farewell perhaps for ever if i lose my mother i shall never forgive myself and shall be a wretch unworthy of you dearest mrs stafford take care i beseech you of her whatever becomes of me having said this he ran away again without his hat and darted across the lawn towards his own house meaning to go thither on foot but fitzedward with more presence of mind was directing two of mr staffords horses to be saddled with which he soon overtook delamere and proceeding together to the town they got into a postchaise and went as expeditiously as four horses could take them towards london equally impetuous in all his feelings his grief at the supposed misfortune was as violent as it could have been had he been sure that the worst had already happened he now remembered with infinite selfreproach how much uneasiness and distress he had occasioned to lady montreville since he left her in november at audleyhall without taking leaveand recollecting all her tenderness and affection for him from the earliest dawn of his memory her solicitude in his sickness when she had attended him herself and given up her rest and health to contribute to his her partial fondness which saw merit even in his errors her perpetual and ardent anxiety for what she believed would secure his happinesshe set in opposition to it his own neglect impatience and disobedience and called himself an unnatural and ungrateful monster fitzedward could hardly restrain his extravagant ravings during the journey which having performed as expeditiously as possible they arrived in berkleysquare where when the porter opened the door to them delamere had not courage to ask how his mother did but on fitzedwards enquiry the porter told them she was alive and not worse relieved by this account delamere sent to his father to know if he might wait upon him his lordship answeredthat he would only see colonel fitzedward but that delamere might come in to wait till his mothers physicians arrived lord montreville was indeed so irritated against delamere by all the trouble and anxiety he had suffered on his account that he determined to shew his resentment and in this resolution he was encouraged by sir richard crofts who represented to him that his mothers danger and his fathers displeasure might together work upon his mind and induce him to renounce an attachment which occasioned to them both so much unhappiness it was in this hope that his lordship refused to see his son and while fitzedward went to him delamere was shewn into another room where his youngest sister immediately came to him she received him with rapture mingled with tears and related to him the nature of his mothers illness which had seized her two days before on her unfortunately taking up a newspaper from the breakfasttable where it was very confidently said that he was mortally wounded in a duel with a person named elkerton of portlandplace that lord montreville had luckily had a letter from fitzedward the day before whom he had forgiven the part he took in regard to emmeline on no other condition than that he should go down to him and give his lordship an account of his conduct and that therefore he was less alarmed tho very much hurried by the paragraph he had however gone to elkertons house where he found him very composedly receiving the enquiries of his friends and where he insisted on hearing exactly what had happened his lordship immediately returned to his wife but the convulsions had arisen to so alarming an height that she was no longer capable of hearing him and she had ever since continued to have at very short intervals such dreadful fits as had entirely contracted her left side and left very little hope of her recovery delamere was extremely shocked at this account and after waiting some time fitzedward came to him and told him that his father was extremely angry and absolutely refused to see him or hear his apology unless he would first give his honour that if lady montreville should survive the illness his indiscreet rashness had brought upon her he would as soon as she was out of danger go abroad and remain there till he should obtain forgiveness for his past errors and leave to return the heart of delamere was accessible only by the avenues of affection and kindness compulsion and threats only made him more resolutely persist in any favourite project sir richard crofts therefore who had advised this measure shewed but little knowledge of his temper and never was more mistaken in his politics delamere no sooner heard the message than he knew with whom it originated and full of indignation at finding his father governed by a man for whom he felt only aversion and contempt he answered with great asperitythat he came thither not to solicit any favour but to see his mother that he would not be dictated to by the crofts but would remain in town till he knew whether his mother desired to see him and be ready to wait on his father when he would vouchsafe to treat him as his son he then shook hands with fitzedward kissed his sister and walked out of the house in spite of their united endeavours to detain him all they could obtain of him was his consent to go to fitzedwards lodgings as he had none of his own ready from whence he sent constantly every hour to enquire after lady montreville chapter x emmeline in the mean time remained in great uneasiness at woodfield delamere on his first arrival in town wrote a short and confused note by which she only learned that lady montreville was alive after some days she received the following letter from augusta delamere i will now try my dearest emmeline to give you an account of what has passed here since my brothers arrival my mother is happily better knows every body and speaks more distinctly her fits return less frequently and upon the whole the physicians give us hopes of her recovery but very little that she will ever be restored to the use of the arm which is contracted on friday in an interval of her fits sir hugh cathcart and dr gardner her physicians proposed that she should see my brother of whose being living nothing we could any of us say could convince her she repeated to dr gardner who staid with her after the other went that she was deceived he assured her that she was deceived in nothing but in her sudden and unhappy prepossession for that mr delamere had never been in the least danger and was actually in perfect health he is alive cried my mother mournfullyi thank god he is alive but he knows my illness and i do not see himah it is too certain i have lost my son you have not been able to see him my dear madam but he came up as soon as he heard of your situation and now waits your commands at colonel fitzedwards lodgingsdo you wish to see him i do i do wish to see him oh let him come the agitation of her mind however brought on almost instantly a return of the disorder and before my brothers arrival she was insensible her distorted features her hands contracted her eyes glazed and fixed her livid complexion and the agonizing expression of her countenance were at their height when delamere was desired to go into the room my father believed that the sight of his mother in such a situation could not but affect the feelings of her son it did indeed affect him he stood a moment looking at her in silent terror then as if suddenly recollecting that he had been the cause of this dreadful alteration he turned away clasped his hands together and burst into tears my mother neither saw him or heard his loud sobs my sister looked at him reproachfully and apparently to escape from her he came to me and taking my hand kissed it and asked how long this melancholy scene would last the physician who heard the question said the fit was going off it did so in a few minutes she sighed deeply and seeing the doctor still sitting by her she asked if he would still perform his promise and let her see her son at these words delamere stepped forward and threw himself on his knees by the bed side he wept aloud and eagerly kissed his mothers hands which he bathed in tears she looked at him with an expression to which no description can do justice but unable to speak she seemed struggling to explain herself and the physician fearful of such agitation saidthere madam is mr delamere not only alive but willing i am persuaded to give you in regard to his future conduct any assurances that you require to tranquillise your mind no said she sighingthat delamere is living i thank heavenbut for the resti have no hopes for the rest resumed the doctor he will promise any thing if you will only make yourself easy at this moment my lord enteredyou see sir said he sternly to delamere whom he had not seen since his arrival in londonyou see to what extremity your madness has reduced your mother delamere still on his knees looked sorrowfully up as if to enquire what reparation he could make my father appearing to understand the question saidif you would not be indeed a parricide shew lady montreville that you have a sense of your errors and will give her no farther uneasiness do frederic cried my sister in what way sir said my brother very mournfully tell her you will consent to fulfil all her wishes sir said delamere firmly if to sacrifice my own life would restore my mothers i would not hesitate but if what your lordship means relates to miss otley it is absolutely out of my power he is already married i doubt not sighed my mother upon my soul i am not come come cried dr gardner this is going a great deal too far your ladyship is but just convinced your son is living and my lord here is already talking of other matters tell me madamwhat do you wish mr delamere to say that he will not marry eagerly interrupted my father but with his mothers consent and mine i will not my lord said delamere sighing that as soon as lady montreville is well enough to allow you to leave her you will go abroad for a twelvemonth or longer if i shall judge it expedient i will promise that if your lordship makes a point of itif my mother insists upon it but my lord if at the end of that time emmeline mowbray is still singlemy lord you do not expect unconditional submissioni shall then in my turn hope that you and my mother will make no farther opposition to my wishes my father who expected no concession from delamere had at first asked of him more than he intended to insist on and now appeared eager to close with the first terms he could obtain accepting therefore a delay instead of a renunciation he saidwell delamere if at the end of a twelvemonth you still insist on marrying miss mowbray i will not oppose it lady montreville you hear what your son engages for do you agree to the terms my mother said very faintlyyes the promise was repeated on both sides before the physician and fitzedward who came in at the latter part of this scene my mother seemed reluctantly to accede complained of extreme faintness and the scene beginning to grow fatiguing to her my brother offered to retire she gave him her hand which he kissed and at her desire consented to return to the apartments here which he used to occupy my mother had that evening another attack tho it was much less severe but as the contraction does not give way to any remedies yet used the physicians propose sending her to bath as soon as she is able to bear the journey thus my dearest emmeline i have punctually related all you appear so anxious to know on which i leave you to reflect my mother now sees my brother every day but he has desired that nothing may be said of the past and their conversations are short and melancholy fitzedward has left london and frederic told me last night that as soon as the physicians pronounce my mother entirely out of danger he shall go down to you ah my lovely friend what a trial will his be but i know you will encourage and support him in the task however painful of fulfilling the promise he has given and my father who praises you incessantly says he is sure of it adieu my dear miss mowbray your affectionate and attached augusta delamere berkleysquare march a few days after the receipt of this letter delamere went down to tylehurst dejection was visibly marked in his air and countenance and all that emmeline could say to strengthen his resolution served only to make him feel greater reluctance to quit her for twelve months to leave her exposed to the solicitation of rivals who would not fail to surround her and to hazard losing her for ever seemed so terrible to his imagination that the nearer the period of his promised departure grew the more impossible he thought it to depart his ardent imagination seemed to be employed only in figuring the variety of circumstances which might in that interval arise to separate them for ever and he magnified these possibilities till he persuaded himself that nothing but a private marriage could secure her as he saw how anxious she was that he should strictly adhere to the promises he had given his father he thought that he might induce her to consent to this expedient as the only one by which he could reconcile his duty and his love he therefore took an opportunity when he had by the bitterness of his complaints softened her into tears to entreat to implore her to consent to marry him before he went he urged that as lord and lady montreville had both consented to their union at the end of the year if he remained in the same mind it made in fact no difference to them because he was very sure that his inclinations would not change and no doubt could arise but from herself if therefore she determined then to be his she might as well consent to become so immediately as to hazard the difficulties which might arise to their marriage hereafter emmeline tho extremely affected by his sorrow had still resolution enough to treat this argument as feeble sophistry unworthy of him and of herself and positively to refuse her consent to an engagement which militated against all her assurances to lord montreville this decisive rejection of a plan to which from the tender pity she testified he believed he should persuade her to assent threw him into one of those transports of agonizing passion which he could neither conceal or contend with he wept he raved like a madman he swore he would return to his father and revoke his promise and the endeavours of mrs stafford and emmeline to calm his mind seemed only to encrease the emotions with which it was torn after having exhausted every mode of persuasion in vain he was obliged to relinquish the hope of a secret marriage and to attempt to obtain another concession in which he at length succeeded he told emmeline that if she had no wish to quit him entirely but really meant to reward his long and ardent affection she could not object to bind herself to become his wife immediately on his return to england emmeline made every objection she could to this request but she only objected for she saw him so hurt that she had not the resolution to wound him anew by a positive refusal mrs stafford too moved by his grief and despair no longer supported her in her reserve and as their steadiness seemed to give way his eagerness and importunity encreased till they allowed him to draw up a promise in these wordsat the end of the term prescribed by lord montreville emmeline mowbray hereby promises to become the wife of frederic delamere this emmeline signed with a reluctant and trembling hand for tho she had an habitual friendship and affection for delamere and preferred him to all the men she had yet seen she thought this not strictly right and felt a pain and repugnance to its performance which made her more unhappy the longer she reflected on it on delamere however it had a contrary effect tho he still continued greatly depressed at the thoughts of their approaching separation he yet assumed some degree of courage to bear it and when the day arrived he bid her adieu without relapsing into those agonies he had suffered before at the mere idea of it he carried with him a miniature picture of her and entreated her to answer his letters which on the footing they now were she could not refuse to promise he then tore himself from her and went to take leave of his mother who still continued ill at bath and from thence to london to bid farewel to his father after which fitzedward accompanied him as far as harwich where he embarked for holland as he had before been the usual tour of france and italy he purposed passing the summer in visiting germany and the winter at vienna and early in the spring to set out thro france on his way home where he purposed being on the th of march when the year which he had promised his father to pass abroad would expire lord montreville by obtaining this delay thought there was every probability that his attachment to emmeline would be conquered and his lordship as well as lady montreville determined to try in the interval to procure for emmeline some unexceptionable marriage which it would not be possible for her to refuse they imagined therefore that their uneasiness on this head was over and lady montreville whose mind was greatly relieved by the persuasion was long since out of all danger from the fits which had so severely attacked her but the contraction of her joints which they had occasioned was still so painful and obstinate that the physicians seemed to apprehend it might be necessary to send her ladyship to the waters of barege in the mean time lord montreville had obtained a post in administration which encreased his income and his power sir richard crofts possessed a lucrative employment in the same department and his eldest son was become extremely necessary from his assiduity and attention to business and more than ever a favourite with all lord montrevilles family with whom he almost entirely lived a lurking penchant for fitzedward which had grown up from her earliest recollection almost insensibly in the bosom of miss delamere had been long chilled by his evident neglect and indifference she now fancied she hated him and really preferred crofts every way inferior as he was while the want of high birth and a title which she had been taught to consider as absolutely requisite to happiness made her repress every tendency to a serious engagement she was extremely gratified by his flattery and when among other young women from whom he affected not to be able to stifle his unhappy passion she was frequently told how much he was in love with her she was accustomed to answerah poor fellow so he is and i heartily pity him but while lord and lady montreville thought croftss attendance on their daughters quite without consequence he and his father insinuated an intended connection between him and one of them with so much art that tho it never reached the ears of the family it was universally believed in the world a young nobleman who had passed the greater part of his life in the army where he had lately signalized himself by his bravery and conduct now returned to england on being promoted to a regiment and having some business to transact with lord montreville in his official capacity he was invited to the house and greatly admired both the miss delameres whose parties he now joined at bath crofts soon afterwards obtaining a short respite from his political engagement went thither also and tho miss delamere really thought lord westhaven quite unexceptionable she had been so habituated to behave particularly to crofts that she could not now alter it or perhaps was not conscious of the familiar footing on which she allowed him to be with her lord westhaven who had at first hesitated between the sprightly dignity of the elder sister and the soft and more bewitching graces of the younger no sooner saw the conduct of miss delamere towards crofts than his doubts were at an end her faults of temper had been hitherto concealed from him and he believed her heart as good as her sisters indeed according to the sentimental turn her discourse frequently took he might have supposed it more refined and sublime but when he observed her behaviour to crofts he thought that she must either be secretly engaged to him or be a decided coquet turning therefore all his attention to augusta he soon found that her temper was as truly good as her person was interesting and that the too great timidity of her manner was solely owing to her being continually checked by her mothers partiality to her sister a very short study of her character convinced him she was exactly the woman calculated to make him happy he told her so and found her by no means averse to his making the same declaration to her father and mother lord montreville received it with pleasure and preliminaries were soon settled in about six weeks lord westhaven and miss augusta delamere were married at bath to the infinite satisfaction of all parties except miss delamere who could not be very well pleased with the preference shewn her younger sister by a man whose morals person and fortune were all superior to what even her own high spirit had taught her to expect in a husband crofts tho he saw all apprehensions of having lord westhaven for a rival were at an end could not help fearing that so advantageous a match for the younger might make the elder more unwilling to accept a simple commoner with a fortune greatly inferior the removal however of lady westhaven gave him more frequent opportunities to urge his passion lady montreville was now going to barege bath having been found less serviceable than was at first hoped for and delamere was written to to meet her ladyship and her eldest daughter at paris in order to accompany them thither peace having been in the interim established lord westhaven found he should return no more to his regiment and purposed with his wife to attend lady montreville part of the way and then to go into switzerland where his mothers family resided who had been of that country lady westhaven was extremely gratified by this scheme not only because she was delighted to wait on her mother but because she hoped it would help to dissipate a lurking uneasiness which hung over the spirits of her lord and which he told her was owing to the uncertain and distressing situation of a beloved sister but whenever the subject was mentioned he expressed so much unhappiness that his wife had not yet had resolution to enquire into the nature of her misfortunes and only knew in general that she was unfortunately married chapter xi emmeline had now lost her lover at least for some time and one of her friends too was gone where she could seldom hear of her these deprivations attached her more closely than ever to mrs stafford mr stafford was gone to town and except now and then a short and melancholy visit from fitzedward to whom delamere had lent his house at tylehurst they saw nobody for all the neighbouring families were in london they found not only society but happiness together enough to compensate for almost every other and passed their time in a way particularly adapted to the taste of both adjoining to the estate where mrs stafford resided a tract of forest land formerly a chase and now the property of a collegiate body deeply indents the arable ground beyond it and fringes the feet of the green downs which rise above it this part of the country is called woodbury forest and the deep shade of the beech trees with which it is covered is broken by wild and uncultured glens where among the broom hawthorn and birch of the waste a few scattered cottages have been built upon sufferance by the poor for the convenience of fewel so amply afforded by the surrounding woods these humble and obscure cabbins are known only to the sportsman and the woodcutter for no road whatever leads through the forest and only such romantic wanderers as mrs stafford and emmeline were conscious of the beautiful walks which might be found among these natural shrubberies and solitary shades the two friends were enjoying the softness of a beautiful april morning in these woods when in passing near one of the cottages they saw at a low casement half obscured by the pendant trees a person sitting whose dress and air seemed very unlike those of the usual inhabitants of such a place she was intent on a paper over which she leaned in a melancholy posture but on seeing the two ladies approach she started up and immediately disappeared tho the distance at which they saw her and the obscurity of the window prevented their distinguishing the features of the stranger they saw that she was young and they fancied she was beautiful the same idea instantly occurred to mrs stafford and emmeline that it was some unfortunate young woman whom mr stafford had met with and had concealed there something of the same sort had happened once before and mrs staffords anxiety and curiosity were both awakened by this incident tho the latter was a passion she never indulged where its object was the business of others she could not repress it where it was excited by suspicion of a circumstance which so nearly concerned herself nor could she conceal from emmeline her fears on this occasion and emmeline tho unwilling to encrease them yet knew enough of her husbands conduct to believe they were too well founded mrs stafford had been accustomed to buy poultry of the woman who lived at this cottage and therefore went in in hopes of finding some vestige of the person they had seen which might lead to an enquiry but they found nothing but the usual humble furniture and few conveniences of such an house and mrs stafford forbore to enquire lest the person she had seen might be alarmed and take more effectual means of concealment but unable to rest and growing every moment more desirous to know the truth and to know it before her husband whom she expected in a few days returned she arose very early the next morning and accompanied by emmeline went to the cottage in the forest the man who inhabited it was already gone out to his work and the woman to a neighbouring town to buy necessaries for her family the door was open and the ladies received this intelligence from three little children who were playing before it they entered the low smoky room usually inhabited by the family and mrs stafford with a beating heart determining to be satisfied opened a door which led from it into that at the window of which she knew the stranger had appeared and which the people of the house dignified with the appellation of their parlour in this room on the brick floor and surrounded by bare walls stood a bed which seemed to have been brought thither for the accommodation of some person who had not been accustomed to such an apartment mrs stafford saw sleeping in it a very young woman pale but extremely beautiful and her hand of uncommon delicacy lay on the white quilta sight which gave her pain for herself and pity for the unfortunate person before her affected her so much that having stood a moment in astonishment she stepped back to the place where emmeline sat and burst into tears the noise however trifling brought from above stairs a person evidently a ladys maid of very creditable appearance who came down hastily into the room where mrs stafford and emmeline were saying as she descended the stairsi am coming immediately my lady but at the sight of two strangers she stopped in great confusion and at the same moment her mistress called to her she hastened without speaking to attend the summons and shut the door after her after remaining a few moments she came out again and asked mrs stafford if she wanted the woman of the house to which mrs stafford determined whatever it cost her to know the truth saidnomy business is with your lady the woman now appeared more confused than before and said hesitatinglyiimy ladyi fancy you are mistaken madam go in however and let your mistress know that mrs stafford desires to speak to her the maid reluctantly and hesitatingly went in and after staying some time came back my mistress madam says she has not the pleasure of knowing you and being ill and in bed she hopes you will excuse her if she desires you will acquaint her with your business by me no replied mrs stafford i must see her myself tell her my business is of consequence to us both and that i will wait till it is convenient to her to speak to me with this message the maid went back with looks of great consternation to her mistress they fancied they heard somebody sigh and weep extremely the maid came out once or twice and carried back water and hartshorn at length after waiting near half an hour the door opened and the stranger appeared leaning on the arm of her woman she wore a long white muslin morning gown and a large muslin cap almost concealed her face her dark hair seemed to escape from under it to form a decided contrast to the extreme whiteness of her skin and her long eye lashes hid her eyes which were cast down and which bore the marks of recent tears if it were possible to personify languor and dejection it could not be done more expressively than by representing her form her air her complexion and the mournful cast of her very beautiful countenance she slowly approached mrs stafford lifted up her melancholy eyes to emmeline and attempted to speak i am at a loss to know ladies said she what can be yourbut unable to finish the sentence she sat down and seemed ready to faint the maid held her smelling bottle to her i waited on you madam said mrs stafford supposing you were acquaintedtoo well acquaintedwith my name and business no upon my honour said the young person i can not even guess you are very young said mrs stafford and i fear very unfortunate be assured i wish not either to reproach or insult you but only to try if you can not be prevailed upon to quit a manner of life which surely to a person of your appearance must be dreadful it is indeed dreadful sighed the young womannor is it the least dreadful part of it that i am exposed to this she now fell into an agony of tears which affected both mrs stafford and emmeline so much that forgetting their fears and suspicions they both endeavoured tenderly to console her having in some measure succeeded and mrs stafford having summoned resolution to tell her what were her apprehensions the stranger saw that to give her a simple detail of her real situation was the only method she had to satisfy her doubts and to secure her compassion and secresy for which reason she determined to do it and mrs stafford whose countenance was all ingenuousness as well as her heart assured her she should never repent her confidence while emmeline whose looks and voice were equally soothing and engaging to the unhappy expressed the tenderest interest in the fate of a young creature who seemed but little older than herself and to have been thrown from a very different sphere into her present obscure and uncomfortable manner of life the stranger would have attempted to relate her history to them immediately but her maid a steady woman of three or four and thirty told her that she was certainly unable then and begged the ladies not to insist upon it till the evening or the next day addingmy lady has been very poorly indeed all this week and is continually fainting away and you see ladies how much she has been frightened this morning and i am sure she will not be able to go through it to the probability of this observation the two friends assented and the young lady naming the next morning to gratify their curiosity they left her mrs stafford first offering her any thing her house afforded to which she replied that at present she was tolerably well supplied and only conjured them to observe the strictest secresy without which she said she was undone at the appointed time they returned equally eager to hear and if possible to relieve the sorrows of this young person for whom they could not help being interested tho they yet knew not how far she deserved their pity she had prepared her own little room as well as it would admit of to receive them and sat waiting their arrival with some degree of composure they contemplated with concern the ruins of eminent beauty even in early youth and saw an expression of helpless sorrow and incurable unhappiness which had greatly injured the original lustre and beauty of her eyes and countenance a heavy languor hung on her whole frame she tried to smile but it was a smile of anguish and their looks seemed to distress and pain her mrs stafford and emmeline to relieve her took out their work and when they were seated at it she hesitatedthen sighed and hesitated againand at length seemed to enter on her story with desperate and painful resolution as if to get quickly and at once thro a task which however necessary was extremely distressing she began in a low and plaintive voice and frequently stopped to summon courage to continue while she wiped away the tears that slowly fell from her eyes i can not believe i shall ever repent the confidence i am about to place in you my heart assures me i shall not perhaps i may find that pity i dare no longer solicit from my own family perhapsbut i must hasten to tell you my melancholy story before its recollection again overwhelms me yet my fate has nothing in it very singular numbers have been victims of the same calamity but some have been more easily forgiven than i shall besome are better able to bear infamy and be reconciled to disgrace my father the late earl of westhaven during the life of my grandfather married while he was making the tour of europe a very beautiful and amiable woman the daughter of a man of rank in switzerland who having lost his life in the french service had left a family without any provision except for the eldest son my grandfather extremely disobliged by this marriage made a will by which he gave to his only daughter every part of his extensive property except what was entailed and which went with the title with this reserve that his grandson should claim and inherit the whole whenever he became lord westhaven by this will he disinherited my father for his life and tho he survived my fathers marriage five years and knew he had three children the two younger of whom must be inevitably impoverished by such a disposition he obstinately refused to alter the will he made under the first impulse of resentment and died before his son could prevail upon him by means of their general friends to withdraw the maledictions with which he had loaded him his death not only hurt my father in his feelings but irreparably in his fortune his sister who was married to a scottish nobleman took possession of estates to the amount of fifteen thousand a year and all that remained to my father to support his rank and his encreasing family was little more than three thousand and even that income he had considerably diminished by taking up money which he was obliged to do while my grandfather lived for the actual maintenance of his family these unhappy circumstances while they injured the health and spirits of my father diminished not his tenderness for his wife whom he loved with unabated passion to retrench as much as possible he retired with her and his three children to an estate which being attached to the title belonged to him in cumberland in hopes of being able to live on the income he had left and to clear off the burden with which he had been compelled to load his paternal estates but a slow fever the effect of sorrow had seized on my mother then far advanced in her pregnancy with me my father solicitous to save her in whom all his happiness was centered sent to london for the best advice to attend her but their assistance was vain the fever encreased upon her and she died three weeks after my birth leaving my father deprived of every thing that could make life valuable in his estimation he gave himself up to a despair equal to the violence of his love and would probably have fallen a victim to it had not the servants sent to mr thirston who had been his tutor and for whom he had the greatest friendship and respect this excellent man represented to him that it was his duty to live for the children of his deplored adelina and he consented to try to live it was long before he could bear to see any of us particularly me whom he beheld with a mixture of tenderness and regret the gloomy solitude in which he lived where every object reminded him of her whose smiles had rendered it a paradise was ill calculated to meliorate his affliction but he could not be persuaded for some months to leave it or could he be diverted from going every evening to visit the spot where lay the relicts of his adelina at length mr thirston prevailed on him to go abroad but he could not determine to leave my elder brother then about five years old of whom he was passionately fond they embarked for naples and he remained abroad five years while my sister my brother william and myself were left at kensington under the care of a female relation and received such instruction as our ages admitted my father returned to england only to place his eldest son at eton finding no relief from the sorrow which perpetually preyed on him but in continual change of place he soon afterwards went again abroad and wandered over europe for almost seven years longer returning once or twice to england in that interval to satisfy himself of our health and the progress of our education when he last returned my elder brother then near eighteen desired to be allowed to go into the army my father reluctantly consented and the regiment into which he purchased was soon after ordered abroad the grief the departure of his son gave him was somewhat relieved by seeing his elder daughter advantageously disposed of in marriage to the eldest son of an irish peer the beauty of lady camilla was so conspicuous and her manners so charming that though entirely without fortune the family of her husband could not object to the marriage she went to ireland with her lord and it was long before i saw her again my brother william who had always been designed for the navy left me also for a three years station in the mediterranean and i was now always alone with my governess and my old relation whose temper soured by disappointment and not naturally chearful made her a very unpleasant companion for a girl of fourteen i learned from masters who attended me from london all the usual accomplishments but of the world i knew nothing and impatiently waited for the time when i should be sixteen for then the dutchess of b who had kindly undertaken to introduce my sister into company had promised that she would afford me also her countenance i remember she smiled and told me that as i was not less pretty than lady camilla i might probably have as good fortune if i was but as accomplished to be accomplished therefore i endeavoured with all my power but the time seemed insupportably long before this essay was to be made it was relieved tho mournfully by frequent visits from my father who was accustomed to sit whole hours looking at me while his tears bore witness to the great resemblance i had to my mother my voice too particularly when we conversed in french frequently made him start as if he again heard that which he had never ceased to remember and to regret he would then fondly press me to his heart and call me his poor orphan girl the image of his lost adelina tho my mother had been now dead above fifteen years his passion for her memory seemed not at all abated he had by a long residence abroad paid off the debts with which he had incumbered his income but could do no more and the expences necessary for young men of my brothers rank pressed hardly upon him ever since his return to england his friends had entreated him to attempt by marrying a woman of fortune to repair the deficiency of his own representing to him that to provide for the children of his adelina would be a better proof of his affection to her memory than indulging a vain and useless regret he had however long escaped from their importunity by objecting on some pretence or other to all the great fortunes which were pointed out to himhis heart rejected with abhorrence every idea of a second marriage but my brothers every day required a larger supply of money to support them as their birth demanded and to their interest my father at length determined to sacrifice the remainder of a life which had on his own account no longer any value the heiress of a rich grocer in the city was soon discovered by his assiduous friends who was reputed to be possessed of two hundred thousand pounds on closer enquiry the sum was found to be very little if at all exaggerated by fame miss jobson with a tall meagre person a countenance bordering on the horrible and armed with two round black eyes which she fancied beautiful had seen her fortieth year pass while she attended on her papa in leadenhallstreet or was dragged by two sleek coach horses to and from hornsey rich as her father was he would not part with any thing while he lived and by the assistance of two maiden sisters had so guarded his daughter from the dangerous attacks of irishmen and younger brothers that she had reached that mature period without hearing the soothing voice of flattery to which she was extremely disposed to listen my father yet in middle age and with a person remarkably fine would have been greatly to her taste if he could have gratified with a better grace her love of admiration but his friends undertook to court her for him and his title still more successfully pleaded in his favour she made some objection to his having a family but as i alone remained at home she at length agreed to undertake to be at once a motherinlaw and a countess while this treaty was going on and settlements and jewels preparing i was taken several times to wait on miss jobson but it was easy to see i had not the good fortune to please her i was but just turned of fifteen was full of gaiety and vivacity and possessed those personal advantages which if she ever had any share of them were long since faded she seemed conscious that the splendour of her first appearance would be eclipsed by the unadorned simplicity of mine and she hated me because it was not in my power to be old and ugly giddy as i then was nothing but respect for my father prevented my repaying with ridicule the supercilious style in which she usually treated me her vulgar manners and awkward attempts to imitate those of people of fashion excited my perpetual mirth and as her dislike of me daily encreased i am afraid i did not always conceal the contempt i felt in return miss jobson chose to pass some time at tunbridge previous to her marriage thither my father followed her and i went with him eager to make my first appearance in public and to see whether the prophecies of the duchess would be fulfilled this experiment was made in a party from tunbridge to lewes races where i had the delight of dancing for the first time in public and of seeing the high and old fashioned little head of miss jobson who affected to do something which she thought was dancing also almost at the end of the set while i as an earls daughter was nearly at the top had i been ever accustomed to appear in public these distinctions would have been too familiar to have given me any pleasure but now they were enchanting and added to the universal admiration i excited intoxicated me with vanity my partner who had been introduced to me by a man of high rank the moment i entered the room was a gentleman from the west of england who was just of age and entered into the possession of a fortune of eight thousand a year mr trelawny for that was his name followed us to tunbridge and frequently danced with me afterwards educated in obscurity and without any prospect of the fortune to which he succeeded by a series of improbable events this young man had suddenly emerged into life he was tolerably handsome but had a heavy unmeaning countenance and was quite unformed several men of fashion however were kind enough to undertake to initiate him into a good style of living and for every thing that bore the name of fashion and ton he seemed to have a violent attachment to that i owed his unfortunate prepossession in my favouri was admired and followed by men whom he had been taught to consider as the arbiters of elegance and supreme judges of beauty and fashion but they could only admirethey could not afford to marry an indigent woman of quality and they told trelawny that they envied him the power of pleasing himselfso trelawny was talked to about me till he believed he was in love in this persuasion he procured a statement of his fortune to be shewn to my father by one of his friends and made an offer to lay it at my feet an offer which tho my father would have been extremely glad to have me accept he answered by referring mr trelawny to me i suspected no such thing but with the thoughtless inattention of sixteen remembered little of the fine things which were said to me by trelawny at the last ball while i was busied in inventing a new chapeau for the next at which i intended to do more than usual execution my father introduced mr trelawny and left the room i concluded he was come to engage me for the evening and felt disposed to refuse him out of pure coquetry when with an infinite number of blushes and after several efforts he made me in due form an offer of his heart and fortune i had never thought of any thing so serious as matrimony and indeed was but just out of the nursery where i had never been told it was necessary to think at all i did not very well know what to say to my admirer and after the first speech which i believe he had learned by heart he knew almost as little what to say to me and he was not sorry when i in a great fright referred him to my father merely because i knew not myself what answer to give him our conversation ended and he went to find my father while i for the first time in my life began to reflect on my prospects and to consider whether i preferred marrying mr trelawny to living with miss jobson to miss jobson i had a decided aversion for mr trelawny i felt neither love or hatred my mind was not made up on the subject when my father came to me he had seen trelawny and expressed himself greatly pleased with the prudence and propriety of my answer my adelina knows continued he that the happiness of my children is the only wish i have on earth and i may tell her too that my solicitude for her exceeds all my other caressolicitude which will be at an end if i can see her in the protection of a man of honour and fortune if therefore my love you really do not disapprove this young man whose fortune is splendid and of whose character i have received the most favourable accounts i shall have a weight removed from my mind and enjoy all the tranquillity i can hope for on this side the grave you know how soon i am to marry miss jobson a motherinlaw is seldom beloved i may die and leave you unprovided for for you know adelina the circumstances into which your grandfathers will has thrown me our dear charles whenever he inherits my title will repossess the fortune of my ancestors and will i am sure act generously by you and william but such a dependance if not precarious is painful and by accepting the proposal of mr trelawny all my apprehensions will be at an end and my adelina secure of that affluence to which her merit as well as her birth entitles her but powerful as these considerations are let them not influence you if you feel any reluctance to the match were they infinitely stronger i will never again name them if in doing so i hazard persuading my daughter to a step which may render her for every unhappy tho i was very far from feeling for mr trelawny that decided preference which would in other circumstances have induced me to accept his hand yet i found my father so desirous of my being settled that as i had no aversion to the man i could not resolve to disappoint him perhaps the prospect of escaping from the power of my motherinlaw and of being mistress of an affluent fortune instead of living in mortifying dependance on her might have too much influence on my heart my father however obtained without any difficulty my consent to close with mr trelawnys proposals we all went to london where lord westhaven married miss jobson and the settlements were preparing by which mr trelawny secured to me a jointure as great as i could have expected if my fortune had been equal to my rank as the new lady westhaven was so soon to be relieved from the presence of a daughter she did not love she behaved to me with tolerable civility occupied with her rank she seemed to have infinite delight in displaying it to her city acquaintance her ladyship thought a coronet so delightful an ornament that the meanest utensils in her house were adorned with it and she wore it woven or worked on all her cloaths in the vain hope perhaps of counteracting the repelling effect of an hideous countenance a discordant voice and a manner more vulgar than either i saw with concern that my father was not consoled by the possession of her great fortune for the mortification of having given the name and place of his adored adelina to a woman so unlike her in mind and person he was seldom well seldomer at home and seemed to have no other delight than in hearing from his two sons and from his eldest daughter and when we were alone he told me that to see me married would also give him pleasure but he appeared i thought less anxious for the match than when it was first proposed the preparations however went on and in six weeks were compleated in that interval i had seen trelawny almost every day he always seemed very good humoured and was certainly very thoughtless he loved me or fancied he loved me extremely but i sometimes suspected that it was rather in compliance with the taste of others than his own and that a favourite hunter or a famous pointer were very likely to rival me my father sometimes laughed at his boyish fondness for such things and the importance he annexed to them and sometimes i thought he looked grave and hurt at observing it for my own part i saw his follies but none that i did not equally perceive in the conduct of other young men tho i had no absolute partiality to him i was totally indifferent to every other man i married him therefore and gave away my person before i knew i had an heart we went immediately into cornwall to an old fashioned but magnificent family seat where i was received by mr trelawnys sister a woman some years older than he was and who had brought him up the coarse conversation of this woman which consisted entirely in details of family oeconomy and the stupidity of her husband and a booby son of fourteen were but ill calculated to render my retirement pleasing having laughed and wondered once at the uncouth figures and obsolete notions of mr trelawnys cornish cousins who hastened in their best cloaths to congratulate him from places whose barbarous names i could not pronounceand having twice entertained the voters of two boroughs which belonged to the family i had exhausted all the delights of cornwall and prevailed on him to return to a country where i could see a few beings like myself when i came back into the world i was surrounded by a croud of idle people whose admiration flattered the vanity of trelawny more than it did mine for i became accustomed to adulation and it lost its charms with its novelty trelawny was continually with young men of fashion who called themselves his friends and who besides doing him the kindness to advise and instruct him in the disposal of his fortune would have relieved him from the affections of his wife if he had ever possessed them they made love to me with as little scruple as they borrowed money of him and told me that neglect on the part of my husband well deserved to be repaid with infidelity on mine but i felt for these shallow libertines only disgust and contempt and received their professions with so much coldness that they left me in search of some other giddy creature who might not by illtimed prudery belie the promise of early coquetry it was yet however very much the fashion to admire me and my husband seemed still to take some delight in hearing and reading in the daily papers that lady adelina trelawny was the most elegant figure at court or that every beauty at the opera was eclipsed on her entrance the eagerness and avidity with which i had entered from the confinement of the nursery to a life of continual dissipation was now considerably abated i continued it from habit and because i knew not how to employ my time otherwise but i felt a dreary vacuity in my heart and amid splendor and admiration was unhappy the return of my elder brother from his first campaign in america was the only real pleasure i had long felt he is perhaps one of the most elegant and accomplished young men of his time but to be elegant and accomplished is his least praisehis solid understanding and his excellent heart are an honour to his country and to human nature that quick sense of honour and that strictness of principle which now make my greatest terror give a peculiar lustre and dignity to his character my father received him with that delight a father only can feel and saw and gloried with all a fathers pride in a successor worthy of his ancestors my brother who had always loved me extremely tho we had been very little together took up his abode at my house while he staid in england trelawny seemed to feel a sort of awe before him which made him endeavour to hide his vices if not his weakness while he remained with us he was more attentive to me than he had long been my brother hoped i was happy and tho trelawny was a man whose conversation afforded him no pleasure he behaved to him with every appearance of friendship and regard he was soon however to return to his regiment and my father who had been in a declining state of health ever since his second marriage appeared to grow worse as the period of separation approached he seemed to have waited only for this beloved son to close his eyes for a few days before he was again to take leave my father found his end very rapidly approaching perfectly conscious of it he settled all his affairs and made a provision for me and my brother william out of the money of the present lady westhaven which the marriage articles gave him a right to dispose of after her ladyships death if he left no children by her and recommended us both to his eldest son you will act nobly by our dear william said he i have no doubt of it but above all remember my poor adelina camilla is happily married tell her i die blessing her and her children but adelinamy unfortunate adelina is herself but a child and her husband is very young and thoughtless watch over her honour and her repose for the sake of your father and that dear woman she so much resembles your sainted mother i was in the room in an agony of sorrow he called me to him my daughter said he in a feeble voice remember that the honour of your familyof your brothersis in your handsand remember it is sacredendeavour to deserve the happiness of being sister to such brothers and daughter to such a mother as yours was i was unable to answer i could only kiss his convulsed hands which i eagerly did as if to tell him that i promised all he expected of me my own heart which then made the vow now perpetually reproaches me with having kept it so ill a few hours afterwards my father died my brother unable to announce to me the melancholy tidings took my hand in silence and led me out of the house which was now lady westhavens he had only a few days to stay in england which he employed in paying the last mournful duties to his father and then embarked again for america leaving his affairs to be settled by my sisters husband lord clancarryl to whom he wrote to come over from ireland for my brother william was now stationed in the west indies where he obtained the command of a man of war and my brother westhaven knew that to leave any material business to trelawny was to leave it to ignorance and imbecility in my husband i had neither a friend or a companioni had not even a protector for except when he was under the restraint of my brothers presence he was hardly ever at home sometimes he was gone on tours to distant counties to attend races or hunts to which he belonged and sometimes to france where he was embarked in gaming associations with englishmen who lived only to disgrace their name left to pass my life as the wife of such a man as trelawny i felt my brothers departure as the deprivation of all i loved but the arrival of my sister and her husband relieved me i had not seen them for some years and was delighted to meet my sister happy with a man so worthy and respectable as lord clancarryl he took possession on behalf of my brother of the estate my aunt was now obliged to resign and as my sister was impatient to return to ireland where she had left her children they pressed me extremely to go thither with them trelawny was gone out on one of his rambles but i wrote to him and obtained his consentindeed he long since ceased to trouble himself about me i attended my sister therefore to lough carryl on the beautiful banks of which her lord had built an house which possessing as much magnificence as was proper to their rank was yet contrived with an attention to all the comforts of domestic retirement here lady clancarryl chose to reside the whole year and my lord never left it but to attend the business of parliament at dublin his tender attention to his wife his ardent yet regulated fondness for his children the peace and order which reigned in his house the delightful and easy society he sometimes collected in it and the chearful confidence we enjoyed in quiet family parties when without company made me feel with bitterness and regret the difference between my sisters lot and mine her husband made it the whole business of his life to fulfill every duty of his rank mine seemed only solicitous to degrade himself below his one was improving his fortune by well regulated oeconomy the other dissipating his among gamesters and pickpockets the conversation of lord clancarryl was sensible refined and improving trelawnys consisted either in tiresome details of adventures among jockies pedigrees of horses or scandalous and silly anecdotes about persons of whom nobody wished to hear or he sunk into sullen silence yawned and shewed how very little relish he had for any other discourse when i married him i knew not to what i had condemned myself as his character gradually discovered itself my reason also encreased and now when i had an opportunity of comparing him to such a man as lord clancarryl i felt all the horrors of my destiny and beheld with a dread from which my feeble heart recoiled a long long prospect of life before mewithout attachment without friendship without love i remained two months in ireland and heard nothing of trelawny till a match having been made on the curragh of kildare on which he had a large bet depending he came over to be present at it and i heard with regret that i was to return with him while he remained in ireland his disgusting manners and continual intoxication extremely displeased lord clancarryl and i lived in perpetual uneasiness a few days before we were to embark for england george fitzedward his lordships younger brother came from the north of ireland where he had been with his regiment to lough carryl but it was only a passing visit to his familyhe was going to england and we were to sail in the same pacquet at the mention of george fitzedward lady adelina grew more distressed than she had yet been in the course of her narrative mrs stafford and emmeline testified signs of surprize she observed it and asked if they knew him mrs stafford answered they had some acquaintance with him and emmeline remarked that she either never heard or had forgotten that his fathers second title was clancarryl his very name seemed to affect lady adelina so much and she appeared so exhausted by having spoken so long that tho she told them she had but little to add to her mournful story they insisted upon her permitting them to release her till the evening when they would attend her again chapter xii they found lady adelina in better spirits in the evening than they had hoped forshe seemed to have been arguing herself into the composure necessary to go on with her story as you have some acquaintance with george fitzedward i need not describe his person or his manner nor how decided a contrast they must form with those of such a man as him to whom i was unhappily united this contrast in spite of all my endeavours was perpetually before my eyesi thought fitzedward who was agreeable as his brother had a heart as good and my heart involuntarily made the comparison between what i was and what i might have been if my fate had reserved me for fitzedward we embarkedit was about the autumnal equinox and before we had sailed two leagues the wind suddenly changing blew from the opposite quarter and then from every quarter by turns as i was always subject to sickness in the cabin i had lain down on the deck on a piece of sailcloth and wrapped in my pelisse and fitzedward sat by me but when the wind grew so violent that it was necessary every moment to shift the sails i who was totally insensible was in the way of the sailors fitzedward carried me down in his arms and having often heard me express an abhorrence to the close beds in the cabin by the help of my own maid he accommodated me with one on the floor where he continued to watch over me without attending to his own danger tho he heard the master of the pacquet express his apprehensions that we should be driven back on the bar and beat to pieces trelawny in whom selfpreservation was generally alive whatever became of his other feelings had passed so jovial an evening before he departed that he was perfectly unconscious of his own danger after struggling some hours to return into the bay it was with difficulty accomplished about five in the morning fitzedward with the tenderest solicitude saw me safe on shore whither trelawny was also brought but far from being rejoiced at our narrow escape he cursed his ill luck which he said had raised this confounded storm only to prevent his returning in time to see clytemnestra got into proper order for the october meeting i was so ill the next day thro the fear and fatigue i had undergone that i was absolutely unable to go on board but nothing that related to me could detain trelawny who embarked again as soon as the pacquet was refitted and after some grumbling at my being too ill to go left me to follow him by the next conveyance and recommended me with great coolness to the care of fitzedward we staid only two days after him fitzedward as well during the passage as on our journey to london behaved to me with the tenderness of a brother and i fancied my partiality concealed from him because i tried to conceal it if he saw it he shewed no disposition to take advantage of it and i therefore thought i might fearlessly indulge it when i arrived at my house in town i found that trelawny was absent and had left a letter for me desiring me to go down to a house he had not long before purchased in hampshire as a hunting seat without enquiring his reasons i obeyed him i took a melancholy leave of fitzedward and went into hampshire where as trelawny was not there i betook myself to my books and i fear to thinking too much of fitzedward after i had been there about a fortnight i was surprized by a visit from the object of my indiscreet contemplations he looked distressed and unhappy and his first conversation seemed to be preparing me for some ill news i was dreadfully alarmed and enquired eagerly for my sisterher husbandher children i hope and believe they are well answered he i have letters of a very late date from my brother oh god cried i in an agony for his countenance still assured me something very bad had happened lord westhavenmy brother my dear brother is well too i hopeat least i assure you i know nothing to the contrary is it news from jamaica then has there been an engagement there has i know and my brother william is killed no upon my honour replied fitzedward had godolphin been killed i who love him better than any man breathing could not have brought the intelligencebut my dear lady adelina are there then no other misfortunes but those which arise from the death of friends none answered i but what i could very well bear tell me therefore i conjure you tell me and keep me no longer in suspencei can hear any thing since i have nothing to apprehend for the lives of those i love well then answered he i will tell youi fear things are very bad with mr trelawny it is said that all the estate not entailed is already gone and that he has even sold his life interest in the rest all his effects at the town house are seized and i am afraid the same thing will in a few hours happen here i came therefore lovely lady adelina to intreat you to put yourself under my protection and to quit this house where it will soon be so improper for you to remain i enquired after the unhappy trelawny he told me he had left him intoxicated at a gaming house in st jamess street that he had told him he was coming down to me to which he had consented tho fitzedward said he much doubted whether he knew what he was saying fitzedward then advised me to pack up every thing i wished to preserve and immediately to depart for he feared that persons were already on the road to seize the furniture and effects in execution gracious heaven cried i what can i dowhither can i go trust yourself with me cried fitzedwarddear injured lady adelina let me rather answered i go down to trelawny park alas said he the same ruin will there overtake you be assured mr trelawnys creditors will equally attach his property there you know too that by the sale of his boroughs he has lost his seat in parliament and that therefore his person will not be safe he must himself go abroad doubting and uncertain what i ought to do i could determine on nothing fitzedward proposed my going to mr percivals who had married one of his sisters they are at bath said he but the house and servants are at my disposal and it is only five and twenty miles from hence hardly knowing what i did i consented to this proposal and taking my jewels and some valuable plate with me i set out in a post chaise with fitzedward leaving my maid to follow me the next day and give me an account whether our fears were verified they were but too well founded four hours after i had left the house the sheriffs officers entered itinformation which encreased my uneasiness for the fate of the unfortunate trelawny in hopes of alleviating whose miseries i would myself have gone to london but fitzedward would not suffer me he said it was more than probable that my husband was already in france that if he was yet in england he had no house in which to receive me and would feel more embarrassed than relieved by my presence but as i continued to express great uneasiness to know what was become of him he offered to go to london and bring me some certain intelligence at the end of a week which appeared insupportably long he returned and told me that with some difficulty he had discovered my unhappy husband at the house of one of his friends where he was concealed and where he had lost at picquet more than half the ready money he could command that with some difficulty he had convinced him of the danger as well as folly of remaining in such a place and had accompanied him to dover whence he had seen him sail for france i told fitzedward that i would instantly give up as much of my settlement as would enable trelawny to live in affluence till his affairs could be arranged but he protested that he would not suffer me to take any measure of that sort till i had the advice of his brother or till one of my own returned to england do you know said he at the end of this conversationdo you know lady adelina that i envy trelawny his misfortunes since they excite such generous pitygood god of what tenderness of what affection would not such a heart be capable if fitzedward had seldom hazarded an observation of this sort tho his eyes had told me a thousand times that he internally made them he could convey into half a sentence more than others could express by the most elaborate speeches alas i listened to him with too much pleasure for my treacherous heart had already said more than his insidious eloquence i wrote to lord clancarryl entreating him to come over he assured me he would do so the moment he could leave my sister who was very near her time but that in the interim his brother george would obey all my commands and render me every service he could himself do if present thrown therefore wholly into the power of fitzedward loving him but too well and seeing him every hour busied in serving mei will not accuse him of art i had myself too little to hide from him the fatal secret of my heart i could not summon resolution to fly from him till my error was irretrievabletill i found myself made compleatly miserable by the consciousness of guilt after remaining there about a fortnight i left the house of mr percival and took a small lodging in the neighbourhood of cavendishsquare fitzedward saw me every dayi met him indeed with tears and confusion but if any accident prevented his coming or if he even absented himself at my own request the anguish i felt till i again saw him convinced me that it was no longer in my power to live without him trelawny had given me no directions for my conduct nor had he even written to me till he had occasion for money he then desired me to send him five hundred guineasa sum i had no immediate means of raising but by selling some of my jewels this i would immediately have done but fitzedward who would not hear of it brought me the money in a few hours and undertook to remit it together with a letter from me to the unfortunate man for whom it was designed he tried tooah how vainlyto persuade me that in acting thus i had done more than my duty to such an husband his sophistry aided by my own wishes to believe him could not quiet the incessant reproaches with which my conscience pursued mei remembered my fathers dying injunctions i remembered the inflexible notions of honour inherited by both my brothers and i trembled at the severe account to which i might be called i could now no longer flatter myself that my error would be concealed since of its consequences i could not doubt and while i suffered all the terrors of remorse and apprehension lord clancarryl came over in order to take measures towards settling trelawnys affairs it was necessary to send for his sister who had a bond for five thousand pounds which claim was prior to every other this woman whom it was extremely disagreeable to me to meet lamented with vulgar clamour her brothers misfortunes which she said could never have happened if he had not been so unlucky as to get quality notions into his head i know not what at first raised her suspicions but i saw that she very narrowly observed fitzedward and sneeringly said that it was very lucky indeed for me to have such a friend and quite kind in the colonel to take so much trouble she made herself thoroughly acquainted with all that related to her brother from the time of our parting in ireland and i found that she had attempted to bribe my servant to give her an account of my conduct in which tho she had failed of success she had found that fitzedward had been constantly with me his attendance was indeed less remarkable when lord clancarryl his brother was also present but mrs bancraft determined to believe ill of me suffered not this circumstance to have any weight and hinted her suspicions of our attachment in terms so little guarded that it was with the utmost difficulty i could prevail on fitzedward not to resent her impertinence lord clancarryl despised this vulgar and disgusting woman too much to attend to the inuendos he heard and far from suspecting my unhappy weakness he continued to lay me under new obligations to fitzedward by employing him almost incessantly in the arrangement of trelawnys affairs on looking over the will of that relation who had bequeathed to mr trelawny the great fortune he had possessed i discovered the reason of mrs bancrafts attentive curiosity in regard to meif he died without heirs above six thousand a year was to descend to her son who was to take the name he had been now married above two years and his bloated and unhealthy appearance the effect of excessive drinking indicated short life and had made her for some time look forward to the succession of the entailed estate as an event almost certain for her son this sufficiently explained her conduct and encreased all my apprehensions for i found that avarice would stimulate malice into that continued watchfulness which i could not now undergo without the loss of my fame and my peace all things being settled by lord clancarryl in the best manner he could dispose them for mr trelawny his lordship pressed me to go with him to ireland but conscious that i should carry only disgrace and sorrow into the happy and respectable family of my sister i refused under pretence of waiting to hear again from trelawny before i took any resolution as to my future residence his lordship therefore left me having obtained my promise to go over to lough carryl in the spring fitzedward continued to see me almost every day attempting by the tenderest assiduity to soothe and tranquillize my mind but time which alleviates all other evils only encreased mine and they were now become almost insupportable after long deliberation i saw no way to escape the disgrace which was about to overwhelm me but hiding myself from my own family and from all the world i determined to keep my retreat secret even from fitzedward himself and to punish myself for my fatal attachment by tearing myself for ever from its object could i have supported the contempt of the world to which it was evidently the interest of mrs bancraft to expose me i could not bear the most distant idea of the danger to which the life of fitzedward would be liable from the resentment of my brothers that he might perish by the hand of lord westhaven or captain godolphin or that one of those dear brothers might fall by his was a suggestion so horrid and yet so probable that it was for ever before me and i hastened to fly into obscurity in the hope that if my error is concealed till i am myself in the grave my brothers may forgive me and not attempt to wash out the offence in the blood of the surviving offender to remain and to die here unknown is all i now dare to wish for my servant having formerly known the woman who inhabits this cottage contrived to have a few necessaries sent hither without observation i have made it worth the while of the people to be secret and as they know not my name i had little apprehension of being discovered i took no leave of fitzedward nor have i written to him since i lament the pain my sudden absence must give him but am determined to see him no more should my child live lady adelina was now altogether unable to proceed and fell into an agony of distress which greatly affected her auditors mrs stafford and emmeline said every thing they could think of to console her and soften the horror she seemed to feel for her unhappy indiscretion but she listened in listless despondence to their discourse and answered that to be reconciled to guilt and habituated to disgrace was to be sunk in the last abyss of infamy they left her not however till they saw her rather more tranquil and till mrs stafford had prevailed upon her to accept of some books which she hoped might amuse her mind and detach it awhile from the sad subject of its mournful contemplations these she promised to convey to the cottage in a way that could create no suspicion and relieved of her own apprehensions yet full of concern for the fair unhappy mourner to whom neither she or emmeline had given the least intimation of fitzedwards frequent residence in that country they returned to woodfield impressed with the most earnest solicitude to soften the calamities they had just heard related tho to cure them was impossible end of the second volume volume iii chapter i whenever mrs stafford and emmeline were afterwards alone they could think and speak of nothing but lady adelina the misfortunes in which an unhappy marriage had involved her her friendless youth her lovely figure the settled sorrow and deep regret that she seemed to feel for the error into which her too great sensibility of heart had betrayed her engaged their tenderest pity and made them both anxious to give her all the consolation and assistance she was now capable of receiving when they considered the uncertainty of her remaining long concealed where she was and the probability that fitzedward himself might discover her they saw the necessity of her removal from woodbury forest but it was a proposal they could not yet makenor had they yet recollected any place where she might be more secure emmeline who felt herself particularly interested by her misfortunes and who was more pleased with her conversation the oftener she conversed with her seldom failed of seeing her every day but mrs stafford more apprehensive of observation could not so frequently visit her and the precaution of both redoubled when mrs ashwood miss galton and the two miss ashwoods arrived at woodfield where they declared an intention of staying the months of june and july thither also soon after came the younger mr crofts who had made an acquaintance with mr stafford in london with the hope of obtaining an invitation which he eagerly accepted sir richard crofts in the ambition of making a family had determined to give every advantage to his eldest son which might authorise him to look up to those alliances that would he hoped make his own obscurity forgotten from the first dawn of his fortune he had considered mr crofts as its general heir and had very plainly told his younger son that a place under government which he had procured for him of about three hundred a year must be his only dependance till he should possess two thousand pounds all the provision he intended making for him at his deathas he meant not to diminish by a more equal division the patrimony of his brother he recommended to him therefore to remedy this deficiency of fortune by looking out for an affluent wife nature had not eminently qualified him for success in such a project for his person was short thick and ill made and his face composed of large broad features two dim grey eyes and a complexion of a dull sallow white a vain attempt to look like a gentleman served only to render the meanness of his figure more remarkable and the qualities of his heart and understanding were but little calculated to make his personal imperfections forgotten his heart was selfish narrow unfeeling and at once mean and proud his understanding beneath mediocrity and his conversation consisted of quaint scraps of something that he supposed was wit or at least very like it and even such attempts to be entertaining poor as they were he retailed from the office where he passed the greatest part of his time and for a subaltern employment in which his education had been barely such as fitted him but ignorant as he was and devoid of every estimable accomplishment he had an infinite deal of that inferior kind of policy called cunning and being accustomed to consider his establishment as depending wholly on himself he had acquired a habit of sacrificing every sentiment and every passion to that one purpose and would adopt the opinions and submit to the caprices of others whenever he thought they could promote it he had learned the obsequious attention the indefatigable industry the humble adulation which is necessary for the under departments of political business and while such acquisitions gave him hopes of rising in that line they failed not to contribute to his success in another he would walk from the extremity of westminster to wapping to smuggle a set of china or of quadrille boxes for the mother or aunt of an heiress and would with great temper suffer the old ladies to take advantage of him at cards while he ogled the young ones which together with his being always ready to perform for them petty services and to flatter them without scruple had obtained for him the character of one of the best creatures breathing but whatever favour these various recommendations obtained for him for a time from the elderly ladies he lost his ground when his views were discovered and tho he had received what he fancied encouragement from two or three young women of fortune on their first emerging from the nursery yet they had no sooner acquired an handsomer or richer lover than the best creature breathing was discarded he was not however discouraged and meeting with mrs ashwood at a rout at lady montrevilles he was told by miss delamere who was extremely diverted with her airs of elegance that she was a rich widow who wanted a husband he enquired into the circumstances of her fortune and being assured she possessed such an income as would make him easy he thought some little advantage she had over him in point of age no diminution of her attractions and found it convenient to fall immediately in love she listened to him with complaisance and soon discovered that he was not so plain as at first he appeared to besoon afterwards that he was rather handsome and vastly sensible and agreeable after which he made a rapid progress in her heart and it was concerted between them that he should follow her to woodfield emmeline and mrs stafford were wearied to death with the party but the former forbore to complain and the latter was forced to submit and to smile while anguish was frequently at her heart mrs ashwood talked of nothing but fashionable parties and fashionable people to whom her acquaintance with lord montrevilles family had introduced her and she now seldom deigned to name an untitled acquaintancewhile crofts hung on her long narratives with affected admiration and the two elder of her three daughters who were all in training to be beauties aped their mother in vanity and impertinence the eldest miss ashwood now about fourteen was an insupportable torment to emmeline as she had taken it into her head to form with her a sentimental friendship she had learned all the cant of sentiment from novels and her mamas lovers had extremely edified her in teaching her to express it she talked perpetually of delicate embarrassments and exquisite sensibilities and had probably a lover as she extremely wanted a confidant a post which emmeline with some difficulty declinedof the sweet novels she had read she just understood as much as made her long to become the heroine of such an history herself and she wanted somebody to listen to her hopes of being so but emmeline shrunk from her advances and repaid her fondness with general and cool civility tho mrs ashwood who loved rather to listen to crofts than to attend to her daughters continually promoted the intimacy in hopes that she would take them off her own hands and allow them to be the companions of her walks this emmeline was obliged studiously to evade as such companions would entirely have prevented her seeing lady adelina and by repeated excuses she not only irritated the curiosity of mrs ashwood and miss galton but gave the former an additional cause of dislike to that which she had already conceived inasmuch as she was younger handsomer and more admired than herself emmeline received frequent letters from delamere as warm and passionate as his personal professions he told her that as his mothers health was greatly amended he intended soon to visit those parts of france with which he was yet unacquainted and should pass some time in the northern provinces from whence he entreated her to allow him to come only for a few days to england to see heran indulgence which he said would enable him to bear with more tranquillity the remaining months of his exile tho now accustomed to consider him as her husband emmeline resolutely refused to consent to this breach of his engagement to his father she had lately seen in her friends mrs stafford and lady adelina two melancholy instances of the frequent unhappiness of very early marriages and she had no inclination to hazard her own happiness in hopes of proving an exception she wished therefore rather to delay her union with delamere two or three years but to him she never dared hint at such a delay a clandestine interview it was however in her power to decline and she answered his request by entreating him not to think of such a journey and represented to him that he could not expect lord montreville would finally adhere to his promises if he himself was careless of fulfilling the conditions on which his lordship had insisted having thus as she supposed prevented delamere from offending his father and without any immediate uneasiness on her own account she gave up her mind to the solicitude she could not help feeling for lady adelina this occupied almost all her time when she was alone and gave her when in company an air of absence and reserve tho mrs ashwood so much encouraged the attention of james crofts she had not forgotten fitzedward whom she had vainly sought at lady montrevilles in hopes of renewing an acquaintance which had in its commencement offered her so much satisfaction fitzedward had been amused with her absurdity at the moment but had never thought of her afterwards nor would he then have bestowed so much time on a woman to him entirely indifferent had not he been thrown in her way by his desire to befriend delamere with emmeline on one of those days when lady adelina insisted on his leaving her to avoid the appearance of his passing with her all his time happy in successful love his gaiety then knew no bounds and his agreeable flattery his lively conversation his fashionable manners and his handsome person had not since been absent from the memory of mrs ashwood his being sometimes at the house he had borrowed of delamere near woodfield was one of the principal inducements to her to go thither she indulged sanguine hopes of securing such a conquest and evaded giving to crofts a positive answer till she had made another essay on the heart of the colonel he came however so seldom to woodfield that mrs stafford had seen him there only once since her meeting lady adelina and then he appeared to be under encreased dejection for which she knew now how to account emmeline had given mrs stafford so indifferent an account of lady adelina one evening that she determined the next morning to see her she therefore went immediately after breakfast on pretence of visiting a poor family who had applied to her for assistance when as mrs ashwood miss galton and emmeline were sitting together colonel fitzedward was announced he came down to tylehurst only the evening before and not knowing there was company at woodfield rode over to pass an hour with the two friends to whom he had frequently been tempted to communicate the source of his melancholy whether it was owing to the consciousness of lady adelinas mournful story that arose in the mind of emmeline or whether seeing fitzedward again in company with mrs ashwood renewed the memory of what had befallen her when they last met she blushed deeply the moment she beheld him and arose from her chair in confusion then sat down and took out her work which she had hastily put up and trying to recover herself grew still more confused and trembled and blushed again mrs ashwood was in the mean time overwhelming fitzedward with compliments and kind looks which he answered with the distant civility of a slight acquaintance and taking a chair close to emmeline enquired if she was not well she answered that she was perfectly well and attempted to introduce general conversation but fitzedward was attentive only to her and mrs ashwood extremely piqued at his distant manner meditated an excuse to get emmeline out of the room in hopes of obtaining more notice fitzedward however having talked apart with miss mowbray a short time arose and took leave having by his manner convinced mrs ashwood of what she reluctantly believed that some later attachment had obliterated the impression she had made at their first interview i never saw such a figure in my life cried she as mr fitzedward mercy on mehe is grown so thin and so sallow and so stupidinterrupted miss galton he is in love i fancy emmeline blushed again and mrs ashwood casting a malicious look at her saidoh yeshe doubtless is in love to men of his gay turn you know it makes no difference whether a person be actually married or engaged emmeline uncertain of the meaning of this sarcasm and unwilling to be provoked to make a tart reply which she felt herself ready to do put up her work and left the room while she went in search of mrs stafford to enquire after lady adelina and to relate the conversation that had passed between her and fitzedward mrs ashwood and miss galton were indulging their natural malignity tho well apprized of emmelines engagement to delamere yet they hesitated not to impute her confusion and fitzedwards behaviour to a passion between them they believed that while her elopement with delamere had beyond retreat entangled her with him and while his fortune and future title tempted her to marry him her heart was in possession of fitzedward and that delamere was the dupe of his mistress and his friend this idea which could not have occurred to a woman who was not herself capable of all the perfidy it implied grew immediately familiar with the imagination of mrs ashwood and embittered the sense of her own disappointment miss galton who hated emmeline more if possible than mrs ashwood irritated her suspicions by remarks of her own she observed that it was very extraordinary miss mowbray should walk out so early in a morning and so studiously avoid taking any body with herand that unless she had appointments to which she desired no witness it was very singular she should chuse to ramble about by herself from these observations and her evident confusion on seeing him they concluded that she had daily assignations with fitzedward they agreed that it would be no more than common justice to inform mr delamere of their discovery and this they determined to do as soon as they had certain proofs to produce with which they concluded a very little trouble and attention would furnish them james crofts whose success was now indisputable since of the handsome colonel there were no hopes was let into the secret of their suspicions and readily undertook to assist in detecting the intrigue for which he assured them he had particular talents while therefore mrs ashwood miss galton and james crofts were preparing to undermine the peace and character of the innocent ingenuous emmeline she and mrs stafford were meditating how to be useful to the unhappy lady adelina they became every day more interested and more apprehensive for the fate of that devoted young woman whose health seemed to be such as made it very improbable she should survive the birth of her child her spirits too were so depressed that they could not prevail on her to think of her own safety or to allow them to make any overtures to her family but in calm and hopeless languor she seemed resigned to the horrors of her destiny and determined to die unlamented and unknown her elder brother lord westhaven had returned from abroad almost immediately after her concealment his enquiries on his first arrival in england had only informed him of the embarrassment of trelawnys affairs and the inconvenience to which his sister had consequently been exposed and that after staying some time in england to settle things as well as she could she had disappeared and every body believed was gone to her husband his lordships acquaintance and marriage with augusta delamere almost immediately succeeded but while it was depending he was astonished to hear from lord and lady clancarryl that lady adelina had never written to them before her departure he went in search of fitzedward but could never meet him at home or obtain from his servants any direction where to find him fitzedward indeed purposely avoided him and had left no address at his lodgings in town or at tylehurst lord westhaven then wrote to trelawny but obtained no answer and growing daily more alarmed at the uncertainty he was in about lady adelina he determined to go as soon as he was married to switzerland being persuaded that tho some accident had prevented his receiving her letters she had found an asylum there amongst his mothers relations fitzedward with anxiety even more poignant had sought her with as little success after the morning when she discharged her lodgings and left them in an hackney coach with her maid he could never with all his unwearied researches discover any traces of her he knew she was not gone to trelawny and dreading every thing from her determined sorrow he passed his whole time between painful and fruitless conjectures and the tormenting apprehension of hearing of some fatal event incessantly reproaching himself for being the betrayer of his trust and the ruin of a lovely and amiable woman he gave himself up to regret and despondence the gay fitzedward so lately the envy and admiration of the fashionable world was lost to society his friends and himself he passed much of his time at tylehurst because he could there indulge without interruption his melancholy reflections and only saw mrs stafford and emmeline in whose soft and sensible conversation he found a transient alleviation of his sorrowsorrow which now grew too severe to be longer concealed and which he resolved to take the earliest opportunity of acknowledging in hopes of engaging the pity of his fair friendsperhaps their assistance in discovering the unhappy fugitive who caused it from lady adelina they had most carefully concealed that his residence was so near the obscure abode she had chosen fatal as he had been to her peace and conscientiously as she had abstained from naming him after their first conversation they knew that she still fondly loved him and that her fears for his safety had assisted her sense of rectitude when she determined to tear herself from him but were she again to meet him they feared she would either relapse into her former fatal affection or conquer it by an effort which in her precarious state of health might prove immediately fatal the request which fitzedward had made to emmeline that he might be allowed to see her and mrs stafford together without any other person being present they both wished to evade dreading least they should by their countenances betray the knowledge they had of his unhappy story and the interest they took in its catastrophe they hoped therefore to escape hearing his confession till lady adelina should be removedand to remove her became indispensibly necessary as emmeline was convinced she was watched in her visits to the cottage twice she had met james crofts within half a quarter of a mile of the cottage and at another time discovered just as she was about to enter it that the miss ashwoods had followed her almost to the door which she therefore forbore to enter these circumstances made both her and mrs stafford solicitous to have lady adelina placed in greater security and added to emmelines uneasiness for her was the unpleasant situation in which she found herself observed with malicious vigilance by mrs ashwood james crofts miss galton and the two misses she felt as awkward as if she really had some secret of her own to hide and with all the purity and even heroism of virtue learned the uneasy sensation which ever attends mystery and concealment the hours which used to pass tranquilly and rationally with mrs stafford were now dedicated to people whose conversation made her no amends and if she retired to her own room it failed not to excite sneers and suspicions she saw mrs stafford struggling with dejection which she had no power to dissipate or relieve and obliged to enter into frequent parties of what is called pleasure tho to her it gave only fatigue and disgust to gratify mrs ashwood who hated all society but a crowd james crofts indeed helped to keep her in good humour by his excessive adulation and chiefly by assuring her that by any man of the least taste the baby face of emmeline could be considered only as a foil to her more mature charms and that her fine dark eyes eclipsed all the eyes in the world he protested too against emmeline for affecting knowledgeit is said he a maxim of my fathersand my father is no bad judgethat for a woman to affect literature is the most horrid of all absurdities and for a woman to know any thing of business is detestable mrs ashwood laid by her dictionary determined for the future to spell her own way without it besides the powerful intervention of flattery james crofts had another not less successful method of winning the ladys favour he told her that his brother who had long cherished a passion in which he was at length likely to be disappointed was in that case determined never to marry that he was in an ill state of health and if he died without posterity the estate and title of his father would descend to himself the elder crofts very desirous of seeing a brother established who might otherwise be burthensome or inconvenient to him suggested this finesse and secured its belief by writing frequent and melancholy accounts of his own ill healthan artifice by which he promoted at once his brothers views and his own he affected the valetudinarian so happily and complained so much of the ill effect that constant application to business had on his constitution that nobody doubted of the reality of his sickness he took care that miss delamere should receive an account of it which he knew she would consider as the consequence of his despairing love and when he had interested her vanity and of course her compassion he contrived to obtain leave of absence for three months from the duties of his office in order to go abroad for the recovery of his health he hastened to barege and soon found means to reestablish himself in the favour of miss delamere from which absence and large draughts of flattery dispensed with french adroitness had a little displaced him this stratagem put his brother james on so fair a footing with the widow that he thought her fortune would be secured before she could discover it to be only a stratagem and that her lover was still likely to continue a younger brother james crofts seeing the necessity of dispatch became so importunate that mrs ashwood despairing of fitzedward and believing she might not again meet with a man so near a title for which she had a violent inclination was prevailed on to promise she would make him happy as soon as she returned to her own house it was now the end of june and lady adelina whose situation grew very critical had at length yielded to the entreaties of her two friends and agreed to go wherever they thought she could obtain assistance and concealment in the approaching hour mrs stafford and emmeline after long and frequent reflections and consultations on the subject concluded that no situation would be so proper as bath in a place resorted to by all sorts of people less enquiry is excited than in a provincial town where strangers are objects of curiosity to its idle inhabitants to bath therefore it was determined lady adelina should go but when the time of her journey and her arrangements there came to be discussed she expressed so much terror least she should be known so much anguish at leaving those to whose tender pity she was so greatly indebted and such melancholy conviction that she should not survive that the sensible heart of emmeline could not behold without sharing her agonies nor was mrs stafford less affected when they returned home after this interview emmeline was pursued by the image of the poor unhappy adelina but to give to the wretched only barren sympathy was not in her nature where more effectual relief was in her power she thought that if by her presence she could alleviate the anguish and soothe the sorrows of the fair mourner perhaps save her character and her life and be the means of restoring her to her family she should perform an action gratifying to her own heart and acceptable to heaven the more she reflected on it the more anxious she became to execute itand she at length named it to mrs stafford mrs stafford tho aware of the numberless objections which might have been made to such a plan could not resolve strenuously to oppose it she felt infinite compassion for lady adelina but could herself do little to assist her as her time was not her own and her absence must have been accounted for but emmeline was liable to no restraint and would not only be meritoriously employed in befriending the unhappy but would escape from the society at woodfield which became every day more disagreeable to her these considerations particularly the benevolent one of saving an unhappy young woman overbalanced in the mind of mrs stafford the objection that might be made to her accompanying a person under the unfortunate and discreditable circumstances of lady adelina and her heart too expansive to be closed by the cold hand of prudery against the sighs of weakness or misfortune assured her that she was right she knew that emmeline was of a character to pity but not to imitate the erroneous conduct of her friend and she believed that the reputation of lady adelina trelawny might be rescued from reproach without communicating any part of its blemish to the spotless purity of emmeline mowbray chapter ii as soon as emmeline had persuaded herself of the propriety of this plan and obtained mrs staffords concurrence she hinted her intentions to lady adelina who received the intimation with such transports of gratitude and delight that emmeline confirmed in her resolution no longer suffered a doubt of its propriety to arise and with the participation of mrs stafford only prepared for her journey which was to take place in ten days mrs stafford also employed a person on whom she could rely to receive the money due to lady adelina from her husbands estate but of this her ladyship demanded only half leaving the rest for trelawny the attorney in whose hands trelawnys affairs were placed by lord westhaven was extremely anxious to discover from the person employed by mrs stafford from whence he obtained the order signed by lady adelina and obliged him to attend several days before he would pay it in hopes by persuasions or artful questions to draw the secret from him he met at the attorneys chambers an officer who had made of him the same enquiry and had followed him home and since frequently importuned himintelligence which convinced mrs stafford that lady adelina must soon be discovered as they concluded the officer was fitzedward and made both her and emmeline hasten the day of her departure about a quarter of a mile from woodfield and at the extremity of the lawn which surrounded it was a copse in which the accumulated waters of a trout stream formed a beautiful tho not extensive piece of water shaded on every side by a natural wood mrs stafford who had particular pleasure in the place had planted flowering shrubs and caused walks to be cut through it and on the edge of the water built a seat of reeds and thatch which was furnished with a table and a few garden chairs thither emmeline repaired whenever she could disengage herself from company solitude was to her always a luxury and particularly desirable now when her anxiety for lady adelina and preparations for their approaching departure made her wish to avoid the malicious observations of mrs ashwood the forward intrusion of her daughters and the inquisitive civilities of james crofts she had now only one day to remain at woodfield before that fixed for their setting out and being altogether unwilling to encounter the fatigue of such an engagement so immediately previous to her journey she declined being of the party to dine at the house of a neighbouring gentleman who on the occasion of his sons coming of age was to give a ball and fête champêtre to a very large company mrs ashwood seeing emmeline averse took it into her head to press her extremely to go with them and finding she still refused saidit was monstrous rude and that she was sure no young person would decline partaking such an entertainment if she had not some very particular reason emmeline teized and provoked out of her usual calmness answeredthat whatever might be her reasons she was fortunately accountable to nobody for them mrs ashwood provoked in her turn made some very rude replies which emmeline not to irritate her farther left the room without answering and as soon as the carriages drove from the door she dined alone and then desiring one of the servants to carry her harp into the summerhouse in the copse she walked thither with her music books and soon lost the little chagrin which mrs ashwoods illbreeding had given her fitzedward who arrived in the country the preceding evening after another fruitless search for lady adelina walked over to woodfield in hopes as it was early in the afternoon that he might obtain in the course of it some conversation with mrs stafford and emmeline on arriving he met the servant who had attended emmeline to the copse and was by him directed thither as he approached the seat he heard her singing a plaintive air which seemed in unison with his heart she started at the sight of himmrs ashwoods suspicions immediately occurred to her and at the same moment the real motive which had made him seek this interview she blushed and looked uneasy but the innocence and integrity of her heart presently restored her composure and when fitzedward asked if she would allow him half an hour of her time she answeredcertainly he sat down by her dejectedly and in silence she was about to put aside her harp but he desired her to repeat the air she was singing it is sweetly soothing said he and reminds me of happier days when i first heard it while you sing it i may perhaps acquire resolution to tell you what may oblige you to discard me from your acquaintance it does indeed require resolution to hazard such a misfortune emmeline not knowing how to answer immediately began the air the thoughts which agitated her bosom while she sung made her voice yet more tender and pathetic she saw the eyes of fitzedward fill with tears and as soon as she ceased he said tell me miss mowbraywhat does the man deserve who being entrusted with the confidence of a young and beautiful womanbeautiful even as emmeline herself and as highly accomplishedhas betrayed the sacred trust and has been the occasionoh godof what misery may i not have been the occasion pardon me continued hei am afraid my despair frightens youi will endeavour to command myself emmeline found she could not escape hearing the story and endeavoured not to betray by her countenance that she already knew it fitzedward went on when first i knew you i was a decided libertine yourself and mrs stafford lovely as i thought you both would have been equally the object of my designs if delameres passion for you and the reserved conduct of mrs stafford had not made me doubt succeeding with either but for your charming friend my heart long retained its partiality nor would it ever have felt for her that pure and disinterested friendship which is now in regard to her its only sentiment had not the object of my present regret and anguish been thrown in my way to you miss mowbray i scruple not to speak of this beloved and lamented woman tho her name is sacred with me and has never yet been mentioned united with dishonour the connection between our families first introduced me to her acquaintance in her person she was exquisitely lovely and her manners were as enchanting as her form the sprightly gaiety of unsuspecting inexperience was i thought sometimes checked by an involuntary sentiment of regret at the sacrifice she had made by marrying a man every way unworthy of her except by that fortune to which she was indifferent and of which he was hastening to divest himself i had never seen mr trelawny and knew him for some time only from report but when he came to lough carryl my pity for her encreased in proportion to the envy and indignation with which i beheld the insensible and intemperate husbandincapable of feeling for her any other sentiment than what she might equally have inspired in the lowest of mankind her unaffected simplicity her gentle confidence in my protection during a voyage in which her illassorted mate left her entirely to my care made me rather consider her as my sister than as an object of seduction i resolved to be the guardian rather than the betrayer of her honourand i long kept my resolution fitzedward then proceeded to relate the circumstances that attended the ruin of trelawnys fortune and that lady adelina was left to struggle with innumerable difficulties unassisted but by himself to whom lord clancarryl had delegated the task of treating with trelawnys sister and creditors her gratitude continued he for the little assistance i was able to give her was boundless and as pity had already taught me to love her with more ardour than her beauty only captivating as it is would have inspired gratitude led her too easily into tender sentiments for me i am not a presuming coxcomb but she was infinitely too artless to conceal her partiality and neither her misfortunes or her being the sister of my friend godolphin protected her against the libertinism of my principles he went on to relate the deep melancholy that seized lady adelina and his own terror and remorse when he found her one morning gone from her lodgings where she had left no direction and from her proceeding it was evident she designed to conceal herself from his enquiries god knows pursued he what is now become of herperhaps when most in need of tenderness and attention she is thrown destitute and friendless among strangers and will perish in indigence and obscurity unused to encounter the slightest hardship her delicate frame and still more sensible mind will sink under those to which her situation will expose herperhaps i shall be doubly a murderer he stopped from inability to proceedemmeline in tears continued silent struggling to conquer his emotion and recover his voice fitzedward at length continued while i was suffering all the misery which my apprehension for her fate inflicted her younger brother william godolphin returned from the west indies where he has been three years stationed i was the first person he visited in town but i was not at my lodgings there before i returned from tylehurst he had informed himself of all the circumstances of trelawnys embarrassments and his sisters absence he found letters from lord westhaven and from my brother lord clancarryl who knowing he would about that time return to england conjured him to assist in the attempt of discovering lady adelina of whose motives for concealing herself from her family they were entirely ignorant while it filled them with uneasiness and astonishment as soon as i went back to london godolphin of whose arrival i was ignorant came to me he embraced me and thanked me for my friendship and attention to his unfortunate adelinai think if he had held his sword to my heart it would have hurt me less he implored me to help his search after his lost sister and again said how greatly he was obliged to mewhile i conscious how little i deserved his gratitude felt like a coward and an assassin and shrunk from the manly confidence of my friend since our first meeting i have seen him several times and ever with new anguish i have loved godolphin from my earliest remembrance and have known him from a boy to have the best heart and the noblest spirit under heaven equally incapable of deserving or bearing dishonour godolphin will behold me with contempt which tho i deserve i can not endure he must call me to an account and the hope of perishing by his hand is the only one i now cherish yet unable to shock him by divulging the fatal secret i have hitherto concealed it and my concealment he must impute to motives base infamous and pusillanimous i can bear such reflections no longeri will go to town tomorrow explain his sisters situation to him and let him take the only reparation i can now make him emmeline shuddering at this resolution could not conceal how greatly it affected her generous and lovely miss mowbray pardon me for having thus moved your gentle nature and allow me since i see you pity me to request of you and mrs stafford a favour which will probably be the last trouble the unhappy fitzedward will give you it may happen that lady adelina may hereafter be discoveredtho i know not how to hope it but if your generous pity should interest you in the fate of that unhappy forlorn young woman yours and mrs staffords protection might yet perhaps save her and such interposition would be worthy of hearts like yours as the event of a meeting between me and godolphin is uncertain shall i entreat you my lovely friend to take charge of this paper it contains a will by which the child of lady adelina will be entitled to all i die possessed of it is enough if the unfortunate infant survives to place it above indigence lord clancarryl will not dispute the disposition of my fortune and to your care and that of mrs stafford i have left it in trust and i have entreated you to befriend the poor little one who will probably be an orphanbut desolate and abandoned it will not be if its innocence and unhappiness interest you to grant my request delamere will not object to your goodness being so exerted and you will not teach it generous gentle as you are to hold in abhorrence the memory of its father this is all i can now do farewell dearest miss mowbrayheaven give you happiness ma douce amie farewell these last words in which fitzedward repeated the name by which he was accustomed to address emmeline quite overcame her he was hastening away while hardly able to speak she yet made an effort to stop him the interview he was about to seek was what lady adelina so greatly dreaded yet emmeline dared not urge to him how fatal it would be to her she knew not what to say least he should discover the secret with which she was entrusted but in breathless agitation caught his hand as he turned to leave her crying hear me fitzedward one moment hear me do not go to meet captain godolphin i conjure i implore you do not she found it impossible to proceed her eyes were still eagerly fixed on his face she still held his hand while he supposing her extreme emotion arose from the compassionate tenderness of her nature found the steadiness of his despair softened by the soothing voice of pity and throwing himself on his knees he laid his head on one of the chairs and wept like a woman emmeline who now hoped to persuade him not to execute the resolution he had formed saidi will take the paper you have given me fitzedward and will most religiously fulfil all your request in it to the utmost extent of my power but in return for my giving you this promise i must insist at this moment james crofts stood before them emmeline shocked and amazed at his appearance roused fitzedward by a sudden exclamation he started up and said fiercely to croftswell sirhave you any commands here commands sir answered crofts somewhat alarmed by the tone in which this question was puti have no commands to be sure sirbut but i came sir just to enquire after miss mowbray i did not mean to intrude then sir returned the colonel i beg you will leave us oh certainly sir cried crofts trying to regain his courage and assume an air of raillerycertainlyi would not for the world interrupt you my business indeed is not at all materialonly a compliment to miss mowbrayyours added he sneeringly is i see of more consequence look ye mr crofts sharply answered fitzedwardyou are to make no impertinent comments miss mowbray is mistress of her actions she is in my particular protection on behalf of my friend delamere and i shall consider the slightest failure of respect to her as an insult to me sir if you have nothing more to say you will be so good as to leave us there was something so hostile in the manner in which fitzedward delivered this speech that james crofts more at home in the cabinet than the field thought he might as well avoid another injunction to depart and quietly submit to the present rather than provoke farther resentment from the formidable soldier he therefore looking most cadaverously made one of his jerking bows and said with something he intended for a smile well well good folks ill leave you to your tête a tête and hasten back to my engagement every body regrets miss mowbrays absence from the ball and the partner that was provided for her is ready to hang himself an impatient look darted from fitzedward stopped farther effusion of impertinence and he only addedservant servant and walked away fitzedward then turning towards emmeline saw her pale and faint why my dear miss mowbray do you suffer this mans folly to affect you your looks really terrify me oh he was sent on purpose cried emmelinemrs ashwood has lately often hinted to me that whatever are my engagements to delamere i was much more partial to you she has watched me for some time and now on my refusing to accompany them to the ball concluded i had an appointment and sent crofts back to see if i thought so sternly answered fitzedward i would instantly overtake him and i believe i could oblige him to secresy no for heavens sake dont said emmelinefor heavens sake do not think of it i care not what they conjectureleave them to their malicecrofts is not worth your anger but fitzedward let us return to what we were talking of will you promise me to delay going to londonto delay seeing mr godolphin untilin short will you give me your honour to remain at tylehurst a week without taking any measures to inform godolphin of what you have told me i will at the end of that time either release you from your promise or give you unanswerable reasons why you should relinquish the design of meeting him at all fitzedward however amazed at the earnestness she expressed to obtain this promise gave it he had no suspicion of emmelines having any knowledge of lady adelina and accounted for the deep interest she seemed to take in preventing an interview by recollecting the universal tenderness and humanity of her character he assured her he would not leave tylehurst till the expiration of the time she had named he conjured her not to suffer any impertinence from crofts on the subject of their being seen together but to awe him into silence by resentment emmeline now desired him to leave her but she still seemed under such an hurry of spirits that he insisted on being allowed to attend her to the door of the house where renewing his thanks for the compassionate attention she had afforded him and entreating her to compose herself he left her emmeline intending to go to her own room went first into the drawing room to deposit her music book she had hardly done so when she heard a mans step and turning beheld crofts open the door which he immediately shut after him i thought sir said emmeline you had been gone back to your company no not yet my fair emmeline i wanted first to beg your pardon for having disturbed so snug a party ah sly little prudewho would think that you who always seem so cold and so cruel made an excuse only to stay at home to meet fitzedward but it is not fair little dear that all your kindness should be for him while you will scarce give any other body a civil look now i have met with you i swear ill have a kiss too emmeline terrified to death at his approaching her with this speech flew to the bell which she rang with so much violence that the rope broke from the crank now cried crofts if nobody hears you are more than ever in my power heaven forbid shrieked emmeline in an agony of fear let me go mr crofts this moment she would have rushed towards the door but he stood with his arms extended before it you did not run thusyou did not scream thus when fitzedward the fortunate fitzedward was on his knees before you then you could weep and sigh too and look so sweetly on him but comeyou see i know so much that it will be your interest little dear to make me your friend rather let me apply to fiends and furies for friendship hateful detestable wretch by what right do you insult and detain me oh these theatricals are really very sublime cried he seizing both her hands which he violently grasped she shrieked aloud and fruitlessly struggled to break from him when the footsteps of somebody near the door obliged him to let her go she darted instantly away and in the hall met one of the maids lord miss cried the servant did you ring ive been all over the house to see what bell it was emmeline without answering flew to her own room the maid followed her but desirous of being left alone she assured the girl that nothing was the matter that she was merely tired by a long walk and desiring a glass of water tried to compose and recollect herself while crofts unobserved returned to the house where the fête was given time enough to dress and dance with mrs ashwood it was at her desire that immediately after dinner crofts had left the company under pretence of executing a commission with which she easily furnished him but his real orders were to discover the motives of emmelines refusal to be of the party this he executed beyond his expectation it was no longer to be doubted that very good intelligence subsisted between emmeline and fitzedward since he had been found on his knees before her while she earnestly yet kindly speaking hung over him with tears in her eyes knowing that emmeline was absolutely engaged to delamere he was persuaded that fitzedward was master of her heart and that the tears and emotion to which he had been witness were occasioned by the impossibility of her giving him her hand he knew fitzedwards character too well to suppose he could be insensible of the ladys kindness and possessing himself a mind gross and depraved he did not hesitate to believe all the ill his own base and illiberal spirit suggested tho interested hypocrite as he was he made every other passion subservient to the gratification of his avarice crofts had not coldly beheld the youth and beauty of emmeline he had however carefully forborne to shew that he admired her and would probably never have betrayed what must ruin him for ever with mrs ashwood had not the conviction of her partiality to fitzedward inspired him with the infamous hope of frightening her into some kindness for himself by threatening to betray her stolen interview with her supposed lover the scorn and horror with which emmeline repulsed him served only to mortify his self love and provoke his hatred towards her and the man whom he believed she favoured and with the inveterate and cowardly malignity of which his heart was particularly susceptible he determined to do all in his power to ruin them both chapter iii such was the horror and detestation which emmeline felt for crofts that she could not bear the thoughts of seeing him again but as she feared mrs stafford might resent his behaviour and by that means embroil herself with the vain and insolent mrs ashwood with whom she knew stafford was obliged to keep on a fair footing she determined to say as little as she could of his impertinence to mrs stafford but to withdraw from the house without again exposing herself to meet him as soon as she saw her the next morning she related all that had passed between fitzedward and herself and after a long consultation they agreed that to prevent his seeing godolphin was absolutely necessary and that no other means of doing so offered but mrs staffords relating to him the real circumstances and situation of lady adelina as soon as she could be removed from her present abode and precautions taken to prevent his discovering her this mrs stafford undertook to do immediately after their departure it was to take place on the next day and emmeline with the concurrence of her friend determined that she would take no leave of the party at woodfield for tho the appearance of mystery was extremely disagreeable and distressing to emmeline she knew that notice of her intentions would excite enquiries and awaken curiosity very difficult to satisfy and that it was extremely probable james crofts might be employed to watch her and by that means render abortive all her endeavours to preserve the unhappy lady adelina relying therefore on the generosity and innocence of her intentions she chose rather to leave her own actions open to censure which they did not deserve than to risk an investigation which might be fatal to the interest of her poor friend she took nothing with her mrs stafford undertaking every necessary arrangement about her cloathsand having at night taken a tender leave of this beloved and valuable woman and promised to write to her constantly and to return as soon as the destiny of lady adelina should be decided they parted and emmeline arising before the dawn of the following morning set out alone to woodbury foresta precaution absolutely necessary to evade the inquisitive watchfulness of james crofts she stole softly down stairs before even the servants were stirring and opening the door cautiously felt some degree of terror at being obliged to undertake so long a walk alone at such an hour but innocence gave her courage and friendly zeal lent her strength as she walked on her fears subsided she saw the sun rise above the horizon and her apprehensions were at an end as no carriage could approach within three quarters of a mile of the house where lady adelina was concealed they were obliged to walk to the road where mrs stafford had directed a post chaise to wait for them which she had hired at a distant town where it was unlikely any enquiry would be made long disuse as she had hardly ever left the cottage from the moment of her entering it and the extreme weakness to which she was reduced made emmeline greatly fear that lady adelina would never be able to reach the place with her assistance and that of her ladyships woman slowly and faintly she walked thither and emmeline saw her happily placed in the chaise every thing had been before settled as to the conveyance of the servant and baggage and to engage the secresy of the woman with whom she had dwelt by making her silence sufficiently advantageous and as they hoped that no traces were left by which they might be followed the spirits of the fair travellers seemed somewhat to improve as they proceeded on their journeyemmeline felt her heart elated with the consciousness of doing good and from the tender affection and assistance of such a friend which could be considered only as the benevolence of heaven itself lady adelina drew a favourable omen and dared entertain a faint hope that her penitence had been accepted they arrived without any accident at bath the following day and emmeline leaving lady adelina at the inn went out immediately to secure lodgings in a retired part of the town as soon as it was dark lady adelina removed thither in a chair and was announced by emmeline to be the wife of a swiss officer to be herself of switzerland and to bear the name of mrs st laurewhile she herself as she was very little known continued to pass by her own name in the few transactions which in their very private way of living required her name to be repeated when mrs ashwood found that emmeline had left woodfield clandestinely and alone and that mrs stafford evaded giving any account whither she was gone by saying coldly that she was gone to visit a friend in surrey whom she formerly knew in wales all the suspicions she had herself harboured and miss galton encouraged seemed confirmed james crofts had related not without exaggerations what he had been witness to in the copse and it was no longer doubted but that she was gone with fitzedward which at once accounted for her departure and the sudden and mysterious manner in which it was accomplished james crofts had suspicions that his behaviour had hastened it but he failed not to confirm mrs ashwood in her prepossession that her entanglement with fitzedward was now at a period when it could be no longer concealedintelligence which was to be conveyed to delamere the elder crofts who had been some time with lady montreville and her daughter had named delamere from time to time in his letters to his brother the last mentioned that he was now with his mother and sister who were at nice and who purposed returning to england in about three months crofts represented delamere as still devoted to emmeline and as existing only in the hope of being no longer opposed in his intention of marrying her in march when the year which he had promised his father to wait expired but that lady montreville as time wore away grew more averse to the match and more desirous of some event which might break it off crofts gave his brother a very favourable account of his progress with miss delamere and hinted that if he could be fortunate enough to put an end to delameres intended connection it would so greatly conciliate the favour of lady montreville that he dared hope she would no longer oppose his union with her daughter and when once they were married and the prejudices of the mother to an inferior alliance conquered he had very little doubt of lord montrevilles forgiveness and of soon regaining his countenance and friendship this account from his brother added another motive to those which already influenced the malignant and illiberal mind of james crofts to injure the lovely orphan and he determined to give all his assistance to mrs ashwood in the cruel project of depriving her at once of her character and her lover in a consultation which he held on this subject with his promised bride and miss galton the ladies agreed that it was perfectly shocking that such a fine young man as mr delamere should be attached to a woman so little sensible of his value as emmeline that it had long been evident she was to him indifferent and it was now too clear that she was partial to another and that therefore it would be a meritorious action to acquaint him of her intimacy with fitzedward and it could not be doubted but his knowledge of it would high spirited as he was cure him effectually of his illplaced passion and restore the tranquillity of his respectable family hiding thus the inveterate envy and malice of their hearts under this hypocritical pretence they next considered how to give the information which was so meritorious anonymous letters were expedients to which miss galton had before had recourse and to an anonymous letter they determined to commit the secret of emmelines infidelitywhile james crofts in his letters to his brother was to corroborate the intelligence it contained by relating as mere matter of news what had actually and evidently happened emmelines sudden departure from woodfield delamere when he saw his mother out of danger at barege had returned to the neighbourhood of paris where he had lingered some time in hopes that emmeline would accede to his request of being allowed to cross the channel for a few days but her answer in which she strongly urged the hazard he would incur of giving his father a pretence to withdraw his promise by violating his own had obliged him tho with infinite reluctance to give up the scheme and being quite indifferent where he was if he was still at a distance from her he had yielded to the solicitations of lady montreville and rejoined her at nice there he now remained while every thing in england seemed to contribute to assist the designs of those who wished to disengage him from his passion for emmeline the day after emmelines departure with lady adelina fitzedward went to woodfield and hearing that miss mowbray had suddenly left it was thrown into the utmost astonishmentastonishment which mrs ashwood and miss galton observed to each other was the finest piece of acting they had ever seen the whole party were together when he was introduceda circumstance mrs stafford would willingly have avoided as it was absolutely necessary for her to speak to him alone and determined to do so whatever construction the malignity of her sisterinlaw might put upon it she said i have long promised you colonel a sight of the two pieces of drawing which miss mowbray and i have finished as companions they are now framed and if you will come with me into my dressingroom you shall see them as the rest of the company had frequently seen these drawings there was no pretence for their following mrs stafford who accompanied by the colonel went to her dressing room a conference thus evidently sought by mrs stafford excited the eager and painful curiosity of the party in the parlour now would i give the world cried mrs ashwood to know what is going forward is it not possible to listen enquired crofts equal to any meanness that might gratify the malevolence of another or his own yes replied mrs ashwood if one could get into the closet next the dressingroom without being perceived which can only be done by passing thro the nursery if indeed the nursery maids and children are out it is easy enough they are out mama i assure you cried miss ashwood for i saw them myself go across the lawn since ive been at breakfast do pray let us go and listeni long of all things to know what my aunt stafford can have to say to that slylooking colonel no no child said her mother i shall not send you indeedbut crofts do you think we should be able to make it out egad answered he ill tryfor depend upon it the mischief will out it will be rare to have such a pretty tale to tell mr delamere of his demurelooking little dearill venture mrs ashwood then shewing him the way he went on tip toe up stairs and concealing himself in a light closet which was divided from the dressing room only by lath and plaister he lent an attentive ear to the dialogue that was passing it happened however that the window near which mrs stafford and fitzedward were sitting was exactly opposite to that side of the room to which crofts hidingplace communicated and tho the room was not large yet the distance the partition and the low voice in which both parties spoke made it impossible for him to distinguish more than broken sentences from mrs stafford he heardcould not longer be concealedin all probability may now remain unknownthe child i will myself attend to from fitzedward he could only catch indistinct sounds his voice appearing to be lost in his emotion but he seemed to be thanking mrs stafford and lamenting his own unhappiness his last speech in which his powers of utterance were returned wasnothing can ever erase the impression of your angelic goodness best and loveliest of friendsoh continue it i beseech you to those for whom only i am solicitous and forgive all the trouble i have given you he then hurried away mrs stafford after remaining alone a moment as if to compose herself went back to the parlour and crofts who thought he had heard enough tho he wished to have heard all slunk from his closet and walked into the garden where being soon afterwards joined by mrs ashwood and miss galton he by relating the broken and disjointed discourse he had been witness to left not a doubt remaining of the cause of emmelines precipitate retreat from woodfield and perhaps minds more candid than theirsminds untainted with the odious and hateful envy which ulcerated theirs might from the circumstances that attended her going and fitzedwards behaviour have conceived disadvantageous ideas of her conduct but such was the uneasiness with which mrs ashwood ever beheld superior merit and such the universal delight which miss galton took in defamation that had none of those circumstances existed they would with equal malignity have studied to ruin the reputation of emmeline and probably with equal successfor against such attacks innocence however it may console its possessor is too frequently a feeble and inadequate defence while the confederates exulting in the certainty of emmelines ruin were manufacturing the letter which was to alarm the jealous and irascible spirit of delamere fitzedward from whom mrs stafford before she would tell him any thing had extorted a promise that he would enquire no farther than what she chose to relate to him was relieved from insupportable anguish by hearing that lady adelina was in safe hands but he lamented in bitterness of soul the despondency and affliction to which mrs stafford had told him she entirely resigned herself he knew not that emmeline was with her whatever he might suspect and mrs stafford had protested to him that if he made any attempt to discover the residence of lady adelina or persisted in meeting her brother she would immediately relinquish all concern in the affair and no longer interest herself in what his rashness would inevitably render desperate he solemnly assured her he would take no measures without her knowledge and remained at tylehurst secluded from every body and waiting in fearful and anxious solicitude to hear of lady adelina by mrs stafford delamere still at nice with his mother who with different sources of uneasiness thought the days and weeks insupportably long in which he lived only in the hope of seeing emmeline at the end of six months was roused from his involuntary resignation by the following letter written in a hand perfectly unknown to him sir a friend to your worthy and noble family writes this which is meant to serve you and to undeceive you in regard to miss mowbraywho without any gratitude for the high honour you intend her is certainly too partial to another person she is now gone from woodfield to escape observation and none but mrs stafford is let into the secret of where she is you will judge what end it is to answer but certainly none that bodes you good one would have supposed that the colonels being very often her attendant at woodfield might have made her stay there agreeable enough but perhaps for i do not aver it the young lady has some particular reasons for wishing to have private lodgings no doubt the colonel is a man of gallantry but his friendship to you is rather more questionable the writer of this having very little knowledge of the parties can have no other motive than the love of justice and being sorry to see deceit and falsehood practised on a young gentleman who deserves better and who has a respectful tho unknown friend in y z london july this infamous scroll had no sooner been perused by delamere than fury flashed from his eyes and anguish seized his heart but the moment the suddenness of his passion gave way to reflection the tumult of his mind subsided and he thought it must be an artifice of his mothers to separate him from emmeline the longer he considered her inveterate antipathy to his marriage the more he was convinced that this artifice unworthy as it was she was capable of conceiving and by means of the crofts executing if she hoped by it to put an eternal conclusion to his affection he at length so entirely adopted this idea that determining to be revenged and love her better for it and to settle the matter very peremptorily with the crofts if they had been found to interfere he obtained a tolerable command over his temper and his features and joined lady montreville and miss delamere whom he found reading letters which they also had received from england his mother asked slightly after his and in a few moments mr crofts arrived asking with his usual assiduity after the health of lord montreville and that of such friends as usually wrote to her ladyship she answered his enquiriesand then desired to hear what news sir richard or his other correspondents had sent him my fathers letters said he contain little more than an order to purchase some particular sort of wine which he is very circumstantial as usual in telling me how to forward safely he adds indeed that he can allow my absence no longer than until the th of septemberhe sighed and looked tenderly at miss delamere i have no other letters continued he but one from james and does he tell you no news asked lady montreville nothing answered crofts carelessly but gossip which i believe would not entertain your ladyship oh why should you fancy that returned sheyou know i love to hear news tho about people i never saw or ever wish to see james has been at mr staffords at woodfield said he where your ladyship has certainly no acquaintance at woodfield sir cried delamere unable to express his anxietyat woodfieldand what does he say of woodfield i dont recollect any thing very particular answered crofts carelesslyi believe i put the letter into my pocket he took it out read it to us croftssaid miss delamere i have lately passed a very agreeable month at woodfield we were a large party in the house among other pleasant circumstances during my stay there was a ball and fête champêtre given by mr conway on his sons coming of age it was elegant and well conducted beyond any entertainment of the sort i ever saw there were forty couple and a great number of very pretty women but it was agreed on all hands that miss mowbray would have eclipsed them all who unluckily declined going she left woodfield a day or two afterwards delameres countenance changedcrofts as if looking for some other news in his letter hesitated then smiled and went on the gossip fame has made a match for me with mrs ashwood i wish she may be right in some other of her stories i really think her wrong so i will not be the means of their circulation the rest said crofts putting up the letter is only about my fathers new purchases and other family affairs delamere who in spite of his suspicions of crofts treachery could not hear this corroboration of his anonymous letter without a renewal of all his fears left the room in doubt suspence and wretchedness the seeds of jealousy and mistrust thus skilfully sown could hardly fail of taking root in an heart so full of sensibility and a temper so irritable as his again he read over his anonymous letter and compared it with the intelligence which seemed accidentally communicated by crofts and with a fearful kind of enquiry compared the date and circumstances he dared hardly trust his mind with the import of this investigation and found nothing on which to rest his hope but that it might be a concerted plan between his mother and crofts his heart alternately swelling between the indignation such a supposition created and shrinking with horror from the idea of perfidy on the part of emmeline kept him in such a state of mind that he could hardly be said to possess his reason but when he remembered how often his extreme vivacity had betrayed him into error and hazarded his losing for ever all he held valuable on earth he tried to subdue the acuteness of his feelings and to support at least without betraying it the anguish which oppressed him till the next pacquet from england when it was possible a letter from emmeline herself might dissipate his doubts resolutely however resolving to call crofts to a serious account if he found him accessory to a calumny so dark and diabolical when the next post from england arrived he saw among the letters which were delivered to him one directed by the hand of emmeline he flew to his own room and with trembling hands broke the seal it was short and he fancied unusually cold towards its close she mentioned that she was going to bath for a few weeks with a friend and as she did not know where she should lodge thought he had better not write till she was again fixed at woodfield that she should go to bath in july with a nameless friend and quit so abruptly her beloved mrs staffordthat she should apparently wish to evade his letters and make her actual residence a secretwere a cloud of circumstances calculated to persuade him that some mystery involved her conduct a mystery which the fatal letter served too evidently to explain as if fire had been laid to the train of combustibles which had since the receipt of it been accumulating in the bosom of delamere his furious and uncontroulable spirit now burst forth a temporary delirium seized him he stamped round the room and ran to his pistols which fortunately were not charged the noise he made brought millefleur into the room whom he instantly caught by the collar and shaking him violently cried scoundrelwhy are not these pistols loaded eh eh monsieur exclaimed millefleur almost strangledque voudriez vousvos pistoletsmon dieu que voudriez vous avec vos pistolets shoot you perhaps you blockhead raved delamere pushing furiously from him the trembling valetthen snatching up the pistols he half kicked half pushed him out of the room and throwing them after him ordered him to clean and load them after which he locked the door and threw himself upon the bed the resolution he had made in his cooler moments never again to yield to such impetuous transports of passion was now forgotten he could not conquer he could not even mitigate the tumultuous anguish which had seized him but seemed rather to call to his remembrance all that might justify its excess he remembered how positively emmeline had forbidden his returning to england tho all he asked was to be allowed to see her for a few hours he recollected her long and invincible coldness her resolute adherence to the promise she need not have given and forgetting all the symptoms which he had before fondly believed he had discovered of her returning his affection he exaggerated every circumstance that indicated indifference and magnified them into signs of absolute aversion tho he could not forget that fitzedward had assisted him in carrying emmeline away and had on all occasions promoted his interest with her that recollection did not at all weaken the probability of his present attachment for such was delameres opinion of fitzedwards principles that he believed he was capable of the most dishonourable views on the mistress or even on the wife of his friend he tortured his imagination almost to madness by remembering numberless little incidents which tho almost unattended to at the time now seemed to bring the cruellest conviction of their intelligenceparticularly that on the night he had taken emmeline from clapham fitzedward was found there tho neither his father or himself who had repeatedly sent to his lodgings could either find him at home or get any direction where to meet with him almost all his late letters too had been dated from tylehurst where it was certain he had passed the greatest part of the summerfitzedward fond of society and courted by the most brilliant circles shut himself up in a country house distant from all his connections and to what could such an extraordinary change be owing if not to his attachment to emmeline mowbray irritated by these recollections he gave himself up to all the dreadful torments of jealousyjealousy even to madness and he felt this corrosive passion in all its extravagance it was violent in proportion to his love and his pride and more insupportably painful in proportion to its novelty for except once at swansea when he fancied that emmeline in her flight was accompanied by fitzedward he had never felt it before however they might serve him as a pretence rochely and elkerton were both too contemptible to excite it the night approached and without having regained any share of composure he had at length determined to quit nice the next day that his mother and crofts might not be gratified with the sight of his despair and triumph in the detected perfidy of emmeline lady montreville and her daughter were out when the letters arrived and he now apprehended that when they returned millefleur might alarm them by an account of his frantic behaviour and that they would guess it to have been occasioned by his letters from england starting up therefore he called the poor fellow to him who was not yet recovered from his former terrifying menaces and who approached trembling the table where delamere sat his dress disordered his eyes flashing fire and his lips pale and quivering come here sir sternly cried he millefleur sprung close to the table have you cleaned and loaded my pistols monsieurje je moccupaisje jemonsieur ils sont fool of what are you afraidwhat does the confounded poltron tremble for mais monsieurcest quequemais monsieur je ne scais tenez mr millefleur said delamere sharplyremember what i am going to say something has happened to vex me and i shall go out tomorrow for a few days or perhaps i may go to england my mother is to know nothing of it but what i shall myself tell her therefore at your peril speak of what has happened this evening or of my intentions for tomorrow come up immediately and put my things into my portmanteaus and put my fire arms in order i shall take you with me david need not be prepared till tomorrow i shall go on horseback and shall want him also the least failure on your part of executing these orders you will find very inconvenientyou know i will not be trifled with millefleur frightened to death at the looks and voice of his master dared not disobey and delamere employing him in putting up his cloaths till after lady montreville came in was he thought secure of his secresy he then made an effort tho a successless one to hide the anguish that devoured him and went down to supper he found that besides their constant attendant crofts his mother and sister were accompanied by two other english gentlemen and a french man of fashion and his sister who full of the vivacity and gaiety of their country kept up a lively conversation with miss delamere and the englishmen but delamere hardly spokehis eyes were wild and inflamedhis cheeks flushedand deep sighs seemed involuntarily to burst from his heart lady montreville observed him and then said surely frederic you are not well not very well said he but i am otherwise merely from the intolerable heat i have had the headache all day the headache exclaimed his motherwhy then do you not go to bed no answered he i am better up since the heat is abated i am in less pain i will take a walk by the fine moon that i see is rising and be back again presentlyand tomorrow continued hetomorrow i shall go northward for a month i can not stay under this burning atmosphere then desiring the company not to move on his account he arose from table and hastened away do my good crofts said lady montrevilledo follow frederiche frightens me to deathhe is certainly very ill crofts hesitated a moment being in truth afraid to interfere with delameres ramble while he was in a humour so gloomy but on her ladyships repeating her request dared not shew his reluctance he went out therefore under pretence of following him while the party present seeing lady montrevilles distress almost immediately departed crofts walked on without much desire to fulfill his commission for delamere whenever he was obliged to associate with him treated him generally with coldness and sometimes rudely there was however very little probability of his overtaking him for delamere had walked or rather run to a considerable distance from the street where his mother lived and then wandering farther into the fields had thrown himself upon the grass and had forgotten every thing but emmelineemmeline and fitzedward gone togetherthe mistress on whom he had so fondly doatedthe friend whom he had so implicitly trusted these cruel images drest in every form most fatal to his peace tormented him and the agony of disappointed passion seemed to have affected his brain deep groans forced their way from his oppressed hearthe cursed his existence and seemed resolutely bent in the gloominess of his despair to shake it off and free himself from sufferings so intolerable to the first effusions of his phrenzy a sullen calm more alarming succeeded he fixed his eyes on the moon which shone above him but had no idea of what he saw or where he was his breath was short his hands clenched he seemed as if having lost the power of complaint he was unable to express the pain that convulsed his whole frame while he continued in this situation a favourite little spaniel of his mothers of which he had from a boy been fond ran up to him and licked his hands and face the caresses of an animal he had so long remembered touched some chord of the heart that vibrated to softer emotions than those which had for the last three hours possessed himhe burst into tears felix said he sobbing poor felix the dog rejoicing to be noticed ran barking round him and presently afterwards with hurried steps came miss delamere leaning on the arm of crofts my god exclaimed she almost screaming here he is oh frederic you have so terrified my mother and mr crofts has been two hours in search of you had it not been for the dog we should not now have found you mr crofts has returned twice to the house without you mr crofts may return then a third time said delamere and cease to give himself such unnecessary trouble but you will come with us brothersurely you will now come home at my leisure replied he sternlylady montreville need be under no apprehensions about me i shall be at home presently but i will not be importuned i will not be watched and followed and above all i will not have a governor so saying he turned from them and walked another way while they seeing him so impracticable could only return to report what they had seen to lady montreville delamere however who had taken another way entered the house at the same moment lady montreville had strictly questioned millefleur as to the cause of his masters disorder and the poor fellow who dared not relate the furious passion into which he had fallen on reading his letter trembled prevaricated stammered and looked so white that her ladyship more alarmed fancied she knew not what and full of terror had sent out crofts a second time and the servants different ways in search of her son at length crofts returning the second time without success miss delamere went with him herself and the dog following her led her to her brother but before their return lady montrevilles apprehensions had arisen to such an height that a return of her fits seemed to threaten her and with difficulty was she brought to her senses when she saw him before her and when he moved by the keenness of her sorrow at his imaginary danger assured her in answer to her repeated enquiries that he was merely affected by the heat that he had no material complaint and should be quite well and in his usual spirits when he returned from the excursion he proposed going upon the next day then being somewhat appeased his mother suffered him to retire and called her counsellor mr crofts to debate whether in such a frame of mind she ought to allow the absence of delamere crofts advised her by all means to let him go he suspected indeed that the anonymous letter had occasioned all the wild behaviour he had been witness to and thought it very likely that delamere might be going to england but he knew that james crofts and his fair associates were prepared for the completion of their project if he did and his absence was on account of crofts own affairs particularly desirable for these reasons he represented to lady montreville that opposition would only irritate and inflame her son without inducing him to stay he departed therefore the next morning without any impediment on the part of his mother but was yet undecided whither to go while crofts no longer thwarted by his observation or humbled by his haughty disdain managed matters so well that in spite of the pride of noble blood in spite of her reluctance to marry a commoner he conquered and silenced all the scruples and objections of miss delamere and a young english clergyman a friend of his coming to nice as both he and crofts declared by the meerest accident in the world just about that time crofts obtained her consent to a private marriage and his friend took especial care that no form might be wanting to enable him legally to claim his bride on their return to england chapter iv emmeline had now been near a month at bath whence she had not written to delamere she had seldom done so oftener than once in six or eight weeks and no reason subsisted at present for a more frequent correspondence far from having any idea that he would think her temporary removal extraordinary she had not attempted to conceal it from him and of his jealousy of fitzedward she had not the remotest suspicion for tho mrs ashwoods hints and the behaviour of james crofts had left no doubt of their ill opinion of her yet she never supposed them capable of an attempt to impress the same idea on the mind of delamere and had no notion of the variety of motives which made the whole family of the crofts with which mrs ashwood was now connected solicitous to perpetuate the evil by propagating the scandalous story they had themselves invented unconscious therefore of the anguish which preyed upon the heart of her unhappy lover emmeline gave her whole attention to lady adelina and she saw with infinite concern the encreasing weakness of her frame with still greater pain she observed that by suffering her mind to dwell continually on her unhappy situation it was no longer able to exert the powers it possessed and that sunk in hopeless despondence her intellects were frequently deranged amid these alienations of reason she was still gentle amiable and interesting and as they were yet short and slight emmeline flattered herself that the opiates which her physician in consequence of the restless and anxious nights lady adelina had for some time passed found it absolutely necessary to administer might have partly if not entirely occasioned this alarming symptom still however the busy imagination of emmeline perpetually represented to her impending sorrow and her terror hourly encreased she figured to herself the decided phrenzy or the death of her poor friend and unable to conquer apprehensions which she was yet compelled to conceal she lived in a continual effort to appear chearful and to soothe the wounded mind of the sufferer by consolatory conversation while she watched her with an attention so sedulous and so painful that only the excellence of her heart which persuaded her she was engaged in a task truly laudable could have supported her thro such anxiety and fatigue she was however very desirous that as mr godolphin was now in england he might be acquainted with his sisters calamitous and precarious situation and she gently hinted to lady adelina how great a probability she thought there was that such a man as her brother was represented to be would in her sorrow and her suffering forget her error but by the most distant idea of such an interview she found lady adelina so violently affected that she dared not again urge it and was compelled in fearful apprehension to await the hour which would probably give the fair penitent to that grave where she seemed to wish her disgrace and affliction might be forgotten to describe the anxiety of emmeline when that period arrived is impossible or the mingled emotions of sorrow and satisfaction pleasure and pity with which she beheld the lovely and unfortunate infant whose birth she had so long desired yet so greatly dreaded lady adelina had till then wished to die she saw her childand wished to livethe physical people who attended her gave hopes that she mightsupported by the tender friendship of emmeline and animated by maternal fondness she determined to attempt it emmeline now full of apprehension now indulging feeble hopes prayed fervently for her recovery and zealously and indefatigably attended her with more than her former solicitude for three days her hopes gradually grew stronger when on the evening of the third as she was sitting alone by the side of the bed where lady adelina had fallen into a quiet sleep she suddenly heard a sort of bustle in the next room and before she could rise to put an end to it a gentleman to whom she was a stranger walked hastily into that where she was on seeing her he started and said i beg your pardon madambut i was informed that here i might find lady adelina trelawny the name of trelawny thus suddenly and loudly pronounced awakened lady adelina she started upundrew the curtainand fixing her eyes with a look of terrified astonishment on the stranger she exclaimed faintlyoh my brothermy brother william then sunk back on her pillow to all appearance lifeless mr godolphin now springing forward caught the cold and insensible hand which had opened the curtain and throwing himself on his knees cried adelina my love are you illhave i then terrified and alarmed you speak to medear adelinaspeak to me emmeline whose immediate astonishment at his presence had been lost in terror for his sister had flown out of the room for the attendants and now returning cried you have killed her sirshe is certainly deadoh my god the sudden alarm the sudden sight of you has destroyed her i am afraid it has exclaimed godolphin wildly and hardly knowing what he saidi am indeed afraid it has my poor sistermy unhappy devoted adelinahave i then found you only to destroy you but perhaps continued he after a moments pause during which emmeline and the nurse were chafing the hands and temples of the dying patientperhaps she may recover send instantly for advicerunflylet me go myself for assistance he would now have run out of the room but emmeline whose admirable presence of mind this sudden scene of terror had not conquered stopped him stay sir said she i beseech you stay you know not whither to go i will instantly send those who do she then left the room and ordered a servant to fetch the physician for she dreaded least mr godolphin should discover the real name and quality of the patient to those to whom he might apply and on returning to the bed side where lady adelina still lay without any signs of existence and by which her brother still knelt in speechless agony her fears were again alive least when the medical gentlemen arrived his grief and desperation should betray the secret to them while her first apprehension was for the life of her friend these secondary considerations were yet extremely alarmingfor she knew that should lady adelina recover her life would be for ever embittered if not again endangered by the discovery which seemed impending and almost inevitable the women who were about her having now applied every remedy they could think of without success began loudly to lament themselves emmeline commanding her own anguish besought them to stifle theirs and not to give way to fruitless exclamations while there was yet hope but to continue their endeavours to recover their lady then addressing herself to mr godolphin she roused him from the stupor of grief in which he had fallen while he gazed with an impassioned and agonizing look on the pale countenance of his sister pardon me sir said she if i entreat you to go down stairs and await the arrival of the advice i have sent for should my poor friend recover your presence may renew and encrease the alarm of her spirits and embarrass her returning recollection and should she not recover you had better hear such mournful tidings in any place rather than this oh if i do hear them answered he wildly it matters little where but i will withdraw madam since you seem to desire it he had hardly seen emmeline before he now turned his eyes mournfully upon herit is i presume miss mowbray said he who thus with an angels tenderness in an angels form would spare the sorrows of a stranger emmeline unable to speak led the way down to the parlour and godolphin silently followed her go back said he tremulously as soon as they reached the roomgo back to my sister your tender assiduity may do more for her than the people about her your voice your looks will soothe and tranquillize her should she awaken from her long insensibility ah tell her her brother came only to rescue her from the misery of her unworthy lottell her his affection his brotherly affection hopes to give her consolation and restore herif it may yet beto her repose but go dearest miss mowbray gosomebody comes inperhaps the physician emmeline now opening the parlour door found it to be indeed the physician she expected and with a fearful heart she followed him informing him as they went up stairs that the sudden appearance of mrs st laures brother whom she had not seen for two or three years had thrown her into a fainting fit from which not all their endeavours had recovered her he remonstrated vehemently against the extreme indiscretion of such an interview emmeline who knew not by what strange chain of circumstances it had been brought about had nothing to reply so feeble were the appearances of remaining life that the physician could pronounce nothing certainly in regard to his patient he gave however directions to her attendants but after every application had been used all that could be said was that she was not actually dead as soon as the physician had written his prescription and retired emmeline recollected the painful state of suspense in which she had left mr godolphin and trying to recover courage to go thro the painful scene before her she went down to him as she opened the door he met her i have seen the doctor said he in a broken and hurried voiceand from his account i am convinced adelina is dying i hope not faintly answered emmeline there is yet a possibility tho i fear no great probability of her recovery my adelina resumed he walking about the roommy adelina for whose sake i so anxiously wished to return to englandgracious god i am come too late to assist her some strange mystery surely hangs over her long lost to all her friends i find her here dying the sight of me instead of relieving her sorrow seems to have accelerated her dissolution and you madam to whose goodness she appears to be so greatly indebtedmay i ask by what fortunate circumstance lost and obscure as she has been she has acquired such a friend emmeline shuddering at the apprehension of enquiries she found it impossible to answer was wholly at a loss how to reply to this she knew not of what mr godolphin was informedof what he was ignorant and dreaded to say too much or to be detected in a false representation she therefore agitated and hesitating gravely said it is not now a time sir to ask any thing relative to lady adelina i am myself too ill to enter into conversation and wish as you have been yourself greatly affected that you would now retire and endeavour to make yourself as easy as you can tomorrow may perhaps afford us more chearful prospectsor at least this cruel suspense will be over and the dear sufferer at peace she sobbed and turned away godolphin rising said in a faultering voice yes i will go since my stay can only encrease the pain of that generous and sensible heart i will gobut not to resti can not rest but do you try most amiable creature to obtain some reposetry i beseech you to recover your spirits which have been so greatly hurried he knew not what he said and was hastening out of the room when emmeline recollecting how ardently lady adelina had desired the concealment of her name and family stopped him as he was quitting her yet one thing captain godolphin allow me to entreat of you what can i refuse you answered he returning onlyare you known at bath probably i may it is above three years since i was in england and much longer since i have been here but undoubtedly some one or other will know me then do indulge me in one request see as few people as you can and if you accidentally meet any of your friends do not say that lady adelina is here not meet any one if i can avoid itand if i do not speak of my sister and why is all thiswhy this concealment this mysterywhy emmeline absolutely overcome sat down without speaking godolphin seeing her uneasiness said but i will not distress you madam by farther questions your commands shall be sufficient i will stifle my anxiety and obey you then bowing respectfully he addedtomorrow at as early an hour as i dare hope for admittance i shall be at the door heaven bless and reward the fair and gentle miss mowbrayand may it have mercy on my poor adelinahe sighed deeply and left the house lady adelina tho not so entirely insensible was yet but little amended but as what alteration there was was for the better emmeline endeavoured to recall her own agitated and dissipated spirits the extraordinary scene which had just passed was still present to her imagination the last words of godolphin still vibrated in her ears fair and gentle miss mowbray repeated she he knows my name yet seems ignorant of every thing that relates to his sister her astonishment at this circumstance was succeeded by reflecting on the unpleasant task she must have if mr godolphin should again enquire into her first acquaintance with his sister to relate to him the melancholy story she had heard would she found be an undertaking to which she was wholly unequal and she was equally averse to the invention of a plausible falsehood from this painful apprehension she meditated how to extricate herself but the longer she thought of it the more she despaired of it the terrors of such a conversation hourly augmented and wholly and for ever to escape from it she sometimes determined to write but from executing that design was withheld by considering that if godolphin was of a fiery and impetuous temper he would probably without reflection or delay fly to vengeance and precipitate every evil which lady adelina dreaded after having exhausted every idea on the subject she could think of nothing on which her imagination could rest but to send to mrs stafford acquaint her with the danger of lady adelina and conjure her if possible to come to her this she knew she would do unless some singular circumstance in her own family prevented her attention to her friends resolved to embrace therefore this hope she dispatched an hasty billet by an express to woodfield and then betook herself to a bed on the floor which she had ordered to be placed by the side of that where lady adelina in happy tho dangerous insensibility still seemed to repose almost in the arms of death emmeline could not however obtain even a momentary forgetfulness tho she could not repent her attention to the unhappy lady adelina she was yet sensible of her indiscretion in having put herself into the situation she was now in the cruel unfeeling world would she feared condemn her and of its reflections she could not think without pain but her heart her generous sympathizing heart more than acquittedit repaid her towards the middle of the night lady adelina who had made two or three faint efforts to speak sighed and again in faint murmurs attempted to explain herself emmeline started up and eagerly listened and in a low whisper heard her ask for her child emmeline ordered it instantly to be brought and those eyes which had so lately seemed closed for ever were opened in search of this beloved object then as if satisfied in beholding it living and well they closed again while she imprinted a kiss on its little hand she then asked for emmeline who delighted with this apparent amendment prevailed on her to take what had been ordered for her she appeared still better in a few moments but was yet extremely languid i have had a dreadful dream my emmeline said she at lengtha long and dreadful dream but it is goneyou are here my poor little boy too is well and this alarming vision will i hope haunt me no more emmeline who feared that the dream was indeed a reality exhorted her to think only of her recovery of which added she cheerfully we have no longer any doubt comfortable and consoling angel sighed lady adelinayour presence is surely safety do not leave me emmeline promised not to quit the room and elate with hopes of her friends speedy restoration to health fell herself into a tranquil and refreshing slumber on awakening the next morning she found lady adelina much better but still whenever she spoke dwelling on her supposed dream and sometimes talking with that incoherence which had for some weeks before so greatly alarmed her her own dread of meeting godolphin was by no means lessened and to prevent an immediate interview she dispatched to him a note sir i am happy in having it in my power to assure you that our dear patient is much better but as uninterrupted tranquillity is absolutely necessary that and other considerations induce me to beg you will forbear coming hither to day you may depend on having hourly intelligence and that we shall be desirous of the pleasure of seeing you when the safety of my friend admits it i have the honour to be sir your most humble servant emmeline mowbray sept to this note mr godolphin answered if miss mowbray will only allow me to wait on her for one moment in the parlour i will not again trespass on her time till i have her own permission w g this request emmeline was obliged with whatever reluctance to comply with she therefore sent a verbal acquiescence and repaired to the bedside of lady adelina who had asked for her will you pardon my folly my dear emmeline said she languidlybut i can not be easy till i have told you what a strange idea has seized me i seemed last night i know not at what time to be suddenly awakened by a voice which loudly repeated the name of trelawny startled by the sound i thought i undrew the curtain and saw my brother william who stood looking angrily on me i felt greatly terrified and growing extremely sick i lost the vision but now again its recollection harrasses my imagination and the image of my brother sterner and with a ruder aspect than he was wont to wear still seems present before me oh he was accustomed to be all goodness and gentleness and to love his poor adelina but now he too will throw me from himhe too will detest and despise meor perhaps continued she after a short pauseperhaps he is dead i am not superstitiousbut this dream pursues me emmeline who had hoped that the very terror of this sudden interview had obliterated its remembrance said every thing she thought likely to quiet her mind and to persuade her that the uneasy images represented in her imperfect slumbers were merely the effect of her weakness and perturbed spirits the impression however was too strong to be effaced by arguments it still hung heavy on her heart irritated the fever which had before been only slight and deprived her almost entirely of sleep or if she slept she again fancied herself awakened by her brother angrily repeating the name of trelawny sometimes starting in terror from these feverish dreams she called on her brother to pardon and pity her sometimes in piercing accents deplored his death and sometimes besought him to spare fitzedward these incoherences were particularly distressing as names were often heard by the attendants which emmeline hoped to have concealed and it was hardly possible longer to deceive the physician and apothecary who attended her with an uneasy heart and a countenance pensively expressive of its feelings she went down to receive captain godolphin in the parlour i fear miss mowbray said he as soon as they were seated you will think me too ready to take advantage of your goodness but there is that appearance of candour and compassion about you that i determined rather to trust to your goodness for pardon than to remain longer in a state of suspense about my sister which i have already found most insupportable in the note you honoured me with to day you say she is better is she then out of danger has she proper advice she has the best advice sir i can not however say that she is out of danger butshe hesitated and knew not how to proceed butyou hope rather than believe she will recover cried godolphin eagerly i both hope it and believe it mr godolphin you yesterday did me the honour to suppose i had been fortunate enough to be of some service to lady adelina suffer me to take advantage of a supposition so flattering and to claim a sort of right to ask in my turn a favour surely i shall consider it as an honour to receive and as happiness to obey any command of miss mowbrays promise me then to observe the same silence in regard to your sister as i asked of you last night trust me with her safety and believe it will not be neglected but you must neither speak of her to others or question me about her good god from whence can arise the necessity for these precautions what dreadful obscurity surrounds her what am i to fear what am i to suppose you will not then said emmeline gravelyyou will not oblige me by desisting from all questions till this trifling restraint can be taken off i will i do promise to be guided wholly by you and to bear however difficult it may be the suspense the frightful suspense in which i must remain tell me however that adelina is not in immediate danger but but added he as if recollecting himself may i not apply for information on that head to her physician not for the world answered emmeline with unguarded quicknessnot for the world not for the worldrepeated godolphin with an accent of astonishment heaven and earth but i have promised to ask nothingi must obeyand will now release you madam godolphin then took his leave and emmeline whose heart had throbbed violently throughout this dialogue sat down alone to compose and recollect herself she saw that to keep godolphin many days ignorant of the truth would be impossible and from the eager anxiety of his questions she feared that all the horrors lady adelinas troubled imagination had represented would be realizedapprehensions which seemed armed with new terror since she had seen and conversed with this william godolphin of whose excellent heart and noble spirit she had before heard so much both from lady adelina and fitzedward and whose appearance seemed to confirm the favourable impression those accounts had given her godolphin who was now about five and twenty had passed the greatest part of his life at sea the various climates he had visited had deprived his complexion of much of its english freshness but his face was animated by dark eyes full of intelligence and spirit his hair generally carelessly dressed was remarkably fine and his person tall light and graceful yet so commanding that whoever saw him immediately and involuntarily felt their admiration mingled with respect his whole figure was such as brought to the mind ideas of the race of heroes from which he was descended his voice was particularly grateful to the ear and his address appeared to emmeline to be a fortunate compound of the insinuating softness of fitzedward with the fire and vivacity of delamere of this however she could inadequately judge as he was now under such depression of spirits and however pleasing he appeared emmeline who conceived herself absolutely engaged to delamere thought of him only as the brother of lady adelina yet insensibly she felt herself more than ever interested for the event of his hearing how little fitzedward had deserved the warm friendship he had felt for him and her thoughts dwelling perpetually on that subject magnified the painful circumstances of the approaching éclaircissemen while her fears for lady adelinas life who continued to languish in a low fever with frequent delirium so harrassed and oppressed her that her own health was visibly affected but without attending to it she passed all her hours in anxiously watching the turns of lady adelinas disorder or when she could for a moment escape in giving vent to her full heart by weeping over the little infant whose birth so similar to her own seemed to render it to her a more interesting and affecting object she lamented the evils to which it might be exposed tho of a sex which would prevent its encountering the same species of sorrow as that which had embittered her own life of her friendless and desolate situation she was never more sensible than now she felt herself more unhappy than she had ever yet been and would probably have sunk under her extreme uneasiness had not the arrival of mrs stafford at the end of three days relieved her from many of her fears and apprehensions chapter v mrs stafford no sooner heard from emmeline that godolphin was yet ignorant of the true reason of lady adelinas concealment than she saw the necessity of immediately explaining it and this task however painful she without hesitation undertook he was therefore summoned to their lodgings by a note from emmeline who on his arrival introduced him to mrs stafford and left them together when with as much tenderness as possible and mingling with the mortifying detail many representations of the necessity there was for his conquering his resentment she at length concluded it watching anxiously the changes in godolphins countenance which sometimes expressed only pity and affection for his sister sometimes rage and indignation against fitzedward both the brothers of lady adelina had been accustomed to consider her with peculiar fondness the unfortunate circumstance of her losing her mother immediately after her birth seemed to have given her a melancholy title to their tenderness and the resemblance she bore to that dear mother whom they both remembered and on whose memory their father dwelt with undiminished regret endeared her to them still more to these united claims on the heart and the protection of william godolphin another was added equally forcible in a letter written by his father with the trembling hand of anxious solicitude when he felt himself dying and when looking back with lingering affection on the children of her whom he hoped soon to rejoin he saw with anguish his youngest daughter liable from her situation to deviate into indiscretion and surrounded by the numberless dangers which attend on a young and beautiful woman whose husband has neither talents to attach her affections or judgment to direct her actions lord westhaven conscious of her hazardous circumstances and feeling in his last moments the keenest anguish in knowing that his mistaken care had exposed her to them hoped by interesting both her brothers to watch over her that he should obviate the dangers he apprehended he had therefore in all their conversations recommended her to his eldest son and as he was not happy enough to embrace the younger before he died had addressed to him a last letter on the same subject such were the powerful ties that bound mr godolphin to love and defend lady adelina with more than a brothers fondness hastening therefore to obey the dying injunctions of his father and in the hope of rendering the life of this beloved sister if not happy at least honourable and contented he had heard that she had clandestinely absented herself from her family and after a long search had found her abandoned to remorse and despair her reputation blasted her health ruined her intellects disordered and all by the perfidy of a man in whom he from long friendship and his sister from family connection had placed unbounded confidence tho godolphin had one of the best tempers in the worlda temper which the roughness of those among whom he lived had only served to soften and humanize and which was immovable by the usual accidents that ruffle others yet he had also in a great excess all those keen feelings which fill a heart of extreme sensibility added to a courage that in the hour of danger had been proved to be as cool as it was undaunted of him might be said what was the glorious praise of immortal bayardthat he was sans peur et sans reproche and educated with a high sense of honour himself as well as possessing a heart calculated to enjoy and a hand to defend the unblemished dignity of his family all his passions were roused and awakened by the injury it had sustained from fitzedward and he beheld him as a monster whom it was infamy to forgive hardly therefore had mrs stafford concluded her distressing recital than as if commanding himself by a violent effort he thanked her warmly yet incoherently for her unexampled goodness to his sister recommended her still to her generous care and the friendship of miss mowbray and without any threat against fitzedward or even a comment on what he had heard arose to depart but mrs stafford more alarmed by this determined tho quiet resentment and by the expression of his countenance than if he had burst into exclamations and menaces perceived that the crisis was now come when he must either be persuaded to conquer his just resentment or by giving it way destroy while he attempted to revenge the fame of his sister she besought him therefore to sit down a moment and when he had done so she told him that if he really thought himself under any obligations to miss mowbray or to her for the services they had been so fortunate as to render lady adelina his making all they had been doing ineffectual would be a most mortifying return and such must be the case if he rashly flew to seek vengeance on fitzedward for that you have such a design continued she i have no doubt allow me however to suppose that i have by doing your sister some good offices acquired a right to speak of her affairs surely answered mr godolphin you have and surely i must hear with respect and attention tho possibly not with conviction every opinion with which you may honour me she then represented to him with all the force of reason how little he could remedy the evil by hazarding his own life or by taking that of fitzedward at present continued she the secret is known only to me miss mowbray and lady adelinas woman if it is farther exposed the heirs of mr trelawny who are so deeply interested will undoubtedly take measures to prove that the infant has no just claim to the estate they so eagerly expect mr trelawnys sister has already entertained suspicions which the least additional information would give her grounds to pursue and the whole affair must then inevitably become public surely this consideration alone should determine youwhy then need i urge others equally evident and equally forcible godolphin acknowledged that there was much of truth in the arguments she used but denied that any consideration should influence him to forgive the man who had thus basely and ungenerously betrayed the confidence of his family however added he again checking the heat into which he feared a longer conversation on this subject might betray himi have not yet madam absolutely formed the resolution of which you seem so apprehensive and am indeed too cruelly hurt to be able to talk longer on the subject suffer me therefore once more to bid you a good day but the encreasing gloom of his countenance and forced calm of his manner appeared to be symptoms so unfavourable that mrs stafford thought there was no hope of being able to prevent an immediate and fatal meeting between him and fitzedward but by engaging him in a promise at least to delay it this she attempted by the most earnest arguments and the most pressing persuasions but all she could obtain was an assurance that he would remain at bath till the next day and see her again in the evening in the mean time the delirium of lady adelina which had recurred at intervals ever since the transient sight she had of her brother more frequently and with more alarming symptoms returned and the fever which had at first threatened the loss of her life now seemed to be fixing on her brain and to menace by a total deprivation of reason reducing her to a condition to which death itself must be preferable she still even in her wildest wanderings knew emmeline and still caressed her little boy but much of her time passed in incoherent and rambling discourse in which she talked of fitzedward and her brother william and held with them both imaginary dialogues sometimes she deprecated the wrath of her elder brother and then her disordered fancy ran to the younger to him from whom she had in her early life found pity and protection in all her little sorrows mrs stafford thought it too hazardous to let her again see her brother while her intellects were thus disarranged as she trembled lest she should start into actual madness but it was absolutely necessary to do something not only because mr godolphins impatience made every delay dangerous but because it was hardly possible to keep the secret from the physicians and attendants who had already heard much more than they ought to have known she determined therefore after consulting with emmeline to introduce godolphin into the room adjoining to that where lady adelina now sat some hours every day in an easy chair the affecting insanity of his unhappy sister and the mournful and pathetic entreaties she frequently used were likely in the opinion of the fair friends to effectuate more than their most earnest persuasions and prevail on him to drop all thoughts of that resentment which could not cure but might encrease her calamities mrs stafford had heard from him that he gained information as to the place of his sisters residence from the mother of lady adelinas woman who being the reduced widow of a clergyman resided in the bishops almshouses at bromley where her daughter frequently sent her such assistance as her own oeconomy or the bounty of her lady enabled her to supply a few weeks before she had sent her a note for ten pounds and not apprehending that an enquiry would be made of her had desired her to acknowledge the receipt of it and direct to her at bath where she said her lady was with a miss mowbray lady clancarryl among many expedients to recover traces of her sister had at length recollected this widow and had desired mr godolphin to make immediate enquiry of her he had hastened therefore to bromley and easily found the poor woman who was paralytic and almost childish her letters were read for her by one of her neighbours a person who being present at the arrival of mr godolphin immediately found that something was to be got and busily put into his hands the very letter which had enclosed the note and which contained the direction he eagerly copied the address and leaving a handsome present for the use of the old widow he delayed not a moment to set out for bath where he soon found the house and where he had enquired for lady adelina trelawny the servant of the house who opened the door assured him no such person was there he supposed that for some reason or other she was denied and insisting on being allowed to go up stairs had entered the room in the abrupt manner which had so greatly alarmed his sister in hopes of counteracting the fatal effects of the discovery which had unavoidably followed this interview godolphin was on his return in the afternoon introduced into the diningroom which opened into lady adelinas bedchamber the door was ajar the partition thin and mrs stafford was pretty well assured that the poor patient would be heard distinctly godolphin came in pale from the conflict of his mind and all his features expressed anger and sorrow with which he seemed vainly struggling he bowed and sat down in silence mrs stafford only was in the room and as soon as he was seated said in a low voice yet with forced chearfulness well sir i hope that miss mowbray and myself have prevailed on you to drop at present every other design than the truly generous one of healing the wounded heart of our fair unfortunate friend and shall he who has wounded it slowly and sternly replied godolphinshall he who has wounded it so basely escape me at this instant lady adelina who had been some time silent exclaimed hastilyoh spare him my dear brother and spare your poor adelina who will not troublewho will not disgrace you long where is she said godolphin startinggood god what is it i hear your unhappy sister answered mrs stafford whom the idea of your determined vengeance has already driven to distraction again lady adelina spoke her brother listened in breathless anguish ah williamand are you grown cruel you on whom i depended for pity and protection surely said he surely she knows i am here no answered mrs stafford she knows nothing but this fear has incessantly pursued her and since she saw you she dwells more frequently on it tho her erring memory sometimes wanders to other objects it is very true my lord cried lady adelina with affected calmness her thoughts wavering again towards lord westhavenit is all very true i have deserved all your reproaches i am ready to make all the atonement i can then you will both of you my brothers be satisfiedfor william has told me that if i died he should be content for then all might be forgotten she ended with a deep sigh and godolphin wildly starting from his seat said this is too much you can not expect me to bear thislet me go to her would you go then answered mrs stafford to confirm her fears and to drive her to deeper desperation if you see her it must be to soothe and comfort her to assure her of your forgiveness and that you will bury your resentment against accursed doubly accursed be the infamous villain who has driven her to this and must i bear it tamely oh injured memory of my fatheroh my poor undone sister he walked about the room the tears ran from his eyes and mrs stafford fearing that his hurried step and deep sobs would be heard by lady adelina determined to bring the scene to a crisis and not to lose the influence she hoped she had gained on his mind she therefore went into the other room and shutting the door advanced with a smile towards the lovely lunatic what will you say my dear adelina if i bring you the best news you can possibly hear news repeated lady adelina looking at her with eyes which too plainly denoted her unsettled mindnewsah dear madam i know very well that all the world is happy but me and if you are happy i am very glad but as to medo you indeed think it is reasonable i should part with him with whom said mrs stafford why one condition which they insist upon is that i should give up my poor little one to them and never ask to see him again william was the most urgent for thiswilliam who used to be so good so gentle so compassionate to every body alas he is now more cruel and relentless than the rest so far from it said mrs stafford your brother william loves you as much as ever he will come and tell you so himself if you will only be composed and talk less strangely to see me exclaimed she as if suddenly recovering her recollectionoh whenwherehow but again it forsook her and she continued ah he comes perhaps to tell me of the blood he has spilt and to load me with reproaches for having obliged him to destroy a friend whom he once loved if that is indeed so why let him come and plunge another dagger in this poor heart which has always loved him she was silent a moment and then languidly went on i thought some time since that i saw him and miss mowbray was with him but it was only a dream for i know he is in jamaica and when he does come home he will harden his heart against mehe will be my judge and sternly will he judge mehe will forget that he is my brother never my poor adelina cried godolphin rushing into the room never can i forget that i am your brothernever can i cease to feel for you compassion and tenderness he would have taken her in his arms but struck by the dreadful alteration that appeared in her face and figure he stopt short and looking at her with silent horror seemed incapable of uttering what he felt she knew him but could neither speak or shed a tear for some moments at length she held out to him her emaciated hand it is indeed william said she he seems too very sorry for me my dear brother do you then pardon and pity the poor adelina both both answered godolphin sobbing and seating himself by her he threw his arms round her and her pale cheek rested on his bosom while her eyes were fixed on his face stay exclaimed she after a momentary pause and disengaging herself suddenly from himstay i have yet another question if i dared ask it do you know all and have you no blood to answer for on my account will you assure me you will not seek it for mercys sake said mrs stafford satisfy her mr godolphinsatisfy her at onceyou see to what is owing this alienation of her reason no reassumed the afflicted adelina you need not answer me i see you cannotwill not forgive name him not adelina sternly and quickly answered hemy soul recoils at his idea i can not i will not promise any thing at this period emmeline who was unwilling to trust the servants in such a moment entered with the infant of lady adelina sleeping in her arms see said mrs stafford a little unfortunate creature whose innocence must surely plead forcibly to you he comes to join our intreaties to you to spare his mother emmeline laid the infant in the lap of lady adelina who was yet unable to shed a tear godolphin beheld it with mingled horror and pity but the latter sentiment seemed to predominate and emmeline whose voice was calculated to go to the heart began to try its influence and imploring him to be calm and to promise his sister an eternal oblivion of the past she urged every argument that should convince him of its necessity and every motive that could affect his reason or his compassion he gazed on her with reverence and admiration while she spoke and seemed greatly affected by what she said animated by the hope of success her eyes were lightened up with new brilliancy and her glowing cheeks and expressive features became more than ever attractive a convulsive laugh from lady adelina interrupted her and drew the attention of godolphin entirely to his sister emmeline who saw her reason again forsaking her took the sleeping baby from her lap she had hardly done so before trying to rise from her chair she shrieked aloudfor again the image of fitzedward dying by the hand of her brother was before her see cried she see there he lieshe is already expiring yet william forgives him not what would you strike him again now while he is dyinggo cruel cruel brother attempting to put godolphin from hergooh touch me not with those polluted hands they are stained with human blood a convulsive shudder and a deep sigh seemed to exhaust all her remaining strength and she fell back in her chair pale and faint and with fixed unmeaning eyes appeared no longer conscious even of the terrors which pursued her but the look of incurable anguish which her features wore the wild import of her words and the sight of the unfortunate child who seemed born only to share her wretchedness could not long be beheld unmoved by a heart like godolphins which possessed all that tenderness that distinguishes the truly brave again he threw his arms round his sister and sobbing said hear me adelinahear me and be tranquil i will promise to be guided by your excellent friendsi will do nothing that shall give pain to them or to you thank god exclaimed emmeline that you at last hear reason remember this promise is given to us all it is answered godolphin but try to make poor adelina sensible of it she no longer understood any thing but with her eyes shut and her hands clasped in each other was at least quiet i can not bear it continued godolphini must go for a few moments to recover myself he then left the room desiring emmeline to comfort and compose his sister who soon afterwards asked hastily what was become of him emmeline pleased to find she had a clear recollection of his having been with her now told her that he had most solemnly assured them he would think no more of seeking fitzedward on account of this unhappy affair as she seemed still in fearful apprehension to doubt the reality of this promise godolphin who was only in the next room with mrs stafford returned and assured her of his pity his forbearance and his forgiveness after some farther efforts on the part of emmeline and protestations on that of godolphin tears which had been long denied to lady adelina came to her relief she wept caressed her infant and blessed and thanked her brother and her friends when capable of recollection she knew that towards those whom he had once pardoned he was incapable of reproach or unkindness and her mind eased of the fears which had so long harrassed it seemed to be recovering its tone still however the sense of her own incurable unhappiness her own irretrievable unworthiness and the disgrace of having sullied the honour of her family and given pain to such a brother overwhelmed her with grief and confusion while her reason as it at intervals returned served only to shew her the abyss into which she had fallen and she sometimes even regretted those hours of forgetfulness when she possessed not the power of steady reflection and when the sad reality was obliterated by wild and imaginary horrors footnote without fear and without reproach chapter vi some few days elapsed before there was any great alteration for the better in lady adelina but the incessant attention of her friends the soothing pity of her brother and the skill of her physician slowly conquered the lurking fever which had so long hung about her and her intellects tho still disordered at times were more collected and gave reason to hope that she would soon entirely recover in the mean time captain godolphin communicated to mrs stafford the resolution he had taken about his sister he said that she should renounce for ever all claim on the trelawny estate except only the stipend settled on her as a consideration for the fortune she was to receive at the death of the dowager lady westhaven and which was only three hundred a year a sum which he thought made her but a paltry and inadequate compensation for having passed two years in the society of such a man as trelawny he added that he had a house in the isle of wight almost all the patrimony his father had been able to give him where as his ship was now out of commission he proposed residing himself and whither he should insist upon lady adelinas retiring without any future attempt to see or correspond with fitzedward as to the child he asked if mrs stafford would have the goodness to see that it was taken care of at some cottage in her neighbourhood till he could adjust matters with the trelawny family and put an end to all those fears which might tempt them to enquire into its birth after which he said he would take it to his own house and call it a son of his own a precaution that would throw an obscurity over the truth which would hardly ever be removed when none were particularly interested to remove it these designs he desired mrs stafford to communicate to lady adelina and as she was obliged to return home in two days she took the earliest opportunity of doing so to the conditions her brother offered lady adelina thought herself most happy to consent the little boy was immediately baptized by the name of william godolphin and his unfortunate mother now began to flatter herself that her disastrous history might be concealed even from her elder brother lord westhaven of whose indignation and resentment she had ever the most alarming apprehensions but while the hope of escaping them by her brother williams generous compassion gave to her heavy sorrows some alleviation they were renewed with extreme poignancy by the approaching separation from her inestimable friends mrs stafford could no longer delay her return to her family and emmeline who now saw lady adelina out of danger and in the protection of her brother was desirous of accompanying her back to woodfield lady adelina ineffectually tried to bear this early departure with some degree of fortitude and resolution nor was it her heart alone that felt desolate and unhappy at its approachthat of her brother had received an impression from the mental and personal perfections of emmeline which being at first deep had soon become indelible and ignorant of her engagement he had indulged it till he found it no longer possible for him to forbear making her the first object of his life and that the value of his existence depended wholly on her emmeline was yet quite unconscious of this but mrs stafford had seen it almost from the first moment of her seeing godolphin in their frequent conversation she observed that the very name of emmeline had the power of fascination that he was never weary of hearing her praises that whenever he thought himself unobserved his eyes were in pursuit of her while fondly gazing on her face he seemed to drink deep draughts of intoxicating passion mrs stafford who knew what ardent and fatal love such excellence of person and understanding might produce in a heart susceptible of all their power was alarmed for the happiness of this amiable man and with regret saw him nourishing an affection which she thought must be entirely hopeless these apprehensions every hours observation encreased yet mrs stafford determined not to communicate them to emmeline but to put an end to the flattering delusion which led on godolphin to indulge his passion by telling him as soon as possible of the engagement emmeline had formed with mr delamere accident soon furnished her with an opportunity while they were all sitting together after dinner a packet of letters was brought in and among others which were forwarded to mrs stafford from woodfield was one for emmeline mrs stafford gave it to her sayingfrom france by the post mark emmeline replied that it was she changed colour as she opened it from mr delamere enquired mrs stafford no answered she it is from lady westhaven your brother and her ladyship are well continued she addressing herself to mr godolphin and are at paris where they propose staying till lady montreville and miss delamere join them as they come to england and when are they expected said godolphin in about a month replied emmeline but lord and lady westhaven do not propose to return till next springthey only pass a few days all together at paris and where is mr delamere wandering to significantly and smilingly asked mrs stafford lady westhaven says only answered emmeline blushing and casting down her eyes that he has left lady montreville and is they believe gone to geneva however reassumed mrs stafford we shall undoubtedly see him in england in march emmeline in still greater embarrassment answered two or three other questions which godolphin asked her about his brother and soon after left the room godolphin who saw there was something relative to delamere with which he was unacquainted had a confused idea immediately occur to him of his attachment and the pain it gave him was so acute that he wished at once to know whether it was well founded why does mr delamere certainly return in march said he addressing himself to mrs stafford rather than with his mother to fulfil his engagement gravely and coldly replied she of what nature is it asked he mrs stafford then related the history of delameres long and violent passion for emmeline and the reluctant consent he had wrung from lord and lady montreville together with the promise obtained from miss mowbray while mrs stafford was making this recital she saw by the variations of godolphins countenance that she had too truly guessed the state of his heart expressive as his features were it was not in his power to conceal what he felt in being convinced that he had irrecoverably fixed his affections on a woman who was the destined wife of another and awaking from the soft visions which hope had offered to certain despondence he found himself too cruelly hurt to be able to continue the conversation and after a few faint efforts which only betrayed his internal anguish he hurried away such however was the opinion mrs stafford conceived of his honour and his understanding that she had no apprehension that he would attempt imparting to the heart of emmeline any portion of that pain with which his own was penetrated and she hoped that absence and reflection together with the conviction of its being hopeless would conquer this infant passion before it could gather strength wholly to ruin his repose she was glad that their departure was so near and hastened it as much as possible the short interval was passed in mournful silence on the part of godolphinon that of lady adelina in tears and regret while emmeline who was herself sensible of great pain in the approaching parting struggled to appear chearful and mrs stafford attempted tho without much success to reconcile them all to a separation which was become as necessary as it was inevitable at length the hired coach in which they were to return to woodfield was at the door lady adelina unable to speak to either of them brought her little boy in her arms and passionately kissing him gave him into those of emmeline then taking a hand of each of her friends she pressed them to her throbbing heart and hastened to conceal the violence of her sorrow in her own room godolphin approached to take leave he kissed the hand of mrs stafford and inarticulately expressed his thanks for her goodness to his sister i know continued he i need not recommend to you this poor infant the same generosity which prompted you to save his mother will effectually plead for him and secure for him your protection till i can take him to that of his own family and you miss mowbray said he turning to emmeline and taking her handmost amiable loveliest of human creatures where shall i find words to thank you as i ought his emotion was too great for utterance emmeline felt it but too sensibly and hastening into the coach to hide how much she was herself affected she could only say all happiness attend you sir remind lady adelina of my hopes of soon hearing from her mrs stafford being then seated and the servant who had been hired to attend the infant following her the coach drove from the door godolphin pursued it with his eyes to the end of the street and then as if deprived of all that made life desirable he gave himself up to languor and despondence afraid of examining his own heart least his reason should condemn an inclination which however hopeless he could not resolve to conquer but while he found charms in the indulgence of his unhappy love he determined never to disturb the peace of its object but rather to suffer in silence than to give pain to a heart so generous and sensible as hers merely for the melancholy pleasure of knowing that she pitied him as soon as lady adelina could bear the journey they departed together to his house in the isle of wight where he left her and went in search of mrs bancraft the sister of trelawny of whom he enquired where trelawny himself might be found this woman apprehensive that he meditated a reconciliation between her brother and his wife which it was so much her interest to prevent refused for some time to give him the information he desired having however at length convinced her that he had no wish to renew a union which had been productive only of misery to his sister she told him that mr trelawny was returned to england and lived at a house hired in the name of her husband a few miles from london there godolphin sought him and found the unhappy man sunk into a state of perpetual and unconscious intoxication in which bancraft the husband of his sister encouraged him foreseeing that it must soon end in his sons being possessed of an income to which the meanness of his own origin and former condition made him look forward with anxious avidity it was difficult to make trelawny sinking into idiotism comprehend either who godolphin was or the purport of his business but bancraft more alive to his own interest presently understood that on condition of his entering into bonds of separation lady adelina would relinquish the greater part of her claim on the trelawny estate and he undertook to have the deeds signed as soon as they could be drawn up in a few days therefore godolphin saw trelawnys part of them compleated and returned to lady adelina satisfied in having released her from an engagement which since he had seen trelawny had rendered her in his eyes an object of tenderer pity and in having acquitted himself according to his strict sense of honour by causing her to relinquish all the advantages trelawnys fortune offered except those to which she had an absolute right this affair being adjusted he again resigned himself to the mournful but pleasing contemplations which had occupied him ever since he had heard of emmelines engagement while lady adelina whose intellects were now restored but who was lost in profound melancholy saw too evidently the state of her brothers heart and could not but lament that his tenderness for her had been the means of involving him in a passion which the great merit of its object and his own sensibility convinced her must be incurable the letters of emmeline were the only consolation she was capable of receiving they gave her favourable accounts of her child and of the continued affection of her inestimable friends whenever one of these letters was brought godolphin eagerly watched her while she was reading it and then faultering and impatient asked if all were well and if mr delamere was yet returned she sometimes gave him the letters to peruse after which he generally fell into long absence broken only by deep drawn and involuntary sighssymptoms which lady adelina knew too well to doubt of the cause in the mean time mrs stafford and emmeline visited every day their innocent charge who passed for the child of one of emmelines friends gone to the west indies emmeline insensibly grew so fond of him that she was uneasy if any accident prevented her daily visit and her friend sometimes laughingly reproached her with the robbery little william committed on her time when they were alone their conversation frequently turned on lady adelina and her brother the subject tho melancholy was ever a favourite with them both and perhaps the more so because it led them to mournful reflectionsfor mrs stafford was unhappy and emmeline was not gay nor were her spirits greatly heightened by finding that in spite of herself she thought as much of the brother as the sister and with a degree of softness and complacency which could not be favourable to her happiness when she first discovered in godolphin those admirable qualities of heart and understanding which he so eminently possessed she asked herself whether she might indulge the admiration they excited without prejudice to him whom she considered as her husband and she fancied that she might safely give him that esteem which his tenderness to his unhappy sister the softness of his manners the elegance of his mind and the generosity of his heart could hardly fail of extorting from the most indifferent observer but insensibly his idea obtruded itself more frequently on her imagination and she determined to attempt to forget him and no longer to allow any partiality to rob delamere of that pure and sincere attachment with which he would expect her to meet him at the altar it was now long since she had heard from him but she accounted for it by supposing that he was rambling about and she knew that letters were frequently lost it was at this time something more than two years since they had first met at mowbray castle and in a few weeks delamere would complete his twentyfirst yeara period to which lord montreville had long looked forward with anxious solicitude and now he could not but think with bitterness that his son would not be present to animate the joy of his dependants at this period but was kept in another country in the vain hope of extinguishing a passion which could not be indulged without rendering abortive all the pains his lordship had taken to restore his family to the eminent rank it had formerly borne in his country to sir richard crofts his sons had communicated the success of those plans by which they had sown in the irritable mind of delamere jealousy and mistrust of emmeline and he failed not to animate and encourage their endeavours while he used his power over the mind of lord montreville to limit the bounty and lessen the affection his lordship was disposed to shew her as the daughter of his brother she received regularly her quarterly payment but she received no more and instead of hearing on those occasions from lord montreville himself she had twice only a methodical letter from maddox the london steward this might however be merely accidental and emmeline was far from supposing that her uncle was estranged from her nor could she guess that the malice of mrs ashwood and the artifices of the crofts had occasioned that estrangement lord montreville rather connived at than participated in their ungenerous proceedings and as if fearful of trusting his own ideas of integrity with a plan which so evidently militated against them he was determined to take advantage of their endeavours without enquiring too minutely into their justice or candour sir richard had assured him that mr delamere was in a great measure weaned from his attachment and that mr crofts was almost sure that if their meeting could be prevented for a few months longer there would be nothing more to fear from this long and unfortunate prepossession crofts himself who had at length torn himself from his bride to pave the way for his being received by her family as her husband soon appeared and confirmed all this he told lord montreville that delamere had conceived suspicions of emmelines conduct tho he knew not from what cause that had at first excited the most uneasy jealousy but which had at length subsided with his love that he had regained his spirits and when he left his mother and sister seemed resolved to make a vigorous effort to expel from his mind a passion he was ashamed of having so long indulged in saying all this crofts rather attended to what his lordship wished to hear than to what was really the truth he knew that a meeting between delamere and emmeline would probably at once explain all the unworthy artifices which had been used to divide them and render those artifices abortive he therefore told lord montreville that to prevent all probability of a relapse it would be advisable to remove emmeline to some place where delamere could not meet her and his lordship forgetting at once all the obligations he owed her thought only of following this advice embarrassed however himself with public business he was unable to give to these domestic politics all the attention which they demanded he threw himself more than ever into the power of the crofts to whose policy he left it to contrive the means between the months of november and march of raising an invincible barrier between his son and his niece tho delameres being of age encreased the difficulties of this undertaking crofts having no scruples about the methods he was to pursue had no doubt of accomplishing his end and to stimulate his endeavours he needed only the particular advantages which would accrue to himself from the pardon and reception which he hoped to obtain from lord montreville and his family every engine therefore that ambition avarice malice and cunning could employ was now put in motion against the character and the peace of the unprotected and unsuspicious emmeline in conscious innocence and unsullied purity she dreamed not that she had an enemy on earth for of mrs ashwood now mrs james crofts she only remembered that she had once been obliged to her the little malicious envy which had given her some pain at the time it was shewn she now no longer recollected and tho she always continued to dislike james crofts yet his impertinence she had forgiven and had written in the usual form to congratulate them both on their marriage of delamere she heard nothing but imputing his silence to his frequent change of place she conceived no anger against him on that account and still felt herself bound to keep from her mind as much as possible the intrusive image of godolphin chapter vii whatever resolution emmeline might form to drive from her heart those dangerous partialities which would be fatal to her repose she found it impossible to be accomplished while lady adelinas frequent letters spoke only of the generous tenderness and excellent qualities of her brother of what else indeed could she speak in a solitude where his goodness made all her consolation and his conversation all her pleasure where he dedicated to her all his time and thought of procuring for her every alleviation to her retirement which books and domestic amusements afforded while he taught her still to respect herself and by his unwearied friendship convincing her that she had still much to lose made her life receive in her own eyes a value it would otherwise have lost and prevented her relapsing into that unhappy state of selfcondemnation which makes the sufferer careless of the future he thought that situated as she was solitude was her only choice but to render it as happy as her circumstances allowed was his continual care and tho oppressive sorrow still lay heavy on her heart tho it still ached with tenderness and regret towards an object whom she had sworn to think of to speak of no more her gratitude and affection towards her brother were as lively as if its acute feelings had never felt the benumbing hand of despair in the total sequestration from the world in which she lived she had no other topic to dwell upon than her brother and she gave it all its force perfectly acquainted however with emmelines engagements she never ventured to mention the passion which she was too well assured godolphin felt but she still almost unknown to herself cherished a lurking hope that her connection with delamere might be dissolved and that her lovely friend was destined to bless her beloved brother this distant hope was warm enough to animate her pen in his praise and emmeline tho every letter she received made on her mind a deeper impression of the merit of godolphin yet found such painful pleasure in reading them that she was unhappy if at the usual periods they did not regularly arrive she tried to persuade herself that the satisfaction she felt in reading these letters arose purely from the delight natural to every uncorrupted mind in contemplating a character honourable to human nature but accustomed to examine narrowly her own heart she could not long impose upon herself and notwithstanding all her endeavours to stifle it she still found the idea of godolphin mixing itself with all her thoughts and embittering the prospect of her certain marriage with delamere in the answers emmeline gave her friend she related whatever she thought likely to amuse the fair recluse gave a regular account of her little charge but avoided punctiliously the least mention of fitzedward fitzedward had received from mrs stafford an account of all that had passed at bath except the pains which had been taken to prevent any meeting between him and godolphin but notwithstanding her cautious silence on that head fitzedward who knew godolphin well could hardly be persuaded not to insist on his taking his chance of depriving him of a life which he said he had deserved to lose and could little brook being supposed to hold on courtesy nothing but his consideration for the unhappy lady adelina prevented his pursuing the sanguinary projects that agitated his mind to her peace he owed it to conquer them and while he was yet struggling against that sense of honour which impelled him to give godolphin imaginary reparation by allowing him an opportunity of putting an end to his existence or losing his own his brother lord clancarryl wrote to desire his attendance in ireland on some family business of importance a summons which after some hesitation mrs stafford and miss mowbray prevailed with him to obey before he went his eager and affecting entreaties prevailed on mrs stafford to let him see his son whom he embraced with an ardour of affection of which the fair friends believed so gay and fashionable a man incapable the errors of fitzedward however were not those of the heart among the dissipation of fashion and the indulgences of libertinism his heart was still sensible and his integrity retrievable he felt therefore with great keenness the injury he had done lady adelina and desirous of making all the reparation he could to the infant he again placed in the hands of emmeline a will by which he made it his heir and recommended it to the protection of godolphin whom he besought to consider as his nephew the son of a man whom he had once loved and who had dearly paid for having forfeited all claim to his friendship when he was departed nothing seemed likely to interrupt the tranquillity of emmeline but her encreasing apprehensions for mrs stafford and her children the derangement of staffords affairs and his wifes unavailing efforts to ward off the ruin which he seemed obstinately bent on incurring were every day more visible while his capricious and unreasonable temper and a strange opinion of his own sagacity which would never allow him to own himself in the wrong made him seek to load his wife with the blame of those misfortunes which he had voluntarily sought and now as obdurately refused to avoid while it was yet in his power mrs stafford who saw too plainly that the destruction of their fortune which she had so long dreaded was now with hasty strides advancing yet endeavoured to convince him of his infatuation but he still improved his house and garden still schemed away all the money he could raise or gain credit for and still repaid with rudeness and insult her anxious solicitude to save him in emmeline she ever found pity and tenderness but pity and tenderness was all she had to bestow the affairs of stafford required interest and money and emmeline could command neither lord montreville now took no other notice of her than to remit her quarterly stipend by the hands of his steward and tho he had promised to double it that promise yet remained unfulfilled it was at this time near the end of november and the mornings were cold and gloomy but emmeline however delicate in her frame had a constitution which had not by early and false indulgences been unfitted for the duties of life and to personal inconvenience she was always indifferent when the service of those she loved engaged her to brave fatigue or cold she therefore still continued her morning visit to woodbury forest where she generally past an hour with little william and in his improving features and interesting smiles loved to trace his resemblance to his mother lady adelina was very like her brother and the little boy was not the less tenderly caressed for the similitude she saw to them both the appearance of rain had one morning detained her at home later than usual she went however about eleven oclock and was busied in playing with the infant who began now to know her and was therefore more attractive when while she yet held him in her arms she heard the woman of the house who was in the outward room suddenly exclaimindeed sir you can not go inprayi beg your honour there was hardly time for emmeline to feel surprise at this bustle before the door opened and delamere stood before her in his countenance was an expression compounded of rage fierceness and despair which extorted from emmeline an involuntary shriek unable to arise she remained motionless in her chair clasping the baby to her bosom delamere seemed trying to stifle his anger in contempt vengeance disdain and pride were struggling for superiority while with his eyes sternly turned upon emmeline and smiling indignantly he exclaimedtill i saw this inarticulately and tremulously he spoketill i saw this all the evidence they brought me was insufficient to cure my blind attachment but nowoh infamymadnessdamnation it is then possibleit is then true but what is it to me torntorn for ever from this outraged heartnever never shall this sight blast me againbut what continued he speaking with more quickness what for fitzedward for the infamous plunderer of his friends happiness however madam on you i intrude no longer oh lostlostwretchedhe could not go on but in the speechless agony of contending passions he leaned his head against the frame of the door near which he stood and gazed wildly on emmeline who pale as death and trembling like a leaf still sat before him unable to recall her scattered spirits he waited a moment gasping for breath and as if he had still some feeble expectation of hearing her speak but the child which she held in her arms was like a basilisk to his sight and made in his opinion all vindication impossible again conviction appeared to drive him to desperation and looking in a frantic manner round the room as if entirely bereft of reason he dashed his hands furiously against his head and running or rather flying out of the house he immediately disappeared in terror and astonishment emmeline remained immovable and speechless she almost doubted whether this was any other than a fearful dream till the woman of the house and the maid who attended on the child ran into the room frightenedlord madam cried the woman what is the matter with the young gentleman i know not answered emmeline faintlyi know not where is he now hes run away into the wood again like any mad answered the woman and from whence enquired emmeline did he come why miss said she i was a going out cross our garden to hang out my cloaths so up a comes to the hedge side an a saysgood woman pray bent here a lady here as comes from woodfield one miss mowbrayi thought how he looked oddish as twere about the eyes but howsever thinking no harm i says yes so he runs up to the door and i called to un to say as id come in and let you know but before i could get thro the wicket whisk he was in the kitchen then i tried agin to stop un but i were as good try to stop the wind the agitation and uneasiness of emmeline encreased rather than subsided she looked so pale and with so much difficulty drew her breath that the women were alarmed least she should faint and one of them persuaded her to swallow something while the other ran out to see if the person who had so terrified her was yet in sight but no traces of him were visible and after a few moments emmeline recalling her presence of mind and feeling proudly conscious of her own innocence and integrity recovered in some degree her spirits and resolution that delamere should be in england did not greatly astonish tho it grieved her but that he should have conceived such strange suspicions of her and fitzedward equally surprised and distressed her since had she an opportunity of undeceiving him which he did not seem willing to allow her she could not relate the truth but by betraying the confidence of her unfortunate friend and embittering that life she had incurred such hazards to preserve as soon as she had apparently recovered from the shock of this abrupt intrusion she was desirous of returning to woodfield anxious to know if delamere had been there or by what means he had been enabled to find her at the cottage in the forest the women who fancied the gentleman they had seen was a lunatic who might lay in wait to hurt her on her way home would not suffer her to set out till they had called a woodcutter from the forest to accompany her then slowly and with difficulty she returned home where she heard from mrs stafford that delamere had neither been there or sent thither this information encreased her wonder and her disquiet she related to mrs stafford the distressing interview of the morning who having seen frequent instances of those excesses of which delamere was capable heard the relation with concern and apprehension chapter viii some days were passed by emmeline in painful conjectures on what measures delamere would take and in uncertainty what she ought to do herself sometimes she thought of writing to lord montreville but against that mrs stafford remonstrated representing that as she was undoubtedly the injured person in having been insulted by suspicions so unworthy she should leave it wholly to delamere to discover and recant his error which if he refused on cooler reflection to do she would be fortunate in escaping from an engagement with a man who had so little command of his own temper so little reliance on her principles as to be driven on a mere suspicion into rudeness and insult greatly mortified at finding it possible for delamere to think so injuriously of her and depressed by a thousand uneasy apprehensions she yielded implicitly to the counsel of her friend but of her counsel and consolation she was now on the point of being deprived stafford who had been some time in london sent an express to fetch his wife thither a few days after the interview between emmeline and delamere his affairs were now growing desperate james crofts demanded immediate payment of a sum of money belonging to his wife that was left her by her father and which she had till now suffered to remain in the hands of her brother stafford had made no provision to pay it his boundless profusion had dissipated all the ready money he could command and this claim of his sisters which james crofts seemed determined to urge would he knew be the signal for every other creditor to beset him with demands he had no means of discharging tho mrs stafford had long tho vainly implored him to stop in his wild career and had represented to him all the evils which were now about to overtake him she could not see their near approach without an attempt again to rescue him and he was accustomed in every difficulty to have recourse to her tho while he felt none he scorned and even resented her efforts to keep them at a distance he now fancied that her application might prevail on james crofts to drop a suit he had commenced against him she hastily therefore set out for london leaving to emmeline the care of her children who promised by the utmost attention to them to obviate part of the inconvenience of such a journey it was unhappily however not only inconvenient but fruitless mr and mrs james crofts were inexorable the suit was tried stafford was cast and nothing remained for him but either to pay the money or to be exposed to the hazard of losing his property and his liberty his conduct had so much injured his credit that to borrow it was impossible mrs stafford attempted therefore to divest herself of part of her own fortune to assist him with the money but her trustees were not to be moved and nothing but despair seemed darkening round the head of the unfortunate stafford mrs stafford saw too evidently that to be in the power of james crofts was to trust to avarice meanness and malignity and she trembled to reflect that her husband was now wholly at his mercy the additional motives he had to use that power rigorously she knew not she was ignorant that the business had so eagerly been pushed to a crisis not merely by the avidity of james crofts to possess the money but also by the directions of sir richard who hoped by this means to drive the family with whom emmeline resided to another country where delamere might find access to her so difficult that he might never have an opportunity of explaining the cause of his estrangement or of hearing her vindication it was now that mrs stafford remembered the frequent offers of service which she had repeatedly received from lord montreville and to him she determined to apply she hoped that he might be induced to influence the crofts family to give mr stafford time and to desist from the violence and precipitation with which they pursued him she even fancied that his lordship would be glad of an opportunity so easily to realize those offers he had so liberally made and full of these expectations she prepared to become a solicitress for favours to a statesman she felt humbled and mortified at the cruel necessity that compelled her to it but her childrens interest conquering her reluctance she addressed a letter to lord montreville and received a very polite answer in which he desired the honour of seeing her at two oclock the following day an hour when he said he should be entirely disengaged she might as well however have attended at his levee for tho punctual to the hour when he was to be disengaged she found two rooms adjoining to that where his lordship was occupied by a variety of figures some of whose faces were faces of negociation and equality but more whose expression of fearful suspence marked them for those of petitioners and dependants those of the former description were separately called to an audience and each after a longer or shorter stay retired while mrs stafford tho with an heart but ill at ease for observation could not help fancying she discerned in their looks the success of their respective treaties as soon as these gentlemen were all departed mrs stafford who had already waited almost three hours was introduced into the study where with many gracious bows and smiling apologies lord montreville received her sir richard crofts had that morning warmly represented to his lordship the necessity of the staffords going abroad and taking emmeline with them lord montreville knew that delamere was returned and was embroiled with emmeline he was therefore eager enough to follow advice which appeared so necessary and to promote any plan which might prevent a renewal of the attachment he enquired not into the cause of this estrangement satisfied with its effect and had secretly determined to give mrs stafford no assistance in the endeavours she was using to keep her family from dispersion and distress but statesman as he was he could not entirely forget that he once felt as other men and he could not hear without some emotion the melancholy description that mrs stafford gave of the impending ruin of her family and all its fearful consequences which she did with so much clear simplicity yet with so much proper dignity that he found his resolution shaken and recollecting that he had a conscience was about to ask it by what right he assumed the power of rendering an innocent family wandering exiles merely to save himself from a supposed possible inconvenience but while every lingering principle of goodness and generosity was rising in the bosom of his lordship to assist the suit of mrs stafford a servant entered hastily and announced the duke of n his grace of course waited not in the antiroom but was immediately introduced lord montreville then civilly apologized to mrs stafford for being unable to conclude the business adding that if she would see sir richard crofts the next day he would take care it should be settled to her satisfaction she withdrew with a heavy heart and feeling infinite reluctance in the proposed application to sir richard crofts she employed the whole afternoon in attempting to move in favour of her husband some of those friends who had formerly professed the most unbounded and disinterested friendship for him and his family of many of these the doors were shut against her others affected the utmost concern and lamented that their little power and limited fortunes did not allow them to assist in repairing the misfortunes they deplored some told her how long they had foreseen mr staffords embarrassments and how destructive building and scheming were to a moderate fortune while others made vague proffers of inadequate services which on farther conversation she found they never intended to perform if unluckily she had accepted their offers in all she saw too plainly that they looked on mr staffords affairs as desperate and in their coldness and studied civility already felt all the misery and mortification of reduced circumstances with encreased anguish she was now compelled to go on the following day to sir richard crofts whom she knew only from emmelines description he also in imitation of his patron had his antichamber filled with soliciting faces she waited not quite so long indeed for an audience but with infinitely less patience at length however she was shewn into the apartment where sir richard transacted business bloated prosperity was in his figure supercilious scorn in his eyes he rose half off his seat and slightly inclined his head on her entrance madam your servantplease to sit down i waited on you sir richard to i beg your pardon madam but as i am perfectly acquainted and informed and aware of the business there is no occasion or necessity to give you the trouble to repeat and dwell upon and explain it it is not i find convenient or suitable or commodious for mr stafford to pay to my son james who has married his mr staffords sister that part and proportion and residue of her fortune which her father at his death gave bequeathed and left to her it is not only inconvenient sir answered mrs stafford but impossible i fear for him to do it immediately and this is what i wished to speak to you upon i am aware and informed and apprized madam of what you would say i am sorry it is as you say so inconvenient and impracticable and impossible however madam my way in these cases is to go very plainly and straitly and directly to the point therefore i will chalk out and describe and point out to you a line of conduct which if you chuse to follow and adopt and pursue it appears to me that all may be adjusted settled and put to rights you will oblige me sir richard by doing so well then it is thisas it appears and is evident and visible that you have not the money in question you must immediately sell and dispose of and make into money your house and effects in dorsetshire and after paying and satisfying and discharging the debt to my son james you must as i understand your husband is besides deeply in debt withdraw retire and remove to france or to normandy or switzerland or some cheap country till your affairs come round and are retrieved and accommodated and adjusted this we might have done sir richard without troubling you with the present application no madam you might not i assure you i have talked and reasoned and argued some time with mr james crofts before i could induce and prevail upon and dispose him to wait and remain and continue unpaid until this arrangement and disposition could take place he wants the money madam for a particular purpose and tho from my heart i grieve and lament and deplore the necessity of the measure i do assure you madam nothing else will give you any chance of winding up compleating and terminating the business before us you will therefore madam think and consider and reflect on its necessity and give your final answer to my son james who will wait for it only till tomorrow morning he then rang his bell and saying he had an appointment with lord montreville who must already have waited for him he made a cold bow and hastened out of the room chapter ix mrs stafford now saw that nothing remained but to follow her husband to a prison or prevail on him to go to the continent while she attempted anew to settle his affairs obstinate even in despair she had the utmost difficulty to convince him of the necessity of this measure and would never perhaps have done it if the more persuasive argument of a writ taken out by james crofts had not driven him to embrace it rather than go into confinement mrs stafford with difficulty procured money to furnish him for his journey and saw him depart for dover while she herself returned to emmeline who had passed the three weeks of her absence in great uneasiness no news had been received of delamere and she now believed that of the promise he had forced from her he meant not to avail himself yet did not relinquish it but in proud and sullen resentment disdained even to enquire whether he had justly harboured anger against her she wished to have withdrawn a promise she could no longer think of without pain and regret but she found mrs stafford so unhappy that she could not resolve to oppress her by complaints and after some struggles with herself determined to let the matter take its course willingly however she consented to accompany her friend to france where mrs stafford at her husbands request now determined to go with her family she had found an opulent tradesman in a neighbouring town who engaged on receiving a mortgage on the estate and ten per cent interest which he so managed as to evade the appearance of usury to let her have the money to pay mr crofts and a farther sum for the support of her family and having got a tenant for the house and satisfied as many of the clamorous creditors as she could she prepared with a heavy heart to quit her abode with emmeline and her infant family as it was necessary that little william should be sent to the isle of wight before their departure emmeline wrote to fix a day at the distance of a month on which she desired lady adelina to send some careful person for him but ten days before the expiration of that period letters came from mr stafford in which he directed his wife who intended to embark at brighthelmstone and land at dieppe to change her route and sail from southampton to havre he also desired her to hasten her journey and as every thing was now put on the best footing the time would allow mrs stafford immediately complied and with her own unfortunate family emmeline and little william whom they now meant to carry themselves to lady adelina they left woodfield the pain of quitting probably for ever a favourite abode which she feared would at length be torn from her children by the rapacity of the law and the fatigue of travelling with infant children under such circumstances almost overcame the resolution and spirits of mrs stafford emmeline ever reasonable gentle and consoling was her principal support and on the evening of the second day they arrived at southampton while emmeline almost forgot in her attention to her friend her own uncertain and unpleasant state delamere remained in norfolk where he had hid himself from the enquiries of his father and from the importunities of his mother who was now with her eldest daughter settled again in berkley square here he nourished inveterate resentment against fitzedward and finding it impossible to forget emmeline he continued to think of her as much as ever but with indignation jealousy and rage he had immediately on receiving as he believed a confirmation of all those suspicions with which the crofts had so artfully inspired him resolved to demand satisfaction of fitzedward and hearing on enquiry that he was in ireland but his return immediately expected he waited with eager and restless uneasiness till the person whom he had commissioned to inform him of his return should send notice that he was again in london week after week however passed away he still heard that tho expected hourly fitzedward arrived not time far from softening the asperity with which his thoughts dwelt on this supposed rival seemed only to irritate and inflame his resentment and ingenious in tormenting himself he now added new anguish to that which corroded his heart by supposing that emmeline aware of the danger which threatened her lover from the vengeance of his injured friend had written to him to prevent his return this idea was confirmed when the agent whom he employed to watch the return of fitzedward at length informed him that he had obtained leave of absence from his regiment now in england and was to pass the remainder of the winter with lord and lady clancarryl the fury of his passions seemed to be suspended while with gloomy satisfaction he looked forward to a speedy retribution but now when no immediate prospect offered of meeting the author of his calamities they tormented him with new violence emmeline and fitzedward haunted his dreams emmeline and fitzedward were ever present to his imagination he figured to himself his happy rival possessed of the tenderness and attachment of that gentle and sensible heart the anguish these images inflicted affected his health and while every day as it passed brought nothing to alleviate his despair he became more and more convinced that the happiness of his life was blasted for ever and growing impatient of life itself determined to go to ireland and insist on an opportunity of losing it or of taking that of the man who had made it an insupportable burthen he set out therefore attended only by millefleur and gave lord montreville no notice of his intention till he reached holyhead from thence he wrote to his lordship to say that he had received an invitation to visit some friends at dublin and that he should continue about a month in ireland his pride prompted him to do this least his father on hearing of his absence should suppose that he was weak enough to seek a reconciliation with emmeline whose name he now never mentioned being persuaded that his lordship knew how ill she had repaid an affection which tho he could not divest himself of he was now ashamed to acknowledge lord montreville happy to find he had really quitted her was extremely glad of this seasonable journey which as the crofts assured him emmeline was on the point of leaving england would he thought prevent his enquiring whither she was gone and by introducing him into a new set of acquaintance turn his thoughts to other objects and perfect his cure while delamere then was travelling to ireland in pursuit of fitzedward mrs stafford and emmeline left southampton on a visit to lady adelina in the isle of wight being desirous of delivering little william into the arms of his mother and his uncle tho it was now almost the end of january they embarked in an open boat with the servant who waited on the child but being detained till almost noon on account of the tide it was evening before they reached a village on the shore three miles beyond cowes where they were to land on arriving there they found that the house of captain godolphin was situated two miles farther mrs stafford ever attentive and considerate was afraid that the sight of the child so unexpectedly might overpower the spirits of lady adelina and cause speculation among the servants which it was absolutely necessary to avoid emmeline therefore undertook to walk forward attended by a boy in the village who was to shew her the way and apprize lady adelina of the visitor she was to expect pleasure in spite of herself glowed in her bosom at the idea of again meeting godolphin tho she knew not that he had conceived for her the most pure and ardent passion that was ever inspired by a lovely and deserving object he had long since found that his heart was irrecoverably gone but tho he struggled not against his passion he loved too truly to indulge it at the expence of emmeline and had therefore determined to avoid her and not to embitter her life with the painful conviction that their acquaintance had destroyed the happiness of his for this reason he did not intend going himself to fetch his nephew from woodbury forest but had given a careful servant directions to go thither in a few days after that when emmeline herself prevented the necessity of the journey her walk lay along the high rocks that bounded the coast and it was almost dark before she entered a small lawn surrounded with a plantation in which the house of godolphin was situated about half an acre of ground lay between it and the cliff which was beat by the swelling waves of the channel the ground on the other side rose more suddenly and a wood which covered the hill behind it seemed to embosom the house and take off that look of bleakness and desolation which often renders a situation so near the sea unpleasant except in the warmest months of summer a sand walk lead round the lawn emmeline followed it and it brought her close to the windows of a parlour they were still open she looked in and saw by the light of the fire for there were no candles in the room godolphin sitting alone he leaned on a book which there was not light enough to read scattered papers lay round him and a pen and ink were on the table emmeline could not forbear looking at him a moment before she approached the door she could as little command her curiosity to know on what he was thus deeply thinking the boy who was with her ran round to the kitchen and sent up a servant to open the door who immediately throwing open that of the parlour saida lady sir godolphin starting from his reverie arose and unexpectedly beheld the subject of it his astonishment at this visit was such as hardly left him the power to express the pleasure with which that astonishment was mingled miss mowbray exclaimed heis it indeed miss mowbray for a moment he surveyed her in silent extasy then congratulated himself upon his unhoped for good fortune and answering her enquiries about lady adelina he suddenly seemed to recollect the papers which lay on the table hurried them into a drawer and again returning to emmeline told her how happy he was to see her look so well he thought indeed that he had never seen her so infinitely lovely the sharpness of the air during her walk had heightened the glow of her complexion her eyes betrayed by their soft and timid glances the partiality of which she was hardly yet conscious she trembled without knowing why and could hardly recover her composure while godolphin who would trust no other person to deliver the message ran eagerly up stairs to acquaint lady adelina my sister cried he immediately returning will be with you instantly a slight pain in her head has kept her on the bed almost all day but to what do we owe the happiness of seeing you here when we thought you on the point of sailing for france by another route emmeline then hastily explained the change in their plan adding gravelyyou will have another visitor who can not fail of being welcome both to you and lady adelina mrs stafford stays with him at the village while she desired me to come on to prepare you for his reception and to know how you will have him introduced as my child answered godolphin my servants are already prepared to expect such an addition to my family ever amiable ever lovely miss mowbray continued he with looks that encreased her confusionwhat obligation does not our little boydo we not all owe you at this moment lady adelina who had been obliged to wait some moments to recover herself from the joyful surprise into which the news of emmelines arrival had thrown her ran into the room and embracing with transport her lovely friend sighed but unable to weep sat down and could only kiss her hands with such wild expressions of rapture that emmeline was alarmed least it should have any ill effect on her intellects or on a frame ever extremely delicate and which now had from her having long indulged incurable sorrow assumed an appearance of such languor and weakness that emmeline with extreme concern looked on her as on a beautiful shadow whom she probably beheld for the last time she stood a moment pensively gazing on her face godolphin said gently to his sister who still held the hand of emmelineadelina my love recollect yourselfyou keep miss mowbray standing what is yet more material answered emmeline smiling is that you keep me from writing a note to mrs stafford which the boy who waits here is to take back to her godolphin answered that he would go himself to mrs stafford and instantly departed while emmeline began to talk to lady adelina of the immediate arrival of her child she at length succeeded in getting her to speak of him and to weep extremely after which she grew more composed and her full heart seemed relieved by talking of her brother her words tho faint and broken by the emotion she felt yet forcibly conveyed to the heart of emmeline impressions of that uncommon worth they described never said she can i be sufficiently grateful to heaven for having given me such a brother tis not in words my emmeline to do him justice he is all that is noble minded and generous tho from the loss of his vivacity and charming spirits i know too well how deeply my unworthy conduct has wounded him tho i know that by having sullied the fair name of our family and otherwise i have been the unhappy cause of injuring his peace yet never has a reproach or an unkind word escaped him pensive yet always kind melancholy and at times visibly unhappy yet ever gentle considerate and attentive to me always ready to blame himself for yielding to that despondence which he can not without an effort conquer trying to alleviate the anguish of my mind by subduing that which frequently preys on his own and now burying the memory of my fault in compassion to my affliction he adopts my child and allows me without a blush to embrace the dear infant for whom i dare not otherwise shew the tenderness i feel emmeline affected by this eulogium to which her heart warmly assented was silent there is reassumed lady adelina but one being on earth who resembles himit is my emmeline if ever two creatures eminently excelled the rest of their species it is my friend and my brother something throbbed at the heart of emmeline at these words into which she was afraid to enquire her engagement to delamere yet uncancelled lay like a weight upon it and seemed to impress the idea of her doing wrong while she thus listened to the praises of another and felt that she listened with too much pleasure she asked herself however whether it was possible to be insensible of the merit of godolphin yet conscious that she had already thought of it too much she wished to change the topic of discoursebut lady adelina still pursued it lord westhaven said she my elder brother is indeed a most respectable and excellent man equally with my brother william he inherits from my father integrity generosity and nobleness of mind together with a regularity of morals and conduct unusual in so young a man even in any rank of life and remarkable in him who has passed almost all his in the army but he is tho not yet thirty much older than i am and has almost always been absent from me those who know him better have told me that with as many other good qualities as william he has less softness of temper and being almost free from error himself makes less allowance for the weakness of others such however has been the management of my younger brother that the elder knows not the truth of my circumstanceshe does not even suspect them you may very possibly see him and lady westhaven abroad i know i need not caution my emmelineshe will be careful of the peace of her poor friend emmeline soon satisfied lady adelina on that head who then asked when she heard of delamere this question emmeline had foreseen but having predetermined not to distress her unfortunate friend by telling her into what difficulties her attendance on her and her child had led her and being shocked to own herself the subject of suspicions so injurious as those delamere had dared to harbour she calmly answered that delamere was returned to england but that she had seen him only for a few moments and did he not object enquired lady adelina to your quitting england since he is himself returned to it emmeline who could not directly answer this question evaded it by saying my absence or my presence you know can not hasten the period till the arrival of which our marriage can not take placeif it ever takes place at all if it ever takes place at all repeated lady adelinadoes then any doubt remain of it an affair of that sort replied emmeline assuming as much unconcern as she could is always doubtful where so many clashing interests and opposite wishes are to be reconciled and where so very young a man as mr delamere is to decide do you suspect that he wavers then very earnestly asked lady adelina fixing her eyes on the blushing face of emmeline i really am not sure answered sheyou know my promise reluctantly given was only conditional i am far from being anxious to anticipate by firmer engagements the certainty of its being fulfilled much better contented i should be if he yet took a few years longer to consider of it you lady adelina continued she smiling are surely no advocate for early marriages and mrs stafford is greatly averse to them you must therefore suppose that what my two friends have found inimical to their happiness i can not consider as being likely to constitute mine this speech had the effect emmeline intended it brought back the thoughts of lady adelina from the uncertainties of her friend to her own actual sorrows she sighed deeply you say truly said she i have no reason to wish those i love may precipitately form indissoluble engagements nor do i wish it would to god i had not been the victim of an hasty and unhappy marriage or that i had been the only victim emmeline added she lowering her voice now hardly audible emmeline may i askwhere isspare me the repetition of a name i have solemnly vowed never to utteryou understand me i do answered emmeline gravely he has been in ireland but is now i suppose in london as the time he told me he should pass there has long since elapsed i heard he was to return no more to tylehurst and that mr delamere had given up the house there but of this i know nothing from themselves the person you enquire after i have seen only once and that for half an hour mrs stafford can tell you more if you wish to hear it ah pardon my wretched weakness emmeline i know i ought to conquer it but i can not help wishingi can not help being anxious to hear of him yet would i conceal from every one but you that the recollection of this unhappy man never a moment leaves me tell me my angelic friend for of you i may ask and be forgivenhas he seen his son he has and was extremely affected but dear lady adelina do not i beseech you enquire into the particulars of the interview try my beloved friend to divest yourself of these painful recollectionsah try to recover your peace and preserve your life for the sake of our dear little william and those friends who love you the unhappy adelina who notwithstanding all her efforts was devoured by an incurable affection for a man whom she had sworn to banish from her heart for ever and whose name her brother would not suffer her to pronounce now gave way to an agony of passion which she could indulge only before emmeline and so violently was she affected by regret and despair that her friend trembled least her reason should again forsake its seat she tried by soothing and tenderness to appease this sudden effusion of grief and had hardly restored her to some degree of composure before mrs stafford entered the room and embraced most cordially lady adelina while godolphin followed her with the little boy in his arms in contemplating the beauty of his nephew he had forgotten the misery of which his birth had been the occasion for with all the humanity of a brave man godolphin possessed a softness of heart which the helpless innocence of the son and the repentant sorrow of the mother melted into more than feminine tenderness he carried the child to his sister and put it into her arms take him my adelina said hetake our dear boy and while you embrace and bless him you will feel all you owe to those who have preserved him lady adelina did indeed feel such complicated sensations that she was unable to utter a word she could only press the little boy to her heart and bedew his face with tears her affecting silence and pale countenance alarmed both mrs stafford and emmeline and the former willing to give her thoughts a new turn said you do not suppose my dear friends that we intend to go back to southampton to night so i hope you will give us some supper and beds in this hospitable island godolphin who had been too much enchanted to think before immediately saw that the meaning of mrs staffords solicitude was merely to call the thoughts of his sister from herself to her guests he seconded therefore this intention by desiring lady adelina to give proper orders about the apartments for her friends and to take his little boy to that which had been prepared for his reception the three ladies therefore withdrew with the child where lady adelina soon recovered some degree of serenity and was able to sit at table while they supped had mrs stafford been before unsuspicious of the passion of godolphin for emmeline she would have been convinced of it during the course of this evening his voice his countenance his manner evidently betrayed it and whenever the eyes of emmeline were turned to any other object his were fixed on her face with looks so expressive of tender admiration yet tempered by a kind of hopeless dejection that the most uninterested observer could hardly have mistaken his thoughts but it was not her face however interesting or her form however graceful that rivetted the chains of godolphin he had seen many faces more regularly beautiful and many figures equally elegant with indifference he had heard with coldness the finest sentiments uttered by the fairest mouths and had listened to the brilliant sallies of fashionable wit with contempt in emmeline he discovered a native dignity of soul an enlarged and generous heart a comprehensive and cultivated understanding a temper at once soft and lively with morals the most pure and manners simple undesigning and ingenuous to these solid perfections genius had added all the lighter graces and nature a form which enchanting as it must ever have been seemed to receive irresistible charms from the soul by which it was informed all his philosophy could not prevent his being sensible of the attractions of such a woman nor was his resolution sufficiently strong to enable him to struggle against their influence even when he found he had nothing to hope but yielding to the painful delight of loving her he persuaded himself that tho he could not conquer he could conceal it and that while she was ignorant of his passion it could be injurious only to himself his absence and silence during supper was broken only by his natural politeness after it concluded they drew round the fire and the three ladies entered into one of those interesting conversations that are so pleasant where mutual confidence and esteem reign among the party godolphin continued silent and insensibly fell into a train of thought the most dangerous to that appearance of indifference which he believed he could observe looking at emmeline as she talked to his sister and remembering all the friendship she had shewn her hearing the sound of her voice and the elegance of her expressions he began insensibly to consider how blessed he might have been had he known her before her hand was promised and her affections given to the fortunate delamere had it but been my lot said he to himselfhad it been my lotah what happiness after the fatigues and dangers of my profession to return to this place which i love so much and to be received by such a friendsuch a mistresssuch a wife as she will make he indulged these ideas till absolutely lost in them he was unconscious of every thing but their impression and starting up he struck his hands together and cried merciful heavenand can it then never be alarmed at the suddenness of an exclamation so causeless lady adelina looked terrified and her friends amazed what brotherwhat are you speaking of enquired she i beg your pardon said godolphin instantly recollecting himself and blushing for this unguarded sallyi beg your pardon i was thinking of some business i have to settle but i do not deserve to be forgiven for suffering my mind in such company to dwell on any thing but the pleasure i enjoy and for yielding to a foolish custom i have acquired of uttering aloud whatever is immediately in my mind an habit added he smiling that has grown upon me by living so much alone since lady adelina is now fixed with me i hope i shall cease to speak and think like an hermit and be again humanized adelina my love you look fatigued ah replied she of what fatigue can i be sensible when with those who i most love and value and from whom tomorrowtomorrow i must part i doubt that extremely said godolphin trying to carry the conversation entirely from his own strange behaviour if i have any skill in the weather tomorrow will bring a gale of wind which will opportunely make prisoners of our two fair friends for another day how infinitely cried lady adelina shall i be obliged to it the rising of the wind during the whole evening had made godolphins conjecture highly probable mrs stafford impatient to return to her children whom she never willingly left wholly in the care of servants heard its encreasing violence with regret emmeline tried to do so too but she could not prevail on herself to lament a circumstance likely to keep her another day with lady adelina and her little boy she wanted too to see a little of this beautiful island of which she had heard so much and found several other reasons for wishing to remain without allowing herself to suppose that godolphin had on these wishes the smallest influence chapter x early the next morning emmeline arose and looking towards the sea saw a still encreasing tempest gathering visibly over it she wandered over the house which tho not large was chearful and elegant and she fancied every thing in it bore testimony to the taste and temper of its master the garden charmed her still more surrounded by copsewood and evergreens and which seemed equally adapted to use and pleasure the country behind it tho divested of its foliage and verdure appeared more beautiful than any she had seen since she left wales and with uncommon avidity she enjoyed even amid the heavy gloom of an impending storm the great and magnificent spectacle afforded by the sea by reminding her of her early pleasures at mowbray castle it brought back a thousand halfobliterated and agreeable tho melancholy images to her mind while its grandeur gratified her taste for the sublime as she was indulging these contemplations the wind suddenly blew with astonishing violence and before mrs stafford arose the sea was become so tempestuous and impracticable that eagerly as she wished to return to her children she could not think of braving it godolphin had seen emmeline wandering along the cliff and had resolutely denied himself the pleasure of joining her for from what had passed the evening before he began to doubt his own power to forbear speaking to her of the subject that filled his heart they now met at breakfast and emmeline was charmed with her walk tho she had been driven from it by the turbulence of the weather which by this time had arisen to an hurricane when their breakfast ended mrs stafford followed lady adelina who wanted to consult her on something that related to the little boy godolphin went out to give some orders and emmeline retired to a bow window which looked towards the sea could she have divested her mind of its apprehensions that what formed for her a magnificent and sublime scene brought shipwreck and destruction to many others she would have been highly pleased with a sight of the ocean in its present tremendous state lost in contemplating the awful spectacle she did not see or hear godolphin who imagining she had left the room with his sister had returned and with his arms crossed and his eyes fixed on her face stood on the other side of the window like a statue the gust grew more vehement and deafened her with its fury while the mountainous waves it had raised burst thundering against the rocks and seemed to shake their very foundation emmeline at the picture her imagination drew of their united powers of desolation shuddered involuntarily and sighed what disturbs miss mowbray said godolphin emmeline unwilling to acknowledge that she had been so extremely absent as not to know he was in the room answered without expressing her surprise to see him therei was thinking how fatal this storm which we are contemplating may be to the fortunes and probably the lives of thousands the gale returned godolphin is heavy but by no means of such fatal power as you apprehend i have been at sea in several infinitely more violent and shall probably be in many others i hope not answered emmeline without knowing what she saidsurely you do not mean it a professional man said he smiling and flattered by the eagerness with which she spoke has you know no will of his own i certainly should not seek danger but it is not possible in such service as ours to avoid it why then do you not quit it if i intended to give you a high idea of my prudence i should say because i am a younger brother but to speak honestly that is not my only motive my fortune limited as it is is enough for all my wishes and will probably suffice for any i shall now ever form but a man of my age ought not surely to waste in torpid idleness or trifling dissipation time that may be usefully employed besides i love the profession to which i have been brought up and by engaging in which i owe a life to my country if ever it should be called for god forbid it ever should said emmeline with quickness for then continued she hesitating and blushing what would poor lady adelina do and what would become of my dear little boy godolphin charmed yet pained by this artless expression of sensibility and thrown almost off his guard by the idea of not being wholly indifferent to her answered mournfullyto them indeed my life may be of some value but to myself it is of none ah miss mowbray it might have been worth preserving had ibut wherefore presume i to trouble you on a subject so hopeless i know not what has tempted me to intrude on your thoughts the incoherences of a mind ill at ease pardon meand suffer not my folly to deprive me of the happiness of being your friend which is all i will ever pretend to he turned away and hastened out of the room leaving emmeline in such confusion that it was not till mrs stafford came to call her to lady adelinas dressingroom that she remembered where she was and the necessity of recollecting her scattered thoughts when they met at dinner she could not encounter the eyes of godolphin without the deepest blushes lady adelina given wholly up to the idea of their approaching separation and mrs stafford occupied by uneasiness of her own did not attend to the singularity of her manner the latter had never beheld such a tempest as was now raging and she could not look towards the sea whose high and foaming billows were breaking so near them without shivering at the terrifying recollection that in a very few hours her children all she held dear on earth would be exposed to this capricious and furious element tho of the steadiest resolution in any trial that merely regarded herself she was a coward when these dear objects of her fondness were in question and she could not help expressing to mr godolphin some part of her apprehensions as i have gained some credit answered he for my sagacity in foreseeing the gale i might perhaps as well not hazard the loss of it by another prophecy for which you lady adelina will not thank meit will be fine i am afraid tomorrow and the day following we embark for france said mrs stafford how providential that we could not sail yesterday your heart fails you my dear mrs stafford replied godolphin and i do not wonder at it but i will tell you what you shall allow me to do i will attend you tomorrow to southampton where in the character of a veteran seaman i will direct your departure as the whole pacquet is yours according to the appearance of the weather and to indulge me still farther you shall suffer me to see you landed at havre adelina i know will be wretched till she hears you are safe on the other side and will therefore willingly spare me to bring her such intelligence and give me at the same time a fortunate opportunity of being useful to you mrs stafford secretly rejoiced at a proposal which would secure them a protector and as much safety as depended on human skill could not conceal her wish to assent to it tho she expressed great reluctance to give him so much trouble godolphin then consulted the eyes of emmeline which on meeting his were cast down but he could not find that they expressed any displeasure at his offer he therefore assured mrs stafford that he should consider it as a pleasurable scheme with a party to whom he was indifferent but when added he it gives me the means of being of the least use to you to miss mowbray and your children i shall find in it not only pleasure but happiness alas how poorly it will repay the twentieth part of the obligation we owe you it was settled therefore that mr godolphin was to cross the channel with them again emmeline tried to be sorry and again found herself incapable of feeling any thing but satisfaction in hearing that he would be yet longer with them during the rest of the evening he tried to assume a degree of chearfulness and did in some measure feel it in the prospect of this farther temporary indulgence lady adelina unable to conceal her concern drooped without any effort to imitate him and when they parted for the night could not help deploring in terms of piercing regret their approaching separation the assurances godolphin had given them of a favourable morning were fulfilled they found that tho there was yet a considerable swell the wind had subsided entirely and that they might safely cross to southampton the boat that was to convey them was ready and emmeline could not take leave of lady adelina without sharing the anguish which she could not mitigate they embraced silently and in tears and emmeline pressed to her heart the little boy to whom she was tenderly attached godolphin was a silent spectator of this melancholy farewel the softness of emmelines heart was to him her greatest charm and he could hardly help repeating in the words of louis xivshe has so much sensibility that it must be an exquisite pleasure to be beloved by her he sighed in remembering that such could not be his happiness then wishing to shorten a scene which so violently affected the unsettled spirits of lady adelina he would have led mrs stafford and emmeline away but lady adelina insisted on following them to the shore smiled thro her tears and promised to behave better silently they walked to the seaside mrs stafford hastily embracing her was handed into the boat by godolphin who then advancing with forced gaiety to emmeline about whom his sister still fondly hung saidcome come i must have no more adieusas if you were never to meet again ah who can tell answered lady adelina that we ever shall emmeline spoke not but kissing the hand of her weeping friend gave her own to godolphin while lady adelina resting on the arm of her woman and overwhelmed with sorrow suffered the boat to depart it rowed swiftly away favoured by the tide lady adelina remained on the shore as long as she could distinguish it and then slowly and reluctantly returned to solitude and tears while her two friends attended by her brother landed safely at southampton where he busied himself in settling every thing for their departure the next morning in the pacquet which they had hired and which now lay ready to receive them during their passage to havre which was short and prosperous the attention of godolphin was equally divided between mrs stafford her children and emmeline but when he assisted the latter to leave the vessel he could not forbear pressing her to his heart while in a deep sigh he bade adieu to the happiness of being with her for he concluded she would not long remain single and after she was married he determined never more to trust himself with the dangerous pleasure of beholding her he had never mentioned the name of delamere and knew not that he was returned to england having once been assured of her engagement he was unable to enquire into the circumstances of what had destroyed his happiness he knew they were to be married in march and that delamere had promised to remain on the continent till that period he doubted not therefore but that emmeline in compliance with the entreaties of her lover had consented to accompany mrs stafford to france and by her presence to charm away the months that yet intervened after which he supposed they would be immediately united notwithstanding some remarks he had made on the interest she seemed to take in regard to himself he imputed it merely to her general sensibility and to his relationship to lady adelina he supposed that delamere possessed her heart and tho it was the only possession on earth that would give him any chance of happiness he envied this happy lover without hating him he could not blame him for loving her who was in his own opinion irresistible nor for having used the opportunity his good fortune had given him of winning her affections the longer he conversed with her the more he was convinced that delamere in being as he believed master of that heart was the most fortunate of human beings but tho he had not resolution enough to refuse himself the melancholy yet pleasing gratification of contemplating perfections which he thought could never be his and tho he could not help sometimes betraying the fondness which that indulgence hourly encreased he never seriously meditated supplanting the happy delamere he did not think that to attempt it was honourable and his integrity would have prevented the trial had he supposed it possible to succeed mrs stafford had at first seen with concern that godolphin whom she sincerely esteemed was nourishing for her friend a passion which could only serve to make him unhappy but she now saw its progress rather with pleasure than regret she was piqued at the groundless jealousy and rash injustice of delamere towards emmeline and disappointed and disgusted at lord montrevilles conduct towards herself sickening at the little sincerity of the latter and doubtful of the temper of the former she feared that if the alliance took place her friend would find less happiness than splendour and she looked with partial eyes on godolphin who in morals manners and temper was equally unexceptionable and whose fortune tho inferior to his birth was yet enough for happiness in that style of life which she knew better calculated for the temper and taste of emmeline than the parade and grandeur she might share with delamere godolphin had no parents to accept her with disdainful and cold acquiescenceno sister to treat her with supercilious condescensionbut all his family tho of a rank superior to that of delamere would receive her with transport and treat her with the respect and affection she deserved mrs stafford however spoke not to emmeline of this revolution in her sentiments but chose rather to let the affair take its course than to be in any degree answerable for its consequences the hour in which godolphin was to leave them now approached unable to determine on bidding emmeline farewel he would still have lingered with her and would have gone on with them to rouen where stafford waited their arrival but this mrs stafford was compelled to decline fearing least this extraordinary attention in a stranger should induce her husband to make enquiry into their first acquaintance and by that means lead to discoveries which could not fail of being injurious to lady adelina of all that related to her he was at present ignorant he had been told that the infant which his wife and miss mowbray so often visited was the son of an acquaintance of the latter who being obliged soon after its birth to go to the west indies had sent it to bath to emmeline who had undertaken to overlook the nurse to whose care it was committed into a circumstance which offered neither a scheme to occupy his mind or money to purchase his pleasures stafford thought it not then worth his while farther to enquire but now in a country of which he understood not the language and detached from his usual pursuits mrs stafford knew not what strange suspicions the assiduity of godolphin might excite in a head so oddly constructed and without explaining her reasons to godolphin she said enough to convince him that he must with whatever reluctance leave the lovely travellers at havre he busied himself however in adjusting every thing for the safety of their journey and being in the course of their preparations left alone with emmeline in a room of the hotel he could not forbear using the last opportunity he was likely to have of speaking to her has miss mowbray any commands to lady adelina my most affectionate love answered emmeline my truest remembrance and tell her that the moment i am settled i will give her an account of my situation and of all that happens worth her knowing we shall hear then said he forcing a melancholy smile we shall hear when you meet the fortunate the happy mr delamere lady adelina blushingly replied emmeline will certainly know it if i should meet him but nothing is at present more improbable tis now reassumed godolphin the last week of januaryfebruarymarchah how soon march will come tell me how long in that month may adelina direct to miss mowbray mr delamere sir said emmeline gravely is not now in france but may he not immediately return thither from geneva or any other place is my sister lady westhaven to be present at the ceremony the ceremony answered she half angry and half vexed may perhaps never take place the awkwardness of her situation in regard to delamere arose forcibly to her mind and something lay very heavy at her heart she tried to check the tears which were filling her eyes least they should be imputed to a very different cause but the effort she made to conquer her feelings rendered them more acute she took out a handkerchief to wipe away these involuntary betrayers of her emotion and sitting down audibly sobbed godolphin had asked these questions in that sort of desperate resolution which a person exerts who determines to know in the hope of being able to endure the worst that can befal him but he was now shocked at the distress they had occasioned and unable to bear the sight of her tears pardon me cried he pardon me most lovely most amiable emmelineoh pardon me for having given a moments pain to that soft and sensible bosom had i suspected that a reference to an event towards which i supposed you looked forward with pleasure could thus affect you i had not presumed to name it whenever it happens added he after a short pausewhenever it happens delamere will be the most enviable of human beings and may you madam be as happy as you are truly deserving of happiness he dared not trust his voice with another word but under pretence of fetching a glass of water left the room and having recovered himself quickly returned and offered it to emmeline again apologizing for having offended her she took the glass from him and faintly smiling thro her tears said in the gentlest accentsi am not offendedi am only low spirited tired by the voyage and shrinking from the fatigue of a long journey yet you talk to me of a journey for life on which i may never set out in the company you mentionand still more probably never undertake at all the entrance of mrs stafford who came to entreat some directions from godolphin prevented the continuance of this critical conversation in which whatever the words imported in regard to delamere he found but little hope for himself he attributed what emmeline had said to mere evasion and her concern to some little accidental neglect on the part of her lover which had excited her displeasure ignorant of the jealousy delamere had conceived from the misrepresentation of the crofts which the solicitude of emmeline for the infant of lady adelina had so immediately matured he had not the most distant idea of the truth nor suspected that the passion of delamere for emmeline which he knew had within a few weeks been acknowledged without hesitation and received with encouragement was now become to him a source of insupportable torment that she had left england without bidding him adieu or even informing him that she was gone the two chaises were now ready and godolphin having placed in the first mrs stafford and her younger children approached emmeline to lead her to the second in which she was to accompany the elder he stopped a moment as they were quitting the room and saidi can not miss mowbray bid you adieu till you say you forgive me for the impertinence of my questions for impertinence answered emmeline giving him her handi can not forgive you because i know not that you have been guilty of it before i go however allow me to thank you most sincerely for the protection you have afforded us and not one word cried he not one parting good wish to your little protegéto my poor william ah i send him a thousand answered emmeline and one last kiss which i will carry him she suffered him to salute her and then he hastily led her to the chaise and as he put her in said very solemnlylet me repeat my wishes madam that wheresoever you are you may enjoy felicityfelicity which i shall never again know and that mr delamerethe fortunate delameremay be as sensible of your value as emmeline to avoid hearing this sentence concluded bade the chaise proceed it instantly did so with all the velocity a french postillion could give it and hardly allowed her to observe the mournful countenance and desponding air with which godolphin bowed to her as she waving her hand again bade him adieu the travellers arrived in due time safe at rouen where mrs stafford found that her husband had been prevented meeting her by the necessity he fancied himself under to watch the early nests of his canary birds of which he had now made a large collection and whose encrease he attended to with greater solicitude than the arrival of his family mrs stafford saw with an eye of hopeless regret a new source of expence and absurdity opened but knowing that complaints were more likely to produce anger and resentment in his mind than any alteration in his conduct she was obliged to conceal her chagrin and to take possession of the gloomy chateau which her husband had chosen for her residence about six miles from rouen while emmeline with her usual equality of temper tried to reconcile herself to her new abode and to share and relieve the fatigue and uneasiness of her friend she found the activity she was for this purpose compelled to exert assuaged and diverted that pain which she now could no longer hope to conquer tho she had not yet had the courage to ascertain by a narrow examination of her heart in regard to godolphin that it would be removed no more on the evening after he had bade her adieu godolphin embarked in the pacquet which was on its departure to england the weather tho cold was calm and he sat down on the deck where after they had got a few leagues from france all was profoundly quiet only the man at the helm and one sailor were awake on board the vessel glided thro the expanse of water while the soul of godolphin fled back to emmeline and dwelt with lingering fondness on the object of all its affection chapter xi emmeline having thus quitted england and delamere appearing no longer to think of her the crofts who had brought about an event so desirable for lord montreville thought it time to claim the reward of such eminent service miss delamere in meeting lady westhaven at paris had severely felt all the difference of their situation and as she had repented of her clandestine union almost as soon as she had formed it the comparison between her sisters husband and her own had embittered her temper never very good and made her return to england with reluctance where she knew that she could not long evade acknowledging her marriage and taking the inferior and humiliating name of mrs crofts to avoid returning was however not in her power nor could she prevail on crofts to delay a declaration which must be attended with circumstances to her most mortifying and unpleasant but impatient to demand a daughter of lord montreville as his wife and still more impatient to receive twelve thousand pounds which was hers independant of her father he would hear of no delay and the present opportunity of conciliating lord and lady montreville was in the opinion of all the crofts family not to be neglected sir richard undertook to disclose the affair to lord montreville and to parry the first effusions of his lordships anger by a very common yet generally successful stratagem that of affecting to be angry first and drowning by his own clamours the complaints of the party really injured for this purpose he waited early one morning on lord montreville and with a countenance where scornful superiority was dismissed for pusillanimous dejection he began my lordwhen i reflect and consider and remember the innumerable invaluable and extraordinary favours kindnesses and obligations i owe your lordship my heart bleedsand i lament and deplore and regret that it is my lot to announce and declare and discover what will i fear give infinite concern and distress and uneasiness to youand my lord what is all this sir richard cried lord montreville hastily interrupting himis delamere married heaven forbid answered the hypocritical croftsbad and unwelcome and painful as what i have to say is it does not amount or arise to that misfortune and calamity whatever it is sir said his lordship impatiently let me hear it at onceis it a dismission from my office never i hope replied sir richard at least for many years to come may this country not know and feel and be sensible of such a loss deprivation and defection my lord my present concern is of a very different nature and i do assure and protest to your lordship that no time nor intreaties nor persuasion will erase and obliterate and wipe away from my mind the injury and prejudice the parties have done me by thus keep me no longer in suspense almost angrily cried lord montreville mr crofts my lord mr crofts is i find married to my daughter sir richardis it not so he is indeed my lord and from this moment i disclaim and renounce and protest against him for my lord sir richard continued his harangue to which lord montreville did not seem to attend he was a moment silent and then said i have been more to blame than the partiesi might have foreseen this but i thought fannys pride a sufficient defence against an inferior alliance pray sir does lady montreville know of this marriage sir richard then related all that his son had told him interlarding his account with every circumstance that might induce his lordship to believe he was himself entirely ignorant of the intrigue lord montreville however knew too much of mankind in general and of the crofts in particular to give implicit credit to this artful recital but sir richard was now become so necessary to him and they had so many secrets in common of great consequence to the political reputation of both that he could not determine to break with him he considered too that resentment could not unmarry his daughter that the lineal honours of his family could not be affected by her marriage and that he owed the crofts some favour for having counteracted the indiscretion of delamere determining therefore after a short struggle to sacrifice his pride to his politics he dismissed sir richard with infinitely less appearance of resentment than he expected and after long contention with the furious and irascible pride of his wife prevailed upon her to let her daughter depart without her malediction she would not see crofts or pardon her daughter protesting that she never could be reconciled to a child of hers who bore such an appellation as that of mrs crofts soon afterwards however the marquisate which lord montreville had been so long promised was to be granted him but his wife could not bear that by assuming a title which had belonged to the mowbray family a point he particularly wished to obtain he should drop or render secondary those honours which he derived from her ancestors wearied by her persecution and accustomed to yield to her importunity he at length gratified her by relinquishing the name he wished to bear and taking the title of marquis of montreville while his son assumed that of viscount delamere this circumstance seemed more than any other to reconcile lady montreville to her eldest daughter whose surname she could evade under the more satisfactory appellation of lady frances she was now therefore admitted to her mothers presence crofts received an haughty and reluctant pardon and some degree of tranquillity was restored to the noble house of mowbraydelamere while the crofts more elated and consequential than before behaved as if they had inherited and deserved the fortune and splendor that surrounded them and the table the buildings the furniture of sir richard vied in expence and magnificence with those of the most affluent of the nobility lord delamere to whom the acquisition of a title could offer nothing in mitigation of the anguish inflicted by disappointed love was now at dublin where immediately on his arrival he had enquired for colonel fitzedward at the house of his brother lord clancarryl as the family were in the country and only a servant in it he could not for some days obtain the information he wanted he heard however that lord clancarryl was very soon expected and for his arrival he determined to wait in this interval of suspense he heard from a correspondent in england that miss mowbray had not only disappeared from woodfield but had actually quitted england and was gone no one knew precisely whither but it was generally supposed to france tho he had sworn in bitterness of heart to drive for ever from it this perfidious and fatal beauty it seemed as if forgetting his resolution he had in this intelligence received a new injury he still fancied that she should have told him of her design to quit england without recollecting that he had given her no opportunity to speak to him at all again he felt his anger towards fitzedward animated almost to madness and again impatiently sought to hasten a meeting when he might discuss with him all the mischief he had sustained lord clancarryl coming for a few days to dublin found there letters from lord montreville in which his lordship bespoke for his son the acquaintance of the clancarryl family desirous of shewing every attention to a young man so nearly connected with his wifes family by the marriage of her brother lord westhaven to his youngest sister and related also to himself lord clancarryl immediately sought delamere and was surprised to find that instead of receiving his advances with warmth or even with politeness he hardly returned them with common civility and seemed to attend to nothing that was said the first pause in the conversation however delamere took advantage of to enquire after colonel fitzedward my brother answered lord clancarryl left us only three days ago for london my lord no he is gone with two other friends on a kind of pleasurable tourthey hired a sloop at cork to take them to france to france exclaimed delameremr fitzedward gone to france yes replied lord clancarryl somewhat wondering at the surprise delamere expressedand i promoted the plan as much as i could for poor george is i am afraid in a bad state of health his looks and his spirits are not what they used to be chearful company and this little tour may i hope restore them but how happens it that he knew not sir of your return he was persuaded you were still abroad and expressed some pleasure at the thoughts of meeting you when you least expected it no no my lord cried delamere in a voice rendered almost inarticulate by contending passionshis hope was not to meet me he is gone with far other designs what designs lord delamere gravely asked lord clancarryl my lord answered delamere recollecting himself i mean not to trouble you on this matter i have some business to adjust with mr fitzedward and since he is not here have only to request of your lordship information when he returns or whither a letter may follow him sir returned lord clancarryl with great gravity i believe i can answer for colonel fitzedwards readiness to settle any business you may desire to adjust with him and i wish since there is business between ye that i could name the time when you are likely to meet him all however i can decidedly say is that he intends going to paris but that his stay in france will not exceed five or six weeks in the whole and that such letters as i may have occasion to send are to be addressed to the care of monsieur de guisnon banker at paris delamere having received this intelligence took a cold leave and lord clancarryl who had before heard much of his impetuous temper and defective education was piqued at his distant manner and returned to his house in the country without making any farther effort to cultivate his friendship debating whether he should follow fitzedward to france or wait his return to ireland delamere remained torn with jealousy and distracted by delay he was convinced beyond a doubt that fitzedward had met emmeline in france by her own appointment but let them not cried helet them not hope to escape me let them not suppose i will relinquish my purpose till i have punished their infamy or cease to feel itoh emmeline emmeline is it for this i pursuedfor this i won thee the violence of those emotions he felt after lord clancarryls departure subsided only because he had no one to listen to no one to answer him he determined as lord clancarryl seemed so certain of his brothers return in the course of six weeks to wait in ireland till the end of that period since there was but little probability of his meeting him if he pursued him to france he concluded that wherever emmeline was fitzedward might be found also but the residence of emmeline he knew not nor could he bear a moment to think that he might see them together the violence of his resentment far from declining seemed to resist all the checks its gratification received and to burn with accumulated fury his nights brought only tormenting dreams his days only a repetition of unavailing anguish he had several acquaintances among young men of fashion at dublin with them he sometimes associated and tried to forget his uneasiness in the pleasures of the table and sometimes he shunned them entirely and shut himself up to indulge his disquiet in the mean time lady clancarryl was extremely mortified at the account her husband gave her of delameres behaviour she knew that her brother lord westhaven would be highly gratified by any attention shewn to the family of his wife particularly to a brother to whom lady westhaven was so much attached she therefore entreated her lord to overlook delameres petulance and renew the invitation he had given him to lough carryl but his lordship disgusted with the reception he had before met with laughed and desired her to try whether her civilities would be more graciously accepted lady clancarryl therefore took the trouble to go herself to dublin where she so pressingly insisted on delameres passing a fortnight with them that he could not evade the invitation without declaring his animosity against fitzedward and his resolution to demand satisfactiona declaration which could not fail of rendering his purpose abortive he returned therefore to lough carryl with her ladyship meaning to stay only a few days and feeling hurt at being thus compelled to become the inmate of a family into which he might so soon carry grief and resentment godolphin after his return to the isle of wight abandoned himself more than ever to the indulgence of his passion he soothed yet encreased his melancholy by poetry and music and lady adelina for some time contributed to nourish feelings too much in unison with her own he now no longer affected to conceal from her his attachment to her lovely friend but to her only it was known her voice and exquisite taste he loved to employ in singing the verses he made and he would sit hours by her piano forté to hear repeated one of the many sonnets he had written on her who occupied all his thoughts sonnet when welcome slumber sets my spirit free forth to fictitious happiness it flies and where elysian bowers of bliss arise i seem my emmelineto meet with thee ah fancy then dissolving human ties gives me the wishes of my soul to see tears of fond pity fill thy softened eyes in heavenly harmonyour hearts agree alas these joys are mine in dreams alone when cruel reason abdicates her throne her harsh return condemns me to complain thro life unpitied unrelieved unknown and as the dear delusions leave my brain she bids the truth recurwith aggravated pain but lady adelina herself at length grew uneasy at beholding the progress of this unhappy passion his mind seemed to have lost all its strength and to be incapable of making even an effort to shake off an affection which his honour would not allow him to attempt rendering successful his spirits affected by the listless solitude in which he lived were sunk into hopeless despondence and his sister was every day more alarmed not only for his peace but for his life she therefore tried to make him determine to quit her for a short abode in london but to do that he absolutely refused lord clancarryl had long pressed him to go to ireland he had not seen his eldest sister for some years and ardently wished to embrace her and her children but fitzedward was at her house and to meet fitzedward was impossible lady clancarryl deceived by a plausible story which had been framed to account for lady adelinas absence was as well as her lord entirely ignorant of the share fitzedward had in it they believed it to have been occasioned solely by her antipathy to trelawny and her fear lest her relations should insist on her again residing with him and it was necessary that nothing should be said to undeceive them godolphin had therefore been obliged to form several excuses to account for his declining the pressing invitations he received and he found that his eldest sister was already much hurt by his apparent neglect in one of her last letters she had mentioned that fitzedward was gone to france and lady adelina pointed out to godolphin several passages which convinced him he had given pain by his long absence to his beloved camilla and prevailed upon him to go to ireland he arrived therefore at lough carryl two days after his sister had returned thither with lord delamere chapter xii mr godolphin was extremely surprised to find in ireland delamere the happy delamere who he supposed had long since been with emmeline waiting the fortunate hour that was to unite them for ever a very few weeks now remained of the year which he had promised to remain unmarried yet instead of his being ready to attend his bride to england to claim in the face of the world his fathers consent he was lingering in another country where he appeared to have come only to indulge dejection for he frequently fled from society and when he was in it forgot himself in gloomy reveries nobody knew why he came to ireland unless to satisfy a curiosity of which nothing appeared to remain yet he still continued there and as lord and lady clancarryl were now used to his singular humour they never enquired into its cause while he flattered by the regard of two persons so amiable and respectable suffered not his enmity to fitzedward to interfere with the satisfaction he sometimes took in their society tho he oftener past the day almost entirely alone godolphin could not repress the anxious curiosity he felt to know what at this period could separate lovers whose union appeared so certain but this curiosity he had no means of satisfying lady clancarryl had heard nothing of his engagement or any hint of his approaching marriage and tho he was on all other topics when he entered at all into conversation remarkably open and unguarded he spoke not in company of any thing that related to himself he seemed however to seek a closer intimacy with godolphin whose excellent character he had often heard and whose appearance and conversation confirmed all that had been reported in his favour godolphin neither courted him or evaded his advances but could not help looking with astonishment on a man who on the point of being the husband of the most lovely woman on earth could saunter in a country where he appeared to have neither attachments or satisfaction sometimes he almost ventured to hope that their engagement was dissolved but then recollecting that lady adelina had assured him the promise of emmeline was still uncancelled he checked so flattering an illusion and returned again to uncertainty and despondence on the third day after godolphins arrival delamere who intended to go back to dublin the following morning save one joined lady clancarryl and her brother in the drawingroom immediately after dinner godolphin on account of the expected return of fitzedward had determined to make only a short stay at lough carryl he wished to carry with him to his own house portraits of his sister and her children and was expressing to her this wishi should like to have them said he in a large miniature the same size as one i have of adelina have you then a portrait of adelina enquired lady clancarryl and have not yet shewn it me i have answered godolphin but my sister likes not that it should be seen it is very like her now but has little resemblance to her former pictures this is painted by a young lady her friend he then took it out of his pocket and gave it to lady clancarryl and is adelina so thin and pale asked her ladyship as she is here represented more so answered godolphin she is then greatly changedyet the eyes and features and the whole air of the countenance i should immediately have acknowledged continuing to look pensively at the picture she added tis charmingly coloured and might represent a very lovely and penitent magdalen the black veil and tearful eye are beautifully touched but why did you indulge her in this melancholy taste godolphin excessively hurt at this speech answered mournfullypoor adelina you know has had little reason to be gay delamere who during this conversation seemed lost in his own reflections now suddenly advanced and desired lady clancarryl would favour him with a sight of the picture he took it to a candle and looking steadily on it was struck with the lightness of the drawing which extremely resembled the portraits emmeline was accustomed to make tho this was more highly finished than any he had yet seen of hers without being able to account for his idea since nothing was more likely than that the drawing of two persons might resemble each other he looked at the back of the picture which was of gold and in the centre a small oval crystal contained the words em mowbray in hair and under it the name of adelina trelawny it was indeed a memorial of emmelines affection to her friend and the name was in her own haira circumstance that made it as dear to godolphin as the likeness it bore to his sister and the whole was rendered in his eyes inestimable by its being painted by herself delamere astonished and pained he knew not why determined to hear from godolphin himself the name of the paintress returning it to him he saida lady you say sir drew it may i ask her name godolphin now first aware of the indiscretion he had committed and flattering himself that the chrystal had not been inspected answered with an affectation of pleasantryoh i believe it is a secret between my sister and her friend which i have no right to reveal and to tell you the truth i teized adelina to give me the picture and obtained it only on condition of not shewing it delamere who had so often sworn to forget her still fancied he had a right to be exclusively acquainted with all that related to emmeline he felt himself piqued by this evasion and answered somewhat quicklyi know the drawing sir it is done by miss mowbray godolphin was then compelled to answer that it was i envy miss mowbray her charming talent cried lady clancarryl pray who is miss mowbray a relation of lord delameres answered godolphin and a most lovely and amiable young woman delamere whose varying countenance ill seconded his attempt to appear indifferent on this subject now grew pale now red are you acquainted then with miss mowbray sir said he to godolphin i have seen her replied godolphin with my sister lady adelina trelawny he then hurried the discourse to some other topic being unwilling to answer any other questions that related either to his sister or her friend but delamere whose wounds bled afresh at the name of emmeline and who could not resist enquiring after her of a person who had so lately seen her took the earliest opportunity of seeking godolphin to renew this discourse they met therefore the following morning in the breakfast parlour and delamere suddenly turning the conversation from the topics of the day saidyou are i find acquainted with miss mowbray you may perhaps know that she is not only a relation of mine but that i was particularly interested in whatever related to her godolphin whose heart fluttered so as almost to deprive him of speech answered very gravelyi have heard so from mrs stafford then you know perhapsbut you are undoubtedly well acquainted with colonel fitzedward certainly replied godolphin he was one of my most intimate friends then sir cried delamere losing all temper one of your most intimate friends is a villain godolphin shocked at an expression which gave him reason to apprehend lady adelinas story was known answered with great emotionyou will be so good my lord as to explain that assertion which whatever may be its truth is very extraordinary when made thus abruptly to me you are a man of honour mr godolphin and i will not conceal from you the cruel injuries i have sustained from fitzedward nor that i wait here only to have an opportunity of telling him that i bear them not tamely he then related in terms equally warm and bitter the supposed alienation of emmelines affections by the artifices of fitzedward enumerated all the imaginary proofs with which the invidious artifices of the crofts had furnished him and concluded by asserting that he had himself seen in the arms of emmeline a living witness of her ruin and the perfidy of his faithless friend to this detail including as it did the real history of his sister under the false colours in which the crofts had drest it to mislead delamere and destroy emmeline godolphin listened with sensations impossible to be described he could not hear without horror the character of emmeline thus cruelly blasted yet her vindication he could not undertake without revealing to a stranger the unhappy story of lady adelina which he had with infinite difficulty concealed even from his own family the fiery and impatient spirit of delamere blazing forth in menace and invective gave godolphin time to collect his thoughts and he almost immediately determined whatever it cost him to clear up the reputation of emmeline tho he saw that to explain the whole affair must put the character of his sister which he had been so solicitous to preserve into the power of an inconsiderate young man yet he thought he might trust to the honour and humanity of delamere to keep the secret and however mortifying such a measure appeared his justice as well as his love would not allow him to suffer the innocent emmeline to remain under an imputation which she had incurred only by her generous and disinterested attentions to the weakness and misfortunes of another but resolutely as he bore the pain of these reflections he shrunk from others with which they were mingled he foresaw that as soon as the jealousy of delamere was by his information removed his love which seemed to be as passionate as ever would prompt him to seek a reconciliation his repentance would probably be followed by emmelines forgiveness and their immediate union farewel then for ever to all the hopes he had nourished since his unexpected meeting with delamerefarewel to every expectation of happiness for ever but tho in relinquishing these delightful visions he relinquished all that gave a value to life so truly did he love and revere her that to have the spotless purity of her name sullied even by a doubt seemed an insupportable injustice to himself and his affection was of a nature too noble to owe its success to a misrepresentation injurious to its object that the compassion which had saved his sister should be the cause of her having suffered from the malicious malice of the crofts and the rash jealousy of delamere redoubled all his concern and he was so much agitated and hurt that without farther consideration he was on the point of relating the truth instantly had not the entry of lord clancarryl for that time put an end to their discourse from this resolution formed in the integrity of his upright heart nothing could long divert him yet he reflected as soon as he was alone on the violent and ungovernable passions which seemed to render delamere unguided by reason and incapable of hearing it he was apprehensive that the discovery if made to him at lough carryl might influence him to say or do something that might discover to lady clancarryl the unhappy story of her sister and he thought it better to delay the explanation till he could follow delamere to dublin which he determined to do in a few days after he left lough carryl this interval gave him time to feel all the pain of the sacrifice he was about to make nor could all his strength of mind and firmness of honour prevent his reluctance or cure his anguish he was about to restore to the arms of his rival the only woman he had ever really loved and whom he adored with the most ardent passion at the very moment that his honour compelled him to remove the impediments to her marriage with another sometimes he thought that he might at least indulge himself in the melancholy pleasure of relating to her in a letter what he had done as soon as the explanation should be made but even this gratification he at length determined to refuse himself if she loves delamere said he she will perhaps rejoice in the effect and forget the cause if she has as i have sometimes dared to hope some friendship and esteem for the less fortunate godolphin why should i wound a heart so full of sensibility by relating the conflicts of my soul and the passion i have vainly indulged a latent hope however almost unknown at least unacknowledged lingered in his heart it was possible that emmeline resenting the injurious suspicions and rash accusations of delamere might refuse to fulfil her engagement but whenever this feeble hope in spite of himself arose he remembered her soft and forgiving temper her strict adherence to her word on other occasions and it faded in a conviction that she would pardon her repentant lover when he threw himself on her mercy and not evade a promise so solemnly given which he learned from delamere himself had never been cancelled delamere now returned to dublin and in a few days godolphin followed him but on enquiring at his lodgings he heard that he was gone out of town for some days with some of his friends on a party of pleasure godolphin left a letter for him desiring to see him immediately on his return and then again resigned himself to the painful delight of thinking of emmeline and to the conscious satisfaction of becoming the vindicator and protector of her honour even unknown to herself emmeline in the mean time unhappy in the unhappiness of those she loved and by no means flattered by the prospect of dependance thro life of which lord montreville now made her see all the dreariness and desolation by the careless and irregular manner in which even her small quarterly stipend was remitted to her yet exerted all her fortitude to support the spirits of mrs stafford calm in the possession of conscious innocence and rich in native integrity and nobleness of nature she was tho far from happy herself enabled to mitigate the sorrows of others nor was her residence otherwise disagreeable and forlorn enough entirely without its advantages it afforded her time and opportunity to render herself perfectly mistress of the language of the country of which she had before only a slight knowledge to the study of languages her mind so successfully applied itself that she very soon spoke and wrote french with the correctness not only of a native but of a native well educated while she thus suffered banishment in consequence of the successful intrigues of the crofts family they enjoyed all the advantages of their prosperous duplicity at least they enjoyed all the satisfaction that arises from accumulating wealth and an ostentatious display of it sir richard by the political knowledge his place afforded him had been enabled by means of trusty agents to carry on such successful traffic in the stocks that he now saw himself possessed of wealth greater than his most sanguine hopes had ever presented to his imagination but as his fortune enlarged his spirit seemed to contract in regard to every thing that did not administer to his pride or his appetite in the luxuries of the table his house his gardens he expended immense sums and the astonished world saw with envy and indignation wealth which seemed to be illgotten as profusely squandered but dead to every generous and truly liberal sentiment these expences were confined only to himself and in regard to others he still nourished the sordid prejudices and narrow sentiments with which he set out in lifea needy adventurer trusting to cunning and industry for scanty and precarious bread mr crofts who had received twelve thousand pounds with his wife whose clandestine marriage had prevented its being secured in settlement used it as his father directed in gaming in the stocks with equal avidity and equal success lady frances in having married beneath herself had yet relinquished none of the privileges of high birth she played deep dressed in the extremity of expence and was celebrated for the whimsical splendor of her equipages and the brilliancy of her assemblies her husband loved money almost as well as the fame acquired by these fashionable displays of her ladyships taste but on the slightest hint of disapprobation he was awed into silence by her scornful indignation and with asperity bade to observe that tho the daughter of the marquis of montreville had so far forgotten her rank as to marry the son of crofts the attorney she would allow nobody else to forget that she was still the daughter of the marquis of montreville this right honourable eloquence subdued the plebeian spirit of crofts while he was also compelled to submit patiently lest lord montreville should be offended and withhold the fortune he farther expected to receive lady frances therefore pursued the most extravagant career of dissipation unchecked she was young handsome and vain and saw every day new occasion to lament having thrown herself away on crofts and as she could not now release herself from him she seemed determined to render him at least a fashionable husband mrs james crofts trod as nearly as she could in the footsteps of lady frances whose name she seemed to take exquisite pleasure in repeating tho its illustrious possessor scarce deigned to treat her with common civility and never on any account admitted her to any thing but her most private parties with a few dependants and persons who found the way to her favour by adulation mrs james crofts however consoled herself for the slights she received from lady frances by parading in all inferior companies with the names of her high and illustrious relations and she employed the same tradespeople laid out with them as much money and paid them better than lady frances herself her chariot and job horses were discarded for a fashionable coach her house at clapham for an elegant town residence she tried to hide the approaches of age by rouge and dress and amusements effectually kept off the approaches of thought her husband slowly yet certainly was creeping up the hill of preferment her daughters were certainly growing more beautiful and accomplished than their mother and mrs james crofts fancied she was happy chapter xiii it was now early in may and in the blooming orchards and extensive beech woods of normandy emmeline found much to admire and something to lament the seine winding thro the vale and bringing numberless ships and vessels to rouen surrounded by hills fringed with forests the property of the crown and extending even to that of arques formed a rich and entertaining scene but however beautiful the outline the landscape still appeared ill finished dark and ruinous hovels inhabited by peasants frequently suffering the extremes of poverty half cultivated fields wanting the variegated enclosures that divide the lands in england and trees often reduced to bare poles to supply the inhabitants with fewel made her recollect with regret the more luxuriant and happy features of her native country the earth however covered with grass and flowers offered her minute objects on which she delighted to dwell but she dared not here wander as in england far from home the women of the villages who in this country are robust and masculine often followed her with abuse for being english and yet oftener the villagers clattered after her in their sabots and addressed her by the name of la belle demoiselle anglaise with a rudeness and familiarity that at once alarmed and disgusted her the long avenue of fir and beech which led to the chateau and the parterre potagerie and verger behind it were therefore the scenes of her morning and evening walks she felt a pensive pleasure in retracing the lonely rambles she used to take at the same season at mowbray castle and memory bringing before her the events of the two years and an half which had elapsed since she left it offered nothing that did not renew her regret at having bid its solitary shades and unfrequented rocks adieu the idea of godolphin still obtruded itself continually on her mind nor could all her resolution prevent its obtruding with pleasure tho she perpetually condemned herself for allowing it to recur to her at all lady adelina in her two or three last letters had not mentioned him farther than to say he was in ireland and emmeline was ashamed of suffering her thoughts to dwell on a man whose preference of her seemed uncertain and perhaps accidental since he had neither absolutely declared himself when present or sought to engage her favour when absent and tho she was now fully persuaded that of delamere she should hear no more as a lover yet while her promise remained in his hands uncancelled she fancied herself culpable in indulging a partiality for another nor could she reflect on the jealousy which had tortured delamere and the pain he must have suffered in tearing her from his heart without mingling with her resentment some degree of pity and sorrow she was one afternoon sitting at an open window of the chateau revolving in her mind these reflections when raising her eyes at a sudden noise she saw driving along the avenue that led to it an english post chaise and four preceded by a valet de chambre and followed by two livery servants to those who are driven by misfortune to seek a melancholy asylum in a foreign country there is an inconceivable delight in beholding whatever forcibly brings back to the memory the comforts and conveniences of their own emmeline who had for many weeks seen only the boors or the curé of the village gazed at english servants and english horses with as much avidity as if she beheld such an equipage for the first time instantly however her wonder was converted into pleasurelady westhaven was assisted out of the chaise by a gentleman whose likeness to godolphin convinced the fluttering heart of emmeline that it was her lord and eagerly enquiring for miss mowbray she was immediately in her arms as soon as the joy in which mrs stafford partook of this unexpected meeting had a little subsided lady westhaven related that hearing by a letter they had received at paris from mr godolphin that emmeline was with mrs stafford in or near rouen she had entreated lord westhaven to make a journey to see her and i assure you emmeline added she i had no great difficulty to persuade him his own curiosity went as far as my inclination for he has long wished to see this dangerous emmeline who began by turning the head of my brother and now i believe has turned the more sage one of hisfor godolphins letters have been filled only with your praises emmeline who had changed colour at the beginning of this speech blushed more deeply at its conclusion involuntary pleasure penetrated her heart to hear that godolphin had praised her but it was immediately checked lady westhaven seemed to know nothing of delameres desertion of the history of lady adelina she was undoubtedly ignorant how could emmeline account for one without revealing the other this reflection overwhelmed her with confusion and she hardly heard the affectionate expressions with which lady westhaven testified her satisfaction at meeting her i trust my lord said her ladyship that the partiality which i foresee you will feel for my fair cousin for her own sake will not be a little encreased by our resemblancetell me do you think us so very much alike i never answered he saw a stronger family likeness between sisters our lovely cousin has somewhat the advantage of you in height and in complexion my lord notwithstanding the improvements i have learned to make to mine in france i should not answered his lordship smiling have ventured such a remark i was merely going to add that you have the same features as miss mowbray with darker hair and eyes if however our charming emmeline had a form less attractive i have heard enough of her to be convinced that her understanding and her heart justify all that lord delamere or mr godolphin have said of her lady westhaven then expressed her wonder that she had heard nothing of delamere for some monthsand it is most astonishing to me said she to emmeline that the month of march should elapse without your hearing of him the distress of emmeline now redoubled and became so evident that lady westhaven convinced there was something relative to her brother of which she was ignorant desired her to go with her into another room incapable of falsehood and detesting concealment yet equally unwilling to ruin the reputation of the unhappy adelina with her brothers wife and having no authority to divulge a secret entrusted to her by her friend emmeline now felt the cruellest conflict all she could determine was to tell lady westhaven in general terms that lord delamere had undoubtedly altered his intentions with regard to her and that the affair was she believed entirely and for ever at an end however anxious her ladyship was to know from what strange cause such a change of sentiments proceeded she found emmeline so extremely hurt that she forbore at present to press the explanation full of concern she was returning to the company having desired emmeline to remain and compose herself when as she was leaving the room she said but i forgot my dear emmeline to ask you where you first became acquainted with mr godolphin again deep blushes dyed the cheeks of the fair orphan for this question led directly to those circumstances she could not relate i knew him answered she faultering as she spoke at bath and is he enquired lady westhaven so very charming as his brother and his family represent him he is indeed very agreeable replied shevery much so extremely pleasant in his manner and in his person very like lord westhaven he never told us how he first became acquainted with you and to tell you the truth emmeline if i had not thought indeed known that you was engaged to lord delamere i should have thought godolphin your lover this speech did not serve to hasten the composure emmeline was trying to regain she attempted to laugh it off but succeeded so ill that lady westhaven rejoined her lord and mr and mrs stafford full of uneasy conjectures and emmeline with a still more heavy heart soon after followed her the pressing and earnest invitation of mrs stafford induced her guests to promise her their company for some days but lady westhaven was so astonished at her brothers desertion of emmeline and so desirous of accounting for it without finding occasion to impute cruelty and caprice to him or imprudence and levity to emmeline that she took the earliest opportunity of asking mrs stafford with whom she knew miss mowbray had no secrets to explain to her the cause of an event so contrary to her expectations mrs stafford had heard from emmeline the embarrassment into which the questions of lady westhaven had thrown her and with great difficulty at length persuaded her that she owed it to her own character and her own peace to suffer her ladyship to be acquainted with the truth that she could run no risk in telling her what for the sake of her lord whose happiness might be disturbed and whose life hazarded by its knowledge she certainly would not reveal besides which motives to secresy the gentleness and humanity of lady westhaven would mrs stafford said be alone sufficient to secure lady adelina from any possible ill consequences by her being made acquainted with the unhappy story these arguments wrung from emmeline a reluctant acquiescence and mrs stafford related to lady westhaven those events which had been followed by delameres jealousy and their separation the love and regard which on her first knowledge of emmeline lady westhaven had conceived for her and which her admirable qualities had ever since encreased was now raised to enthusiasm she knew not for mrs stafford and emmeline were themselves ignorant of the artful misrepresentations with which the crofts had poisoned the mind of her brother and was therefore astonished at his suspicions and grieved at his rashness she immediately proposed writing to him but this design both her friends besought her for the present to relinquish emmeline assured her that she had so long considered the affair as totally at an end that she could not now regret it or if she felt any regret it was merely in resigning the hope of being received into a family of which lady westhaven was a part her ladyship could not however believe that emmeline was really indifferent to her brother and accounted for her present coldness by supposing her piqued and offended at his behaviour for which she had so much reason anxious therefore to reconcile them she still continued desirous of writing to delamere and so much did her affectionate heart dwell on the happiness she should have in reuniting her brother and her friend that only the difficulty which there seemed to be in vindicating emmeline without injuring lady adelina withheld her and she promised to delay writing till means could be found to clear up the reputation of the one without ruining that of the other lord westhaven had during his stay learnt from mrs stafford the circumstances that had driven her and her family abroad and had heard them with a sincere wish to alleviate the inconveniences that oppressed a woman whose manners and conduct convinced him she deserved a better fate unwilling however to hold out to her hopes that he was not sure he should be able to fulfil he contented himself with procuring from emmeline general information of the state of their affairs and silently meditated the noble project of doing good as soon as it should be in his power her children for whose sake only she seemed to be willing to support with patience her unfortunate lot were objects particularly interesting to lord westhaven and for the boys he thought he might on his return to england assist in providing to their father consoling himself in trifling follies and dirty intrigues for his misfortunes it seemed more difficult to be serviceable while these benevolent purposes engaged his attention lady westhaven reflected with regret on her approaching departure which must divide her from emmeline whom she seemed now to love with redoubled affection his lordship ever solicitous to gratify her proposed that emmeline should go with them into switzerland with the baron de st alpin his lordships uncle who after a life passed in the service of france now prepared to retire to his native country the baron had seen his nephew at paris he had embraced with transport the son of a beloved sister and insisted on his and lady westhavens going back with him to his estate in the païs de vaud as soon as he should have the happiness of being rejoined by his only son the chevalier de bellozane who was expected with his regiment from martinique lord westhaven on his first visit to the paternal house of his mother had found there only one of her sisters who with the baron were the last survivors of a numerous family he could not therefore resist his uncles earnest entreaties to accompany him back and lady westhaven who was charmed with the manners of the respectable veteran and interested by his affection for her lord readily consented to delay her return to england for three months and to cross france once more to attend him to have emmeline her companion in such a journey seemed to offer all that could render it charming but how could she ask her to quit mrs stafford to whom she had been so much obliged and who in her present melancholy solitude seemed more than ever to need her consolatory friendship her ladyship however ventured to mention it to emmeline who answered that tho nothing in the world would give her more pleasure than being with such friends she could not without a breach of duty which it was impossible to think of quit mrs stafford to whom she was bound by gratitude as well as by affection lord westhaven acquiesced in the justice of this objection but undertook to remove it by rendering the situation of her friend such as would make a short absence on both sides more supportable he therefore in his next conversation with stafford represented the inconvenience of a house so far from a town and how much better his family would be situated nearer the metropolis he concluded by offering him a house he had himself hired at st germains which he said he should be obliged to mrs stafford and her family if they would occupy till his return from switzerland and that no objection might arise as to expence he added that considering himself as miss mowbrays banker he had furnished her with five hundred pounds with which she was desirous of repaying some part of the many obligations she owed mr and mrs stafford mrs stafford who saw immediately all the advantages that might arise to emmeline from her residence with lady westhaven had on the slightest hint been warmly an advocate for her going however reluctant to part with her she suffered not her own gratifications to impede the interest of her fair charge but she could not prevail on emmeline to yield to her entreaties till lord westhaven having settled every thing for the removal of the family to st germains she was convinced that mrs stafford would be in a pleasant and advantageous situation and that she ought even for the sake of her and her children whom lord westhaven had so much the power of serving to yield to an arrangement which would so much oblige him the chateau they inhabited was ready furnished their cloaths were easily removed and the staffords and their children set out at the same time with lord westhaven his wife and emmeline who having seen them settled at st germains greatly to the satisfaction of mrs stafford went on to paris where in about a week they were joined by the baron de st alpin and the chevalier de bellozane footnote flower garden kitchen garden and orchard chapter xiv the baron de st alpin was a venerable soldier near sixty in whom the natural roughness of his country was polished by a long residence among the french he was extremely good humoured and chearful and passionately fond of the chevalier de bellozane who was the youngest of three sons the two elder of whom had fallen in the field the military ardour however of the baron had not been buried with them and he still entrusted the sole survivor of his house and the last support of his hopes in the same service with infinite satisfaction he embraced this beloved son on his return from martinique and with exultation presented him to his nephew to lady westhaven and miss mowbray the baron was indeed persuaded that he was the most accomplished young man in france and had no notion that every body did not behold him with the same eyes bellozane was tall well made and handsome his face and yet more his figure bore some resemblance to the godolphin family his manners were elegant his air military his vivacity excessive and he was something of a coxcomb but not more than is thought becoming to men of his profession in france at two and twenty having lived always in the army or in fashionable circles at paris he had conceived no advantageous ideas of his own country where he had not been since his childhood his father now retiring thither himself had obtained a long leave of absence for him that he might go also but bellozane would willingly have dispensed with the journey which the baron pressed with so much vehemence that he had hardly time to modernize his appearance after his american campaigns a point which was to him of serious importance he had therefore with reluctance looked forward to their journey over the alps but as soon as his father who had met him at port lorient on his landing introduced him at paris to his english relations and to emmeline the journey seemed not only to have lost its horrors but to become a delightful party of pleasure and he was happy to make the fourth in the postcoach in which lady westhaven emmeline and her ladyships woman travelled lord westhaven and the baron following in a postchaise nothing could exceed the happiness of the baron nor the gaiety of his son lord westhaven and his wife tho they talked about it less were not less pleased with their friends and their expedition while emmeline appeared restored to her former chearfulness because she saw that they wished to see her chearful but whenever she was a moment alone involuntary sighs fled towards england and when she remembered how far she must be from lady adelina from little william in short from godolphin how could she help thinking of them with concern during the day however the chevalier gave her no time for reflection he waited on her with the most assiduous attention watched her looks to prevent her slightest wishes talked to her incessantly besought her to teach him english and told her all he had seen in his travels and much that he had done a frenchman talks without hesitation of himself and the chevalier was quite a frenchman too polite however for exclusive adulation lady westhaven shared all his flattery and her real character being now unrepressed by the severity of her mother she all gaiety and good humour was extremely amused with the extravagant gallantry of the chevalier and at emmelines amazement who having been little used to the manners of the french was sometimes alarmed and sometimes vexed at the warmth of his address and the admiration which he professed towards them both lady westhaven assured her that such conversation was so usual that nobody ever thought of being offended at it and that bellozane was probably so much used to apply the figures of speech which she thought so extraordinary to every woman he saw that he perhaps knew not himself and certainly never thought of what he was saying emmeline therefore heard from him repeatedly what would from an englishman have been considered as an absolute declaration of love without any other answer than seeming inattention and flying as soon as possible to some other topic in the progress of their journey these common place speeches and this desultory gallantry was gradually exchanged for a deportment more respectful he besought emmeline very seriously to give him an opportunity of speaking to her apart which she with the utmost difficulty evaded his extreme gaiety forsook himthe poor chevalier was in love it was in vain he communicated his malady to la belle cousine as he usually called lady westhaven la belle cousine only laughed at him and told him he had according to his own account been so often in love that this additional penchant could not possibly hurt him and would merely serve to prevent what he owned he had so much dreaded being ennuyé a la mort at st alpin when he found the inexorable lady westhaven refused seriously to attend to him he applied with new ardour to emmeline herself to whom his importunity began to be distressing as she foresaw in his addresses only a repetition of the persecution she had suffered from the fiery and impetuous delamere still however she was often obliged to hear him she could hear him only with coldness which he was far from taking as discouragement as she did not love to think herself engaged she could not use that plea or even name an engagement which she believed might now never be claimed by him to whom it was given all therefore she could say was that she had no thoughts of marrying an answer which however frequently repeated bellozane determined to think favourable and emmeline knew not how to treat with peremptory rudeness the cousin of lord westhaven and of captain godolphin but whatever diminution of her ease and tranquillity she might suffer or apprehend from the growing attachment of this young man the journey was attended with so many pleasant circumstances that all parties were desirous that it might be lengthened the extreme eagerness with which the baron de st alpin had wished to revisit his estate gave way to the pleasures he found in travelling in such society and as lady westhaven had never been farther south than lyons and emmeline had never seen the southern provinces at all it was determined on their arrival at that city to proceed to the shore of the mediterranean before they went into switzerland it was the finest season of the year and the loveliest weather imaginable the party consulted therefore only pleasure on their way sometimes they went no more than a single stage in a day and employed the rest in viewing any place in its neighbourhood worth their curiosity they often left their carriages to walk to saunter to dine on the grass on provisions they had brought with them and whenever a beautiful view or uncommon scene presented themselves they stopped to admire them and bellozane drew sketches which were put into emmelines port feuille as they were travelling between marseilles and toulon they entered a road bounded on each side by mountainous rocks which sometimes receding left between them small but richly cultivated vallies and in other parts so nearly met each other as to leave little more room than sufficed for the carriage to pass while the turnings of the road were so angular and abrupt that it seemed every moment to be carrying them into the bosom of the rock thro this defile as it was quite shady they agreed to walk in some places huge masses impended over them of varied form and colour without any vegetation but scattered mosses in others aromatic plants and low shrubs the lavender the thyme the rosemary the mountain sage fringed the steep craggs while a neighbouring aclivity was shaded with the taller growth of holly phillyrea and evergreen oak and the next covered with the glowing purple of the mediterranean heath the summits of almost all crowned with groves of fir larch and pine emmeline in silent admiration beheld this beautiful and singular scene and with the pleasure it gave her a soft and melancholy sensation was mingled she wanted to be alone in this delightful place or with some one who could share who could understand the satisfaction she felt she knew nobody but godolphin who had taste and enthusiasm enough to enjoy it insensibly she left lady westhaven and the chevalier behind her and passing his lordship and the baron who were deeply engaged in a discourse about the military operations of the past war she walked on with some quickness intent on the romantic wildness of the cliffs with which she was surrounded and her mind associating with these objects the idea of him on whom it now perpetually dwelt she had brought godolphin before her and was imagining what he would have said had he been with her with what warmth he would enjoy with what taste and spirit point out the beauty of scenes so enchanting she had now left her companions at some distance yet as she heard their voices swell in the breeze along the defile she felt no apprehension in the narrowest part of it where she saw only steep craggs and the sky which their bending tops hardly admitted she was stopped by a transparent stream which bursting suddenly with some violence out of the rock is received into a small reservoir of stone and then carried away in stone channels to a village at some distance while emmeline stood contemplating this beautiful spring she beheld in an excavation in the rock close to it two persons sitting on a bench which had been rudely cut for the passenger to rest one of them appeared to be a man about fifty he wore a short light coloured coat a waistcoat that had once been of embroidered velvet from his head which was covered first with a red thrum nightcap and then with a small hat bound with tarnished lace depended an immense queüe his face tho thin and of a mahogena darkness seemed to express penetration and good humour and emmeline who had at first been a little startled was no longer under alarm when he on perceiving her near the entrance of the cavern flew nimbly out of it bowed to the ground and pulling off most politely his thrum nightcap enquiredsi mademoiselle voudrez bien se reposer emmeline thanked him and advanced towards the bench from which a girl about seventeen very brown but very pretty had on her approach arisen and put up into a kind of wallet the remains of the provisions they had been eating which were only fruit and black bread as soon as the old frenchman perceived that emmeline intended to sit down he sprung before her brushed down the seat with his cap and then making several profound bows assured mademoiselle quelle pourroit sasseoir sans incommodité the young woman dressed like the paisannes of the country was modestly retiring but emmeline desired her to remain and entering into conversation with her found she was the daughter of the assiduous old frenchman and that he was going with her to toulon in hopes of procuring her a service the baron and lord westhaven now approached and laughingly reproached emmeline for having deserted them she told them she was enchanted with the seat she had found and should wait there for the chevalier and lady westhaven i am only grieved said she that i have disturbed from their humble supper these good people the two gentlemen then spoke to the old frenchman whose countenance had something of keen intelligence and humble civility which prejudiced both in his favour je vois bien said he addressing himself to lord westhavenje vois bien que jai lhonneur de parler a un milor anglais eh comment answered his lordshipcomment tu connois donc bien les anglais oh ouijai passé a leur service une partie de ma jeunesseils sont les meilleur maitres parle tu anglais mon ami yes milor i speak little english mais continued he relapsing into the volubility of his own languagemais il ya à peu pres dix neuf ans depuis que mon maitremon pauvre maitre mouroit dans mes bras helassi avoit vecucar il etoit tout jeunjaurois passé ma vie entiere avec luijaurois retournez avec lui en angleterreah cest un païs charmant que cette angleterre you have been there then he answered that he had been three times and should have been happy had it pleased heaven to have ended his days there the praise you bestow on our country my friend said lord westhaven is worth at least this piece de six francs and the beauty de cette jolie enfant added he turning towards the little paisanne is interesting enough to induce me to enquire whether such a gift may not serve to purchase quelques petites amplettes a la ville he presented the young woman with another crown the old frenchman seemed ready to thank his lordship with his tears without solicitation or ceremony seeing that the gentlemen were disposed to listen to him he began to relate his short and simple story lady westhaven and the chevalier now arrived but she sat down by emmeline and desired the old man to continue whatever he was saying he has been praising our country said lord westhaven and in return i am willing to hear the history of himself which he seems very desirous of relating i was in the army said he as we all are till being taken with a pleurisy at calais and rendered long incapable of duty i got my discharge and hired myself as a travelling valet to a milor anglais with him he was the best master in the world i lived six years i went with him to england when he came to his estate and five years afterwards came back with him to france he met with a misfortune in losing une dame tres amiable and never was quite well afterwards to drive away trouble pour se dissiper he went among a set of his own countrymen and i believe le chagrin and living too freely gave him a terrible fever une fievre ardente lui saisit a milan ses compagnons apparemment naimoit gueres les malades for nobody came near him except a young surgeon who arrived there by accident and hearing that an englishman of fashion lay ill charitably visited him but it was too late he had already been eleven days under the hands of an italian physician and when the english gentleman saw him he said he had only a few hours to live he sat by him however but my poor master was senseless till about an hour before he died he recovered his recollection he ordered me to bring him two little boxes which he always carried with him and charged me to go to england with his body and deliver those boxes to a person he named he bade me give one of his watches which was a very rich one to his brother and told me to keep the other in memory of my master then he spoke to the strangersir said he since you have the humanity to interest yourself for a person unknown to you have the goodness to see that my servant is suffered to execute what i have directed and put your seal on my effects the money i have about me my cloaths and my common watch i have given him he knows what farther i would have done i told him on the second day of my illness baptistyou remember he tried to say something more but in a few moments he died in my arms with the assistance of the young english surgeon i arranged every thing as my master directed i went with his corps to england and received a large present from his brother whom however i did not see because he was not in london then i returned to france since you loved england so much enquired the baron puisque vous aimiez tant cet païs pourquoi ne pas y rester ah monsieur jetois riche et je brulez de partager mes richesse avec une jolie fille dont jetois eperdument amoureux eh bien i married her monsieur and for above two years we were the happiest people on earth but we were very thoughtless je ne scais comment cela se faisoit mes espece anglais qui je croyais inepuisable se dissiperent peu a peu et enfin il falloit songer a quelque provision pour ma femme et mes deux petites filles i returned therefore into the limosin of which province i was a native but some of my family were dead and the rest had neither power or inclination to assist their poor relations the seigneur of the village had bought a post at paris and was about to quit his chateau he heard i was honest and therefore tho he had very little to lose he put me into it i worked in the garden and raised enough with the little wages we had to keep us my wife learned to work and my two little girls were healthy and happy oui messieurs nous etions pauvre a la verité mais nous etions tres contents till about eight months ago and then an epidemical distemper broke out in the village and carried off my wife and my eldest daughter oh therese et toi ma petite suzette je te pleurs encore amerement je te pleurs the poor frenchman turned away and wept bitterly je scais bien continued heje scais bien quil faut saccoutumer a les souffrances we might still have lived on madelon and me at our ruinous chateau but the possessor of it dying his son sent us notice that he should pull it down indeed it must soon have fallen and ordered us to quit it ainsi me voila messieurs a cinquante ans sans pain mais pour cela je ne membarrasse pas si je pourrois bien placer ma pauvre madelon tout ira bien there was in this relation a touching simplicity which drew tears from lady westhaven and emmeline the whole party became interested for the father and the daughter who had wept silently while he was relating their story can nothing be done for these poor creatures said lady westhaven certainly we will assist them answered her lordbut let us enquire how we can best do it tu tappelles continued he speaking to the frenchman baptiste la feremais mon nomme de guerre et de condition fut toujours le limosin dites moi donc monsieur le limosin said his lordship what hopes have you of placing your daughter at toulon alas milor but little i know nobody there but an old relation of my poor wifes who is touriere at a convent and if i can not get a service for madelon i must give the good abbess a little money to take her till i can do something better for her and where do you expect to get money tenez mon seigneur answered he pulling a watch out of his pocket ayez la bonté dexaminer cet montre it is an english watch gold and in a gold case i have been offered a great deal of money for it but in all my poverty in all my distresses i have contrived to keep it because it was the last gift of my dear master but now my poor madelon must be thought of and if it must be so i will sell it and pay for her staying in the convent you shall not do that my friend replied lord westhaven still holding the watch in his hand it had a cypher h c m and a crest engraved on it h c m said his lordship and the mowbray crest pray what was your masters name milor moubray answered le limosin comment milor mowbray oui milorregardez sil vous plait voila son chiffre henricharles moubrayet voila le cimier du famille emmeline who no longer doubted but this was her fathers servant was so much affected that lady westhaven apprehending she would faint called for assistance and the chevalier who during this conversation had attended only to her snatched up the beechen cup out of which le limosin and madelon had been drinking and which still stood on the ground and flying with it to the spring brought it instantly back filled with water while lady westhaven bathed her temples and held to her her salts she soon recovered and then speaking in a faint voice to his lordship saidmy lord this is the servant in whose arms my poor father expired do allow me to intercede with your lordship for him and for his daughter but let him not know tonight at least who i am i can not again bear a circumstantial detail about my father lord westhaven now led le limosin out of the cave told him he had determined as he had known his masters family to take him into his own service and that lady westhaven would provide for his daughter at this intelligence the poor fellow grew almost frantic he would have thrown himself at the feet of his benefactor had he not been prevented then flew back to fetch his madelon that she might join in prayers and benedictions and hardly could lord westhaven persuade him to be tranquil enough to understand the orders he gave him which were to hire some kind of conveyance at the next village to carry his daughter to toulon where he gave him a direction to find his english benefactor the next day it was now late and the party hastened to leave this romantic spot which had been marked by so singular a meeting on their arrival at toulon they equipped and sent away before them to st alpin le limosin and madelon the latter of whom lady westhaven took entirely to wait on emmeline the soft heart and tender spirits of emmeline had not yet recovered the detail she had heard of her fathers death a pensive melancholy hung over her which the chevalier nothing doubting his own perfections hoped was owing to a growing affection for himself but it had several sources of which he had no suspicion and it made the remaining three weeks of their tour appear tedious to emmeline who languished to be at st alpin where she hoped to find letters from mrs stafford and from lady adelina she thought it an age since she had heard from the latter and secretly but anxiously indulged an hope of meeting a large pacquet which might contain some

and antique building but in habitable repair the only constant resident in it for some years had been the demoiselle de st alpin now about five and forty whose whole attention had been given to keeping it in order and collecting in the garden variety of plants in which she took singular pleasure detached from the world and with no other relations than her brother and her nephews whom she was seldom likely to see she found in this innocent and amusing pursuit a resource against the tedium of life her manners tho simple were mild and engaging and her heart perfectly good and benevolent with her therefore emmeline was extremely pleased and the country in which her residence was situated was so beautiful that accustomed to form her ideas of magnificent scenery from the first impressions that her mind had received in wales emmeline acknowledged that her eye was here perfectly satisfied with her heart it was far otherwise on her arrival at st alpin she found letters from lady adelina enclosed in others from mrs stafford lady adelina gave such an account of her own health as convinced emmeline it was not improved since she left england of mr godolphin she only said that he was returned from ireland but had staid with her only a few hours and was then obliged to go on business to london where his continuance was uncertain mrs stafford gave of herself and her family a more pleasing account she said she had hopes that the readjustment of mr staffords affairs would soon allow of their return to england and as it might possibly happen on very short notice and before emmeline could rejoin them she had sent by a family who were travelling to geneva and who readily undertook the care of it a large box which contained some of her cloaths and the caskets which belonged to her which had been long left at mrs ashwoods after emmelines precipitate departure from her house with delamere and which on mrs ashwoods marriage and removal she had sent with a cold note addressed to miss mowbray to the person who negociated mr staffords business in london their lengthened journey had so much broken in on the time allotted to their tour that lord and lady westhaven purposed staying only a month at st alpin the baron who had equal pride and pleasure in the company of his nephew endeavoured by every means in his power to make that time pass agreeably and felt great satisfaction in shewing to the few neighbours who were within fifteen miles of his chateau that he had in an english nobleman of such rank and merit so near a relation he had observed very early the growing passion of his son for miss mowbray he was assured that she returned it for he never supposed it possible that any woman could behold the chevalier with indifference he had heard from lord westhaven that emmeline was the daughter of a man of fashion but was by the circumstances of her birth excluded from any share of his fortune and entirely dependant on the favour of the marquis of montreville the old baron charmed himself with her person and her manners rather approved than opposed the wishes of his son and however convenient it might have been to have seen him married to a woman of fortune he was disposed to rejoice at his inclining to marry at all and convinced that with emmeline he must be happy thought he might dispense with being rich the chevalier confident of success and believing that emmeline had meant by her timid refusals only encouragement grew so extremely importunate that she was sometimes on the point of declaring to him her real situation but from this she was deterred by the apprehension that he would apply to lord delamere for the relinquishment of her promise and should he obtain it consider himself as having a claim to the hand his lordship resigned this was an hope which whatever his vanity might have suggested she never meant to give him yet she had the mortification to find that all her rejections however repeated were considered by the chevalier as words of course it was in vain she assured him that besides her disinclination to change her situation by marriage at all she had other forcible objections that she should never think of passing her life out of england that not only their country but their manners their ideas on a thousand subjects so materially differed as to make every other reason of her refusal unnecessary when she seriously urged thus much he usually answered that he would then reside in england that he would accommodate his manner of living to her pleasure and that as to the ideas which had displeased her he would never again offend her with their repetition emmeline had indeed been extremely hurt and disgusted at that levity of principle on the most serious subjects which the chevalier avowed without reserve and for which he appeared to value himself tho brought up a calvinist he had as he owned always conformed to the mode of worship and ceremonies of the catholics while he was among them and usually added that had he served amid the turks or the jews he should have done the same as a matter of great indifference the baron whose life had been more active than contemplative was unaccustomed to consider these matters deeply and as every thing bellozane advanced had with him great authority he was struck with his lively arguments and whatever might be their solidity could not help admiring the wit of the chevalier whom he sometimes encouraged to dispute with lord westhaven the religion of lord westhaven was as steady and unaffected as his morals were excellent and he entered willingly into these dialogues with bellozane in hopes of convincing him that infidelity was by no means necessary to the character of a soldier and that he was unlikely to serve well the country to which he belonged or for which he fought who began by insulting his god he found however that the young man had imbibed these lessons so early and fancied them so much the marks of a superior and penetrating mind that he could make no impression by rational argument bellozane usually answered by a sprightly quotation from some french author and his lordship soon declined the conversation believing that if sickness and sorrow did not supercede so slow a cure time at least would convince him of his folly but such was the effect of this sort of discourse on emmeline that had bellozane been in other respects unexceptionable and had her heart been free from any other impression she would never have listened to him as a lover from his own account of himself in other respects emmeline had gathered enough to believe that he was profligate and immoral but as she could not appear to detect these errors without allowing him to suppose her interested in his forsaking them she generally heard him in silence and only when pressed to name her objections stated his loose opinions as one in her mind very material to this he again repeated that his opinions he would correct his residence should be settled by herselfhad she any objection to his person enquired he as he proudly surveyed it in the long old fashioned glass which ornamented the sal a manger emmeline blushing from the conscious recollection of the resemblance it bore in height and air to that of godolphin answered faulteringlythat to his person there could be no objection to his fortune it was undoubtedly more than situated as she was she could expect to his family it was a family whose alliance must confer honour what then vehemently continued the chevalierwhat then charming emmeline occasions this long reserve this barbarous coldness since you can form no decided objection since you have undoubtedly allowed me to hope why do you thus cruelly prolong my sufferings surely you do not you can not mean finally to refuse and desert me after having permitted me so long to speak to you of my passion it is with some justice gravely and coldly answered emmelinei own it is with some justice that you impute to me the appearance of coquetry because i have listened with too much patience tho certainly never with approbation to your discourse on this subject but be assured that whatever i have said tho perhaps with insufficient firmness i now repeat in the hope that you will understand it as my unalterable resolutionthe honour you are so obliging as to offer me i never can accept and i beg you will forbear to urge me farther on a subject to which i never can give any other answer this dialogue which happened on the second day of her residence at st alpin and the first moment he could find her alone did not seem to discourage the chevalier he observed her narrowly the country round st alpin which as well as the place itself he thought triste et insupportable seemed to delight and attract her he saw her not only enduring but even fond of his aunt and her plants which were to him les sujets du monde les plus facheuxhis excessive vanity made him persist in believing that she could not admire such a place but thro some latent partiality to its master nor seek the company and esteem of his aunt but for the sake of her nephew these remarks and a conviction formed on his own selflove and on the experience of his parisian conquests made him disregard her refusal and persecute her incessantly with his love lord westhaven saw her uneasiness but knew not how to relieve her without offending the baron and the chevalier or divulging circumstances of which he did not think himself at liberty without her permission to speak lady westhaven to whom emmeline was obliged to complain of the importunity of bellozane repeatedly but very fruitlessly remonstrated with him what she had at first ridiculed now gave her pain and anxious as she was to reconcile her brother to her friend from whom she thought only his warmth of temper and a misunderstanding had divided him she wished to shorten as much as possible their stay at st alpin her own situation too made her very anxious to return to england and she was impatient to see lord delamere to explain to him all the mystery of emmelines conduct a detail which she could not venture by the post tho she had written to him from lyons intreating him to suspend all opinion in regard to miss mowbrays conduct till she should see him this letter never reached the hands of lord delamere and therefore was not answered to st alpin whither his sister had desired him to direct and where she now grew very uneasy at not hearing from him le limosin and his madelon had arrived at st alpin some time before their noble patrons with whose goodness they were elated to excess le limosin himself assiduous to do every thing for every body flew about as if he was but twenty his particular province was to attend with lady westhavens english servant on her ladyship and miss mowbray and madelon was directed to wait on the latter as her fille de chambre emmeline with painful solicitude for which she could hardly account wished to hear from le limosin those particulars of her father of which he was so well able to inform her he had served too her mother whose name she had hardly ever heard repeated and of whom before witnesses she dared not enquire lord westhaven had not yet explained to him to what he principally owed the extraordinary kindness he had met with he knew not that the lady on whom he had the honour to wait was the daughter of that master to whom he had been so much obliged the first days that lord and lady westhaven and emmeline had passed with the baron had been engaged by company or in parties which he made to shew the views of the surrounding country to his english guests the chevalier never suffered emmeline to be absent from these excursions nor when at home allowed her to be a moment out of his company if she sought refuge in the chamber of mrs st alpin he followed her if she went with her to her plants thither also came bellozane and having acquired from his aunts books a few physical and botanical terms affected to desire information which the old lady highly pleased with his desire of improvement in her favourite studies gave him with great simplicity lord westhaven grew apprehensive that the jaunts of pleasure which the baron continued to propose would be too fatigueing for his wife and as they were now to go on a visit to one of st alpins old military friends who resided at the distance of fifteen miles and where they were to remain all night he prevailed on her to stay at home where emmeline also desired to be left bellozane detesting a party which the ladies were not to enliven made some efforts to be excused also but he found his declining to go would so much chagrin and disappoint his father that with whatever reluctance he was obliged to set out with him lady westhaven who was a good deal indisposed went to lie down in her own room whither emmeline attended her and finding she was disposed to sleep left her mrs st alpin was busied in her garden and emmeline delighted with an opportunity of being alone retired to her room to write to mrs stafford she had not proceeded far in her letter when a servant informed her that the messenger who had been sent to geneva for her box was returned with it she desired that it might be brought up madelon came to assist her in opening it and then left her she took out the cloaths and linen and then the two embroidered caskets which she put on the table before her and gazed at with melancholy pleasure as silent memorials of her parents they brought also to her mind the recollection of mrs carey and many of her infantine pains and pleasures at mowbray castle where she remembered first to have remarked them in a drawer belonging to that good woman to which tho it was generally locked she had occasionally sent her little charge when she was herself confined to her chair one of them she had began to inspect at clapham and perused some of the letters it contained they were from her grandmother mrs mowbray to her father and were filled with reproaches so warm and severe and such pointed censures of his conduct in regard to miss stavordale her mother to whom one letter yet more bitter was addressed that after reading three of them emmeline believed that the further inspection of the casket was likely to produce for her only unavailing regret still however she would then have continued it painful as it was but was interrupted by the sudden entrance of lord montreville who came to enquire after his son the sight of mr mowbrays picture which she had taken out created in the breast of his lordship a momentary tenderness for his niece she had since always worn that picture about her but the papers by which she had been too much affected after that interview farther to peruse she had again secured in the caskets and being almost immediately afterwards taken by delamere on her involuntary journey to stevenage from whence she returned no more to clapham she had not since had them in her possession her mind in this interval had acquired greater strength and she at length wished to know those particulars of her mothers fate into which she had hitherto forborne thro timidity to enquire being now therefore alone and having these repositories once more in her hands she resolutely inspected them the first contained about twenty letters some were those she had before seen and others followed them equally severe they seemed in sullen resentment to have been preserved and emmeline could not but reflect with pain on the anger and asperity in which they were written on the remorse and uneasiness with which they must have been read the second casket seemed also to hold letters on opening it emmeline found they were part of the correspondence between her father and mother during the early part of their acquaintance when tho they sometimes resided in the same house the vigilant observation of mrs mowbray very seldom allowed them to converse among these were several pieces of poetry elegant and affecting after having read which emmeline imagined she had seen all the box contained a few loosely folded papers only remaining but on opening one of these what was her astonishment to find in it two certificates of her mothers marriage one under the hand of a catholic priest by whom she had been married immediately on their arrival at dunkirk the other signed a few days before the birth of emmeline by an english clergyman who had again performed the ceremony in the chapel of the english ambassador at paris that the memory of her mother should thus be free from reproach that the conduct of her father which had hitherto appeared cruel and unjust should be vindicated from every aspersion and that she should herself be restored to that place in society from which she seemed to be excluded for ever was altogether such unexpected such incredible happiness as made her almost doubtful of the evidence of her senses ignorant as she was of the usual form of such papers yet the care with which these seemed to be executed left her little doubt of their regularity one other folded paper yet remained unread trembling she opened it it was written in her fathers hand and endorsed memorandum the harshness with which my mother and her family have treated miss stavordale for a supposed crime has forced her to put herself under my protection miss stavordale is now my wife but of this i shall not inform my family conceiving myself accountable no longer to persons capable of so much rashness and injustice least any thing however should happen before i can make a will in due form i hereby acknowledge emmeline stavordale now mowbray as my wife and her child whether a son or a daughter heir to my estate my brother being possessed of a very large fortune both by his late marriage and the gifts of his mothers family will hardly dispute the claim of such child to my paternal estate this is a duplicate of a paper sent to francis williamson my steward at mowbray castle signed by me at paris in presence of two witnesses this fifteenth of march henry charles mowbray witnessed by robert wallace baptiste la fere dit le limosin this which was of the same date as the last certificate confirmed every claim which they both gave emmeline to her name and fortune a change of circumstances so sudden her apprehensions that the marquis of montreville who she thought must have long known should dispute her legitimacy and her wonder at the concealment which mr williamson and mrs carey seemed passively to have suffered which together with a thousand other sensations crouded at once into her mind so greatly affected her that feeling herself grow sick she was obliged to call madelon who being at work in an adjoining room ran in and seeing her lady look extremely pale and hearing her speak with difficulty she threw open the window fetched her some water and then without waiting to see their effects she flew away to call mrs st alpin who presently appeared followed by her maid carrying a large case which was filled with bottles of various distillations from every aromatic and pungent herb her garden or the adjacent mountains afforded emmeline hardly knowing what she did was compelled to swallow a glass full of one of these cordials which mrs st alpin assured her was excellente pour les vapeurs it almost deprived her of breath but recalled her astonished spirits and having with great difficulty prevailed on her kindlybusy hostess to leave her she locked up her papers and threw herself on the bed where having directed madelon to draw the curtains and retire she tried to compose her mind and to consider what steps she ought to take in consequence of this extraordinary discovery footnote dining room footnote the most wearisome or to use the cant of the times the most boring subjects in the world footnote excellent for the cure of vapours chapter ii convinced of the noble and disinterested nature of lord westhaven emmeline thought she ought immediately on his return to shew him the papers she had found and entreat him to examine for farther particulars le limosin who seemed providentially to have been thrown in her way on purpose to elucidate her history after having formed this resolution her mind was at liberty for other reflections delamere returned to it his unjust suspicions his haughty reproaches his long indignant anger which vouchsafed not even to solicit an explanation she involuntarily compared with the gentleness the generosity of godolphin with his candid temper his warm affections his tender heart and with pain she remembered that unless delamere would relinquish the fatal promise she had given him she could not shew the preference which she feared she must ever feel for him sometimes she thought of asking lord westhaven to apply to delamere for her release but how could she venture on a measure which might involve in such difficulties lady adelina and engage lord westhaven in an enquiry fatal to his repose and that of his whole family how could she by this application counteract the wishes of lady westhaven who anxiously hoped to reunite her brother and her friend and who desired ardently to be in england that she might explain herself to delamere all the circumstances that had injured emmeline in his opinion which she thought she could easily do without hazarding any of the evils that might follow from an inconsiderate disclosure of the occurrences he had misunderstood uneasily ruminating on the painful uncertainty of her situation and the difficulties which every way surrounded her she continued alone till lady westhaven alarmed at hearing she had been ill sent her woman to enquire after and know if she might herself come to her emmeline to relieve at once her friendly solicitude arose and went to her apartment where she made light of her sickness and endeavoured to assume as much chearfulness as possibletill she had seen lord westhaven she determined not to mention to her ladyship the discovery of the morning feeling that there would be great indelicacy in eagerly divulging to her a secret by which she must tacitly accuse the marquis of montreville of having thus long detained from its legal owner the mowbray estate and of having brought up in indigence and obscurity the daughter of his brother while conscious of her claim to education and affluence struggling therefore to subdue the remaining tumult of her spirits she rejoined her friend they passed the afternoon tranquilly with mrs st alpin and about eleven oclock the following morning lord westhaven the baron and the chevalier returned emmeline took the earliest opportunity of telling lord westhaven that she wished to speak to him alone there was no way of escaping from the chevalier but by his lordships openly declaring that he wanted a private conference with his fair cousin whom he led into the garden bellozane who hoped that his earnest solicitations had prevailed on lord westhaven to befriend his love was glad to see them walk out together while he watched them from a window emmeline put into her pocket the two certificates and the memorandum written by her father without explanation or comment she gave them as soon as they were at a little distance from the house to lord westhaven he read them twice over in silence then looking with astonishment at emmeline he asked her from whence she had these papers they were enclosed my lord answered she in two little boxes or caskets which were left to me among other things by my fathers nurse who becoming the housekeeper at mowbray castle brought me up they afterwards long remained at the house of mrs james crofts with whom you know i resided on her removal after her marriage they were sent together with some of my cloaths to mrs staffords agent in london from whence she lately received them and having an opportunity of sending them to geneva by a family travelling thither she forwarded them to me and i found them yesterday in the trunk brought by the messenger which you know the baron sent thither on purpose again lord westhaven read the papers and after pausing a moment said there is no doubt there can be none of the authenticity of these papers nor of your consequent claim to the mowbray estate surely added he again pausingsurely it is most extraordinary that lord montreville should have suffered the true circumstances of your birth to remain thus long unexplained most cruel most ungenerous to possess himself of a property to which he must know he had no right your fathers memorandum says that he had forwarded a duplicate of it to francis williamson do you know whether that person is yet living he is dead my lord he died in consequence of an accident at mowbray castle where he was many years steward he must however have had sufficient time to give lord montreville every information as to his masters marriage even if his lordship knew it not as he probably did by other means yet from a man of honourfrom lord montrevillesuch conduct is most unworthy i can hardly conceive it possible that he should be guilty of such concealment surely my lord it is possible said the candid and ingenuous emmelinesurely it is possible that my uncle might by some accident for which without knowing more we can not account have been kept in ignorance of my mothers real situation for your satisfaction and mine before we say more on this subject would it not be well to hear what le limosin who was i suppose present both at my mothers marriage and at my fathers death has to relate to this proposal lord westhaven agreed the sal a compagnie was usually vacant at this time of the day thither they went together and sent for le limosin who loved talking so much that nothing was more easy than to make him tell all he remembered and even minutely describe every scene at which he had been present le limosin said lord westhaven as soon as he came into the room i was much pleased and interested with the account you gave me when i first met you of the english master whom you call milor mowbray i know his family well tell me does this picture resemble him his lordship shewed him a portrait of mr mowbray which had been drawn at paris le limosin looked a moment at itthe tears came into his eyes o ouioui mi lorje me rappelle bien ce portraitah quel resemblance quelques mois avant sa mort tel etoit mon pauvre maitre ah added he giving back with a sigh the picture to lord westhavencela me fend le coeur now then reassumed lord westhaven look le limosin at that he put before him the resemblance of emmelines mother which had been painted at the same time eh pardi ouivoilavoila madame la charmante femme dont la perte couta la vie a mon maitre helasje men souviens bien du jôur que je vis pour la premiere fois cette aimable dame elle navoit quenviron quatorze a quinze ans ah quelle etoit pour lors gaï espiegle folatre et si bellesi belle tell me said lord westhaven all you remember of her i remember her my lord said le limosin speaking still in french i remember her from the first of my going to england with milor mowbray she lived then with madame mowbray and the servants told me that being a distant relation and an orphan madame had taken her and intended to give her a fortune milor mowbray when he first returned from his travels used to live for two or three months together with madame his mother but she was strict and severe and used frequently to reproach him with his gaietiesil etoit un peu libertin milor comme sont a lordinaire les jeunes seigneurs de sa nation he admired mademoiselle stavordale as a beautiful child and used to romp with her but as she grew older madame mowbray was dissatisfied with him for taking so much notice of her and would oblige her to live always up in madames dressing room so that my master could hardly ever see her madame however told my master one day that tho mademoiselle stavordale had no fortune she would not object to his marrying her in a year or two if he was then in the same mind but my master was in his turn offended he said he would not be dictated to nor told whether he should marry or remain single madame etoit forte brusqueelle piquoit monsieur par un reponse un peu viveand they had a violent disagreement in consequence of which he quitted her house and only went now and then afterwards to see her quite in form some months afterwards he called me to him and as i was dressing him he asked me if i had no female friend among his mothers servants baptiste said he i can not get the demoiselle stavordale out of my headjaime a la folie cette fille mais pour le mariage je ne suis pas trop sur que je macquitterai bien en promissant de laimer pour la vieje veux aussi quelle maime sans que linteret yentre pour quelque chosepuisque madame ma mere samuse a me guetter je voudrois bien la tromper je scais que tu est habilene pourra tu pas nous menager une petite tete a tete milor je faisois mon possibleet enfinpar la bonté et lhonetetédune fille qui servoit madameje vins heureusement aboutquelque jours apresmonsieur enleva la belle stavordale tant en depitquen amour at this recital emmeline found herself cruelly hurt but lord westhaven besought her to command herself and le limosin went on to avoid the rage and reproaches of madame mowbray which it was likely would be very loud my master took mademoiselle stavordale immediately abroad we landed at dunkirk but the young lady was so unhappy at the step she had taken elle pleuroit elle se desoloit elle sabandonna a le desespoirenfin tant elle faisoit that monsieur sent for a priest and they were married soon afterwards my lady was likely to bring monsieur an heir ah quils etoient pour lors heureux but their happiness was interrupted by the death of my masters mother madame mowbray who had never forgiven him and who disposed of all her money that was in her own power to his brother my poor lady took this sadly to heart she reproached herself with being the cause of my masters losing such a fortune he said he had yet enough and tried to console my lady still still it hung on her spirits and she could not bear to think that madame mowbray who had brought her up and had been kind to her when she had no other friend should have died in anger with her i believe my master was sorry then that he had not reconciled himself with his mother as my lady often begged and entreated that he would but it was now too late and he said his brother had used him unkindly and had certainly helped to irritate his mother against him and he would not write to him tho my lady often desired and prayed that he would as she grew near her time she was more and more out of spirits and my master finding her uneasy because they had not been married by an english priest had the ceremony performed again in the chapel of the english ambassador my master could not however make her forget her concern for the death of his mother and she was always melancholy as if she had foreseen how little a time she had herself to live alas she brought my master a daughter and died in three hours if i were to live a thousand years continued le limosin i should never forget my poor masters distraction when he heard she was dead it was with great difficulty that even with the assistance of his english servants i could prevent his destroying himself in the phrenzy of his grief i dared not leave him a moment he heard nothing we said to him he heeded not the questions i asked him about the child and at last i was forced to send an express to mr oxenden his friend who was at some distance from paris he came and by the help of another english gentleman they forced him out of the house while the body of my mistress was removed to be carried to england he was so near madness that his friends were afraid of his relapsing even after he grew better if they asked him many questions about it so they gave me orders as to her funeral and after about a fortnight he came back to the house where the child was attended by his two friends it was an heartpiercing sight milor to see him weep over the little baby as it lay in the arms of its nurse after some time he called me and told me that he should not be easy unless he was sure his poor little girl would be taken proper care of that he had no friend in france to whom he chose to entrust her and therefore ordered me to go with the nurse to england and directed therése my mistresss fille de chambre to go also that the child might be well attended he told me that he should perhaps quit paris before i could get back in which case he would leave directions where i should follow him then he kissed his little girl and his two friends tore him away i immediately proceeded to england as he directed with the nurse and therése and we carried the infant to the chateau de mowbray the french nurse could speak no english and could not be prevailed upon to stay above two days therése too longed to get back to france and we immediately returned to paris where i found a letter from my master ordering me to follow him into italy at milan milor i rejoined him he looked very ill and complained of feeling himself indisposed but still he went out and i believe drank too much with his english friends the third or fourth day after i got there he came home from a party which he had made out of town with them about ten oclock in the morning and told me he had a violent pain in his head he went up into his room i am strangely disordered baptiste said he as he put his hand to his templesperhaps it may go off but if it should grow worse as i am afraid it will remember that you take those two little boxes in which i keep my papers to england and deliver them to my steward at mowbray castle i have already written to him about my daughter then almost shrieking with the acute pain which darted into his head he criedi can not talk nor can i now write to my brother as i think i ought to do about my child but send send for a notary and when i am a little easier i will dictate a will milor i sent for the notary but he waited all day in the antiroom to no purpose my poor master was never again easy enough to see himnever again able to dictate a will he grew more and more delirious and continued to complain of his head his head alas he did not even know me till about an hour before his death emmeline whose tears had almost choaked her during the greatest part of this narration now said to lord westhaven my lord do not let him repeat the scene of my fathers death i am not now able to bear it well le limosin said his lordship this young lady who is the daughter of your master the same whom you helped to carry an infant to mowbray castle will soon have it in her power to reward your fidelity and attachment to her father le limosin now threw himself on his knees in a transport of joy and acknowledgment lord westhaven fearing that his raptures might quite overcome the disturbed spirits of his fair mistress desired her to give him her hand to kiss which she did and trying but ineffectually to smile thro her tears was led by his lordship into her own room he told her that at present he wished to conceal from lady westhaven the discovery they had made for tho i am convinced added he that for your sake she will rejoice in it she will be hurt at the extraordinary conduct of her father and harrass herself with conjectures about it and apologies for it which i wish to spare her in her present state emmeline assured him she would observe a strict silence and he left her to give to le limosin a charge of secresy he then retired to his room and wrote to lord montreville stating the simple fact and enclosing copies of the certificates and after shewing his letter to emmeline sent it off to england emmeline now went out to walk in hopes of recovering her composure and being able to appear at dinner without betraying by her countenance that any thing extraordinary had been the subject of her conversation with lord westhaven the chevalier however was soon at her side and still flattering himself that his lordship had undertaken to plead his cause he addressed her with all the confidence of a man sure of success emmeline was very little disposed to listen to him and with a greater appearance of chagrin and impatience than she had yet shewn repeated to him her determination not to marry he still declared himself sure of her relenting and added that unless she had designed finally to hear him favourably she would never have allowed him so repeatedly to press his attachment this speech which indirectly accused her of coquetry encreased her vexation but the persevering chevalier was not to be repressed he told her that he had projected a party of pleasure on the lake the next day in which he intended to include a visit to the rocks of meillerie it is classic ground mademoiselle said he and is fitted to love and despair ah will you not there hear me will you still inhumanly smile will you still look so gentle while your heart is harder than the rocks we shall seecolder than the snow that crowns theman heart on which even the pen of fire which rousseau held would make no impression he held her hands during this rhapsody she could not therefore immediately escape but on the appearance of a servant who announced the dinners being ready she coldly disengaged herself and went into the house footnote drawing room footnote o yes my lord i recollect well this picture what a likeness such a few months before he died was my poor master alas it cuts me to the heart footnote ah hah yesthere is sure enough my lady the charming woman whose loss cost my master his life alas how well i recollect the first day i saw this amiable lady she was then only between fourteen and fifteen and at that time so gay so full of frolic and vivacity and so very very pretty footnote he was a little free my lord as the young noblemen of his country usually are footnote madame was very hasty she irritated my master by a sharp answer footnote i love that girl to madness but as to marrying her i am not quite sure i should acquit myself well were i to promise that i would love her for ever i desire too that interest may have nothing to do with her affection for me as my mother amuses herself with watching me i long to deceive her you are a clever fellow can not you contrive for us a private meeting footnote my lord i did my best and at last by the goodness and civility of a young woman who waited on madame i happily accomplished it some days after which my master carried off the fair stavordale as much thro revenge as love footnote she wept she lamented she gave herself up to despair chapter iii the agitation she had undergone in the morning affected both the spirits and the looks of emmeline and when immediately after dinner bellozane proposed the party of pleasure he had projected for the next day lady westhaven answeredas for me i shall on my own account make no objection but i can not equally answer for our fair cousinemmeline my love you seem ill i can not imagine my lord what you have been saying to her i have been advising her answered lord westhaven to go into a convent and her looks are merely looks of penitence for all the mischief she has done she determines to take the veil and to do no more emmeline tho hardly able to bear even this friendly raillery turned it off with a melancholy smile the party was agreed upon the baron went out to give orders for preparing the provisions they were to take with them and the chevalier to see that the boat was in a proper state for the expedition and give the boatmen notice lady westhaven then began talking of england and expressed her astonishment at having heard nothing from thence for above six weeks while lord westhaven was attempting to account for this failure of intelligence which he saw gave his wife more concern than she expressed a servant brought in several large pacquets of letters which he said the messenger who was usually sent to the post town had that moment brought in his lordship eagerly surveying the address of each gave to emmeline one for her which opening she found came from mrs stafford and enclosed another st germains june my dearest emmeline will forgive me if i write only a line in the envelope to account for the long detention of the enclosed letter it has by some mistake of mr la fosse been kept at rouen instead of being forwarded to st germains and appears to have passed thro numberless hands i hope you will get it safe tho my being at paris when it did arrive here has made it yet a week later by the next post i shall write more fully and therefore will now only tell you we are well and that i am ever with the truest attachment your c stafford emmeline now saw by the seal and the address that the second letter was from lord montreville it appeared to have been written in great haste and as she unfolded it infinite was her amazement to find instead of a remittance which about this time she expected the promise she had given delamere torn in two pieces and put into a blank paper the astonishment and agitation she felt at this sight hardly left her power to read the letter which she held berkleysquare may dear miss mowbray my son lord delamere convinced at length of the impropriety of a marriage so unwelcome to his family allows me to release you from the promise which he obtained i do myself the pleasure to enclose it and shall be glad to hear you receive it safe by an early post my lord delamere assures me that you hold no promise of the like nature from him if he is in this matter forgetful i doubt not but that you will return it on receipt of this maddox informs me that he shall in a few days forward to you the payment due to which i beg leave to add that if you have occasion for fifty or an hundred pounds more during your stay on the continent you may draw on maddox to that amount with sincere wishes for your health and happiness i am dear miss mowbray your obedient and faithful humble servant montreville tho joy was in the heart of emmeline the predominant emotion she yet felt some degree of pique and resentment involuntarily arise against lord montreville and his son and tho the renunciation of the latter was what she had secretly wished ever since she had discovered the capricious violence of delamere and the merit of godolphin the cold and barely civil stile in which his father had acquainted her with it seemed at once to shock mortify and relieve her after having considered a moment the contents of her own letters she cast her eyes towards lady westhaven whose countenance expressed great emotion while her lord sternly and displeased ran over his and then put them into his pocket what say your letters from england my fairest cousin said he advancing and trying to shake off his chagrin will you do me the honour to peruse them my lord said she half smilingthey will not take you up much time he read them it is a settled thing then i find lady westhaven yours are i presume from berkleysquare they are answered shenever and she took out her handkerchiefnever have i received any less welcome she gave one from lady frances crofts to his lordship in which with many details of her own affairs was this sentence before this you have heard from my father or my mother that lord delamere has entirely recovered the use of his reason and accepts of miss otley with her immense fortune this change was brought about suddenly it was settled in norfolk immediately after lord delameres return from ireland i congratulate you and lord w on an event which i conclude must to both of you be pleasing i have seen none of the family for near three weeks as they are gone back into norfolk only my brother called for a moment and seemed to be greatly hurried by which as well as from other circumstances i conclude that preparations are making for the wedding immediately may lady westhaven who saw all hopes of being allied to the friend of her heart for ever at an endwho believed that she had always cherished an affection for her brother and who supposed that in consequence of his desertion she was left in mortifying dependance on lord montreville was infinitely hurt at this information the letter from her father to emmeline confirmed all her apprehensions there was a freezing civility in the style which gave no hopes of his alleviating by generosity and kindness the pain which her ladyship concluded emmeline must feel while lord westhaven knowing that to her whom he thus insulted with the distant offer of fifty or an hundred pounds he really was accountable for the income of an estate of four thousand five hundred a year for near nineteen years and that he still withheld that estate from her could hardly contain his indignation even before his wife whom he loved too well not to wish to conceal from her the ill opinion he could not help conceiving of her father emmeline who was far from feeling that degree of pain which lady westhaven concluded must penetrate her heart was yet unwilling to shew that she actually received with pleasure tho somewhat allayed by lord montrevilles coldness an emancipation from her engagement of her partiality to godolphin her friend had no idea for emmeline too conscious of it to be able to converse about him without fearing to betray herself had studiously avoided talking of him after their first meeting and she now imagined that lady westhaven passionately fond of her brother as she was would think her indifference affected thro pique and carried too far if she did not receive the intelligence of their eternal separation with some degree of concern these thoughts gave her an air of vexation and embarrassment which would have saved her the trouble of dissimulation had she been an adept in its practice extremely harrassed and out of spirits before tears now in spite of her internal satisfaction and perhaps partly arising from it filled her eyes while lady westhaven who was greatly more hurt exclaimed my brother then marries miss otley after all i have heard him say i thought it impossible he will however i doubt not be happy answered emmeline the satisfaction of having made lord and lady montreville completely happy must greatly contribute to his being so himself heaven grant it replied lady westhaven poor frederic he throws away an invaluable blessing whether he will in any other find consolation i greatly doubt but however changed his heart may be my dearest emmeline added she tenderly embracing her i think i can venture to assure you that those of lord westhaven and your augusta will towards you ever be the same emmeline now wished to put an end to a conversation which lady westhaven seemed hardly able to support and she languished herself to be alone forcing therefore a smile tho the tears still fell from her eyes she saidmy dear friends tho i expected this long ago yet i beg you to consider that being but a woman and of course vain my pride is a little wounded and i must recollect all your kindnesses to put me in good humour again with myself do not let the chevalier follow me for i am not disposed to hear any thing this evening after these sweetest and most consoling assurances of your inestimable friendship therefore i shall take madelon with me and go for a walk she then left the room lady westhaven not attempting to detain her and her lord vexed to see his gentle augusta thus uneasy remained with her pointing out to her the fairest prospects of establishment for her beloved emmeline tho he thought the present an improper opportunity to open to her his knowledge of those circumstances in her friends fortune which without such conspicuous merit could hardly fail of obtaining it to go to a great distance from the house alone emmeline had not courage to stay near it subjected her to the intrusion and importunity of the chevalier she therefore determined to take madelon whose presence would be some protection without any interruption to her thoughts she had wished ever since her arrival at st alpin to visit alone the borders of the lake of geneva madelon alert and sprightly undertook to shew her the pleasantest way and led her thro a narrow path crossing a hill covered with broom and coppice wood into a dark and gloomy wood of fir cypress and chestnut that extended to the edge of the water from which it was in some places separated by rocks pointing out into the lake while in others the trees grew almost in the water and dipped their extremities in the limpid waves beneath them madelon informed emmeline that this was the place where the servants of the castle assembled to dance of an holyday in the shade and where boats usually landed that came from the other side of the lake the scene softened into more pensive beauty by the approach of a warm and serene evening had every thing in it that could charm and soothe the mind of the lovely orphan but her internal feelings were at this time too acute to suffer her to attend to outward circumstances she wished only for tranquillity and silence to collect her thoughts and bidding madelon find herself a seat she went a few yards into the wood and sat down on the long grass where even madelon might not remark her the events of the two last days appeared to be visions rather than realities from being an indigent dependant on the bounty of a relation whose caprice or avarice might leave her entirely destitute she was at once found to be heiress to an extensive property from being bound down to marry if he pleased a man for whom she felt only sisterly regard and who had thrown her from him in the violence of unreasonable jealousy and gloomy suspicion she was now at liberty to indulge the affections she had so long vainly resisted and to think without present selfaccusation or the danger of future repentance of godolphin in imagination she already beheld him avowing that tenderness which he had before generously struggled to conceal she saw him who she believed would have taken her without fortune receiving in her estate the means of bestowing happiness and the power of indulging his liberal and noble spirit she saw the tender unhappy adelina reconciled to life in contemplating the felicity of her dear william and lord westhaven to whom she was so much obliged glorying in the good fortune of a brother so deservedly beloved while still calling her excellent and lovely friend augusta by the endearing appellation of sister she saw her forget in the happiness of godolphin the concern she had felt for delamere from this delicious dream of future bliss she was awakened somewhat suddenly by madelon who running towards her told her that a boat in which there appeared to be several men was pointing to land just where she had been sitting emmeline wearied as she was with the chevaliers gallantry immediately supposed it to be him and she knew he was out on the lake she therefore advanced a step or two to look it was so nearly dark that she could only distinguish a man standing in the boat whose figure appeared to be that of bellozane and taking madelon by the arm she hastily struck into the wood to avoid him by returning to st alpin before he should perceive her she had hardly walked twenty paces when she heard the boat put on shore and two or three persons leap out of it still hoping however to get thro the wood before bellozane could overtake her she almost ran with madelon but somebody seemed to pursue them her cloaths were white and she knew that notwithstanding the evening was so far shut in and the path obscured by trees she must yet be distinguished gliding between their branches the persons behind gained upon her and her pace quickened as her alarm encreased for she now apprehended something yet more disagreeable than being overtaken by bellozane suddenly she heardarretez arretez mesdames de grace dites moi si vous etes de la famille du baron de st alpin the first word of this sentence stopped the flying emmeline and fixed her to the spot where she stood it was the voice of godolphingodolphin himself was before her the suddenness of his appearance quite overcame her breathless as she was before from haste and fear and finding that to support herself was impossible she staggered towards a tree which grew on the edge of the path but would have fallen if godolphin had not caught her in his arms he did this merely from the impulse of his natural gallantry and good nature what were his transports when he found that the fugitive whom he had undesignedly alarmed by asking a direction to st alpin was his adored emmeline and that the lovely object whose idea since their first meeting had never a moment been absent from it he now pressed to his throbbing heart instantly terrified however to find her speechless and almost insensible he ordered the servant who followed him to run back for some water and seating her gently on the ground he threw himself down by her and supported her while madelon wringing her hands called on her aimable her belle maitresse and was too much frightened to give her any assistance before the man returned with the water her recollection was restored and she said faintlymr godolphin is it possible loveliest miss mowbray how thoughtlessly have i alarmed youcan you forgive me ah cried she disengaging herself from his supporthow came you here and from whence godolphin without considering and almost without knowing what he said repliedi come from lord delamere from lord delamere exclaimed she in amazement is he not in london thenis he not married no i overtook him at besançon where he lies illvery ill ill repeated emmelineill and at besançonmerciful heaven she now again relapsed almost into insensibility for at the mention of godolphins having overtaken him and having left him ill a thousand terrific and frightful images crouded into her mind but the predominant idea was that it was on her account they had met and that delameres illness was a wound in consequence of that meeting that such an imagination should possess her godolphin had no means of knowing he therefore very naturally concluded that the violent sorrow which she expressed on hearing of delameres illness arose from her love towards him and in such a conclusion he found the ruin of those hopes he had of late fondly cherished happy happy delamere said he sighing to himselfher first affections were his and never will any secondary tenderness supersede that early impression alas his rejection of her has not been able to efface itfor me there is nothing to hope and while i thus hold her to my heart i have lost her for ever i came not hither however solely on my own account but rather to save from pain her and those she loves tis not then of myself i am to think while these reflections passed thro his mind he remained silent and emmeline concluded that his silence was owing to the truth of her conjecture the grief of lady westhaven for her brother the despair of lord montreville for his son presented themselves to her mind and the contemptuous return of her promise which a few hours before she thought of with resentment was now forgotten in regret for his illness and pity for his sufferings ah cried she trying to rise what shall i say to lady westhavenhow disclose to her such intelligence as this it was to prevent her hearing it abruptly said godolphin that i came myself rather than sent by a messenger or a letter such distressing information so strongly had the idea of a duel between them taken possession of the mind of emmeline that she had no courage to ask particulars of his illness and shuddering with horror at the supposition that the hand godolphin held out to assist her was stained with the blood of the unfortunate delamere she drew hers hastily and almost involuntarily from him and taking again madelons arm attempted to hasten towards home but the scene of anguish and terror which she must there encounter with lady westhaven the distress and vexation of her lord and the misery of believing that godolphin had made himself for ever hateful to all her own family and that if her cousin died she could never again behold him but with regret and anguish were altogether reflections so overwhelming and so much more than her harrassed spirits were able to sustain that after tottering about fifty yards she was compelled to stop and gasping for breath to accept the offered assistance of godolphin strongly prepossessed with the idea of her affection for delamere he languidly and mournfully lent it he had no longer courage to speak to her yet wished to take measures for preventing lady westhavens being suddenly alarmed by his appearance and he feared that not his appearance only but his countenance would tell her that he came not thither to impart tidings of happiness it was now quite dark and the slow pace in which only emmeline could walk had not yet carried them through the wood the agitation of emmeline encreased she wished yet dreaded to know the particulars of delameres situation and unable to summons courage to enquire into it she proceeded mournfully along almost borne by godolphin and madelon who understanding nothing of what had been said and not knowing who the gentleman was who had thus frightened her mistress was herself almost as much in dismay after a long pause emmeline in faultering accents asked if the situation of lord delamere was absolutely desperate i hope and believe not said godolphin when i left him at least there were hopes of a favourable issue ah wherefore did you leave him why not stay at least to see the event because he so earnestly desired that his sister might know of his situation and that i only might acquaint her with it and press her to go to him she will need no entreaties poor poor delameresighing deeply emmeline again became silent they were to mount a small hill which was between the wood they had left and the grounds immediately surrounding st alpin which was extremely steep and rugged before she reached the top she was quite exhausted i believe said she i must again rest before i can proceed she sat down on a bank formed by the roots of the trees which sustained the earth on the edge of the narrow path godolphin excessively alarmed at her weakness and dejection which he still attributed to the anguish she felt for delamere sat by her hardly daring to breathe himself while he listened to her short respiration and fancied he heard the violent palpitation of her heart and how long do you think said she again recurring to delamerehow long may he linger before the event will be known i really hope and i think i am not too sanguine that the fever will have left him before we see him again the fever repeated emmelinehas he a fever then yes replied godolphini thought i told you that a fever was his complaint but had you not better my dear madam think a little of yourself ill as you appear to be i see not how you are to get home unless you will suffer me to go on and procure some kind of conveyance for you i shall do very well answered she as i am if you will only tell me about lord delamere he has only a fever and is it not enough said godolphin tho were i lord delamere i should think an illness that called forth in my favour the charming sensibility of miss mowbray the happiest event of my life having said this he fell into a profound silence the certainty of her affection for delamere deprived him of all spirits when he most wanted to exert them yet it was necessary to take some measures for introducing himself at st alpin without alarming lady westhaven and to consider how he was to account to his brother for delameres estrangement from emmeline and while he canvassed these and many other perplexities emmeline who was relieved from the most distressing of her apprehensions and dared not for the world reveal what those apprehensions had been in some degree recovered herself and growing anxious for lady westhaven said she believed she could now walk home as she was about to arise with an intention to attempt it they heard the sound of approaching voices and almost immediately lights appeared above the hill while mademoisellemiss mowbraymadelonmadelon was frequently and loudly repeated by the persons who carried them the baron and lord westhaven said emmeline alarmed at my being out so late have sent persons in search of me her conjecture was right in a moment the chevalier with a flambeau in his hand was before them who when he found emmeline sitting in such a place supported by a young man whom he had never before seen was at once amazed and displeased there was no time for explanation lord westhaven immediately followed him and after stopping a moment to consider whether the figure of godolphin which rose before him was not an illusion he flew eagerly into his arms the manly eyes of both the brothers were filled with tears lord westhaven had not seen godolphin for four years and since their last parting they had lost their father after a short pause his lordship introduced godolphin to bellozane and then taking the cold and trembling hand of emmeline who leaned languidly on madelon he said and you my lovely cousin for whose safety we have been above an hour in the cruellest alarm where did you find william and by what extraordinary chance are ye here together emmeline with great difficulty found voice enough to explain their accidental meeting and bellozane observing her apparent faintness saidyou seem mademoiselle to be extremely fatigued pray allow me the honour of giving you my arm if you please said she in a low voice and supposing that godolphin would be glad to have some conversation with his brother she accepted his assistance and proceeded this preference however of bellozane godolphin imputed to her coldness or dislike towards himself and so struck was he with the cruel idea that it was not without an effort he recollected himself enough to relate to his brother as they walked all that it was necessary for him to know lord westhaven anxious for a life so precious to his wife and her family as was that of lord delamere determined immediately to go to him at present it was necessary to reveal as tenderly as possible his situation to his sister lady westhaven and first to dissipate the uneasiness she had suffered from the long absence of emmeline footnote stay stay a moment ladies have the goodness to tell me whether you belong to the family of the baron de st alpin chapter iv lord westhaven first entered the room where his wife was whose alarming apprehensions at emmelines long stay were by this time extreme our emmeline is returned my love said he and has met with no accident lady westhaven eagerly embracing her reproached her tenderly for her long absence but then observing how pale she looked and the fatigue and oppression she seemed to suffer her ladyship said surely you have been frightenedor you are ill you look so faint she is a little surprised interrupted lord westhaven seeing her still unable to answer for herself she has brought us a visitor whom we did not expect my brother godolphin landed just as she was returning home at this intelligence lady westhaven could express only pleasure she had never seen godolphin who was now introduced and received with every token of regard by her ladyship as well as by the baron and mrs st alpin who beheld with pleasure another son of their sister and beheld him an honour to their family bellozane however saw his arrival with less satisfaction he remembered that emmeline had been as she had told him well acquainted with godolphin in england and recollected that whenever he had been spoken of she had always done justice to his merit yet rather evaded than sought the conversation her extraordinary agitation on his arrival which was such as disabled her from walking home seemed much greater than could have been created by the sight of a mere acquaintance his figure was so uncommonly handsome his countenance so interesting and his address such a fortunate mixture of dignity and softness that bellozane vain as he was could not but acknowledge his personal merit and began to fear that the coldness and insensibility of emmeline which he had till now supposed perseverance would vanquish were less occasioned by her affected blindness to his own perfections than by her prepossession in favour of another whatever internal displeasure this idea of rivalry gave the chevalier he overwhelmed godolphin with professions of regard and esteem not the less warm for being wholly insincere but godolphin who saw in the encreasing dejection of emmeline only a confirmation of her attachment to delamere drooped in hopeless despondence emmeline unable to support herself retired early to her room and godolphin complaining of fatigue was conducted to his by bellozane while lord westhaven meditated how to disclose to his wife without too much distressing her the illness of her brother he thought that as she had suffered a good deal of vexation in the course of the day as well as terror at emmelines absence at so late an hour in the evening he would defer till the next morning this unwelcome intelligence as soon however as she was retired he communicated to his uncle and aunt the situation of lord delamere and the necessity there was for their quitting st alpin the next day to attend him an account which they both heard with sincere regret mrs st alpin heartily wished lord delamere was with her being persuaded she could immediately cure him with remedies of her own preparing while the baron expressed his vexation and regret to find the visit of his nephews so much shortened lord westhaven went to his own apartment in great uneasiness he heard from his brother that lord delamere repenting of his renunciation of emmeline was coming to st alpin when illness stopped him at besançon he knew not how to act about her who heiress to a large fortune was of so much more consequence than she had been hitherto supposed he had a long contention in view with lord montreville and was now likely to be embarrassed with the passion of delamere if he recovered who would certainly expect his influence over emmeline to be exerted to obtain his pardon or if the event of his illness should prove fatal he dreaded the anguish of lady westhaven and the despair of the whole family he was besides hurt at that melancholy and unhappy appearance so unlike his former manners which he had observed in godolphin and for which ignorant of his passion for emmeline he knew not how to account his short conversation with him had cleared up no part of the mystery which he could not but perceive hung about the affairs of lady adelina and he only knew enough to discover that something remained which it would probably pain him to know thoroughly the pillow of emmeline also was strewn with thorns for tho the sharpest of them was removed by having heard that delamere was ill without having suffered from the event of any dispute in which he might on her account have engaged she was extremely unhappy that he had in pursuit of her come to france which she now concluded must be the case and sorry for the disquiet which she foresaw must arise from his indisposition and his love she was sure that lady westhaven would immediately fly to her brother and in that event how was she herself to act could she suffer her generous her tender friend to whom she was so much obliged to encounter alone all the fatigue and anxiety to which the sickness and danger of this beloved brother would probably expose her yet could she submit to the appearance of seeking a man who had so lately renounced her for ever with coldness contempt and insult if she went not with lady westhaven she had no choice but that of travelling across france alone to rejoin mrs stafford since she could not remain with propriety a moment at st alpin with the chevalier de bellozane whose addresses she never meant to encourage and whose importunate passion persecuted and distressed her godolphin toowhither would godolphin go could she go where he was and conceal her partiality or could she by accompanying him to besançon plunge another dagger in the heart of delamere and shew him not only that he had lost that portion of her regard he had once possessed but that all her love was now given to another that she was most partial to godolphin she could no longer attempt to conceal from herself the moment her fears that he had met delamere hostilely were removed all her tenderness for him returned with new force she again saw all the merit all the nobleness of his character but she still tormented herself with uneasy conjectures as to the cause of his journey to switzerland and wearied herself with considering how she ought to act till towards morning when falling thro mere fatigue and lassitude into a short slumber she saw multiplied and exaggerated in dreams the dreadful images which had disturbed her waking and starting up in terror determined no more to attempt to sleep it was now day break and wrapping herself in her muslin morning gown and cloak she went down into the garden of mrs st alpin where seated on a bench under a row of tall walnut trees which divided it from the vineyard she leaned her head against one of them and lost in reflections on the strangeness of her fate and the pain of her situation she neither saw or heard any thing around her godolphin in the anxiety she had expressed for delamere believed he saw a confirmation of his fears which had always been that the early impression he had made on her heart would be immoveable and that neither his having renounced her or his rash and heedless temper would prevent her continuing to love him wretched in this idea he concluded all hopes of obtaining her regard for ever at an end while every hours experience of his own feelings whether he thought of or saw her convinced him that his love however desperate was incurable accustomed to fatigue all that he had endured the day before could not restore to him that repose which was driven away by these reflections almost as soon as he saw it was light he left his room and with less interest than he would once have taken in such a survey wandered over the antique apartments of the paternal house of his mother he then went down into the garden and musing rather than observing passed along the strait walk that went between the walnut trees into the vineyard at the end of it he turned and in coming again towards the house saw emmeline sitting on the bench beneath them who had not seen him the first time he passed her but who now appeared surprised at his approach she had not however time to rise before he went up to her and bowing gravely enquired how she did after the alarm he had been so unfortunate as to give her the evening before i fear said he seating himself by her that miss mowbray is yet indisposed from her late walk and my inconsiderate address to her i know not how to forgive myself for my indiscretion since it has distressed you such intelligence as i had the misfortune of hearing sir of the brother of lady westhavena brother so dear to hercould hardly fail of affecting me i should have been concerned had a stranger been so circumstanced but when ah madam interrupted godolphin you need not repeat all the claims which give the fortunate delamere a right to your favour but do not suffer yourself on his account to be so extremely alarmed i hope the danger is by no means so great as to make his recovery hopeless since of those we love the most minute account is not tedious and since it may perhaps alleviate your apprehensions for his safety will you allow me to relate all i know of his illness it will engage me perhaps in a detail of our first acquaintance and carry me back to circumstances which i would wish to forget if your gratification was not in my mind a consideration superior to every other emmeline trembling yet wishing to hear all could not refuse she bowed in silence and godolphin considering that as an assent reassumed his discourse soon after i had the happiness of seeing you last my wish to embrace lady clancarryl and her family from whose house i had been long obliged to absent myself because mr fitzedward was with them carried me to ireland and to my astonishment i there met lord delamere the relationship between their families made my sister anxiously invite him to lough carryl thither reluctantly he came and an accident informed him that i had the good fortune by means of lady adelina trelawny to be known to you he did me the honour to shew me particular attention and the morning after he found i had the happiness of being acquainted with miss mowbray he took occasion when we were alone to ask me abruptly whether i knew colonel fitzedward i answered that i certainly did by the connection in our families and that he was once my most intimate friend he then unreservedly and with vehemence said that fitzedward was a villain astonished and hurt at an assertion which how true soever it might be i thought alluded to that unhappy affair which i hoped was a secret i eagerly asked an explanation but judge miss mowbray of the astonishment the pain with which i heard him impute to you the error of my unfortunate adelinawhen i saw him take out three anonymous letters one of which i found had hastened his return from france purporting that fitzedward had availed himself of his absence to win your affections that he had taken of those affections the most ungenerous advantage and that on going to a place named which i remembered to be the house where my little william was nursed he might himself see an unequivocal proof of your fatal attachment and fitzedwards perfidy when i had read these odious letters and listened to several circumstances he related which confirmed in his apprehension the truth of the assertions they contained he went on to inform me that following this cruel information he had seen you with the infant in your arms had bitterly reproached you and then had quitted you for everbut as he could not rest without trying to punish the infamous conduct of fitzedward he had pursued him to ireland where instead of finding him he heard that he was gone to france undoubtedly to meet you by your own appointment but as lord clancarryl still expected him back he determined to wait a little longer in hopes of an opportunity of discussing with him the subjects of complaint he had related tho i immediately saw what i ought to do astonishment for a moment kept me silent and in that moment we were interrupted this delay however unwelcome gave me time for reflection lord delamere was to go the same day from lough carryl to dublin i resolved to follow him thither and relate the whole truth since i would by no means suffer your generous and exalted friendship for my sister to stain the lovely purity of a character which only the malice of fiends could delight in blasting only the blind and infatuated rashness of jealousy a moment believe capable of blemish many reasons induced me however to delay this necessary explanation till i saw him at his own lodgings thither i followed him two days after he departed from lough carryl but on enquiring for him was surprised and mortified to find that he had received letters from england which had induced him immediately to return thither and that he had sailed in the packet for holyhead the day after his arrival at dublin emmeline astonished at the malice which appeared to have been exerted against her remained silent but in such tremor that it was with difficulty she continued to hear him i now therefore relinquished all thoughts of returning to the house of my sister and followed him by the first conveyance that offered greatly apprehending that if the letters he had received gave him notice of fitzedwards return to london my interposition would be too late to prevent their meeting i knew the hasty and inconsiderate delamere would without an explanation so conduct himself towards fitzedward that neither his spirit or his profession would permit him to bear and that if they met the consequence must to one of them be fatal i was impatient too to rescue your name madam from the unmerited aspersions which it bore but when i arrived in london and hastened to berkleysquare i heard that lord and lady montreville together with lady frances crofts her husband and lord delamere had gone all together to audley hall immediately after his return from ireland thither therefore i went also generous considerate godolphin sighed emmeline to herself tho related by my brothers marriage to the family of the marquis of montreville i was a stranger to every member of it but lord delamere he was gone to dine out and in the rest of the family i observed an air of happiness and triumph which lord montreville informed me was occasioned by the marriage which was intended soon to take place between his son and miss otley whose immense fortune and near relationship to his mothers family had made such a marriage particularly desirable i was glad to hear he was likely to be happy but it was not therefore the less necessary to clear up the error into which he had fallen on his coming home he appeared pleased and surprised to see me but i saw in his looks none of that satisfaction which was so evident in those of the rest of the house as soon as we were alone he said to meyou see me mr godolphin at length taken in the toils immediately after leaving lough carryl i received a letter from a person in london whom i had employed for that purpose which informed me that he heard at the office of the agent to fitzedwards regiment that he was certainly to be in town in a few days he named indeed the exact time and i who imagined that pains had been taken to keep us from meeting determined to return to england instantly that he might not again avoid me on reaching london however i found that the intelligence i had received was wholly unfounded and originated in the mistake of a clerk in the agents office none knew where fitzedward was or when he would return and though i wrote to enquire at rouen where i imagined the residence of miss mowbray might induce him to remain i have yet had no answer the entreaties and tears of my mother prevailed on me to come down hither and reckless of what becomes of me since emmeline is undoubtedly lost to me for ever i have yielded to the remonstrance of my father and the prayers of my mother and have consented to marry a woman whom i can not love let not fitzedward however imagine vehemently and fiercely he spoke that he is with impunity to escape and that tho my vengeance may be delayed i can forgive the man who has basely robbed me of her whom i could lovewhom i did loveeven to madness i own to you madam that when i found this unfortunate young man had put into his fathers hands the promise you had given him and that it was returned to you i felt at once pity for him andhope for myself which till then i had never dared to indulge godolphin had never been thus explicit before pale as death and deprived of the power as well as of the inclination to interrupt him emmeline awaited in breathless silence the close of this extraordinary narrative it was now reassumed he my turn to speak and trusting to his honour for his silence about my unhappy sister i revealed to him the whole truth i at once cleared your character from unjust blame and i hope did justice to those exalted virtues to which i owe so much i will not shock your gentle and generous bosom with a relation of the wild phrenzy the agonies of regret and repentance into which this relation threw lord delamere concerned at the confusion his reproaches and his anguish had occasioned to the whole family i lamented that i could not explain to them what i had said to him which had produced so sudden a change in his sentiments about you but to such women as the marchioness of montreville and her daughter i could not relate the unhappiness of my poor adelina and delamere steadily refused to tell them how he became convinced of your innocence and the wicked arts which had been used to mislead him which he openly imputed to the family of the crofts against whom his fiery and vindictive spirit turned all the rage it had till now cherished against fitzedward the marquis tho extremely hurt had yet candour enough to own that if i was convinced that the causes of complaint which his son had against you were ill founded i had done well in removing them yet i saw that he wished i had been less anxious for the vindication of innocence and he beheld with an uneasy and suspicious eye what he thought officious interference in the affairs of his family i observed too that he believed when the influence that he supposed i had over the mind of lord delamere was removed he should be able to bring him back to his engagements with miss otley which had i found been hurried on with the utmost precipitation the ladies who had at first overwhelmed me with civilities now appeared so angry that notwithstanding lord delameres entreaties that i would stay with him till he could determine how to act i immediately returned to london and from thence after passing a week with adelina whom i had only seen for a few hours since my return from ireland i set out for st alpin but lord delamere sir said emmeline inarticulately alas madam dejectedly continued godolphin i mean not to entertain you on what relates to myself but to hasten to that which i farther have to say of the fortunate delamere i waited a few days at southampton for a wind and then landing at havre proceeded to st germains where mrs staffords last letters had informed adelina she was settled i knew too that you were gone with my brother and lady westhaven to st alpin mrs stafford had only the day before forwarded to you lord montrevilles letter which by one from his lordship to herself she knew contained the promise you had given lord delamere she said that this renunciation would give you no pain she made me hope that your heart was not irrevocably his ah why did i suffer such illusions to lead me on to this conviction but pray forgive me lovely miss mowbray i am still talking of myself from st germains i made as much haste as possible to besançon i rode post and just as i got off my horse at the hotel was accosted by a french servant whom i knew belonged to lord delamere the man expressed great joy at seeing me and besought me to go with him to his master who he said had thro fatigue and the heat of the weather been seized with a fever and was unable to proceed to st alpin whither he was going i was extremely concerned at his journey and i hope not so selfish as to be unmoved by his illness i found indeed his fever very high but greatly irritated and encreased by his impatience as soon as he saw me he told me that he was hurrying to st alpin in hopes of obtaining your pardon that he had broke off his engagement with miss otley and never would return to england till he carried you thither as his wife i am now well enough to go on indeed godolphin added he and if i can but see her i was by no means of opinion that he was in a condition to travel his fever encreased after i left him in the evening he grew delirious and millefleur terrified came to call me to him i sat up with him for the rest of the night and being accustomed to attend invariably to the illness of men on ship board i thought i might venture from my experience to direct a change in the method which the physician he had sent for pursued in a few hours he grew better and the delirium left him but he was then convinced that he was too weak to proceed on his journey he knew i was coming hither and he entreated me to hasten my departure go my good friend said hesend augusta to me she will bring with her the generous the forgiving angel whom my rash folly has dared to injure she will behold my penitence and if her pardon can be obtained it will restore me to life but if i can not see themif i linger many days longer in suspence my illness must be fatal as i really did not think him in great danger and saw every proper care was now taken of him determined to come on not only because i wished to save lady westhaven the pain of hearing of his illness by any other means but because he was proceeding when a deep and convulsive sigh from emmeline made him look in her face from which he had hitherto kept his eyes unable to bear the varying expressions it had shewn of what he thought her concern for delamere he now beheld her quite pale motionless and to all appearance lifeless her sense of what she owed to the generosity of godolphin her concern for delamere and the dread of those contending passions which she foresaw would embitter her future life added to the sleepless night and fatigueing day she had passed had totally overcome her godolphin flew for assistance the servants were by this time up and ran to her among the first of them was le limosin who expressed infinite anxiety and concern for her and assiduously exerted himself in carrying her into the house where she soon recovered begged godolphins pardon for the trouble she had given and was going to her own room led by madelon when bellozane suddenly appeared and offered his assistance which emmeline faintly declining moved on godolphin who could not bear to leave her in such a state walked slowly by her tho she had refused his arm the expression of his countenance while his eyes were eagerly fixed on her face would have informed any one less interested than bellozane of what passed in his heart and the chevalier surveyed him with looks of angry observation which did not escape emmeline ill as she was on arriving therefore at the foot of the staircase she besought in english godolphin to leave her which he instantly did she then told the chevalier that she would by no means trouble him to attend her farther and he satisfied that no preference was shewn to his cousin at least in this instance bowed and returned with him into the room where they usually assembled in a morning and where they found lord westhaven chapter v his lordship told them that lady westhaven had been less alarmed at the account he had given her of delamere than he had apprehended and that she was preparing to begin their journey towards him immediately after breakfast i must send continued he miss mowbray to her who is i understand already up and walking bellozane then informed his lordship of what he knew of emmeline but godolphin was silent he dared not trust himself with speaking much of her he dared not relate her illness lest the cause of it should be enquired into does miss mowbray go with my sister asked he that i know not replied lord westhaven augusta will very reluctantly go without her yet her situation in regard to lord delamere is suchhe ceased speaking looked embarrassed and soon after the chevalier quitting the room before whom civility would not allow them to converse long in english and to whom his lordship thought he had no right to reveal the real situation of emmeline while it yet remained unknown to others he related to his brother the circumstances of the discovery that had been made of her birth and of her consequent claim to the mowbray estate godolphin who would from the obscurest indigence have chosen her in preference to all other women heard this account with pleasure only as supposing that independance might be grateful to her sensibility and affluence favourable to the liberality of her spirit but the satisfaction he derived from these reflections was embittered and nearly destroyed when he considered that her acquiring so large a fortune would make her alliance eagerly sought by the very persons who had before scorned and rejected her and that all the family would unite in persuading her to forgive delamere the more especially as this would be the only means to keep in it the mowbray estate and to preclude the necessity of refunding the income which had been received for so many years and which now amounted to a great sum of money when the pressing instances of all her own family and particularly of lady westhaven whom she so tenderly loved were added to the affection he believed she had invariably felt for delamere he thought it impossible that her pride however it might have been piqued by the desertion of her lover could make any effort against a renewal of her engagement and his own hopes which he had never cherished till he was convinced delamere had given her up and which had been weakened by her apparent affection for him were by this last event again so nearly annihilated that no longer conscious he retained any he fancied himself condemned still to love serve and adore the object of his passion without making any effort to secure its success or being permitted to appear otherwise than as her friend he was vexed that he had been unguardedly explicit in telling her that he had ever indulged those hopes at all since he now feared it would be the means of depriving her conversation and her manner when they were together of that charming frankness of which tho it rivetted his chains and encreased his torments he could not bear to be deprived melancholy and desponding he continued long silent after lord westhaven ceased speaking suddenly however awakening from his reverie he saiddoes your lordship think miss mowbray ought to go to meet lord delamere upon my word i know not how to advise my wife is miserable without her and fancies the sight of her will immediately restore delamere on the other hand i believe emmeline herself will with reluctance take a step that will perhaps appear like forcing herself into the notice of a man from whom she has received an affront which it is hardly in female nature to forgive they were now interrupted by bellozane who flew about the house in evident uneasiness and confusion he did not yet know how emmeline was to be disposed of he saw that lord westhaven was himself uncertain of it and he had been applying for information to le limosin and madelon who had yet received no orders to prepare for her departure while emmeline had created in the bosoms of others so much anxiety she was herself tortured with the cruellest uncertainty unable to resolve how she ought to act she had yet determined on nothing when lady westhaven sent for her who as soon as she entered the room saidmy dear emmeline are you not preparing for our journey how can i dearest madamhow can i with any propriety go where lord delamere is after the separation which has now so decidedly and irrevocably taken place between us shall i intrude again on his lordships sight and solicit a return of that regard with which i most sincerely wish he had forborne to honour me you are piqued my lovely friend and i own with great reason but mr godolphin has undoubtedly told you that poor frederic is truly penitent that he has taken this journey merely to deprecate your just anger and to solicit his pardon will my emmeline generous and gentle as she is to others be inexorable only to him besides my sweet coz pray consider a moment what else can you do you certainly would not wish to stay here surely you would not travel alone to st germains and let me add my own hopes that you will not quit me now when poor frederics illness and my own precarious health make your company not merely pleasant but necessary that is indeed a consideration which must have great force with me when lady westhaven commands how shall i disobey even tho to obey be directly contrary to my judgment and my wishes commands my dear friend very gravely and with an air of chagrin said her ladyship are neither for me to give or for you to receive certainly if you are so determined against going with me i must submit but i did not indeed think that emmeline however the brother may have offended her would thus have resented it to the sister i should be a monster lady westhaven hardly was she able to restrain her tears as she spokewas i a moment capable of forgetting all i owe you but do you really think i ought again to put myself in the way of lord delamereagain to renew all the family contention which his very unfortunate partiality for me has already occasioned and again to hazard being repulsed with contempt by the marquis and still more probably by the marchioness of montreville my lot has hitherto been humble i have learned to submit to it if not without regret at least with calmness and resignation yet pardon me if i say that however unhappy my fortune there is still something due to myself and if i again make myself liable to the humiliation of being refused i shall feel that i am degraded in mind as much as i have been in circumstances and lost to that proper pride to which innocence and rectitude has in the lowest indigence a right and which can not be relinquished but with the loss of virtue the spirit which emmeline thought herself obliged to exert was immediately lost in softness and in sorrow when she beheld lady westhaven in tears who sobbing saidgo then miss mowbraygo my dear emmeline for dear you must ever be to me leave me to be unhappy and poor frederic to die hear me my dear madam answered she with quicknessif to you i can be of the least use i will hesitate no longer but let it then be understood that i go with you and by no means to lord delamere it shall be so understoodbe assured my love it shall you will not then leave meyou will see my poor brother my best my dearest friend replied emmeline collecting all her fortitude hear me without resentment explain to you at once the real situation of my heart in regard to lord delamere i feel for him the truest concern i feel it for him even to a painful excess and i have an affection for him a sisterly affection for him which i really believe is little inferior to your own but i will not deceive you nor since i am to meet him will i suffer him to entertain hopes that it is impossible for me to fulfil to be considered as the friend as the sister of lord delamere is one of the first wishes my heart now formsagainst ever being his wife i am resolutely determined impossiblesurely you can not have made such a resolution i have indeednor will any consideration on earth induce me from that determination to recede and is it anger and resentment only have raised in your heart this decided enmity to my poor brother or is it that any other emmeline whose colourless cheeks were suffused with a deep blush at this speech hastily interrupted it whatever dear lady westhaven are my motives for the decision it is irrevocable as lord delameres sister i shall be honoured if i am allowed to consider myselfas such if my going with you to besançon will give you a daysan hours satisfaction i go get ready then my love but indeed cruel girl if such is your resolution it were better to leave you here than take you only to shew lord delamere all he has lost while you deprive him of all hopes of regaining you but i will yet flatter myself you do not mean all thisat lovers perjuries they say jove laughsand those of my fair cousin will be forgiven should she break her angry vow and receive her poor penitent come let us hasten to begin our journey to him for tho that dear godolphin whom i shall love as long as i live ah thought emmeline and so shall i assures me he does not think him in any danger my heart will sadly ache till i see him myself emmeline then left her to put up her cloaths and prepare for a journey to which she was determined solely by the pressing instances of lady westhaven to herself she foresaw only uneasiness and embarrassment and even found a degree of cruelty in permitting lord delamere to feed by her consenting to attend him those hopes to which she now could never accede unless by condemning herself to the most wretched of all lotsthat of marrying one man while her love was anothers the late narrative which she had heard from godolphin encreased her affection for him and took from her every wish to oppose its progress and tho she was thus compelled to see delamere she determined not to deceive him but to tell him ingenuously that he had lost all that tenderness which her friendship and long acquaintance with him would have induced her to cherish had not his own conduct destroyed it but it was hardly less necessary to own to him part of the truth than to conceal the rest should he suspect that godolphin was his rival and a rival fondly favoured she knew that his pride his jealousy his resentment would hurry him into excesses more dreadful than any that had yet followed his impetuous love or his unbridled passions the apprehensions that he must if they were long together discover it were more severely distressing than any she had yet felt and she resolved both now and when they reached besançon to keep the strictest guard on her words and looks and to prevent if possible her real sentiments being known to delamere to lady westhaven and to godolphin himself so painful and so difficult appeared the dissimulation necessary for that end and so contrary did she feel it to her nature that she was withheld only by her love to lady westhaven from flying to england with mrs stafford and should she be restored to her estate she thought that the only chance she had of tranquillity would be to hide herself from delamere whom she at once pitied and dreaded and from godolphin whom she tenderly loved in the silence and seclusion of mowbray castle her embarrassment and uneasiness were encreased when on her joining lord and lady westhaven whose carriages and baggage were now ready she found that the chevalier de bellozane had insisted on escorting them an offer which they had no pretence to refuse on her taking leave of the baron he very warmly and openly recommended his son to her favour and mrs st alpin who was very fond of her repeated her wishes that she would listen to her nephew and both with unfeigned concern saw their english visitors depart captain godolphin had a place in his brothers chaise madelon occupied that which on the former journey was filled by bellozane in the coach the chevalier now proceeding on horseback during the journey emmeline was low and dejected from which she was sometimes roused by impatient enquiries and fearful apprehensions which darted into her mind of what was to happen at the end of it every thing he observed confirmed godolphin in his persuasion that her heart was wholly delameres her behaviour to himself was civil but even studiously distant while the unreserved and ardent addresses of bellozane who made no mystery of his pretensions she repulsed with yet more coldness and severity and tho towards lord and lady westhaven the sweetness of her manners was yet preserved she seemed overwhelmed with sadness and her vivacity was quite lost as soon as they reached besançon lord westhaven directed the carriages to stop at another hotel while he went with his brother to that where lord delamere was at the door they met millefleur who overjoyed to see them related that since mr godolphin left his master the violence of his impatience had occasioned a severe relapse in which according to the orders mr godolphin had given the surgeons had bled and blistered him that he was now again better but very weak yet so extremely ungovernable and selfwilled that the french people who attended him could do nothing with him and that his english footmen and millefleur himself were forced to be constantly in his room to prevent his leaving it or committing some other excess that might again irritate the fever and bring on alarming symptoms they hastened to him and found not only that his fever still hung on him tho with less violence but that he was also extremely emaciated and that only his youth had supported him thro so severe an illness or could now enable him to struggle with its effects the moment they entered the room he enquired after his sister and emmeline and hearing the latter was actually come he protested he would instantly go to her lord westhaven and godolphin resolutely opposed so indiscreet a plan the former by his undeviating rectitude of mind and excellent sense had acquired a greater ascendant over delamere than any of his family had before possessed and to the latter he thought himself so much obliged that he could not refuse to attend to him he consented therefore at length to remain where he was and lord westhaven hastened back to his wife whom he led immediately to her brother she embraced him with many tears and was at first greatly shocked at his altered countenance and reduced figure but as lord westhaven and godolphin both assured her there was no longer any danger if he would consent to be governed she was soothed into hope of his speedy recovery and soon became tolerably composed as lord westhaven and godolphin soon left them alone he began to talk to his sister of emmeline he told her that when he had been undeceived by mr godolphin and the scandalous artifices discovered which had raised in his mind such injurious suspicions he had declared to lord and lady montreville his resolution to proceed no farther in the treaty which they had hurried on with miss otley and had solicited their consent to his renewing and fulfilling that which he had before entered into with miss mowbray but that his mother with more anger and acrimony than ever had strongly opposed his wishes and that his father had forbidden him on pain of his everlasting displeasure ever again to think of emmeline after having for some time he said combated their inveterate prejudice he had left them abruptly and set out with his three servants for st alpin where godolphin informed him emmeline was to be when a fever owing to heat and fatigue seized and confined him where he now was ah tell me my sister what hopes are there that emmeline will pardon me may i dare enquire whether she is yet to be moved in my favour lady westhaven who during their journey could perceive no symptoms that her resolution was likely to give way dared not feed him with false hopes yet unwilling to depress him by saying all she feared she told him that emmeline was greatly and with justice offended but that all he could at present do was to take care of his health she entreated him to consider the consequence of another relapse which might be brought on by his eagerness and emotion and then conjuring him to keep all he knew of lady adelina a secret from lord westhaven the necessity of which he already had heard from godolphin she left him and returned to emmeline to avoid the importunity of bellozane and the melancholy looks of godolphin which affected her with the tenderest sorrow she had retired to a bed chamber where she waited the return of lady westhaven with impatience her solicitude for delamere was very great and her heart greatly lightened when she found that even his tender and apprehensive sister did not think him in any immediate danger and believed that a few days would put him out of hazard even of a relapse she now again thought that since lady westhaven had nothing to fear for his life her presence would be less necessary and her mind the longer it thought of mowbray castle adhering with more fondness to her plan of flying thither she considered how she might obtain in a few days lady westhavens consent to the preliminary measure of quitting besançon chapter vi while the heiress of mowbray castle meditated how to escape thither from the embarrassed and uneasy situation in which she now was and while she fancied that in retirement she might conceal if she could not conquer her affection for godolphin tho in fact she only languished for an opportunity of thinking of him perpetually without observation lady westhaven laid in wait for an occasion to try whether the ruined health and altered looks of her brother would not move in his favour her tender and sensible friend while delamere kept his chamber emmeline easily evaded an interview but when after three or four days he was well enough to leave it it was no longer possible for her to escape seeing him however godolphin thought himself obliged to bury in silence his unfortunate passion he could not divest himself of that painful curiosity which urged him to observe the behaviour of emmeline on their first meeting bellozane had discovered on what footing lord delamere had formerly been and he dreaded a renewal of that preference she had given her lover to which his proud heart could ill bear to submit tho he could himself make no progress in her favour tho lady westhaven had entreated her to see delamere alone she had refused assigning as a reason that as he could never again be to her any other than a friend nothing could possibly pass which her other friends might not hear delamere was obliged therefore to brook the hard conditions of seeing her as an indifferent person or not seeing her at all but tho she was immoveably determined against receiving him again as a lover she had not been able to steel her heart against his melancholy appearance his palid countenance his emaciated form extremely affected her and when he approached her bowed with a dejected air and offered to take her handher haughtiness her resentment forsook hershe trembling gave it expressed in incoherent words her satisfaction at seeing him better and betrayed so much emotion that godolphin who with a beating heart narrowly observed her saw as he believed undoubted proof of her love and symptoms of her approaching forgiveness delamere who whenever he was near her ceased to remember that any other being existed would notwithstanding the presence of so many witnesses have implored her pardon and her pity but the moment he began to speak on that subject she told him with as much resolution as she could command that the subject was to her so very disagreeable as would oblige her to withdraw if he persisted in introducing it while his looks expressed how greatly he was hurt by her coldness those of godolphin testified equal dejection for however she might repress the hopes of his rival by words of refusal and resentment he thought her countenance gave more unequivocal intelligence of the real state of her heart bellozane as proud as little used to controul and disappointment and with more personal vanity than lord delamere beheld with anger and mortification the pity and regard which emmeline shewed for her cousin and ceasing to be jealous of godolphin he saw every thing to apprehend from the rank the fortune the figure of delamerefrom family connection which would engage her to listen to himfrom ambition which his title would gratifyfrom her tenderness to lady westhaven and from the return of that affection which she had as he supposed once felt for lord delamere himself but the more invincible the obstacles which he saw rising appeared the more satisfaction he thought there would be in conquering them and to yield up his pretensions on the first appearance of a formidable rival was contrary to his enterprising spirit and his ideas of that glory which he equally coveted in the service of the fair and of the french king with these sentiments of each other the restraint and mistrust of every party impeded general or chearful conversation godolphin soon left the room to commune with his own uneasy thoughts in a solitary walk lord westhaven would then have taken out bellozane in order to give lord delamere an opportunity of being alone with his sister and emmeline but he was determined not to understand hints on that subject and when his lordship asked him to take an afternoons walk found means to refuse it afraid of leaving two such combustible spirits together lord westhaven to the great relief of emmeline staid with them till delamere retired for the night but the behaviour of bellozane to emmeline which was very particular as if he wished it to be noticed had extremely alarmed delamere and whenever they afterwards met they surveyed each other with such haughty reserve and their conversation bordered so nearly on hostility and defiance that emmeline who expected every hour to see their animosity blaze out in a challenge could support her uneasiness about it no longer and sending early to speak to lord westhaven on the beginning of the second week of their stay she represented to him her fears and entreated him to prevail on the chevalier to leave them and return to st alpin i have attempted it already said he but with so little success that if i press it any farther i must quarrel with him myself i know perfectly well that your fears have too much foundation and that if we can neither separate or tranquillise these unquiet spirits we shall have some disagreeable affair happen between them i know nothing that can be done but your accepting at once your penitent cousin no my lord answered she with an air of chagrin that i will not do i most ardently wish lord delamere well and would do any thing to make him happyexcept sacrificing my own happiness and acting in opposition to my conscience why my dear emmeline how is this you had once surely an affection for delamere and his offence against you however great admits of considerable alleviation consider all the pains that were taken to disunite you and the importunity he suffered from his family surely when you are convinced of his repentance you should restore him to your favour and however you may be superior to considerations of fortune and rank yet when they unite in a man otherwise unexceptionable they should have some weight they have none with me upon my honour my lord and since we have got upon this topic i will be very expliciti am determined on no account to marry lord delamere but that i may give no room to charge me with caprice or coquetry since your lordship believes i once had so great a regard for him or with that unforgiving temper which i see you are disposed to accuse me of it is my fixed intention if i obtain by your lordships generous interposition the mowbray estate to retire to mowbray castle and never to marry at all lord westhaven at the solemnity and gravity with which she pronounced these words began to laugh so immoderately and to treat her resolution with ridicule so pointed that he first made her almost angry and then obliged her to laugh too at length however she prevailed on him again to listen to her apprehensions about delamere and bellozane do not my lord rally me so cruelly but for heavens sake before it is too late prevent any more meetings between these two rash and turbulent young men why should the chevalier de bellozane stay here because it is his pleasure i do assure you seriously my dear miss mowbray that i have almost every day since we came hither attempted to send my fiery cousin back to st alpin but my anxiety has only piqued him and he determines more resolutely to stay because he sees my motive for wishing him gone he is exactly the character which i have somewhere seen described by a french poeta young man who leger impetueux de soi meme rempli jaloux presomptueux bouillant dans ses passions cedant a ses caprices pour un peu de valeur se passoit de tous ses vices yet among all his faults poor bellozane has some good qualities and i am really sorry for this strange perseverance in an hopeless pursuit because it prevents my asking him to england i give you my honour emmeline continued his lordship in a more serious tone that i have repeatedly represented to him the improbability of his success but he answers that you have never positively dismissed him by avowing your preference to another that he knows your engagement with lord delamere is dissolved and that he considers himself at liberty to pursue you till you have decidedly chosen or even till you are actually married nay i doubt whether your being married would make any difference in the attentions of this eccentric and presuming frenchman for i do not consider bellozane as a swiss well but my dear lord if the chevalier will persist in staying i must determine to go i see not that my remaining here will be attended with any good effects it may possibly be the cause of infinite uneasiness to lady westhaven do therefore prevail upon her to let me go alone to st germains when i am gone lord delamere will think more of getting well than of forcing me into a new engagement he will then soon be able to travel and the chevalier de bellozane will return quietly to the baron why to speak ingenuously emmeline it does appear to me that it were on every account more proper for you to be in england thither i wish you could hasten before it will be possible for lord delamere or indeed for my wife who must travel slowly to get thither i do not know whether your travelling with us will be strictly proper on other accounts but if it were it would be rendered uneasy to you by the company of these two mad headed boys for bellozane i am sure intends if you accompany us to go also what objection is there then to my setting out immediately for st germains with le limosin and madelon if lady westhaven would but consent to it i can easily convince her of the necessity of it but i foresee another objection that has escaped you what is that my lord that bellozane will follow you surely he will not attempt it indeed i apprehend he will i have no manner of influence over him and he is here connected with a set of military men who are the likeliest people in the world to encourage such an enterprizeand if at last this paris should carry off our fair helen nay but my lord do not ridicule my distress well then i will most seriously and gravely counsel you and my advice is that you set out as soon as you can get ready and that my brother godolphin escort you emmeline was conscious that she too much wished such an escort yet fearing that her preference of him would engage godolphin in a quarrel with bellozane or lord delamere perhaps with both she answered while the deepest blush dyed her cheeks no my lord i cannoti mean noti should be sorry to give captain godolphin the trouble of such a journeyand i beg you not to think of it i shall speak to him of it however i beg my lordi intreat that you will not here he isand we will discuss the matter with him now godolphin at this moment entered the room and lord westhaven relating plainly all emmelines fears and her wishes to put an end to them by quitting besançon added the proposal he had made that godolphin should take care of her till she joined mrs stafford tho godolphin saw in her apprehensions for the safety of delamere only a conviction of her tender regard for him and considered his own attachment as every way desperate yet he could not refuse himself when it was thus offered him the pleasure of being with herthe exquisite tho painful delight of being useful to her he therefore eagerly expressed the readiness the happiness with which he should undertake so precious a charge emmeline fearful of betraying her real sentiments overacted the civil coldness with which she thought it necessary to refuse this offer godolphin mortified and vexed at her manner as much as at her denial ceased to press his services and lord westhaven who wondered what could be her objection since of the honour and propriety of godolphins conduct he knew she could not doubt seemed hurt at her rejection of his brothers friendly intention of waiting on her and dropping the conversation went away with godolphin she saw that her conduct inevitably impressed on the mind of the latter a conviction of her returning regard for delamere and she feared that to lord westhaven it might appear to be the effect of vanity and coquetry perhaps he will think me said she so vain as to suppose that godolphin has also designs and that therefore i decline his attendance and coquet enough to wish for the pursuit of these men whom i only affect to shun and for that reason prefer going alone to accepting the protection of his brother yet as i know the sentiments of godolphin which it appears lord westhaven does not surely i had better suffer his ill opinion of me than encourage godolphins hopes which till delamere can be diverted from prosecuting his unwelcome addresses will inevitably involve him in a dispute and such a dispute as i can not bear to think of uncertain what to do another day passed and on the following morning while she waited for lady westhaven she was addressed by godolphin who calmly and gravely enquired if she would honour him with any commands for england are you going then sir before my lord and lady i am going madam immediately by way of paris yes madam to havre whence i shall get the quickest to southampton and to the isle of wight i am uneasy at the entire solitude to which my absence condemns adelina you have heard no unfavourable news i hope of lady adelina or your little boy none but i am impatient to return to them as you are going immediately sir said emmeline making an effort to conquer a pain she felt rising in her bosom i will not detain you by writing to lady adelina perhapsas it is possibleas i hope she stopped godolphin looked anxious to hear what was possible what she hoped as i shall so soon so very soon be in england perhaps we may meet reassumed she speaking very quickpossibly i may have the happiness of seeing her ladyship and dear little william to meet you replied godolphin very solemnly adelina shall leave her solitude for certainly a journey to see her in it will hardly be undertaken by lady delamere he then in the same tone wished her health and happiness till he saw her again and left her he was no sooner gone than she felt disposed to follow him and apologize for her having so coldly refused his offers of protection pride and timidity prevented her but they could not stop her tears which she was obliged to conceal by hurrying to her own room lady westhaven soon after sent for her to a late breakfast she found lord delamere there but heard that godolphin was gone soon after breakfast lady westhaven and her brother who could not yet obtain a clear intermission of the fever which hung about him and who continued extremely weak went out together for an airing and lord westhaven unusually grave was left reading in the room with emmeline he laid down his book so said he william is flown away from us it was a topic on which emmeline did not care to trust her voice i wish you could have determined to have gone with him i wish my lord i could have reconciled it to my ideas of propriety since certainly i should have been happy and safe in such an escort and since without any at all i must in a day or two go i believe it will be best lord delamere is no better and bellozane has no thought of leaving us entirely tho his military friends take up so much of his time that he is luckily less with delamere lord delamere has again miss mowbray been imploring me to apply to you he wishes you only to hear him he complains that you fly from him and will not give him an opportunity of entering on his justification i am extremely concerned at lord delameres unhappiness but i must repeat that i require of his lordship no justification that i most sincerely forgive him if he supposes he has injured me but that as to any proposals such as he once honoured me with i am absolutely resolved never to listen to them and i entreat him to believe that any future application on the subject must be entirely fruitless poor young man said lord westhaven however you must consent to see him alone and to tell him so yourself for from me he will not believe you so very inflexibleso very cruel i am inflexible my lord but surely not cruel the greatest cruelty of which i could be guilty either to lord delamere or myself would be to accept his offers feeling as i feel and thinking as i think i do not know how we shall get him to england or what will be done with him when he is there he will do well my lord doubt it not upon my honour i do doubt it it is to me astonishing that a young man so volatile so highspirited as delamere should be capable of an attachment at once so violent and so steady steadyhas your lordship forgotten miss otley his wavering then was you well know owing to some evil impressions he had received of you which tho he refuses to tell me the particulars he assures me were conveyed and confirmed with so much art that a more dispassionate and cooler lover would have believed them without enquiry how then can you wonder at his petulant and eager spirit seizing on probable circumstances which his jealousy and apprehension immediately converted into conviction as soon as he knew these suspicions were groundless did he not fly to implore your pardon and hasten even at the hazard of his life to find and appease you such is the present situation of his mind and of his health that i very seriously assure you i doubt whether he will survive your total rejection emmeline unable to answer this speech gravely without betraying the very great concern it gave her assumed a levity she did not feel your lordship said she is disposed to think thus from the warm and vehement manner in which lord delamere is accustomed to express himself if he is really unhappy i am very sorry but i am persuaded time and the more fortunate alliance which he is solicited to form will effect a cure dont think me unfeeling if i answer your melancholy prophecy in the words of rosalind men have died from time to time and worms have eat thembut not for love she then ran away and losing all her forced spirits the moment she was alone gave way to tears she fancied they flowed entirely for the unhappiness of poor delamere and for her uncertain situation but tho the former uneasiness deeply affected her sensible heart many of the tears she shed were because godolphin was gone and she knew not when she should again see him godolphin repining and wretched pursued his way to paris he thought that emmelines coldness and reserve were meant to put an end to any hopes he might have entertained and that her reconciliation and marriage with lord delamere must inevitably take place as soon as she had by her dissimulated cruelty punished him for his rashness and his errors his daily observation confirmed him in this opinion he saw that in place of her candid and ingenuous manners a studied conduct was adopted which concealed her real sentimentssentiments which he concluded to be all in favour of delamere and finding that he could not divest himself of his passion for her he thought that it was a weakness if not a crime to indulge it in her presence while it imposed on himself an insupportable torment and that by quitting her he should at least conceal his hopeless attachment and save himself the misery of seeing her actually married to lord delamere he determined therefore to tear himself away and to punish himself for the premature expectations with which he had begun his journey to st alpin by shutting himself up at east cliff his house in the isle of wight and refusing himself the sight of her of whom it would be sufficient misery to think when she had given herself to her favoured and fortunate lover full of these reflections godolphin continued his road intending to take the passage boat at havre but at the hotel he frequented at paris he met a gentleman of his acquaintance who was going the next day to england by way of calais and as he had his own post chaise and only his valet with him he told godolphin that if he would take a place in his chaise he would send his servant post this offer godolphin accepted and altering his original design went with his friend to calais to cross to england footnote volatileimpetuous full of himselfjealouspresumptuous fiery in his passions yielding to every caprice and who believes some courage an apology for all his vices chapter vii it was now impossible for emmeline to avoid a conversation with lord delamere which his sister urged her so earnestly to allow him bellozane was by the french officers with whom he principally lived engaged out for two days and lord and lady westhaven easily found an opportunity to leave emmeline with delamere he was no sooner alone in her presence than he threw himself on his knees before herwill you cried he ah will you still refuse to hear and to forgive me have i offended beyond all hopes of pardon no my lordi do most readily and truly forgive every offence whether real or imaginary that you believe you have committed against me you forgive mebut to what purposeonly to plunge me yet deeper into wretchedness you forgive mebut you despise you throw me from you for ever ah rather continue to be angry than distract me by a pardon so cold and careless if your lordship will be calmif you will rise and hear me with temper i will be very explicit with you but while you yield to these extravagant transports i can not explain all i wish you to understand and must indeed beg to be released from a conversation so painful to me and to you so prejudicial delamere rose and took a chair i need not sir said emmeline collecting all her courage recall to your memory the time so lately passed when i engaged to become yours if at the expiration of a certain period lord and lady montreville consented and you still remained disposed to bestow on me the honour of your name what am i to expect cried delamere eagerly interrupting herah what am i to expect from a preface so cold and cruel you have indeed no occasion to recall to my memory those days when i was allowed to look forward to that happiness which now thro the villainy of others and my own madness and ideotism i have lost but madam it must not it can not be so easily relinquished by heaven i will not give you upand if but for a moment i thought you seemed just now sir disposed to hear me with patience since however you can not even for a few minutes forbear these starts of passion i really am unequal to the task of staying with you she would then have hastened away but delamere forcibly detaining her again protested he would be calm and again she went on at that time i will own to you that without any prepossession almost without a wish either to accept or decline the very high honour you offered me i was content to engage myself to be your wife because you said such an engagement would make you happy and because i then knew not that it would render me otherwise was you even then thus indifferent had i no place in your heart madam when you would have given me your hand yes siryou had then the place i now willingly restore to you i esteemed you i looked upon you with a sisterly affection and had i married you it would have been rather to have made you happy than because i had any wish to form other ties than those by which our relationship and early acquaintance had connected us ah my angelic emmeline it will still make me happy let the reasons which then influenced you again plead for me and forget o forget all that has passed since my headlong folly urged me to insult and forsake you alas my lord that is not in my power you have cancelled the engagements that subsisted between us and as i understand have actually formed others more indissoluble with a lady of high rank and of immense fortuneone whose alliance is as anxiously courted by your family as mine is despised can your lordship again fly from your promises can you quit at pleasure the affluent and highborn heiress as you quitted the deserted and solitary orphan cursed cursed cruelty exclaimed delamere speaking thro his shut teethbut go on madam i deserve your severity and must bear your reproaches yet surely you know that but for the machinations of those execrable crofts i should never have acted as i didyou know that however destitute of fortune chance had made you i preferred you to all those who might have brought me wealth i acknowledge your generosity sir and on that head meant not to reproach i merely intended to represent to you what you seem to have forgottenthat were i disposed to restore you the hand you so lately renounced you could not take it since miss otley will certainly not relinquish the claim you have given her to your regard you are misinformedi am under no engagement to miss otleyi am not by heaven by all that is sacred were not all preparations for your marriage in great forwardness sir when you left england and must not your consent have been previously obtained before lord montreville would have made them however to put an end to all uncertainty i must tell you my lord with a sincerity which will probably be displeasing to you that my affections are no longer in your own power cried he hastily interrupting herspeak madamis it not so i did not say that sir i was going to assure you that i now find it impossible to command themimpossible to feel for you that preference without which i should think myself extremely culpable were i to give you my hand i understand you madam you give that preference to another the chevalier de bellozane has succeeded to your affections he has doubtless made good use of the opportunities he has had to conciliate your favour but before he carries his good fortune farther he must discuss with me the right by which he pretends to it whether he has or has not a right to pretend to my regard sir said emmeline with great spirit this causeless jealousy so immediately after you have been convinced of the fallacy of your supposition in regard to another person convinces me that had i unfortunately given you an exclusive claim to my friendship and affection my whole life would have been embittered by suspicion jealousy and caprice recollect my lord that i have said nothing of the chevalier de bellozane nor have you the least reason to believe i have for him those sentiments you are pleased to impute to me but can i doubt it exclaimed delamere rising and walking about in an agonycan i doubt it when i have heard you disclaim me for everwhen you have told me your affections are no longer in your power no sir my meaning was what i now repeatthat as my near relation as my friend as the brother of lady westhaven i shall ever esteem and regard you but that i can not command now in your favour those sentiments which should induce me to accept of you as my husband what is past can not be recalled and tho i am most truly concerned to see you unhappy my determination is fixed and i must abide by it death and hell cried the agonized delamereit is all over then you utterly disclaim me and hardly think it worth while to conceal from me for whose sake i am disclaimed emmeline was terrified to find that he still persisted in imputing her estrangement from him to her partiality for bellozane foreseeing that he would immediately fly to him and that all she apprehended must follow i beg i entreat lord delamere that you will understand that i give no preference to mr de bellozane i will not only assure you of that but i disclaim all intention of marriage whatever suffer me my lord to entreat that you will endeavour to calm your mind and regain your health reflect on the cruel uncertainty in which you have left the marquis and the marchioness reflect on the uneasy situation in which you keep lord and lady westhaven and on the great injury you do yourself and resolutely attempt in the certainty of succeeding to divest yourself of a fatal partiality which has hitherto produced only misery to you and to your family oh most certainly most certainly cried delamere almost choaked with passioni shall undoubtedly make all these wise reflections and after having gone thro a proper course of them shall possibly with great composure see you in the arms of that presumptuous coxcombthat vain supercilious frenchmanthat detested bellozane no madam no you may certainly give yourself to him but assure yourself i live not to see it he flew out of the room at these words tho she attempted to stop and to appease him her heart bled at the wounds she had yet thought it necessary to inflict and she was at once grieved and terrified at his menacing and abrupt departure she immediately went herself after lord westhaven to intreat him to keep bellozane and delamere apart his lordship was much disturbed at what had passed which emmeline faithfully related to him bellozane was still out of town and lord westhaven who now apprehended that on delameres meeting him he would immediately insult him said he would consider what could be done to prevent their seeing each other till delamere became more reasonable on enquiry he found that the chevalier was certainly engaged with his companions till the next day he therefore came back to emmeline about an hour after he had left her and told her that he thought it best for her to set out that afternoon on her way to st germains you will by this means make it difficult for bellozane to overtake you if he should attempt it and when he sees you have actually fled from delamere he will be little disposed to quarrel with him and will perhaps go home as to delamere his sister and i must manage him as well as we can which will be the easier as he is within this half hour gone to bed in a violent access of fever indeed in the perturbation of mind he now suffers there is no probability of his speedy amendment for as fast as he regains strength his violent passions throw his frame again into disorderbut perhaps when he knows you are actually in england he may try to acquire by keeping himself quiet that share of health which alone can enable him to follow you emmeline eagerly embracing this advice which she found had the concurrence of lady westhaven prepared instantly for her departure and embracing tenderly her two excellent friends who hoped soon to follow her and who had desired her to come to them to reside as soon as they were settled in london where they had no house at present she got into a chaise with madelon and attended by le limosin who was proudly elated at being thus lhomme de confience to mademoiselle mowbray she left besançon her heart deeply impressed with a sense of delameres sufferings and with an earnest wish for the restoration of his peace tho godolphin had been gone four days and went post so that she knew he must be at paris long before her she could not as she proceeded on her journey help fancying that some accident might have stopped him and that she might overtake him she knew not whether she hoped or feared such an encounter but the disappointed air with which she left every post house where she had occasion to stop for horses plainly evinced that she rather desired than dreaded it she felt all the absurdity and ridicule of expecting to see him yet still she looked out after him and he was the object she sought when she cast her eyes round her at the several stages without overtaking him or being herself overtaken by bellozane she arrived in safety and in the usual time at paris and immediately went on to st germains le limosin being so well acquainted with travelling that she had no trouble nor alarm during her journey when she got to st germains she was received with transport by mrs stafford and her family she found her about to depart in two days for england where there was a prospect of settling her husbands affairs and she had undertaken to go alone over in hopes of adjusting them for his speedy return while he had agreed to remain with the children till he heard the success of her endeavours great was the satisfaction of mrs stafford to find that emmeline would accompany her to england with yet more pleasure did she peruse those documents which convinced her that her fair friend went to claim with an absolute certainty of success her large paternal fortune lord westhaven had given her a long letter to the marquis of montreville to whom he desired she would immediately address herself and he had also written to an eminent lawyer his friend into whose hands he directed her immediately to put the papers that related to her birth and by no means to trust them with any other person with money also lord westhaven had amply furnished her and she proposed taking lodgings in london till she could settle her affairs with lord montreville and then to go to mowbray castle on the second day after her reaching st germains she began her journey to calais with mrs stafford attended by le limosin and madelon when they arrived there they heard that a passage boat would sail about nine oclock in the evening but on sending le limosin to speak to the master they learned that there were already more cabin passengers than there was room to accommodate and that therefore two ladies might find it inconvenient as the evening however was calm and the wind favourable and as the two fair travellers were impatient to be in england they determined to go on board it was near ten oclock before the vessel got under way and before two they were assured they should be at dover they therefore hesitated not to pass that time in chairs on the deck wrapped in their cloaks and would have preferred doing so to the heat and closeness of the cabin had there been room for them in it by eleven oclock every thing insensibly grew quiet on board the passengers were gone to their beds the vessel moved calmly and with very little wind over a gently swelling sea and the silence was only broken by the waves rising against its side or by the steersman who now and then spoke to another sailor that slowly traversed the deck with measured pace the night was dark a declining moon only broke thro the heavy clouds of the horizon with a feeble and distant light there was a solemnity in the scene at once melancholy and pleasing mrs stafford and emmeline both felt it they were silent and each lost in her own reflections nor did they attend to a slight interruption of the stillness that reigned on board made by a passenger who came from below muffled in a great coat he spoke in a low voice to the man at the helm and then sat down on the gunwale with his back towards the ladies after which all was again quiet in a few minutes a deep sigh was uttered by this passenger and then after a short pause the two friends were astonished to hear in a voice low but extremely expressive these lines addressed to night sonnet i love thee mournful sobersuited night when the faint moon yet lingering in her wane and veild in clouds with pale uncertain light hangs oer the waters of the restless main in deep depression sunk the enfeebled mind will to the deaf cold elements complain and tell the embosomd grief however vain to sullen surges and the viewless wind tho no repose on thy dark breast i find i still enjoy theechearless as thou art for in thy quiet gloom the exhausted heart is calm tho wretched hopeless yet resignd while to the winds and waves its sorrows given may reachtho lost on earththe ear of heaven surely said mrs stafford in a whisper it is a voice i know surely repeated the heart of emmeline for she could not speak it is the voice of godolphin do you reassumed mrs stafforddo you not recollect the voice yes replied emmeline i thinki believei rather fancy it ismr godolphin shall i speak to him asked mrs stafford or are you disposed to hear more poetry he has no notion who are his auditors as you please said emmeline again the person sighed and repeated with more warmth and reach tho lost on earththe ear of heaven yesif she is happy they will indeed be heard ah that cruel ifif she is happy and can i bear to doubt it yet leave her to the experiment there now remained no doubt but that the stranger was godolphin and emmeline as little hesitated to believe herself the subject of his thoughts and of his muse why do you not speak to him emmeline said mrs stafford archly i can not indeed i must speak then myself and raising her voice she saidmr godolphin is it not who is so good as to recollect me cried he rising and looking round him it was very dark but he could just distinguish that two ladies were there mrs stafford gave him her hand sayinghave you then forgotten your friends he snatched her hand and carried it to his lips there is another hand for you said she pointing to emmelinebut you must be at the trouble of taking it that i shall be most delighted to do but who is it surely it can not be miss mowbray that allows me such happiness have you in one little week said the faultering emmeline occasion to ask that question not now i hear that voice answered godolphin in the most animated tonenot when i hold this lovely hand but whence comes it that i find you madam here or how does it happen that you have left my brother and sister and the happy delamere he seemed to have recollected after his first transport at meeting her that he was thus warmly addressing her who was probably only going to england to prepare for her union with his rival do not be so unreasonable said mrs stafford as to expect miss mowbray should answer all these questions but find a seat and let us hear some account of yourself you have also to make your peace with me for not seeing me in your way godolphin threw himself on the deck at their feet i find a seat here said he which i should prefer to a throne as to an account of myself it is soon given i met a friend whose company induced me to come to calais rather than travel thro normandy and the haste he was in made it impossible for me to stop him miss mowbray had refused to give me any commission for you and i had nothing to say to you that would have given you any pleasure i was therefore unwilling to trouble you merely with a passing enquiry but whence comes it that you sail only tonight if your friend was so much hurried he went four days ago but ii was kepti was detained at calais emmeline felt a strange curiosity to know what could have detained him but dared not ask such a question they then talked of lord and lady westhaven lord delamere is i conclude much better said godolphin when i took leave of lord and lady westhaven coldly answered emmeline i did not think him much better than when we first saw him his servant said he was almost as ill as when you sir with friendship so uncommon attended him call it not uncommon madamit was an office i would have performed not only for any englishman in another country but i hope for any human being in any country who had needed it should i then allow you to suppose there was any great merit in my rendering a slight service to the brother of lady westhaven and who is besides dear to one to whom i owe obligations so infinite the stress he laid on these words left emmeline no doubt of his meaning she was however vexed and half angry that he persisted in believing her so entirely attached to delamere and for the first time she had ventured to think steadily on the subject meditated how to undeceive him yet when she reflected on the character of delamere and remembered that his father would now claim an authority to controul her actionsthat one would think himself at liberty to call any man to an account who addressed her and the other to refuse his consent to any other marriage than that which would be now so advantageous to the familyshe saw only inquietude to herself and hazard to the life so dear to her should she suffer the passion of godolphin openly to be avowed is it not remarkable said mrs stafford that you should voluntarily have conducted us to france and by chance escort us home yes answered godolphinand a chance so fortunate for me i should think portended some good was i sanguine and had i any faith in omens are you going immediately to london immediately and from thence to east cliff i believe i shall be obliged to stay in town a week or ten daysbut my continuance there shall be longer if you or miss mowbray will employ me the night now grew cold and the dew fell so heavily that mrs stafford expressed her apprehensions that emmeline would find some ill effects from it and advised her to go down oh no said godolphin with uncommon anxiety in his mannerdo not go down there are so many passengers in the cabin and it is so close that you will find it extremely disagreeable it will not now be half an hour before we see the lights of dover and we shall presently be on shore emmeline who really apprehended little from cold acquiesced and they continued to converse on general topics till they landed godolphin saw them on shore immediately and attended them to the inn he then told them he must go back to see after the baggage and left them hastily they ordered a slight refreshment and when it was brought in emmeline saidshall we not wait for mr godolphin the gentleman is come in madam said the waiter with another lady and is assisting her up stairs would you please i should call him emmeline felt without knowing the nature of the sensation involuntary curiosity and involuntary uneasiness no do not call him said mrs staffordi suppose he will be here immediately but send the french servant to us le limosin attending she gave him some requisite orders and then again enquired for captain godolphin le limosin answered that he was gone to assist a lady to her room who had been very ill during the passage of which nation is she le limosin i am ignorant of that madam as i have not heard her speak monsieur le capitaine is very sorry for her and has attended her the whole way only the little time he was upon deck is she a young lady enquired mrs stafford yes very young and pretty the curiosity of mrs stafford was now in spite of herself awakened and the long stay godolphin made gave to emmeline such acute uneasiness as she had never felt before it is extraordinary surely said she to herself that he should be thus anxious about an acquaintance made in a pacquet boat she grew more and more disturbed at his absence and was hardly able to conceal her vexation from mrs stafford while she was ashamed of discovering it even to herself in about ten minutes which had appeared to her above an hour godolphin came in apologised without accounting for his stay and while they made all together a slight repast enquired how they intended to proceed to london and at what time on hearing that they thought of setting out about noon in a chaise he proposed their taking a post coach and then added he you may suffer me to occupy the fourth place to this mrs stafford willingly agreed and emmeline glad to find that at least he did not intend waiting on his pacquet boat acquaintance to london retired with somewhat less uneasiness than she had felt on her first hearing that he had brought such an acquaintance on shore after a few hours sleep the fair travellers arose to continue their journey they heard that mr godolphin had long left his room and was at breakfast with the lady whom he had been so careful of the preceding morning at this intelligence emmeline felt all her anxiety revive and when he came into the room where they were to speak to them hardly could she command herself to answer him without betraying her emotion miss mowbray is fatigued with her voyage said he tenderly approaching herthe night air i am afraid has affected her health no sir coldly and faintly answered emmeline how is the young lady you was so good as to assist on shore sir said mrs stafford i understand she was ill godolphin blushed and replied with some little embarrassment she is better madam i thank you so thought emmeline he makes then no mystery of having an interest in this lady are you acquainted with her enquired mrs stafford yes politeness would not admit of another question yet it was impossible to help wishing to ask it godolphin however turned the discourse and soon afterwards went out emmeline felt ready to cry yet knew not for what and dreaded to ask herself whether she had not admitted into her heart the tormenting passion of jealousy why should i be displeased said she why should i be unhappy mr godolphin believes me attached to delamere and has ceased to think of me wherefore should i lament that he thinks of another or what right have i to enquire into his actionswhat right have i to blame them the post coach was now ready emmeline attended by madelon mrs stafford and godolphin got into it and a lively and animated conversation was carried on between the two latter emmeline in the approaching interview with her uncle and in the wretchedness of delamere which she never ceased to lament had employment enough for her thoughts but in spite of herself they flew perpetually from those subjects to the acquaintance which captain godolphin had brought with him from calais footnote confidential servant chapter viii when they arrived at canterbury the ladies were shewn into a parlour where godolphin did not join them for near half an hour emmeline had accounted for her lowness of spirits by her dread of meeting her uncle on such terms as they were likely to meet but mrs stafford knew the human heart too well to be ignorant that there was another and a concealed source of that melancholy which overwhelmed her it was in vain she had attempted to dissemble it was to her friend evident that her compassion her good wishes were delameres but that her heart was wholly godolphins and was now pierced with the poignant thorns of newborn jealousy and anxious mistrust while they waited together the return of godolphin mrs stafford saidi fancy that post chaise that passed us about half an hour ago contained mr godolphins acquaintance did it why do you think so because he looked after it so earnestly and there seemed to be only a young woman in it i did not observe it indeed replied emmeline with the appearance of carelessness i should like to see her nearer continued mrs stafford with some archnessby the glympse i had of her she appeared to be very handsome do you think she is a french woman enquired emmeline still affecting great indifference no she appeared to be english but if you please i will enquire of him i beg you will not in an half angry tone answered emmelinei am sure it is very immaterial at this moment godolphin entered and with looks of uneasiness apologized for his long stay i have an awkward embarrassment said he on my hands a poor young woman who is wholly a stranger in this country and whom i have undertaken to conduct to london but she is so ill that i am afraid she is unfit to go onyet how to leave her here i know not pray sir said emmeline do not let us be any restraint to you if your presence is necessary to the lady you had surely better continue with her than put her to any inconvenience to go on godolphin who was at once pleased and pained by the quickness with which she spoke saidi will tell you my dear miss mowbray very ingenuously that if i were quite sure the character of this unhappy young woman is such as may entitle her to yours and mrs staffords protection i should without scruple have asked it i know continued he looking distressed how compassionate and good you both are but i ought not therefore to hazard improperly taxing such generosity and sensibility who is this young person sir asked mrs stafford if it will not tire you i will tell you on my arrival at calais this day sennight i found all the pacquet boats on the other side and was obliged to wait with my friend cleveland a whole day as i was sauntering about the streets after dinner i passed by an englishman whose face i thought i recollected the man looked confused and took off his hat and i then perfectly remembered him to have been one of the best sailors i had on board in the west indies where he received a dangerous wound in the arm i stopped and asked him by what accident he came to calais and why his appearance was no better for his honest hard features seemed pinched with want his dress was shabby his person meagre and his look dejected i am ashamed to tell you captain said he how i came hither but in short because i could not live at home you know i got prize money when i served under your honour mayhap i might have managed it better but howsomdever tis gone and theres an end ont so as we are all turned a drift in the world some of my ship mates advised me to try a little matter of smuggling with them and come over here i have lived among these frenchmen now these two months and can to be sure just live but rot em if i could get any thing to do at home i wouldnt stay another hour for i hates em all as your honour very well knows a lucky voyage or two will put some money mayhap in my way with this smuggling trade and then i reckons to cross over home once for all and so go down to liverpool to my friends if any on um be alive yet i reproved my acquaintance severely for his proceeding and told him that to enable him to go to his friends i would supply him with money to buy him cloaths which i found he principally wanted being ashamed to appear among his relations so ill equipped after having received a considerable sum in prize money the poor fellow appeared to be very grateful and assured me that to prove his sincerity he would embark in the same pacquet boat but lord captain added he i bent the only englishman who stays in this rascally country agin their willyour honour remembers lieutenant stornaway on board your honours ship aye to be sure i do well he poor lad is got into prison here for debt and there i reckon hell die for nobody that ever gets into one of their confounded jails in this country ever gets out again as i perfectly remembered stornaway a gallant and spirited young scotsman i was much hurt at this account and asked if i could be admitted to see him i found it attended with infinite difficulty and that i must apply to so many different persons before i could be allowed to see my unfortunate countryman that the pacquet boat of the next day must sail without me cleveland therefore departed and i with long attendance on the commandant and other officers was at length introduced into the prison i will not shock you with a description of it nor with the condition in which i found the poor young man who seemed to me likely to escape by death from the damp and miserable dungeon where he lay without necessary food without air and without hope of relief he related to me his sorrowful and simple tale he was brought up to the sea had no friends able to assist him and on being discharged after the peace had gone with what money he received and on half pay to france in hopes of being able to live at less expence than in england and to learn at the same time a language so necessary in his profession and for some time said he i did pretty well till going with one of my countrymen to see a relation of his who was tho born of scots parents brought up as a pensioner in a convent and a catholic i was no longer my own master and tho i knew that it was almost impossible for me to support a wife i yet rashly married and have made one of the loveliest young creatures in the world a beggar she was totally destitute of fortune and was afraid her friends who were but distant relations and people of rank in scotland would insist on her taking the veil as the most certain and easiest means of providing for her she had a decided aversion to a monastic life and poor as i was for i did not attempt to deceive her hesitated not to quit her convent with me which it was easy enough to do by the management of her relation with whom she was allowed to go out we set out therefore together for england i had about twenty louis in my pocket which would have carried us thither comfortably but calamity overtook us by the way we travelled in stages and diligences as we found cheapest in one of which i imagine my poor girl caught the infection of the small pox with which she fell ill at amiens i attended her with all the agonizing fear of a wretch who sees his only earthly good on the point of being torn from him for ever and very very ill she was for many days and nights yet her lovely face was spared and in a month i saw her quite out of danger but still too weak to travel as i spared nothing that could contribute to her ease or her recovery my money was dreadfully diminished and i had barely enough left to carry me alone to england but as our credit was yet good i purposed our living on it till her strength was somewhat reestablished and that i would then go to england get a supply of money and return to pay my debts and fetch my wife this was the only expedient said poor stornaway that i could think of and perhaps was the very worst i could have adopted since by this means we insensibly got into debt and to creditors the most inexorable at the end of three weeks my wife was tolerably well i divided with her the money i had left and went off in the night to calais flattering myself i should return to her within a fortnight but so vigilant were those to whom i owed money and so active the maréchaussés that i was pursued and thrown without hesitation and without appeal into this prison where my little remaining money being all exhausted in fees to save me from even worse treatment i have now lain near six weeks in the situation in which you see me as to myself continued the poor young man my life has been a life of hardship and i have learned to hold it as nothing but when i reflect on what must have been the condition of my isabel i own to you dear sir that my fortitude forsakes me and the blackest despair takes possession of my soul i had but little occasion to deliberate said godolphin continuing his narrativei had but little occasion to deliberate i enquired into the debt it was a trifle i blushed to think that while englishmen were daily passing thro the place in pursuit of pleasure a gentleman an officer of their nation languished for such a sum in the horrors of a confinement so dreadful the debt was easily discharged and i took the unhappy stornaway to my lodgings from whence he was eagerly flying to amiens when i was called aside by one of the maréchaussé who desired to speak to me sir said the man you have been generous to me and i will hazard telling you a secret orders are coming to stop your friend whom you have released from prison for stealing a pensioner out of a convent get him off to england immediately or he will be taken and perhaps confined for life i hastened stornaway instantly into a boat and sent him after a pacquet which had just sailed and which i saw him overtake he conjured me in an agony of despair to enquire for his wife without whom he said he could not live and that rather than attempt it he would return and perish in prison i promised all he desired and as soon as i was sure he was safe i set out post for amiens where i found the poor young woman in a situation to which no words can do justice she had parted with almost every thing for her support and was overwhelmed by the weight of misfortunes which young and inexperienced as she was she had neither the means to soften or the fortitude to bear i brought her away to calais and embarked with her yesterday having only staid long enough to furnish her with cloaths and to recruit her enfeebled frame after her journey but sea sickness added to her former ill state of health has reduced her to a condition of deplorable weakness she speaks so little english that she is unable to travel alone and i was in hopes that by her chaise keeping up with the coach i might have assisted her on the road but she is now so extremely ill that i am afraid she must remain here during the first part of this short account emmeline charmed more than ever with godolphin and ashamed of having for a moment entertained a suspicion to the disadvantage of such a man sat silent but at the conclusion of it her eyes overflowed with tears she felt something that told her she ought to apologize to him for the error she had been guilty oftho of that error he knew nothing and impelled by an involuntary impulse she held out her hand to himdear generous nobleminded godolphin was uttered by her heart but her lips only echoed the last word godolphin said she let us go to this poor young creaturelet us see her ourselves certainly we will cried mrs stafford and indeed sir you ought to have told us before that we might sooner have offered all the assistance in our power i was afraid answered he i knew not whether i might not be deceived in the character of mrs stornaway and dared not intrude upon you lest it should be found that the object merited not your good offices but she is in distress said emmelineshe is a strangerand shall we hesitate godolphin who found in the tenderness of her address to him and in the approbation her eyes expressed a reward as sweet as that which the consciousness of doing good afforded from his own heart kissed the hand she had given him in silence and then went to enquire if the poor young woman could see the ladies she expressed her joy at being so favoured and mrs stafford and emmeline were introduced the compassion they expressed and the assurances they gave her that she would meet her husband in london and that she should stay with them till she did calmed and composed her and as her illness was merely owing to fatigue and anxiety they believed a few hours rest now her mind was easier would restore her tho they were impatient to get on to london they yet hesitated not to remain at canterbury all night on the account of this poor stranger godolphin on hearing their determination warmly thanked them the heart of emmeline was at once eased of its inquietude and impressed with a deeper sense than ever of godolphins worth she gave way almost for the first time to her tenderness and esteem without attempting to check or conceal her sentiments while mrs stafford who ardently wished to see her in possession of her estate and married to godolphin rejoiced in observing her to be less reserved and godolphin himself hardly believing the happiness he possessed real forgot all his fears of her attachment to lord delamere and dared again entertain the hopes he had discarded at besançonas he thought for ever the next day mrs stornaway was so much recovered that they proceeded in their journey taking her into the coach with them and directing madelon to travel in the chaise accompanied by her father they arrived early in town and godolphin leaving them at an hotel went in search of lodgings he soon found apartments to accommodate them in bond street and thither they immediately went mrs stafford taking upon herself the protection of the poor forlorn stranger till godolphin could find her husband on whose behalf he immediately intended to apply for a berth on board some ship in commission he had given him a direction to his banker and bid him there leave an address where he might be found in london the next day he brought the transported stornaway to his wife and the gratitude these poor young people expressed to their benefactor convinced the fair friends that they had deserved his kindness and that there was no deception in the story the lieutenant had told them about his wife godolphin took a lodging for them in oxford street and gave them money for their support till he could get the young man employed which his interest and indefatigable friendship soon accomplished in the mean time he saw emmeline every day and every day he rose in her esteem yet still she hesitated to discover to him all she thought of him and at times was so reserved and so guarded that godolphin knew not what to believe he knew she was above the paltry artifice of coquetry yet she fearfully avoided being alone with him and never allowed him an opportunity of asking whether he had any thing to hope from time and assiduity is he not one of the best creatures in the world said mrs stafford after he left the room on the second day of their arrival to go out in the service of the stornaways yes yes and is that all the praise you allow to such a man is he not a perfect character as perfect i suppose as any of them are ah emmeline you are a little hypocrite it is impossible you can be insensible of the merit of godolphin and i wonder you are not in more haste to convince him that you think of him as he deserves what would you have me do marry him before i am sure he desires it smilingly asked emmeline you can not doubt that tho you so anxiously repress every attempt he makes to explain himself shall i tell you what he has said to me shall i tell you what motive carried him to st alpin noi had rather not hear any thing about it and why not because it is better for some time if not for ever that godolphin should be ignorant of those favourable thoughts i may have had of himbetter that i should cease to entertain them why so pray because i dread the mortified pride and furious jealousy of lord delamere on one hand and on the other the authority of my uncle who till i am of age will probably neither restore my fortune nor consent to my carrying it out of his family for those very reasons you should immediately marry godolphin when you are actually married delamere will reconcile himself to the loss of you to an inevitable evil even his haughty and selfwilled spirit must submit and should lord montreville give you any trouble about your fortune who can so easily so properly oblige him to do you justice as a man of spirit of honour of understanding who will have a right to insist upon it it was impossible to deny so evident a truth yet still emmeline apprehended the consequence of delameres rage and disappointment and thought that there would be an indelicacy and an impropriety in withdrawing herself from the protection of her own family almost as soon as she could claim it and that her uncle might make such a step a pretence for new contention and longer wrath the result therefore of all her deliberations ended in a determination neither to engage herself or to marry till she was of age and till then not even to encourage any lover whatever by that time she hoped that lord delamere wearied by an hopeless passion and convinced of her fixed indifference would engage in some more successful pursuit she knew that by that time all affairs between her and lord montreville must be adjusted if the affection of godolphin was as she hoped fixed and founded on his esteem for her character he would not love her less at the end of that period when she should have the power of giving him her estate unincumbered with difficulties and unembarrassed by law suits and should she hoped escape the misery of seeing delameres anguish and despair on which she could not bear to reflect she ingenuously explained to mrs stafford her reasons for refusing to receive godolphins proposals in which her friend tho she allowed them to be plausible by no means acquiesced still insisting upon it that the kindest thing she could do towards lord delamere as well as the properest in regard to the settlement of her estate was immediately to accept godolphin but emmeline was not to be convinced and all she could obtain from mrs stafford was an extorted promise reluctantly given that she would not give any advice or encouragement to godolphin immediately to press his suit emmeline tho convinced she was right yet doubted whether she had fortitude enough to persist in the conduct she wished to adopt if exposed at once to the solicitations of a woman of whose understanding she had an high opinion and to the ardent supplications of the man she loved the day after her arrival in london she had sent to berkleysquare and was informed that lord montreville and his family were in norfolk thither therefore she wrote and enclosed the letter she had brought from lord westhaven her own was couched in the most modest and dutiful terms and that of lord westhaven was equally mild and reasonable but they gave only disquiet and concern to the ambitious and avaricious bosom of lord montreville tho already tortured by delameres absence and illness and uncertain whether the object of his long solicitude would live to reap the advantage of his accumulated fortunes he could not think but with pain and reluctance of giving up so large a portion of his annual income still more unwilling did he feel to refund the produce of the estates for so long a period and in the immediate emotion of his vexation at receiving lord westhavens first letter he had sent for sir richard crofts who having at the time of mr mowbrays death been entrusted with all the papers and deeds which belonged to him was the most likely to know whether any were among them that bore testimony to the marriage of mr mowbray and miss stavordale the fact was that a very little time before he died his steward williamson had received the memorandum of which emmeline had found a copy and on the death of his master had carried it to sir richard crofts lord montreville being then in the north of england sir richard eagerly enquired whether there were any other papers to the like purport williamson replied he believed not and very thoughtlessly left it in his hands when a few days afterwards he called to know in whose name the business of the mowbray estate was to be carried on sir richard then acting as an attorney and only entering into life told him that every thing was to be considered as the property of lord montreville because there were many doubts about the marriage of mr mowbray and great reason to think that the paper in question was written merely with a view to pique and perplex his brother with whom he was then at variance but that lord montreville would enquire into the business and certainly do justice to any claims the infant might have on the estate soon after williamson applied again to have the paper restored but crofts answered that he should keep it by order of lord montreville tho it was of no use his lordship having obtained undoubted information that his brother was never married sir richard had reflected on the great advantage that would accrue to his patron from the possession of this estate to which besides its annual income several boroughs belonged he thought it was very probable that the little girl then only a few weeks old and without a mother or any other than mercenary attendants might die in her infancy if she did not that lord montreville might easily provide for her and that it would be doing his friend a great service and be highly advantageous to himself should he conceal the legal claim of the child even unknown to her uncle and put him in immediate possession of his paternal estate having again strictly questioned williamson repressed his curiosity by law jargon and frightened him by threats of his lords displeasure if he made any effort to prove the legitimacy of emmeline he very tranquilly destroyed the paper and lord montreville never knew that such a paper had existed williamson timid and ignorant of every thing beyond his immediate business returned in great doubt and uneasiness to mowbray castle when he received the child and the two caskets he had questioned the frenchman who brought her and heard an absolute confirmation of the marriage of his master he then examined the caskets and found the certificates but without money or friends he knew not how to prosecute the claim of the orphan against the power and affluence of lord montreville and after frequent consultations with mrs carey they agreed that the safest way would be carefully to secure those papers till emmeline was old enough to find friends for should they attempt previously to procure justice for her they might probably lose the papers which proved her birth as they had already done that which williamson had delivered to crofts as long as williamson lived he carefully locked up these caskets his sudden death prevented him from taking any steps to establish the claim of his orphan mistress and that of mrs carey two years afterwards involved the whole affair in obscurity which made sir richard quite easy as to any future discovery but as the aggressor never forgives sir richard had conceived against emmeline the most unmanly and malignant hatred and had invariably opposed every tendency which he had observed in lord montreville to befriend and assist her for no other reason but that he had already irreparably injured her he hoped that as he had at length divided her from lord delamere and driven her abroad she would there marry a foreigner and be farther removed than ever from the family and from any chance of recovering the property of which he had deprived her instead of which she had in consequence of going thither met the very man in whose power it was to prove the marriage of her mother and in lord westhaven had found a protector too intelligent and too steady to be discouraged by evasion or chicanerytoo powerful and too affluent to be thrown out of the pursuit either by the enmity it might raise or the expence it might demand nothing could exceed the chagrin of sir richard when lord montreville put into his hands the first letter he had on this subject from lord westhaven accustomed however to command his countenance he said without any apparent emotion that as no papers in confirmation of the fact alledged had ever existed among those delivered to him on the death of mr mowbray it was probably some forgery that had imposed on lord westhaven i see not how that can be answered lord montreville it is not likely that emmeline mowbray could forge such papers or should even conceive such an idea true my lord but your lordship forgets and overlooks and passes by the long abode and continuance and residence she has made with the staffords mrs stafford is to my certain knowledge and conviction artful and designing and intrigueing a woman my lord who affects and pretends and presumes to understand and be competent and equal to business and affairs and concerns with which women should never interfere or meddle or interest themselves it is clearly and evidently and certainly to the interest and advantage and benefit of this woman that miss mowbray over whom she has great influence and power and authority should be established and fixed and settled in affluence rather than remain and abide and continue where nature and justice and reason have placed her i own sir richard i can not see the thing in this light however to do nothing rashly let us consider how to proceed sir richard then advised him by no means to answer lord westhavens letter but to wait till he saw his lordship as in cases so momentous it was he said always wrong to give any thing in black and white in a few days afterwards he heard out of norfolk for he had come up from thence to consult with sir richard crofts that lord delamere was ill at besançon his precipitate departure had before given him the most poignant concern and now his fears for his life completed the distress of this unfortunate father on receiving however the second letter from lord westhaven together with that of emmeline his apprehensions for the life of his son were removed and left his mind at liberty to recur again to the impending loss of four thousand five hundred a year with the unpleasant accompanyment of being obliged to refund above sixty thousand pounds again sir richard crofts was sent for and again he tried to quiet the apprehensions of lord montreville but his attempt to persuade him that the whole might be a deception originating with the staffords obtained not a moments attention he knew stafford himself was weak ignorant and indolent and would neither have had sagacity to think of or courage to execute such a design and that mrs stafford should imagine and perform it seemed equally improbable he was perfectly aware that lord westhaven had a thorough acquaintance with business and was of all men on earth the most unlikely to enter warmly into such an affair against the interest too of the family into which he had married unless he was very sure of having very good grounds for his interference but tho sir richard could not prevail on him to disbelieve the whole of the story he saw that his lordship thought with great reluctance of the necessity he should be under of relinquishing the whole of the fortune he now therefore recommended it to him to remain quiet at least till lord westhaven came to england to send an answer to miss mowbray that meant nothing and to gain time for farther enquiries these enquiries he himself undertook and leaving lord montreville in a political fit of the gout he returned from audley hall to london and bent all his thoughts to the accomplishment of his design which was to get the original papers out of the hands of emmeline and to bribe le limosin to go back to france while these things were passing in england lord delamere whose rage and indignation at emmelines departure the authority of lord westhaven could hardly restrain had learned from his brotherinlaw the real circumstances of the birth of his cousin and he heard them with the greatest satisfaction he now thought it certain that his father would press his marriage as eagerly as he had before opposed it and that so great an obstacle being removed and emmeline wholly in the power of his family she would be easily brought to forgive him and to comply with the united wishes of all her relations in this hope and being assured by lord westhaven that bellozane was actually returned into switzerland without any design of following emmeline who had been induced he said to leave besançon purely to avoid him he consented to attempt attaining a greater command over his temper on which the reestablishment of his health depended and after about ten days was able to travel lord and lady westhaven therefore at the end of that time slowly began with him their journey to england chapter ix emmeline had now been almost a week in london and mrs stafford with the assistance of godolphin had succeeded so much better than she expected in the arrangement of some of those affairs in which she apprehended the most difficulty that very little remained for her to do before she should be enabled to return to france where her husband was to sign some papers to secure his safety and that little depended on james crofts who seemed to be making artificial delay and trying to give her all the trouble and perplexity in his power he had however another motive than merely to harrass and distress her his father had employed him to deal with le limosin well knowing that there was nothing so base and degrading that he would not undertake where his interest was in question and sir richard had promised him a considerable addition to his fortune if he had address enough to prevent so capital a sum as emmeline claimed from being deducted from that of the family to whom his brother was allied and from whence he had expectations which could not but suffer from such a diminution of its wealth and interest the tediousness therefore that the crofts created promised still to detain emmeline in london and her uncles letter which coldly and hardly with civility deferred any conference on her affairs till the arrival of lord westhaven convinced her that from his tenderness she had nothing from his justice little to hope godolphin was very anxious to be allowed personally to apply to him on the claim of his niece but this emmeline positively refused she would not even allow mr newton the lawyer to whom lord westhaven had recommended her and in whose hands her papers were safely deposited to write officially to lord montreville but determined to wait quietly the return of lord westhaven himself on whom she knew neither the anger of her uncle or the artifices of sir richard would make any impression while his lordships interference could not be imputed to such motives as might possibly be thought to influence godolphin or would it give her the appearance of proceeding undutifully and harshly against lord montreville which appearances she might be liable to should she hastily institute a suit against him she grew however very uneasy at the determined attendance of godolphin whose presence she knew was so necessary to poor lady adelina she saw that he was anxious about his sister yet could not determine to tear himself from her and to insist upon his returning to lady adelina would be to assume a right to which on the footing they were she declined pretending she failed not however every day to represent to him the long solitude in which lady adelina had been left and to read to him parts of her letters which breathed only sorrow and depression whenever this happened godolphin heard her with concern and promised to set out the next day but still something was to be done for the service of emmeline and still he could not bear to resign the delight he had now so long enjoyed of seeing her every day and of indulging those hopes she had tacitly allowed him to entertain mrs stafford notwithstanding her promise to emmeline had not been able to forbear discovering to him part of the truth yet when he reflected on the advantages delamere had over him in fortune in rank in the influence his family connection and his former engagement might give him he trembled least if he should be himself absent when lord delamere arrived her tender and timid spirit would yield to the sorrow of her lover and the authority of her family and that almost in despite of herself he might lose her for ever while he yet lingered and continued to promise that he would go to the isle of wight the eight first days of their stay in town glided away early in the morning of the ninth godolphin entered the room where mrs stafford and emmeline were at breakfast i must now indeed said he lose no time in going to adelina i am to day informed that mr trelawny is dead shall we then see lady adelina in town eagerly asked emmeline who could not affect any concern at the death of such a man i apprehend not replied godolphin whatever business there may be to settle with the bancrafts i am sure will be more proper for me than for her to them i must now go at putney and only came to inform you madam addressing himself to mrs stafford of the reason of my sudden absence shall you return again to london sir before you proceed into hampshire not unless you or miss mowbray will allow me to suppose that to either of you my return may be in any way serviceable mrs stafford assured him she had nothing to trouble him upon which required such immediate attention emmeline then attempted to make an answer of the same kind but tho she had for some days wished him to go she could not see him on the point of departing without being sensible of the anguish his absence would occasion her and instead of speaking distinctly her thanks she only murmured something and was so near bursting into tears that fearing to expose herself she was hurrying out of the room no messageno letternot one kind word said he gently detaining her to poor adelina nothing to your little protegé mylove to them both sir and will you not write to my sister by the post said emmeline struggling to get from him to conceal her emotion he then kissed her hand and suffered her to go while the explanation mrs stafford gave of her real feelings elated him to rapture in which he departed protesting that nothing should prevent his return to follow the good fortune which he now believed might be his as soon as he could adjust his sisters business with her husbands relations mrs stafford recommended it to him to bring lady adelina to london with him as the affection emmeline had for her would inevitably give her great influence godolphin in answer to this advice only shook his head and mrs stafford remained uncertain of his intentions to follow it a few days now elapsed without any extraordinary occurrence emmeline thought less of the impending restoration of her fortune for of its restoration mr newton assured her he had no doubt than of him with whom she hoped to share it she impatiently longed to hear from lady adelina that he was with her and sometimes her mind dwelt with painful solicitude on lady westhaven and delamere for whose health and safety she was truly anxious and of whom she had received no account since her arrival in london as she was performing the promise she had made to godolphin of writing to lady adelina by an early post le limosin announced mr james crofts who immediately entered the room with his usual jerking and familiar walk emmeline who incapable as she was of hating any body yet felt towards him a disgust almost amounting to hatred received him with the coldest reserve and mrs stafford with no more civility than was requisite to prevent his alledging her rudeness and impatience as reasons for not settling the business on which she concluded he came he began with general conversation and when mrs stafford impatient to have done with him introduced that which went more immediately to the adjustment of the affair she wished to settle he told her that being extremely unwilling to discuss a matter of business with a lady and apprehensive of giving offence to one for whom he and his dear mrs crofts had so sincere a regard he had determined to leave all the concerns yet between them to his attorney a man of strict honour and probity to whom he would give her a direction and to whom it would be better for her attorney to apply than that they should themselves enter on a topic whereon it was probable they might differ mrs stafford vexed at his dissimulation and finesse again pressed him to come to a conclusion without the interference of lawyers but he again repeated the set speech he had formed on the occasion and then addressing himself to emmeline asked smilingly and affecting an interest in her welfare whether the information he had received was true what information sir that miss mowbray has the most authentic claim to the estate of her late father it is by no means an established claim sir and such as you must excuse me if i decline talking of i am told you have papers that put it out of dispute if you would favour me with a sight of them perhaps i could give you some insight into the proceedings you should commence and i am sure my friendship and regard would make any service i could do you a real satisfaction to myself i thank you sir for your professions the papers in question are in the hands of mr newton of lincolns inn if he will allow you to see them i have no objection you intend then said james crofts unable entirely to conceal his chagrinyou intend to begin a suit with my lord montreville by no means sir i am persuaded there will be no necessity for it but as you have just referred mrs stafford to a lawyer i must beg leave to say that if you have any questions to ask you must apply to mine james crofts quite disconcerted notwithstanding his presumptuous assurance was not ready with an answer and emmeline who doubted not that he was sent by his father to gain what intelligence he could was so provoked that not conceiving herself obliged to preserve the appearance of civility to a man she despised she left him in possession of the room from whence mrs stafford had a few moments before departed he therefore was obliged to withdraw having found his attempt to shake the integrity of le limosin as fruitless as that he had made to get sight of the papers he had not long been gone when a servant brought to emmeline the following note i have heard you are in town with mrs stafford and beg leave to wait on you do not ma douce amie refuse to grant me this favour besides the happiness of seeing you and your friend i have another very particular reason for soliciting you to grant such an indulgence to george fitzedward i write this from a neighbouring coffeehouse where i expect your answer emmeline immediately carried this billet to mrs stafford who told her there was no reason why she should refuse the request it contained she therefore wrote a card of compliment to colonel fitzedward signifying that she should be glad to see him in a few moments fitzedward appeared and emmeline tho aware of his arrival could not receive him without confusion and emotion nor could she without pity behold his altered countenance and manner so different from what they were when she first saw the gay and gallant fitzedward at mowbray castle he began by expressing with great appearance of sincerity his joy at seeing her enquired after lord delamere and mentioned his astonishment at what he had heardthat delamere had so repeatedly enquired after him and signified such a wish to see him yet had never written to him to explain his business emmeline who knew well on what he had so earnestly desired to meet him blushed but did not think it necessary to clear up a subject which godolphins explanation to delamere had rendered no longer alarming you know perhaps said fitzedward that mr trelawny is dead i do and your fair unhappy friendmay i nowor is it still a crime enquire after her she is i believe well answered emmeline and remains at the house of her brother tell me miss mowbraywill she after a proper time refuse do you think her consent to see me will you my lovely friend undertake to plead for me will you and mrs stafford who know with what solicitude i sought her with what anguish i deplored her loss intercede on my behalfyou who know how fondly my heart has been devoted to her from the moment of our fatal parting i can undertake nothing of this kind sir the fate of lady adelina depends i apprehend on her brothers to them i think you should apply and why not to herself is she not now at liberty and when destiny has at length broken the cruel chains with which she was loaded will she voluntarily bind herself with others hardly more supportable if she refers me to her brothers i must despairthe coldhearted lord westhaven the inflexible and rigid godolphin will make it a mistaken point of honour to divide us for ever you can not suppose sir that i shall undertake to influence lady adelina to measures disapproved by her family i know not that lord westhaven is cold and unfeeling as you describe him on the contrary i believe he unites one of the best heads and warmest hearts if your request is proper you certainly risk nothing by referring it to him of godolphin she spoke not fearful of betraying to the penetrating and observing fitzedward how little he answered in her idea the character of unfeeling and severe i know not what to do said fitzedward should i address myself to her brothers without success i am undone since i well know that from their decision there will be no appeal i can not live without her emmelineindeed i can not and in the hope only of what has lately happened have i dragged on till now a reluctant existence once and but once i dared write to her but her brother returned the letter she suffered him cruelly to return it in a cover in which he informed me that the peace and honour of lady adelina trelawny made it necessary for her to forget that such a man existed as colonel fitzedward godolphin continued hegodolphin may carry this too far he may oblige me to remind him that there is more than one way in which his inexorable punctilio may be satisfied certainly cried emmeline in great agitation which she vainly struggled to conceal there is no method more likely to convince lady adelina of your tenderness for her than that you hint at and if you should be fortunate enough to destroy a brother to whom she owes every thing your triumph will be complete prevent then the necessity of my applying to godolphin by speaking to lady adelina in my favour ask her whether she can divest herself of all regard for me ask her whether she can condemn me to eternal regret and despair i can not indeed i am not likely to see her and if i were this is a subject on which nothing shall induce me to influence her mrs stafford who had been detained in another room by a person who came to her upon business now joined them and fitzedward without hesitation repeated to her what he had been saying to emmeline i do not think indeed colonel that miss mowbray can interfere and i am of her opinion that as soon as such proposals as you intend to make are proper you should address them to her brothers mr godolphin madam treats me in a way which only my tenderness my love for his sister induces me to bear i have met him accidentally and he passes rudely by me i sent a gentleman to him to desire an amicable interview he answered that as we could not meet as friends he must be excused from seeing me at all had i been as rash as cruel as he seems to be i should then have noticed in the way it demanded such a message but conscious that i had already injured him i bore with his petulance and his asperity i love godolphin continued hefrom our boyish days i have loved and respected him i know the nobleness of his nature and i can make great allowances for the impatience of injured honour but will he not carry it too far if now that his sister is released from her detested marriage he still persists in dividing us you are not sure said mrs stafford that he will do so have patience at least till the time is elapsed when you may try the experiment in the interim i will consider what ought to be done my ever excellent ever amiable friend exclaimed fitzedward warmlyhow much do i owe you already ah add yet to those obligations the restoration of adelina and i shall be indebted to you for more than life as to you my sweet marblehearted emmeline i heartily pray that all your coldness both towards me and poor delamere may be revenged by your feeling on behalf of him all the pain you have inflicted alas thought emmeline your wicked wish is already accomplished tho not in favour of poor delamere fitzedward then obtained permission to wait on them again tho mrs stafford very candidly told him that after captain godolphin came to town she begged he would forbear coming in when he heard of his being there we will try said she to conciliate matters between you so that ye may meet in peace and till then pray forbear to meet at all fitzedward flattering himself that mrs stafford would interest herself for him and that emmeline however reserved would be rather his friend than his enemy departed in rather better spirits and left the fair friends to debate on the means of preventing what was very likely to happena difference of the most alarming kind between him and godolphin should the latter persist in refusing him permission to address at a proper season lady adelina the long delays that seemed likely to arise before her own business would be adjusted with lord montreville the fiery and impatient spirits with which it appeared to be her lot to contend the vexation to which she saw mrs stafford subjected by the sordid and cruel conduct of the crofts towards her and lastly her encreasing disquietude about godolphin whom she feared to encourage yet was equally unwilling and unable to repulse oppressed her spirits and made her stay in london very disagreeable to her she had never before been in it for more than a night or two and at this time of the year it was the beginning of october the melancholy deserted houses in the fashionable streets and the languor that appeared in the countenances of those who were obliged to be in town offered no amusement or variety to compensate for the loss of the pure air she had been accustomed to breathe or for the beautiful and interesting landscapes which she remembered to have enjoyed in autumn at mowbray castle where she so much languished to be that she sometimes thought if her uncle would resign it and the estate immediately around to her she could be content to leave him in possession of the rest of that fortune he coveted with so much avidity chapter x a few days longer passed and emmeline yet heard nothing of the return of lord and lady westhaven a circumstance at which she grew extremely uneasy not only as it gave her reason to fear for the health of lord delamere for whom she was very anxious but for that of lady westhaven whom she so tenderly loved she observed too with concern that under pretence of waiting the arrival of his son and his son in law lord montreville delayed all advances towards a settlement and that mrs stafford wearied by the duplicity and chicanery of the crofts and miserable in being detained so long from her children grew quite disheartened and was prevented only by her affection for emmeline from returning to france and abandoning all hopes of an accommodation which every day seemed more difficult and more distant the arrival of lord westhaven was on her account particularly desirable as he had promised emmeline to make a point of assisting her and on his assurances she knew it was safe to rely since they were neither made to give himself an air of importance nor meant to quiet the trouble of present importunity by holding out the prospect of future advantage never thought of more nothing however could be done to hasten this important arrival and the fair friends tho uneasy and impatient were obliged to submit but from the restlessness of daily suspence they were roused by two letters which brought in its place only poignant concern that to mrs stafford was from her husband who tho he had neither relish for her conversation nor respect for her virtues was yet dissatisfied without her and even while she was wholly occupied in serving him tormented her with murmurs and suspicions he scrupled not to hint that as she was with her beloved miss mowbray she forgot her duty to her family and that as she had been now gone near a month he thought it quite long enough not only to have done the business she undertook but to have enjoyed as much pleasure as was in her situation reasonable he therefore expected her to return to france and supposed that she had settled every thing to facilitate his coming back to england the unreasonable expectations and ungrateful suspicions which this letter contained overwhelmed her with mortification to return without having finished the business on which she came would be to expose herself to insult and reproach yet to stay longer without a probability of succeeding by her stay would only occasion an aggravation of his ill humour and probably a worse reception when she rejoined him the letter to emmeline was from lady adelina and ran thus east cliff oct godolphin my emmeline is at length returned to your unhappy friend who has passed many many melancholy days since he left her my dear brother appears not only in better health but in better spirits than when he went from hence ought i then to repine when i see him and when he tells me that you are well and that affluence and with it i hope happiness will be yours the very name of happiness and of adelina should not come in the same page ah never must they any where meet again pardon me for thus recurring to myself but the mournful topic will intrude unhappy trelawny he had not quite compleated his twentyfifth year tho i never either loved or esteemed him and tho to my early and hasty marriage i owe all the misery of my life his death has something shocking in it my weak spirits which have of late been unusually deranged are sadly affected by it yet surely in regard to him i have little to reproach myself did he not abandon me to my destiny did he not plunge headlong into follies from which he resented even an effort to save him alas unless i could have given him that understanding which nature had denied him my solicitude must ever have been vain it is some alleviation too to my concern to reflect that as much of his honour as depended on me has not by the breath of public fame been sullied and i try to persuade myself that since his life was useful to nobody and had long been from intemperance burthensome to himself i should not suffer his death to dwell so heavily upon me yet in spite of every effort to shake off the melancholy which devours me it encreases upon me and to you i may say for you will hear and pity me that there exists not at this moment so complete a wretch as your adelina to my brother william all gentle and generous as he is i can not complain it were ingratitude to let him see how little all his tenderness avails towards reconciling me to myself towards healing the wounds of my depressed spirit and quieting the murmurs of this feeble heart yet methinks to have a friend in whose compassionate bosom i might pour out its weakness and its sorrows would mitigate the extreme severity of those sufferings which are now more than i can bear where have i on earth such a friend but in my emmeline and will she refuse to come to me ah wherefore should she refuse it i shall be alone for godolphin is obliged to go immediately to london to settle all the business i shall now ever have with the family of trelawny and put it on such a footing as may preclude the necessity of my ever meeting any of them hereafter he tells me that your affairs advance nothing till lord westhavens return and that our dear mrs stafford talks of being obliged to go back to her family if she must do so you will not stay in london alone and where is your company so fondly desired where can you have such an opportunity of exercising your generous goodness as in coming hither our little boydo you not long to embrace him ah lovely as he is why dare i not indulge all the pleasure and all the pride i might feel in seeing him and wherefore must anguish so keen mingle with tenderness so delicious ah my friend come to me i entreat i implore you the reasons why i can not see london are of late multiplied rather than removed and i can only have the happiness of embracing you here hesitate not to oblige me then for i every hour wish more and more ardently to see you when i awake from my imperfect slumbers your presence is the first desire of my heart i figure you to myself as i wander forth on my solitary walks and when i do sleep the image of my angelic friend consolatory and gentle makes me some amends for visions less pleasant that disturb it ah let me not see you in dreams alone for above all i want youwhen i am alone with poor adelina come o come and if it be possiblesave mefrom myself at the melancholy tenor of this letter greatly affected emmeline she wished almost as eagerly as her friend to be with her but how could she determine to become an inmate at the house of godolphin even tho he was himself to be absent from it she communicated however lady adelinas request to mrs stafford who could see no objection to any plan which might promote the interest of godolphin she represented therefore to emmeline how very disagreeable it would be to her to be left alone in town when she should herself be obliged to leave her as must now soon happen that there was in fact no very proper asylum for her but the house of her uncle which he seemed not at all disposed to offer her but that to lady adelinas proposal there could be no reasonable objection especially as godolphin was not to be there emmeline yet hesitated till another letter from stafford more harsh and unreasonable than the first obliged her friend to fix on the following thursday for her departure the absurd impatience of her husband thus defeating its own purpose and emmeline partly influenced by her persuasions and yet more by her own wishes determined at length to fix the same time for beginning her journey to the isle of wight there was yet two days to intervene and mrs stafford was obliged to employ the first of them in the city among lawyers and creditors of her husband from scenes so irksome she readily allowed miss mowbray to excuse herself who therefore remained at home and was engaged in looking over some poems she had purchased when she heard a rap at the door and the voice of godolphin on the stairs enquiring of le limosin for mrs stafford le limosin told him that she was from home but that mademoiselle mowbray was in the dining room he sent up to know if he might be admitted emmeline had no pretence for refusing him and received him with a mixture of confusion and pleasure which she ineffectually attempted to hide under the ordinary forms of civility the eyes of godolphin were animated by the delight of beholding her but when she enquired after lady adelina as she almost immediately did they assumed a more melancholy expression adelina is far from being well said he has she not written to you she has and has she not preferred a request to you yes what answer do you mean to give it will you refuse once more to bless and relieve by your presence my unhappy sister i do not know said emmeline deeply blushing that i ought especially without the concurrence of my uncle to consent yet to contribute to the satisfaction of lady adelinato give her any degree of happinesswhat is there i can refuse adorable angelic goodness eagerly cried godolphin best as well as loveliest of human creatures you go then i intend beginning my journey on thursday and you will allow me to see you safe thither there can surely be no occasion to give you that trouble sir said emmeline apprehensively nor ought you to think of it since lady adelinas affairs certainly require your attendance in london they do but not so immediately as to prevent my attending you to east cliff if you will suffer me to do that i promise instantly to return no i go only attended by my servants or go not at all godolphin was mortified to find her so determined and easily discouraged from those hopes which he had indulged rather from the flattering prospects offered to him by mrs stafford than presumption founded on his own remarks he now again felt all his apprehensions renewed of her latent affection for delamere the acute anguish to which those ideas exposed him and their frequent return determined him now to attempt knowing at once whether he had or had not that place in emmelines heart which mrs stafford had assured him he had long possessed sitting down near her therefore he said gravelyas i may not miss mowbray soon have again the happiness i now enjoy will you allow me to address you on a subject which you must long have known to be nearest my heart but on which you have so anxiously avoided every explanation i have attempted that i fear intruding too much on your complaisance if i enter upon it emmeline found she could not avoid hearing him and sat silent her heart violently beating godolphin went on from the first moment i beheld you my heart was yours i attempted indeed at the beginning of our acquaintanceah how vainly attemptedto conquer a passion which i believed was rendered hopeless by your prior engagement while i supposed you the promised wife of lord delamere i concealed as well as i was able my sufferings and never offended you with an hint of their severity had you married him i think i could have carried them in silence to the grave those ties however lord delamere himself broke and i then thought myself at liberty to solicit your favour it was for that purpose i took the road to st alpin when the unhappy delamere stopped me at besançon when i afterwards related to you his illness the sorrow the lively and generous sorrow you expressed for him and the cold and reserved manner in which you received me made me still believe that tho he had relinquished your hand he yet possessed your heart i saw it with anguish and continued silent all that passed at besançon confirmed me in this opinion i determined to tear myself away and again conceal in solitude a passion which while i felt it to be incurable i feared was hopeless accident however detaining me at calais again threw me in your way and i heard that far from having renewed your engagement with lord delamere you had left him to avoid his eager importunity dare i addthat then my pity for him was lost in the hopes i presumed to form for myself and studiously as you have avoided giving me an opportunity of speaking to you i have yet ventured to flatter myself that you beheld not with anger or scorn my ardent my fond attachment from the beginning of this speech to its conclusion the encreasing confusion of emmeline deprived her of all power of answering it with deepened blushes and averted eyes she at first sought for refuge in affecting to be intent on the netting she drew from her work box but having spoiled a whole row her trembling hands could no longer go on with it and as totally her tongue refused to utter the answer which by the pause he made she concluded godolphin expected after a moment however he went on i have by no means encouraged visions so delightful without a severe alloy of fear and mistrust frequently your coldness your unkindness gives me again to despondence and every lovely prospect i had suffered my imagination to draw is lost in clouds and darkness yet i am convinced you do not intend to torture me and that from miss mowbray i may expect that candour that explicit conduct of which common minds are incapable tell me then dearest and loveliest emmeline may i venture to hope that tender bosom is not wholly insensible will you hear me with patience and even with pity what sir can i say faulteringly asked emmeline i am in a great measure dependant at least for some time on lord montreville and till i am of age have determined to hear nothing on the subject on which you are pleased to address me admitting it to be so answered godolphin give me but an hope to live upon till then i will not deny sir said emmeline still more faintly i will not deny that my esteem for your charactermymy oh speak exclaimed godolphin eagerlyspeak and tell me that at this moment le limosin hastily came into the room and saidmademoiselle le chevalier de bellozane demande permission de vous parler godolphin vexed at the interruption and embarrassed at the arrival of the chevalier said hastilyyou will not see him how can i refuse him answered she perhaps he comes with some intelligence of your brotherof my dear lady westhaven by this time the chevalier was in the room emmeline received him with anxious and confused looks arising entirely from her apprehensions about lady westhaven and lord delamere but the vanity of bellozane saw in it only a struggle between her real sentiments and her affectation of concealment she almost instantly however enquired after her friends i left them said bellozane almost as soon as you did and went because i wanted money and my father wanted to see me back to st alpin where i staid almost a fortnight and having obtained a necessary recruit of cash i set off for paris where my leave of absence being to expire in another month i was forced to make interest to obtain a longer permission in order to throw myself lovely miss mowbray at your feet and to pass the winter in the delights of london which they tell me i shall like better than paris emmeline disgusted at his presumption and volatility enquired if he knew nothing since of lord and lady westhaven oh yes said he i saw them all at paris and asked them if they had any commands to you but i could get nothing from my good cousin but sage advice and from lady westhaven only cold looks and half sentences and as to poor delamere i knew he was too much afraid of my success to be in a better temper with me than the other two so we had but little conversation but they are well sir no delamere has been detained all this time by illness at different places he was better when i saw him but lady westhaven was herself ill and my cousin was in looks the most rueful of the three but sir when may they be expected in england that i can not tell the last time i saw lord westhaven was above a week before i left paris and then he said he knew not when his wife would be well enough to begin their journey but he hoped within a fortnight good god thought emmeline what can have prevented his writing to me all this time godolphin after the first compliments passed with the chevalier had been quite silent he now however asked some questions about his brother by which he found that in consequence of endeavouring to discourage bellozanes voyage to england lord westhaven had offended him and that a coldness had taken place between them bellozane had ceased to consider godolphin as a rival when he beheld lord delamere in that light and was now rather pleased to meet him knowing that his introduction into good company would greatly be promoted by means of such a relation do you know said the chevalier addressing himself to emmeline that i have had some trouble my fair friend to find you and how enquired godolphin did you accomplish it why my lord westhaven to whom i applied at paris protested that he did not know so remembering the name of le marquis de montreville i wrote to him to know where i might wait on mademoiselle mowbray monseigneur le marquis being at his country house did not immediately answer my letter at length i had a card from him which he had the complaisance to send by a gentleman un monsieurmonsieur croff who invited me to his house and introduced me to milady croff his wife who is daughter to milor montreville mon dieu que cette femme la est vive aimable quelle a lair du monde et de la bonne compagnie you think lady frances crofts then handsomer than her sister asked godolphin mais nonelle nest pas peutetre si bellemais elle a cependant un certain air enfinje la trouve charmante godolphin then continuing to question him found that the crofts had invited bellozane with an intention of getting from him the purpose of his journey and what his business was with emmeline and finding that it was his gallantry only brought him over and that he knew nothing of the late mr mowbrays affairs had no longer made any attempt to oppose his seeing her godolphin tho he believed emmeline not only indifferent but averse to him was yet much disquieted at finding she was likely again to be exposed to his importunities he trembled least if he discovered her intentions of going to east cliff he should follow her thither for which his relationship to lady adelina would furnish him with a pretence and desirous of getting him away as soon as possible he asked if he would dine with him at his lodgings bellozane answered that he was already engaged to mr crofts and then turning to emmeline offered to take her hand and enquired whether she had a softer heart than when she left besançon emmeline drew away her hand and very gravely entreated him to say no more on a subject already so frequently discussed and on which her sentiments must ever be the same bellozane gaily protested that he had been too long a soldier to be easily repulsed that he would wait on her the next day and doubted not but he should find her more favourably disposed je reviendrai demain vous offrir encore mon hommage adieu nymphe belle et cruelle la chaine que je porte fera toute ma gloire he then snatched her hand which in spite of her efforts he kissed and with his usual gaiety went away accompanied by godolphin hardly had emmeline time to recollect her dissipated spirits after the warm and serious address of godolphin and to feel vexation and disgust at the presumptuous forwardness of bellozane from which she apprehended much future trouble before a note was brought from mrs stafford to inform her that after waiting some hours at the house of the attorney she employed the people who were to meet her had disappointed her and that there was no prospect of her getting her business done till a late hour in the evening she therefore desired emmeline to dine without her and not to expect her till ten or eleven at night as it was now between four and five she ordered up her dinner and was sitting down to it alone when godolphin again entered the room vexation was marked in his countenance he seemed hurried and having apologized for again interrupting her tho he did not account for his return he sat down surely cried emmeline alarmed you have heard nothing unpleasant from france nothing upon my honour answered he the account the chevalier gives is indeed far from satisfactory yet i am persuaded there is nothing particularly amiss or we should have heard it is that consideration only which has made me tolerably easy yet it is strange i have no letter from lady westhaven will you dine with me added emmeline it was indeed hardly possible to avoid asking him as le limosin at that moment brought up the dinner where is mrs stafford said he detained in the city and you dine alone and will allow me the happiness of dining with you certainly replied emmeline blushing if you will favour me with your company godolphin then placed himself at the end of the table and in the pleasure of being with her thus unmarked by others and considering her invitation as an assurance that his declaration of the morning was favourably received he forgot the chagrin which hung upon him at his first entrance and thought only of the means by which he might perpetuate the happiness he now possessed emmeline tried to shake off in common conversation her extreme embarrassment but when dinner was over and le limosin left the room in whose presence she felt a sort of protection she foresaw that she must again hear godolphin and that it would be almost impossible to evade answering him she now repented of having asked him to dine with her then blamed herself for the reserve and coldness with which she had almost always treated a man who deserving all her affections had so long possessed them but the idea of poor delamereof his sadness his despair arose before her and was succeeded by yet more frightful images of the consequences that might follow his frantic passions and impressed at once with pity and terror she again resolved to keep if it were possible the true state of her heart from the knowledge of godolphin i have seldom seen one of my relations with so little pleasure said he after the servant had withdrawn as i to day met my volatile cousin de bellozane i hoped he would have persecuted you no farther with a passion to which i think you are not disposed to listen i certainly never intend it pardon me then dearest miss mowbray if i solicit leave to renew the conversation his abrupt entrance broke off you had the goodness to say you had some esteem for my characterah tell me if on that esteem i may presume to build those hopes which alone can give value to the rest of my life emmeline who saw he expected an answer attempted to speak but the halfformed words died away on her lips it was not thus she was used to receive the addresses of delamere her heart then left her reason and her resolution at liberty but now the violence of its sensations deprived her of all power of uttering sentiments foreign to it or concealing those it really felt godolphin drew from this charming confusion a favourable omenyou hear me not with anger lovely emmeline cried heyou allow me then to hope i can only repeat sir said emmeline in a voice hardly audible that until i am of age i have resolved to hear nothing on this subject and why not are you not now nearly as independant as you will be then alas said emmeline i am indeedfor my uncle concerns not himself about me and it is doubtful whether he will do me even the justice to acknowledge me he must he shall replied godolphin warmlyah entrust me with your interest let me in the character of the fortunate man whom you allow to hope for your favourlet me apply to him for justice that any one should make such an application except lord westhaven is what i greatly wish to avoid i shall most reluctantly appeal to the interference of friends and still more to that of law the last is you know very uncertain and instead of the heiress to the estate of my father as i have lately been taught to believe myself i may be found still to be the poor destitute orphan so long dependant on the bounty of my uncle and as such cried godolphin greatly animated you will be dearer to me than my existence yes emmeline whether you are mistress of thousands or friendless portionless and deserted your power over this heart is equally absoluteequally fixed ah suffer not any consideration that relates to the uncertainty of your situation to delay a moment the permission you must you will give me to avow my long and ardent passion it must not be mr godolphin and tears filled her eyes as she spoke indeed it must not be it is not now possible at least it is very improper for me to listen to you ah do not then press it i have indeed already suffered you to say too much on such a topic godolphin then renewed his warm entreaties that he might be permitted openly to profess himself her lover but she still evaded giving way to them by declaring that till she was of age she would not marry had i no other objections continued she the singularity of my circumstances is alone sufficient to determine me i can not think of accepting the honour you offer me while my very name is in some degree doubtful it would i own mortify me to take any advantage of your generosity and should i fail of obtaining from lord montreville that to which i am now believed to have a claim his lordship irritated at the attempt will probably withdraw what he has hitherto allowed mescanty support and occasional protection find protection with your lover with your husband exclaimed heand may that happy husband that adoring lover be godolphin may adelina forget her own calamities in contemplating the felicity of her brother and may her beauteous her benevolent friend become her sister indeed as she has long been the sister of her heart you will oblige me sir said emmeline feeling that notwithstanding all her attempts to conceal it the truth trembled in her eyes and faultered in her accentsyou will oblige me if you say no more of this i will obey you if you will only tell me i may hope how can i say so sir when so long a time must intervene before i shall think of fixing myself for life yet surely you know the generous the candid miss mowbray knows whether her devoted godolphin is agreeable to her or whether if every obstacle which exists in her timid imagination were removed he would be judged wholly unworthy of pretending to the honour of her hand certainly not unworthy tremblingly said emmeline let me then thus encouraged go fartherand ask if i have a place in your esteem do not ask meindeed i can not tellnay i beg i entreat added she trying to disengage her hands from him that you will desistdo not force me to leave you ah talk not think not of leaving me think rather of confirming those fortunate presages i draw from this lovely timidity i can not go till i know your thoughts of metill i know what place i hold in that soft bosom i think of you as an excellent brother as a generous and disinterested friend for such i have found you as a man of great good sense of noble principles of exalted honour as one then said godolphin vehemently interrupting her not unworthy of being entrusted with your happiness who may hope to be honoured with a deposit so inestimable as the confidence and tenderness of that gentle and generous heart i do indeed think very highly of youi can not if i would deny it and you allow me then to go instantly to lord montreville oh no nosurely nothing i have said implied such a consent godolphin however was still pressing and at length brought her to confess with blushes and even with tears her early and long partiality for him and her resolution either to be his or die unmarried she found indeed all attempts to dissimulate vain the reserve she had forced herself to assume gave way to her natural frankness and having once been induced to make such an acknowledgment of the state of her heart she determined to have no longer any secrets concealed from him who was its master she therefore candidly told him how great was her compassion for lord delamere and how severe her apprehensions of his rage resentment and despair he allowed the force of the first but as to the other he would not suppose it a reason for her delaying her marriage poor delamere said he is of a temper which opposition and difficulty renders more eager and more obstinate yet when you are for ever out of his reach as the obstacle will become invincible he must yield to necessity while you remain single he will still hope the greatest kindness therefore that you can do him will be to convince him that he has nothing to expect from you and put an end at once to the uncertainty which tortures him to drive him to despair ah i know so well the dreadful force of his passions and the excesses he is capable of committing when under their influence that i dare not i positively will not risk it i love delamere as my brother i love him for the resemblance he is said to bear to my father i pity him for the errors which the natural impetuosity of his temper inflamed by the unbounded indulgence of his mother continually leads him into and the misfortunes these causes are so frequently inflicting on him and should his fatal inclination for me be the means of bringing on himself and on his family yet other miseries i should never forgive myself or him by whose means they were incurred from me at least you have nothing of that sort to apprehend i truly pity delamere i feel what it must be to have relinquished the woman he loves and to find her lost to his hopes while his passion is unabatedbe assured my compassion for him will induce me rather to soothe his unhappiness than to insult him with an ostentatious display of my enviable fortune yet if you suffer me to believe my attachment not disagreeable to you how shall i wholly conceal it how appear as not daring to avow that which is the glory and happiness of my life and by your being supposed disengaged and indifferent see you exposed to the importunities of an infinite number of suitors who however inconsequential they may be to you will torment me i do not know that i have much of jealousy in my nature yet i can not tell how i shall bear to see delamere presuming again on your former friendship for himeven the volatile and thoughtless bellozane has the power to make me uneasy when i see him so persuaded of his own merit and so confident of success while you assert that you are but little disposed to jealousy you are persuading me that you are extremely prone to it you know bellozane can never have the smallest interest in my heart but as to delamere i am decided against inflaming his irritable passions by encouraging an avowed rival tho i will do all i can by other means to discourage him the only condition on which i will continue to see you is that you appear no otherwise interested about me than as the favoured friend of your sister your brother and lady westhaven press me therefore no farther on the subject and let us now part tell me first whether your journey remains fixed for thursdaywhether you still hold your generous resolution of going to adelina i do but i must insist on going alone and if bellozane should enquire whither you are going you see nothing prevents his following you and to follow you to east cliff he will you know have sufficient excuse emmeline i can not bear itthere is a presumption in his manner which offends and shocks me and which however you may dislike it it may not always be in your power to repress surely he need not know that i am going thither it was now therefore agreed between them that if bellozane called upon her the next day as he said he intended she should be denied to him and that early on the following morning which was thursday she should set out for east cliff attended by madelon and le limosin this arrangement was hardly made when mrs stafford returned weary and exhausted from the unpleasant party with which she had passed the day with emmelines permission who left the room that she might not hear it godolphin related to mrs stafford the conversation they had held it was the only information which had any power to raise her depressed spirits and as soon as emmeline rejoined them she added her entreaties to those of godolphin they urged her to conquer immediately all those scruples which divided her from him to whom she had given her heart and to put herself into such protection as must at once obviate all the difficulties she apprehended but emmeline still adhered to her resolution of remaining single if not till she was of age at least till her affairs with her uncle were adjusted and till she saw the unhappy delamere restored to health and tranquillity but notwithstanding this delay godolphin assured of possessing her affection left her with an heart which was even oppressed with the excess of its own happiness footnote the chevalier is below footnote how lively and agreeable she ishow much she has the air of a woman of fashion and of the world footnote not so handsome perhapsbut there is a somethingin short i think her charming footnote i shall come again tomorrow to offer my homage adieu fair cruel nymph i place my glory in wearing your chains chapter xi emmeline seemed to be happier since she had confessed to godolphin his influence over her mind and since she had made him in some measure the director of her actions she hoped that she might conceal her partiality till she had nothing to fear from delamere at present she was sure he had no suspicion that godolphin was his rival and she flattered herself that on his return to england the conviction of her coldness would by degrees wean him from his attachment and that he would learn to consider her only as his sister these pleasing hopes however were insufficient to balance the concern she felt for mrs stafford who having long struggled against her calamities now seemed on the point of sinking under their pressure and of determining to attend in despondent resignation the end of her unmerited sufferings emmeline attempted to reanimate her by repeating all the promises of lord westhaven on whose word she had the most perfect reliance she assured her that the moment her own affairs were settled her first care should be the reestablishment of those of her beloved friend for some time the oppressed spirits of mrs stafford would only allow her to answer with her tears these generous assurances at length she said it is to you my emmeline i could perhaps learn to be indebted without being humbled for you have an heart which receives while it confers an obligation but think what it is for one born with a right to affluence and educated in its expectation with feelings keen from nature and made yet keener by refinement to be compelled as i have been to solicit favours pecuniary favours from persons who have no feeling at allfrom the shifting paltryspirited james crofts forbearance from the claim of debts from the calloushearted and selfish politician his father pity and assistance from rochely who has no ideas but of getting or saving money to ask the loan of it and to bear with humility a rude refusal i have endured the brutal unkindness of hardened avarice the dirty chicane of law exercised by the most contemptible of beings i have been forced to attempt softening the tradesman and the mechanic and to suffer every degree of humiliation which the insolence of sudden prosperity or the insensible coolness of the determined money dealer could inflict actual poverty i think i could have better borne i should have found in some place of my soul a drop of patience but ineffectual attempts to ward it off by such degradation i can no longer submit to while mr stafford for whom i have encountered it all is not only unaffected by the poignant mortifications which torture me but receives my efforts to serve him if successful only as a dutyif unsuccessful he considers my failure as a fault and loads me with reproach with invective with contemptothers have in their husbands protectors and friends mine not only throws on me the burthen of affairs which he has himself embroiled but adds to their weight by cruelty and oppression such complicated and incurable misery must overwhelm me and thenwhat will become of my children penetrated with pity and sorrow emmeline listened in tears to this strong but too faithful picture of the situation of her unfortunate friend and with difficulty said in a voice of the tenderest pity yet a little patience and surely things will mend it can not be very long before i shall either be in high affluence or reduced to my former dependance perhaps to actual indigence of these events i hope the former is the most probable but be it as it may you and your children will be equally dear to meif i am rich my house my fortune shall be yoursif i am poor i will live with you and we will work together but for such resources as the pencil or the needle may afford us we shall i think have no occasion you my dear friend will continue to exert yourself for your children lord westhaven is greatly interested for you and all will yet be well i am afraid not replied mrs stafford among the various misfortunes of life there are some that admit of no cure some which even the tender and generous friendship of my emmeline can but palliate of that nature i fear are many of mine my past life has been almost all bitterness god only knows what the remainder of it may be but shadows clouds and darkness rest upon it ah give not up your mind to these gloomy thoughts said emmeline setting aside all hopes i have of being able without the assistance of any one to clear those prospects i have a firm dependance on lord westhaven and am sure i shall yet see you happy never i believe in this world dejectedly answered mrs stafford but why should i distress you my best emmeline with a repetition of my hopeless sorrows why can not i now refrain as i have hitherto done from taxing with my complaints your lively sensibility she then began to talk of their journey for the next day for which every thing was now ready it would have been very agreeable to emmeline could mrs stafford have gone by southampton and have accompanied her for a few days to east cliff but she said that besides her suffering so much at sea which made the long passage to france very dreadful to her she had already in a letter to her husband fixed to go by calais and as he might either send or come to meet her on that road he might be offended if she took the other besides these reasons she had yet another in the chance the calais road afforded of meeting lord and lady westhaven the two last arguments were unanswerable emmeline relinquished the project of their going together and they passed the rest of the day in the last preparations for their separate journeys in the course of it bellozane called twice but was not admitted godolphin was allowed to sup with them and early the next morning came again to see them set out they parted on all sides with tears and reluctanceemmeline with madelon in the chaise with her and le limosin on horseback took the road to southampton and mrs stafford pursued her melancholy journey to dover emmeline arrived at southampton late the same evening where she slept and the next morning landed on the isle of wight it was a clear and mild day towards the end of october and she walked attended by her servants to east cliff as she approached the door of godolphins house her heart beat quick a thousand tender recollections arose that related to its beloved master and some mournful apprehensions for the fate of its present lovely and unhappy inhabitant the maid who had so long waited on lady adelina opened the door and expressed the utmost delight at seeing emmeline ah dearest madam said she how good it is in you to come to my lady now i hope both her health and her spirits will be better but the joy of knowing you are here will overcome her unless i inform her of it with caution for tho she rather expected you i know it will be extreme barret then ran to execute this welcome commission and in a few moments lady adelina supported by her walked into the room holding in her hand little william and fell almost insensible into the arms of her friend the expression of her countenance faded as it was where a gleam of exquisite pleasure seemed to lighten up the soft features which had long sunk under the blighting hand of sorrow her weeds forming so striking a contrast to the fairness of her transparent skin and the lovely child now about fourteen months old which hung on her arm made her altogether appear to emmeline the most interesting the most affecting figure she had ever seen neither of them could speak lady adelina murmured something as she fondly pressed emmeline to her heart but it was not till its oppression was relieved by tears that she could distinctly thank her for coming emmeline with equal marks of tenderness embraced the mother and caressed the son whose infantine beauty would have charmed her had he been the child of a stranger after a little they grew more composed and emmeline while lady adelina in the most melting accents spoke of her brother william and enquired tenderly after her elder brother and his wife had time to contemplate her lovely but palid face from which the faint glow of transient pleasure the animated vivacity of momentary rapture was gone and a languor so great seemed to hang over her such pensive and settled melancholy had taken possession of her features that emmeline could hardly divest herself of the idea of immediate danger and fancied that she was come thither only to see the beauteous mourner sink into the grave she trembled to think on the consequence which in such a state of health might arise from the conflict she would probably have to undergo in regard to fitzedward emmeline herself dared not name him to godolphin in their long conference it was a subject on which however slightly touched he had always expressed such painful sensibility that she could not resolve to enter upon it with him yet she foresaw that on lord westhavens arrival either a general explanation must take place or that his lordship would accept for his sister the offer of fitzedward to which there would be in his eyes while he yet remained ignorant of their former unfortunate acquaintance no possible objection she supposed that lord and lady clancarryl equally ignorant of that error which had been partly owing to their own confidence in fitzedward would press lady adelina to accept him and that godolphin must either consent to forgive and receive him as his brother or give such reasons for opposing his alliance with lady adelina as would probably destroy the peace of his family and the fragile existence of his sister sometimes she thought that his inflexible honour would yield and induce him to bury the past in oblivion but then she recollected all the indignation he had but lately expressed against fitzedward and doubted with fearful apprehension the event the first day passed without that mutual and unreserved confidence being absolutely established which the lovely friends longed to repose in each other lady adelina languished to enquire after to talk of fitzedward yet dared not trust herself with his name and emmeline tho well assured that the knowledge of those terms which she was now on with godolphin would give infinite pleasure to his sister yet had not courage to reveal that truth which her conscious heart secretly enjoyed affected with her friends depression and unwilling to keep her up late she complained of fatigue soon in the evening and retired to her own room she there dismissed madelon and bade her as soon as mrs barret came from her ladys apartment let her know that she desired to speak to her she wished to enquire of this faithful servant her opinion of her ladys health and as soon as she came to her expressed her fears about it in terms equally anxious and tender ah madam said barret all you observe as to my lady is but too just and what i go thro about her especially when the captain is not here i am sure no tongue can tell sometimes maam when i have left her of a night and she tells me she is going to bed i hear her walk about the room talking then she goes to the bed for i have looked thro the key hole where master godolphin sleeps and looks at him and bursts into tears and laments herself over him and again begins to walk about the room and speaks as it were to herself and at other times she will open the window and leaning her head on her two hands sit and look at the clouds and the stars and sighs so deeply and so often that it makes my heart quite ache to hear her the child was very ill once with a tooth fever while the captain was gone to france and then indeed i thought my poor lady would have been quite quite gone in her head again for she talked so wildly of what she would do if he died and said such things as almost frightened me to death we sent to winchester for a physician and before he could come for you know maam what a long way tis to send she grew so impatient and had terrified herself into such agonies that when the doctor did come he said she was in a great deal the most danger of the two thank god master godolphin soon got well but it was a long time before my lady was quite herself again and since that maam she will hardly suffer master out of her sight at all but makes either his own maid or me sit in the room to attend upon him while she reads or writes when she walks out she generally orders one of us to take him with her and only goes out alone after he is in bed of a night then indeed she stays out long enough and tho you see maam how sadly she looks she never seems to care at all about her own health but does things that really would kill a strong person what then does she do enquired emmeline why maam quite late sometimes of a night when every body else is asleep she will go away by herself perhaps to that wood you see there or down to the sea shore and she orders me to let nobody follow her quite of cold nights this autumn when the wind blew and the sea made a noise so loud and dismal she has staid there whole hours by herself only i ventured to disobey her so far as to see that no harm came to her but three or four times maam she remained so long that i concluded she must catch her death at last i bethought me of getting one of the maids to go and tell her master was awake and i have got her to come in by that means out of the wind and the cold then maam she seems to take pleasure in nothing but sorrow and melancholy the books she reads are so sad that sometimes when her own eyes are tired and she makes me read them to her i get quite horrible thoughts in my head but my lady instead of trying as i do to shake them off will go directly to her music and play such mournful tunes that it really quite overcomes me as i am at work in another room at other times she goes and writes verses about her own unhappiness how is it possible maam that with such ways of passing her time my lady always so delicate as she was in health should be well for my part i only wonder she is not quite dead but how do you know barret that your lady employs herself in writing verses about her own unhappiness dear maam i have found them about every where when the captain is absent my lady is indifferent where she leaves them sometimes four or five sheets lay open on the table in her little dressing room and sometimes upon her music emmeline was too certain that such were the occupations of her poor friend during the short time they had been together lady adelina had shewn her some work and as she took it out of her drawer she drew out some papers with it i do but little work said she i find even embroidery does not serve to call off my thoughts sufficiently from myself i read a good deal in books of mere amusement for of serious application i am incapable and here is another specimen of my method of employing myself which perhaps you will not think a remedy for melancholy thoughts she put a written paper into emmelines hand who was about to open it but lady adelina added with a pensive smile do not read it now rather keep it till you are alone this paper emmeline took out to peruse as soon as she had dismissed barret her heart bled as she ran over this testimony of the anguish and despondence which preyed on the heart of lady adelina it was an ode to despair thou spectre of terrific mien lord of the hopeless heart and hollow eye in whose fierce train each form is seen that drives sick reason to insanity i woo thee with unusual prayer grim visaged comfortless despair approach in me a willing victim find who seeks thine iron swayand calls thee kind ah hide for ever from my sight the faithless flatterer hopewhose pencil gay portrays some vision of delight then bids the fairy tablet fade away while in dire contrast to mine eyes thy phantoms yet more hideous rise and memory draws from pleasures witherd flower corrosives for the heartof fatal power i bid the traitor love adieu who to this fond believing bosom came a guest insidious and untrue with pitys soothing voicein friendships name the wounds he gave nor time shall cure nor reason teach me to endure and to that breast mild patience pleads in vain which feels the curseof meriting its pain yet not to me tremendous power thy worst of spiritwounding pangs impart with which in dark convictions hour thou strikst the guilty unrepentant heart but of illusion long the sport that dreary tranquil gloom i court where my past errors i may still deplore and dream of longlost happiness no more to thee i give this tortured breast where hope arises but to foster pain ah lull its agonies to rest ah let me never be deceivd again but callous in thy deep repose behold in long array the woes of the dread future calm and undismayd till i may claim the hopethat shall not fade the feelings of a mind which could dictate such an address appeared to emmeline so greatly to be lamented and so unlikely to be relieved that the tender and painful compassion she had ever been sensible of for her unhappy friend was if possible augmented full of ideas almost as mournful as those by which they had been inspired she went to bed but not to tranquil sleep her spirits worn by her journey and oppressed by her concern for lady adelina were yet busy and instead of the uneasy images which had pursued her while she waked they represented to her others yet more terrifying she beheld in her dreams godolphin wildly seeking vengeance of fitzedward for the death of his sister then instead of fitzedward lord delamere appeared to be the object of his wrath and mutual fury seemed to animate them against the lives of each other to them her uncle in all the phrenzy of grief and despair succeeded overwhelmed her with reproaches for the loss of his only son and tore her violently away from godolphin who in vain pursued her these horrid visions returned so often drest in new forms of terror that emmeline having long resisted the impression they made upon her could at length bear them no longer but shaking off all disposition to indulge sleep on such terms she arose from her bed and wrapping herself up in her night gown went to the window the dawn did not yet appear but she sat down by the window of which she had opened the shutter to watch its welcome approach the morning for it was between three and four was mild the declining stars were obscured by no cloud and served to shew dimly the objects in the garden beneath her she softly opened the sash listened to the low hollow murmur of the sea and surveyed the lawn and the hill behind it which by the faint and uncertain light she could just discern all breathed a certain solemn and melancholy stillness calculated to inspire horror emmelines blood ran cold yet innocence like hers really fears nothing if free from the prejudices of superstition she endeavoured to conquer the disagreeable sensations she felt and to shake off the effects of her dreams but the silence and the gloominess of the scene assisted but little her efforts and she cast an eye of solicitude towards the eastern horizon and wished for the return of the sun in this disposition of mind she was at once amazed and alarmed by seeing the figure of a man tall and thin wrapped in a long horsemans coat as if on purpose to disguise him force himself out from between the shrubs which bounded one part of the lawn he looked not towards the windows but with folded arms and his hat over his eyes was poring on the ground while with slow steps he crossed the lawn and came immediately under the windows of the house when she first perceived him she had started back from that where she sat but tho greatly surprized she could not forbear watching him on longer observing his figure she fancied it was that of a gentleman and by his slow walk and manner he did not appear to have any design to attack the house her presence of mind never forsook her unless where her heart was greatly affected and she had now courage enough to determine that she would still continue for some moments to observe him and would not alarm the servants till she saw reason to believe he had ill intentions she sat therefore quite still and saw that instead of making any attempt to enter the house he traversed the whole side of it next the lawn with a measured and solemn pace several times then stopped a moment again went to the end and slowly returned and having continued to do so near an hour he crossed the grass and disappeared among the shrubs from whence he had issued had not emmeline been very sure that she not only heard his footsteps distinctly as he passed over a gravel walk in his way but even heard him breathe hard and short as if agitated or fatigued she would almost have persuaded herself that it was a phantom raised by her disordered spirits the longer she reflected on it the more incomprehensible it seemed that a man should at such an hour make such an excursion apparently to so little purpose that it was with a dishonest design there seemed no likelihood as he made no effort to force his way into the house which he might easily have done and had he come on a clandestine visit to any of the servants he would probably have had some signal by which his confederates would have been informed of his approach but he seemed rather fearful of disturbing the sleeping inhabitants his step was slow and light and on perceiving the first rays of the morning he started like a guilty thing and swiftly stepped away to his concealment emmeline continued some time at the window after his disappearance believing he might return but it soon grew quite light the gardener appeared at his work and she was then convinced that he would for that time come no more so extraordinary a circumstance however dwelt on her mind nor could she entirely divest herself of alarm a strange and confused idea that this visitor might be some one not unknown to her crossed her mind his height answered almost equally to that of bellozane godolphin and fitzedward the latter indeed was rather the tallest and to him she thought the figure bore the greatest resemblance yet he had taken leave of her ten days before she left london and told her he was going down to mr percivals in berkshire where as he was very anxious to hear of lady adelina he had desired mrs stafford to write to him who had done so and had received an answer of thanks dated from thence before the departure of emmeline from london that fitzedward therefore should be the person seemed improbable yet it was hardly less so that a night ruffian should be on foot so long without any attempt to execute mischief or even the appearance of examining how it might be perpetrated after long consideration she determined that lest the first conjecture should be true she would speak to nobody of the stranger she had seen but would watch another night before she either terrified lady adelina with the apprehension of robbers or gave rise to conjectures in her and the servants of yet more disquieting tendency having taken this resolution and argued herself out of all those fears for her personal safety which might have enfeebled a less rational mind she met lady adelina at breakfast with her usual ease and almost with her usual chearfulness but she was pale and her eyes were heavy lady adelina remarked it with concern but emmeline making light of it imputed it intirely to the fatigue of her journey and when their breakfast was finished proposed a walk to this her friend assented and while she went to give some orders and to fetch the crape veil in which she usually wrapped herself for even her dress partook something of the mournful cast of her mind emmeline already equipped went into the lawn and saw plainly where the stranger had made his way thro the thick shrubs and where the flexible branches of a young larch were twisted away a laurel broken and that some deciduous trees behind them had lost all their lower leaves which having sustained the first frosts fell on the slightest violence she marked the place with her eye and determined to observe whether if he came again it was from thence emmeline now desired that madelon might come with them to wait on little william rather than his own maid as she understood english so ill that she would be no interruption to their discourse they then walked arm in arm together towards the sea and there lady adelina who now enjoyed the opportunity she had so long languished for opened to her sympathizing friend the sorrows of an heart struggling vainly with a passion she condemned and sinking under ineffectual efforts to vindicate her honour and eradicate her love she knew not that fitzedward had ever written to her godolphin well acquainted with his hand had kept the letter from her she knew not that he had applied to emmeline and tho she had torn herself from him and had vowed never again to write to him to name him to hear from him she involuntarily felt disposed to accuse him of neglect of ingratitude of cruelty for having never attempted to write to her or see her and added the poignant anguish of jealousy to the dreary horrors of despair that fitzedward was for ever lost to her she seemed to be convinced yet that he should forget her or attach himself to another seemed a torment so entirely insupportable that when her mind dwelt upon it as it perpetually did her reason was inadequate to the pain it inflicted and when she touched on that subject emmeline too evidently saw symptoms of that derangement of intellect to which she had once before been a melancholy witness with a mind thus unsettled and a heart thus oppressed the consequences of touching on the application of fitzedward to herself might as emmeline believed have the most alarming effect on lady adelina and she dared not therefore name it unless she had the concurrence of godolphin she only attempted to soothe and tranquillize her mind without giving her those assurances of his undiminished attachment which she thought might in the event only encrease her anguish if her brother remained inflexible on the other hand she forbore to remonstrate with her on the necessity there might be to forget him being too well convinced that the arguments which were to enforce that doctrine would be useless and perhaps appear cruel to a heart so deeply wounded as was that of the luckless lovely adelina but in pouring her sorrows into the bosom of her friend she appeared to find consolation the tender pity of emmeline was a balm to her wounded mind and growing more composed she began to discourse on the singular discovery emmeline had made and to enter with some interest into the affairs depending between her and the marquis of montreville and by questions aided by the natural frankness of emmeline at length became acquainted with the happy prospects which tho distant opened to godolphin this was the only information that seemed to have the power of suspending for a moment the weight of those afflictions which lady adelina suffered my brother then cried shemy dear godolphin will be happy and you my most amiable friend will constitute while you share his felicity ah fortunate thrice fortunate for ye both was the hour of your meeting for heaven and nature surely designed ye for each other fortunate too were those circumstances which divided my emmeline from delamere before indissoluble bonds enchained you for ever had it been otherwise had your guardian angel slumbered as mine did you too all lovely and deserving as you are would have been condemned to the bitterest of all lots and might have discovered all the excellence and worth of godolphin when your duty and your honour allowed you no eyes but for delamere your destiny is more happyyet not happier than you deserve oh may it quickly be fixed unalterably and long very long may it endure so shall your adelina for the little while she drags on a reluctant existence have something on which to lean for the alleviation of her sorrows and when she shall interrupt your felicity no longer by the sight of cureless calamity she will in full confidence entrust the sole tie she has on earth the dear and innocent victim of her fatal weakness to the compassionate bosoms of godolphin and his emmeline the tremulous voice and singular manner in which lady adelina uttered these words made emmeline tremble she now tried to divert the attention of her poor friend from dwelling too earnestly either on her own wretchedness or the promised felicity of her brother but as if exhausted by the mingled emotions of pain and pleasure she soon afterwards fell into a deep silence scarce attending to what was said and after a long pause she suddenly called to madelon in whose arms her little boy had fallen asleep and looking at him earnestly a moment took him from the maid and carried him towards the house emmeline more and more convinced of her partial intellectual derangement followed her dreading lest she should see it encrease without the power of applying any remedy before lady adelina reached the gate which opened from the cliffs to the lawn she was fatigued by her lovely burthen and forced to stop emmeline would then have taken him but she said no and sitting down on the ground held him in her lap till barret who had seen her from a window came out and took him from her to which as to a thing usual she consented and then walked calmly home with emmeline who extremely discomposed by the wildness of her manner was fearful of again introducing any interesting topic lest she should again touch those fine chords which were untuned in the mind of her unhappy friend and which seemed occasionally to vibrate with an acuteness that threatened the ruin of the whole fabric barret who afterwards came to assist her in dressing told her that within the last six weeks her lady had often been subject to long fits of absence sometimes of tears which generally ended in her snatching the child eagerly to her kissing him with the wildest fondness and that after having kept him with her some time and wept extremely she usually became rational and composed for the rest of the day chapter xii when emmeline met lady adelina at dinner she had the satisfaction to find her quite tranquil and easy as the afternoon proved uncommonly fine and emmeline was never weary of contemplating the scenery which surrounded them she willingly consented to lady adelinas proposal of another ramble that she might see some beautiful cliffs a little farther from the house than she had yet been there she was pleased to find that her fair friend seemed to call off her mind from its usual painful occupations to admire the charms which on one side a very lovely country and on the other an extensive sea view offered to their sight you can not imagine my emmeline said she how exquisitely beautiful the prospect is from the point of these rocks where we stand in the midst of summer now the sun more distant gives it a less glowing and rich lustre and reflects not his warm rays on the sea and on the white cliffs that hang over it here it was that indulging that melancholy for which i have too much reason i made while my brother was absent last summer some lines which if it was pleasant to repeat ones own poetry i would read to you as descriptive at once of the scene and the state of mind in which i surveyed it emmeline now earnestly pressing her to gratify the curiosity she had thus raised at length prevailed upon her to repeat the following sonnet far on the sands the low retiring tide in distant murmurs hardly seems to flow and oer the world of waters blue and wide the sighing summer wind forgets to blow as sinks the day star in the rosy west the silent wave with rich reflection glows alas can tranquil nature give me rest or scenes of beauty soothe me to repose can the soft lustre of the sleeping main yon radient heaven or all creations charms erase the written troubles of the brain which memory tortures and which guilt alarms or bid a bosom transient quiet prove that bleeds with vain remorse and unextinguishd love the season and the scene were brought by this description full on the mind of emmeline yet she almost immediately repented having pressed adelina to repeat to her what seemed to have led her again into her usual tract of sad reflection she fell as usual into one of her reveries and as they walked homewards said very little the rest of the evening however passed in a sort of mournful tranquillityadelina seemed to feel encreasing pleasure as she gazed on her friend and remembering all her goodness reflected on the happiness of her brother but this satisfaction was not of that kind which seeks to express itself in words and emmeline sensible of great anxiety for her and godolphin who would she knew be cruelly hurt by the relapse which he feared threatened his sister and busied in no pleasant conjectures about the person whom she had seen in the lawn was in no spirits for conversation nor did her thoughts when they wandered to other objects from those immediately before her bring home much to appease her anxiety that nothing had yet been heard of lord and lady westhaven was extremely disquieting she knew not that the marquis of montreville had received a letter for her under cover to him and that having sent it to mr crofts in another in order to be forwarded to her the latter had exercised his political talents and supposing it related to her claims on lord montreville and probably contained instructions for pursuing them and that therefore his lordship would be but little concerned if it never reached the place of its destination he had very composedly put it into the fire and undertook should it be enquired for to account for its failure without suffering the name of lord montreville to be called in question the marquis tho his conscience had been so long under the direction of sir richard crofts that it ought to have acquired insensibility as callous as his own yet found it sometimes a very troublesome companion and it often spoke to him so severely on the subject of his niece that he was more than once on the point of writing to her to say he was ready to make her the retribution to which his heart told him she had the clearest pretensions and which his fears whispered that a court of justice would certainly render her these qualms and these fears would inevitably have produced a restoration of the mowbray estate to its owner had they not been counteracted by the influence of the marchioness of montreville and sir richard crofts the marchioness now in declining health felt all the inefficacy of riches and all the fallacy of ambition yet could she not determine to relinquish one or to own that the other had but little power to confer happiness that emmeline mowbray whom she had despised and rejected should suddenly become heiress to a large fortune and that of that fortune her own children should be deprived that lord westhaven should be the instrument to assist her in this hateful transition and should interfere for this obscure orphan against the interest of the illustrious family into which he had married stung her to the soul and irritated the natural asperity of her temper already soured by the repeated defection of delamere and her own continual ill health till it was grown insupportable to others and injurious to herself since it aggravated all her complaints and put it out of the power of medicine to relieve her rather than encrease these maladies by opposition his lordship was content to yield to delay and while her haughtiness and violence withheld him on one hand from settling with his niece sir richard assailed him on the other with cool and plausible arguments and together they obliged him to have recourse to such expedients as gained time without his having much hope that he could finally detain the property of his late brother from his daughter who seemed likely to establish her right to its possession at once to indulge his avarice and quiet his conscience he would willingly have consented to pay her a considerable portion and to leave her right to the whole undecided but of such an accommodation there seemed no probability unless he could win over lord westhaven to his interest he thought however that there could be little doubt of his reuniting the mowbray estate with his own by promoting the marriage between emmeline and lord delamere which he had hitherto so strenuously opposed but this he knew must be the last resort not only because he was ashamed so immediately to avow a change of opinion in regard to emmeline which could have happened only from her change of circumstances but because the dislike which lady montreville had originally conceived towards her now amounted to the most determined and inveterate hatred bent on conversing fully with lord westhaven before he took any measures whatever either to detain or to restore the estate the marquis was desirous of seeing him immediately on his arrival in england and to precede any conversation he might hold with emmeline for this reason he kept back all information that related to his soninlaws return and tho he knew that the indisposition of lord delamere and his sister had kept lord westhaven at paris almost three weeks and that they were travelling only twenty miles a day from thence to calais he had withheld even this intelligence from the anxious emmeline lady frances crofts never feeling any great disposition to filial piety and having lost in the giddy career of dissipation the little sensibility she ever possessed was soon tired of attending on her mother at audley hall the fretful impatience or irksome lassitude which devoured a mind without resources and weary of itself in the melancholy gloom of a sick chamber soon disgusted and fatigued her she therefore left audley hall in october and after staying ten days or a fortnight in burlington street where she made an acquaintance with bellozane she went to pass the months that yet intervened before it was fashionable to appear in london at a villa near richmond which she had taken in the summer and fitted up with every ornament luxury could invent or money purchase she retired not thither however to court the sylvan deities a set of friends of both sexes attended her bellozane was very handsome very lively very much a man of fashion lady frances who thought him no bad addition to her train invited him also bellozane became the life of the party and was soon so much at his ease in the family and so great a favourite with her ladyship at a very early period of their acquaintance that only her high rank there exempted her from those censures which in a less elevated condition would have fallen on her from the grave and sagacious personages who are so good as to take upon them the regulation of the world crofts detained by his office in london heard more than gave him any pleasure but like a wise and cautious husband he forebore to complain besides the fear of his wife which was no inconsiderable motive to silence he had the additional fear of the martial and fiercelooking french soldier before his eyes who talked in very bad english of such encounters and exploits as made the coldblooded politician shudder when on friday evenings after the business of his office was over he went down to richmond he now always found there this foreign adonis and beheld him with mingled hatred and horror tho he concealed both under the appearance of cringing and servile complaisance and when lady frances compared the narrowspirited and meanlooking crofts with the handsome animated gallant bellozane the poor husband felt all the disadvantages of the comparison and as certainly suffered for it scorning to dissimulate with a man whom she thought infinitely too fortunate in being allied to her on any terms and superior to the censures of a world the greater part of whom she considered as beings of another species from the daughter of the marquis of montreville her ladyship grew every day fonder of the chevalier and less solicitous to conceal her partiality she found too her vanity and inordinate self love gratified in believing that this elegant foreigner did justice to her superior attractions and had been won by them from that inclination for emmeline which had brought him to england a conquest snatched from her whom she had always considered at once with envy and contempt was doubly delightful and bellozane with all the volatility of his adopted country saw nothing disloyal or improper in returning the kind attentions of lady frances en attendant the arrival of emmeline with whom he was a good deal piqued for her having left london so abruptly without informing him whither she was gone he still preferred her to every other person but he was not therefore insensible to the kindness or blind to the charms of lady frances who was really very handsome and who with a great portion of the beauty inherited by the mowbray family possessed the junolike air as well as the high spirit of her mother in aid of these natural advantages every refinement of art was exhausted and by those who preferred its dazzling effects to the interesting and graceful simplicity of unadorned beauty lady frances dressed for the opera might have been esteemed more charming than emmeline in her modest muslin night gown or than the pensive madona which in her widows dress was represented by lady adelina these two friends after having passed a calm afternoon together retired early to their respective apartments emmeline who had a repeating watch given her by lord westhaven wound it up carefully and having bolted her chamber door lay down for a few hours being sure that the anxiety she felt would awaken her before the return of that on which the stranger had appeared the preceding night fatigue and long watching closed her eyes but her slumber was imperfect and suddenly awaking at some fancied noise she pressed her repeater and found it was half past three oclock this was about the time on which the man had appeared the night before and tho she felt some fear she had yet more curiosity to know whether he came again she arose softly therefore and went to the window which she did not venture to open but she had no occasion to look towards the shrubbery to watch the coming of the stranger he was already traversing the length of the house dressed as before and with his arms folded and his head bent towards the ground he slowly moved in the same pensive attitude emmeline tho now impressed with deeper astonishment summoned resolution narrowly to observe his air and figure had not his hat concealed his face the obscurity would not have allowed her to examine his features but tho the great coat he wore considerably altered the outline of his person she still thought she discerned the form of fitzedward his height and his walk confirmed this idea and the longer she observed him the more she was persuaded it was fitzedward himself this conviction was not unaccompanied by terror she wished to speak to him and to represent the indiscretion the madness of his thus risking the reputation of lady adelina and his own life or that of one of her brothers while the very idea of godolphins resentment and danger filled her mind with the most alarming apprehensions she determined then to open the window and speak to him yet if it should not be fitzedward at length she had collected the courage necessary and knowing that tho the whole family was yet fast asleep she could easily rouse them if the person to whom she spoke should not be known to her and gave her any reason for alarm she was on the point of lifting up the sash when the stranger put an end to her deliberations by hastily walking away to his former covert among the shrubs and she saw him no more emmeline wearied alike with watchfulness and uneasiness now went to bed having at length determined to keep barret on whose silence and discretion she could rely with her the next night and when the colonel appeared for the colonel she was sure it was to send her to him or at least make her witness to what she should herself say to him from the window the anxiety of her mind made her very low on the early part of the next day and lady adelina was still more so they dined however early and as the evening was clear and they had not been out in the morning lady adelina proposed their taking a short walk to the top of the hill behind the house which commanded a glorious view that emmeline had not seen but as it was cold they agreed to leave little william at home the grounds of godolphin behind the house consisted only of a small paddock divided from the kitchen garden by a dwarf wall and the copse which partly cloathed the hill and thro which a footpath went to a village about two miles beyond it the woody ground ceasing about half way up opened to a down which commanded the view they stood admiring it a few moments and then emmeline who could not for an instant help reflecting on what she had seen for two nights felt something like alarm at being so far from the house she complained therefore that it was cold and the evening at this season very short was already shutting in the wind blew chill and hollow among the half stripped trees as they passed thro the wood and the dead leaves rustled in the blast twas such a night as ossian might describe emmeline recollected the visionary beings with which his poems abound and involuntarily she shuddered at the gate that opened into the lawn lady adelina stopped as if she was tired she was talking of something godolphin had done and emmeline who on that subject was never weary of hearing her turned round and they both leaned for a moment against the gate looking up the wood walk from which they had just descended the veil of lady adelina was over her face but emmeline less wrapped up suddenly saw the figure which had before visited the garden descending in exactly the same posture down the pathway which was rather steep he seemed unknowingly to follow it without looking up and was soon so near them that emmeline losing at once her presence of mind clasped her hands and exclaimedgood god who is this what said lady adelina looking towards him by this time he was within six paces of the gate and sprung forward at the very moment that she knew him and fell senseless on the ground emmeline unable to save her was in a situation but little better fitzedward for it was really himself knelt down by her and lifted her up but she was without any appearance of life and he who had no intention of rushing thus abruptly into her presence was too much agitated to be able to speak ah why would you do this sir said emmeline in a tremulous voice what can i do with her added she merciful heaven what can be done how could you be so cruel so inconsiderate dont talk to me said hedont reproach me i am not able to bear it i suffer too much already have you no salts have you nothing to give her emmeline now with trembling hands searched her pockets for a bottle of salts which she sometimes carried she luckily had it and in another pocket some hungary water with which she bathed the temples of her friend who still lay apparently dead she remained some moments in that situation and emmeline had time to reflect which she did with the utmost perturbation on what would be the consequence of this interview when she recovered her recollection she dreaded lest the sight of fitzedward should totally unsettle her reason she dreaded lest godolphin should know he had clandestinely been there and she concluded it were better to persuade him to leave them before the senses of lady adelina returned how fearfully long she continues in this fainting fit cried she and yet do i dread seeing her recover from it you dread itand why dread it indeed i do when her recollection returns it may yet be worse you know not how nearly gone her intellects have at times been and the least emotion may render her for ever a lunatic it is the cruelty of her brother sternly replied fitzedward that has driven her to this his rigid conduct has overwhelmed her spirits and broken her heart but now since we have met we part not till i hear from herself whether she prefers driving me to desperation or quitting in the character i can now offer her the cold and barbarous godolphin do not ah pray do not attempt to speak to her now let me try to get her home and when she is better able to see you indeed i will send to you can you then suppose i will leave her but perhaps she is already gone she seems to be deadquite dead and cold nothing but terror now lent emmeline strength to continue chafing her temples and her hands in another moment or two the blood began to circulate and soon after with a deep sigh lady adelina opened her eyes for pitys sake said emmeline in a low voicefor pitys sake do not speak to her then addressing herself to her she saidlady adelina are you better yes do you think i can assist you home she shall not be hurried said fitzedward ah save me save me exclaimed she faintly shriekingsave me and clasping her arms round emmeline she attempted to rise am i then grown so hateful to you said fitzedward as he assisted and supported herthat for one poor moment you will not allow me to approach you will no penitence no sufferings obtain your pity take me away emmeline cried she in a hurried mannerah take me quick away godolphin will come he will come indeedlet us go homego home before he finds us here it is as i said exclaimed fitzedward her brother has terrified her into madness but emmeline now making an effort to escape falling into a condition as deplorable as was her friends said with some firmnessmr fitzedward i must entreat you to say nothing about her brother it is a topic of all others least likely to restore her adelina still clung to her and putting away fitzedward with her hand laid her head on the shoulder of emmeline who saidi fancy you can walk shall we go towards home lady adelina without speaking and still motioning with her hand to fitzedward to leave her moved on but so enfeebled was she that in the very attempt she had again nearly fallen emmeline being infinitely too much frightened to lend her much assistance she can not walk cried fitzedward yet will not let me support her will you miss mowbray accept my arm perhaps it may enable you to guide better the faultering steps of your friend emmeline thought that at all events it was better to get her into the house and therefore taking in silence the arm that fitzedward offered her she proceeded across the lawn lady adelina appeared to exert herself she quickened her pace a little and they were soon at a small gate which opened in a wire fence near the house to keep the cattle immediately from the windows here emmeline determined to make another effort on fitzedward to persuade him to leave them now said she we shall do very well had you not better quit us he seemed disposed to obey when mrs barret who had seen them from the door where she had been watching the return of her lady advanced hastily towards them and said to emmelinedear maam i am so glad you and my lady are come in the captain is quite frightened at your being out so late the captain exclaimed emmeline yes maam the captain has been come in about two minutes he is but just seeing master godolphin and then was coming out to meet you take hold of your lady barret cried emmeline barret ran forward but lady adelina whom the terror of her brothers return at such a moment had again entirely overcome was already lifeless in the arms of fitzedward and emmeline whose first idea was to go in and prevent godolphin from coming out to meet them could get no farther than the door where breathless and almost senseless she was only prevented from falling by leaning against one of the pillars your lady is in a fainting fit mrs barret said fitzedward pray assist her the woman at once knew his voice and saw the situation of her lady and terrified both by the one and the other screamed aloud godolphin caressing his nephew in the parlour heard not the shriek but a footman who was crossing the hall ran out and flying by emmeline ran to the group beyond her where as mrs barret still wildly called for help for lady adelina he proposed to fitzedward to carry her ladyship into the house which they together immediately did this was what emmeline most dreaded but there was no time for remonstrance as they passed her at the door she put her hand upon fitzedwards arm and criedoh stop for gods sake stop why stop said he no nothing shall now detain me i am determined and must go on she saw indeed that godolphins being in the house only made him more obstinately bent to enter it the door of the parlour now opened and godolphin saw with astonishment inexpressible his sister to all appearance dead in the arms of fitzedward and emmeline as pale and almost as lifeless following her who silently and with fixed eyes sat down near the door what can be the meaning of this exclaimed godolphin miss mowbraymy emmelinemy adelina the child with whom godolphin had been at play reached out his little arms to lady adelina whom they had placed on a sopha godolphin sat him down upon it and not knowing where to fix his own attention he looked wildly first at his sister and then at emmeline while fitzedward totally regardless of him knelt by the side of lady adelina and surveyed her and the little boy with an expression impossible to be described for mercys sake tell me godolphin as he took the cold and trembling hands of emmeline in hisfor mercys sake tell me what all this means is my sister my poor adelina dead i hope not you are yourself almost terrified to death your hands tremble tell me i conjure you tell me what you have met with and to what is owing the extraordinary appearance of mr fitzedward here that or any farther enquiry mr godolphin has to make which may relate to me said fitzedward sternly i shall be ready at any other time to answer but now it appears more necessary to attend to this dear injured creature injured sir cried godolphin turning angrily towards himdo you come hither to tell me your crimes or to triumph in their consequence oh for the love of heaven said emmeline with all the strength she could collect let this proceed no farther consider added she lowering her voice the servants are in the room reflect on the consequence of what you say let every body but barret go out said godolphin aloud the child whose usual hour of going to rest was already past had crept up to his mother heedless of the people who surrounded her and had dropped asleep on her bosom should i take master sir enquired the nursery maid of godolphin leave him answered he fiercely excess of terror now operated to restore in some measure to emmeline the presence of mind it had deprived her of she found it absolutely necessary to exert herself and advancing towards lady adelina by whose side fitzedward still knelt she took one of her handsi hope said she to barret your lady is coming to she is less pale and her pulse is returning colonel fitzedward would it not be better for you now to leave us i must first speak to lady adelina impossible you can not speak to her tonight nor can i leave her madam unless she herself dismisses meleave her thus weak and languid to meet perhaps on my account reproach and unkindness reproach and unkindness mr fitzedward said godolphin in a passionate tonereproach and unkindness do me the favour to say from whom you apprehend she may receive such treatment from the cruel and unrelenting brother who has persisted in wishing to divide us even after heaven itself has removed the barrier between us sir replied godolphin with a stern calmnessin this house and in miss mowbrays presence you may say any thing with impunity and i may bear this language even from the faithless destroyer of my sister fitzedward now starting from his knees looked the defiance he was about to utter when lady adelina drew a deep and loud sigh and barret exclaimedfor gods sake gentlemen do not go on with these high words my lady is coming to but this sort of discourse will throw her again into her fits worse than ever pray let me entreat of you both to be pacified i insist upon it said emmeline that you are calm or it will not be in my power to stay i must leave you indeed i must mr godolphin if you would not see me expire with terror and entirely kill your sister you must be cool she was indeed again deprived nearly of her breath and recollection by the fear of their instantly flying to extremities lady adelina now opened her eyes and looked round her but there was wildness and horror in them and she seemed rather to see the objects than to have any idea of who were with her the child however was always present to her my dear boy here cried she faintly poor fellow he is asleep shall i take him from you maam asked her woman oh no i will put him to bed myself she then again reposed her head as if fatigued and sighed twas all said she long foreseen but destiny they say must be fulfilled and fate will have its way i wish i had not been the cause of his death however of whose death dear madam said barret nobody is dead nobody indeed did i not hear him groan and see him die did not he tell me i know not what of my lord westhaven i shall remember it all distinctly tomorrow she now rested again profoundly sighing and emmeline beckoning to fitzedward and godolphin took them to the other end of the room where the arm of the sopha she reclined on concealed them from her view pray said she addressing herself to them both pray leave her then recollecting that she dared not trust them together she addedno dont both go at once but indeed it is absolutely necessary to have her kept quite quiet and got to bed as soon as possible i believe it is answered godolphin poor adelina her dreadful malady is returned it is indeed said emmeline i have seen it too evidently approaching for some days and this last shockshe stopped and repented she had said so much mr fitzedward cried godolphin will you walk with me into another room certainly oh no no exclaimed emmeline with quickness they were going out together but taking an arm of each she eagerly repeated oh no no not together the imagination of lady adelina was now totally disordered she had risen and carrying the child in her arms walked towards her brother who in traversing the apartment with uneasy steps was by this time near the door while fitzedward was at the other end of the room where emmeline was trying to persuade him to quit the house lady adelina supported by her maid and trembling under the weight of the infant she clasped to her bosom stepped along as quickly as her weakness would allow and putting her hand on godolphins arm she cried in a slow and tremulous mannerstay william i have something to say to you before you go lord westhaven you know is coming and you have promised that he shall not kill me i may however die and i rather believe i shall for since this last sight i am strangely ill you and emmeline will take care of my poor boy will ye not had fitzedward livednay do not look so angry for now he can not offend youhad poor fitzedward lived he would perhaps have taken him but now i must depend on emmeline who has promised to be good to him they say she will have a great fortune too and therefore i need not fear that you will find my child burthensome burthensome cried godolphin good god adelina well well be not offended only you know when people come to have a family of their own the child of another may be reckoned an incumbrance i know that now you love my william dearly but then you know it will be another thing gracious heaven exclaimed godolphin what can have made her talk in this manner reason in madness said fitzedward advancing towards her her son however shall be an incumbrance to nobody emmeline now grasping his hand implored him not to speak to her lady adelina neither heard or noticed him but again addressing herself to her brother said with a mournful sighand now since i have told you what was upon my mind i will go put my little boy to bed good night to you dear william you and miss mowbray will remember she then walked out of the room and calmly took the way to her own attended by her maid emmeline not daring to leave together these two ardent spirits irritated against each other remained trembling with them hoping by her presence to prevent their animosity from blazing forth and to prevail upon them to part they both continued for some time to traverse the room in gloomy silence at length fitzedward stopped and saidat what hour tomorrow sir may i have the honour of some conversation with you at whatever hour you please sirthe earlier however the more agreeable at seven oclock sir i will be with you if you please at that hour i will be ready to receive your commands fitzedward then took his hat and bowing to emmeline wished her a good night and left the room starting from her chair she followed him into the hall and shut the parlour door after her fitzedward cried she detaining him and speaking in an half whisperfitzedward hear me do you design to kill me to kill you replied he no surely then do not go till you have heard me it is unpleasant to me to stay in godolphins house after what has just passed but as you please she led him into a little breakfast room and regardless of being without light shut the door tell me said she before i die with terrortell me with what intention you come tomorrow simply to have a positive answer from mr godolphin if he will together with his brother allow me when the usual mourning is over to address their sister with proposals of marriage which in fact they have no right to prevent and if mr godolphin refuses what if he refuses i shall take my son into my own care and wait till lady adelina will herself exert that freedom which is now hers godolphin doats on the child nothing i am persuaded will induce him to part with it not part with it he must nay he shall pray be calmpray be quiet stay yet a few monthsa few weeks not a day not an hour good god what can be done mischief will inevitably happen i am sorry replied fitzedward that you are thus made uneasy but i can not recede and my life has not been pleasant enough lately to make me very solicitous about the event of my explanation with mr godolphin conscious however that he has some reason to complain of me i do not wish to increase it i mean to keep my temper if i can but if he suffers his to pass the bounds which one gentleman must observe towards another i shall not consider myself as the aggressor or as answerable for the consequences but why oh why would you come hither wherefore traverse the garden of a night and suffer appearances to be so much against you and what is yet worse against lady adelina who told you i have done sogodolphin no he was you well know absent but i saw you myself with terror i saw you and meditated how to speak to you alone when our unhappy meeting in the wood this evening put an end to all my contrivances yet i had no intention of terrifying you or of abruptly rushing into the presence of adelina it is true that for some nights past i have walked under the window where she and my child sleep for i could not sleep and it was a sort of melancholy enjoyment to me to be near the spot which held all i have dear on earth as i pass at the ale house where i lodge as a person hiding in this island from the pursuit of creditors my desire of concealment did not appear extraordinary i have often lingered among the rocks and copses and seen adelina and my child with you last night i came out in the dusk and was approaching to conceal myself near the house in hopes that as you love walking late and alone i might have found an opportunity of speaking to you and of concerting with you the means of introducing myself to her without too great an alarm would to heaven you had but now since all this has happened consent to put off this meeting with godolphin do not meet at least tomorrow i entreat that you will not on all subjects but this said he as he opened the dooron all subjects but this miss mowbray knows she may command me but this is a point from which i can not without infamy recede and in which she must forgive me if all my veneration and esteem for her goodness and tenderness does not induce me to desist he then went into the hall and by the lamp which burnt there opened himself the door into the garden and hastily walked away while the trembling and harrassed emmeline finding him inflexible went back to godolphin with very little hopes that she should with him have better success chapter xiii on entering the room emmeline sat down without speaking how is adelina my dearest miss mowbray i know not you have not then been with her no were it not best to enquire after her certainly i will go immediately but come to me againi have much to say to you emmeline then went up stairs she found that the composing medicine which barret had been directed to keep always by her had been liberally administered and that her lady was got into bed and was already asleep barret sat by her deep sighs and convulsive catchings marked the extreme agitation of her spirits after she was no longer conscious of it herself with this account emmeline returned in great uneasiness to godolphin i thank heaven said he that she is at least for some moments insensible of pain now my emmeline for surely i may be allowed to say my emmeline sit down and try to compose yourself i can not bear to see you thus pale and trembling he led her to a seat and placed himself by her gazing with extreme concern on her face pallid as it was and expressive only of sorrow and anxiety whence is it said she after a pause of some moments that i see you here did i not come hither on the assurance you gave me that you would long be detained in or near london by the business of your sister i certainly did say so but i could not then foresee what happened on the sunday after you left london has then any thing happened the return of lord and lady westhaven with lord delamere are they all well tolerably so but my brother is very anxious to see adelina and expects you with little less solicitude he could not think of giving lady westhaven the trouble of such a journey nor could he now leave her without being unhappy i therefore at his pressing request came myself to fetch you both to london and do you mean that we should begin our journey tomorrow i meant it certainly till the events of this evening made me doubtful how far my sister herself may be in a situation to bear change of place and variety of objects or being able whether she may chuse to leave to me the direction of her actions ah impute not to lady adelina the meeting with fitzedward it was entirely accidental its suddenness overcame her and threw her into the way in which you saw her and what has a man to answer for who thus comes to insult his victim and to rob her of the little tranquillity time may have restored to her indeed i think you injure poor fitzedward fondly attached to your sister he has no other wish or hope than to be allowed to address her when the time of her mourning for mr trelawny is expired for this permission he intended to apply to you but the severity with which you ever received his advances discouraged him and he then in the hope of hearing that such an application would not be rendered ineffectual by her own refusal and languishing to see his son came hither not with any intention of forcing himself abruptly into the presence of lady adelina but to see me and induce me to intercede with her for an interview accident threw us in his way your sister fell senseless on the ground and when she did recover endeavoured to avoid him but she was too weak to walk home without other assistance than mine and i was compelled to accept for her that which fitzedward offered on hearing from barret that you was returned the terror which has ever pursued her lest you and fitzedward should meet as enemies again overcame her and occasioned the scene you must with so much astonishment have beheld has adelina had any previous knowledge of the proposals fitzedward intends to make none i believe in the world do you know whether they have ever corresponded i am convinced they have not there are objections in my mind insuperable objections to this alliance these however i must talk over with the colonel himself not hostilely i hope surely you have too much regard for the unhappy adelina to give way now to any resentment you may have conceived against him or if that does not influence you think of what i must suffer she knew not what she had said hardly what she intended to say enchanting softness exclaimed godolphin in a transportis then the safety of godolphin so dear to that angelic bosom you know it but too well but if my quiet is equally dear to you promise me that if this meeting tomorrow must take place you will receive fitzedward with civility and hear him with patience remember on how many accounts this is necessary remember how many expressions there are which his profession will not allow him to hear without resentment that must end in blood yours is no common cause of enmity none of those trifling quarrels which daily send modern beaux into the field your characters are both high as military men and as gentlemen and your former intimacy must i know impress more deeply on the mind of each the injury or offence that either suppose they receive be careful then godolphin promise me you will be careful ah lovely emmeline more lovely from this generous tenderness than from your other exquisite perfections can i be insensible of the value of a life for which you interest yourself and shall i suffer any other consideration to come in competition with your peace you promise me then to be calm with fitzedward i do and while i remember his offence for can i forget while i suffer from it i will also recollect that you who have also suffered on the same account think him worthy of compassion and i will try to conquer at least to stifle my resentment but what shall we do with adelina that must depend on her situation in the morning i have greatly apprehended an unhappy turn in her intellects ever since my first coming the death of trelawny far from appearing to have relieved her by removing the impediment to her union with fitzedward seems rather to have rendered her more wretched continually agitated by contending passions she was long unhappy in the supposition that fitzedward had obeyed her when she desired him to forget her since trelawnys decease as she has more fearlessly allowed her thoughts to dwell on him she has suffered all the anxiety of expecting to hear from him and all the bitterness of disappointment and i could plainly perceive that she was still debating with herself whether if he did apply to her she should accept him or by a violent effort of heroism determine to see him no more this conflict is yet to come judge whether in the frame of mind in which you see her she is equal to it and whether any additional terror for you and for him will not quite undo her alas far from aggravating by pursuing your resentment anguish so poignant try rather to soothe her sorrows and assist her determination and whatever that determination may be when it is once made she may perhaps be restored to health and to tranquillity indeed i will do all you dictate my loveliest friend surely i should ill deserve the generosity you have shewn to me were i incapable of feeling for others and particularly for my sister but wherefore that air of defiance which mr fitzedward thought it necessary to assume he seemed to come more disposed to insult than to conciliate the family of lady adelina alas do you make no allowance for the perturbed situation of his mind when he saw the woman he adores to all appearance dead and for the first time beheld the poor little boy he looked upon you as one who desires to tear from him for ever these beloved objects and forgetting that he was the aggressor thought only of the injury which he supposed you intended there is indeed some apology for the asperity of his manner and perhaps i was in some measure to blame generous candid considerate emmeline how does your excellent heart teach you to excuse those weaknesses you do not feel and to pity and to forgive errors which your own perfect mind makes it impossible for you to commit ah how heavily is your tenderness perpetually taxed here it is suffering from the sight of adelinain town it will have another object in the unfortunate delamere did you not tell me he was in tolerable health alas what is bodily health when the mind is ill at ease the anxiety of delamere to see you to hear his destiny from yourself is uneasy even to me who feel my own exquisite happiness in knowing what that destiny must be i look with even painful commiseration on this singular young man yet from passions so violent and obstinacy so invincible i must have rejoiced that miss mowbray has escaped even tho her preference of the fortunate godolphin had not rendered his lot the most happy that a human being can possess since you are so good said emmeline faintly for she was quite exhausted to compassionate the situation of mind of delamere you will i think see the humanity of concealing from himthat she could find no term that she liked to express her meaning and stopped that he has a fortunate rival said godolphin no dearest emmeline i hope i am incapable of such a triumph till poor delamere is more at ease i am content to enjoy the happiness of knowing your favourable opinion without wishing by an insulting display of it to convince him he has for ever thrown a pearl away richer than all his tribe yet i am sure you will think it still more cruel to give him hope i will tell you all my weakness while i see you here all benignity and goodness to me i feel for lord delamere infinite pity but were you to receive him with your usual sweetness to give him many of those enchanting smiles and to look at him with those soft eyes as if you tenderly felt his sorrows i am not sure whether the most unreasonable jealousy would not possess me and whether i should not hate him as much as i now wish him well that were to be indeed unreasonable and to act very inconsistently with your natural candour and humanity i will not think so ill of you as to believe you you know i must of course often see lord delamere but after the avowal you have extorted from me surely i need not repeat that i shall see him only as my friend godolphin then kissed her hands in rapture and for a few moments forgot even his concern for lady adelina emmeline now wished to break off the conversation and he at length allowed her to leave him after having enquired of barret after her mistress who was happily in a calmer sleep she retired to her own room where she hoped to have a few hours of repose but notwithstanding the promises of godolphin she felt as the hour of the morning approached on which he was to meet fitzedward that anxiety chased away sleep and again made her suffer the cruellest suspense the heart of godolphin glowing with the liveliest sense of his own happiness yet felt with great keenness the unfortunate situation of his sister he began to doubt whether he had any right to perpetuate her wretchedness and whether it were not better to leave it to herself to decide in regard to fitzedward the delicacy of his honour made him see an infinity of objections to their marriage which to common minds might appear chimerical and romantic to that part of his own family who were yet ignorant of her former indiscretion as he could not urge his reasons his opposition of fitzedward must seem capricious and unjust lord westhaven must therefore either be told that which had hitherto with so much pains been concealed from him or he must determine to refer fitzedward entirely to lady adelina herself and on this after long deliberation he fixed exactly as the clock struck seven fitzedward was at the door and was introduced into godolphins study who was already up and waiting for him emmeline still full of apprehension had arisen before six and hearing lady adelina was still asleep had gone down stairs and waited with a palpitating heart in the breakfast room she was glad to distinguish at their first meeting the usual salutations of the morning she listened but tho the rest of the house was profoundly silent she could not hear their conversation or even the tone in which it was carried on it was not however loud and she drew from thence a favourable omen near two hours passed during which breakfast was carried in to them and as the servant passed backwards and forwards she heard parts of sentences which assured her that then at least they were conversing on indifferent subjects now therefore the agitation of her spirits began to subside and she dared even to hope that this meeting would prove the means of reconciliation rather than of producing those fatal effects she had dreaded in about a quarter of an hour however after they had finished their breakfast they went out and crossed the lawn together then again her heart failed her and without knowing exactly what she intended she took the little boy whom the maid had just brought to her and walked as quickly as possible after them before she could overtake them they had reached the gate and in turning to shut it after him godolphin saw her and both together came hastily back to meet her at the same moment the child putting out his hands to godolphin called him papa as he had been used to do and fitzedward snatching him up kissed him tenderly while his eyes were filled with tears godolphin took the hand of emmeline why this terror why this haste said he observing her to be almost breathless i thoughti imaginedi was afraid answered she not knowing what she said be not alarmed said godolphinwe go together as friends and godolphin interrupted fitzedward is again the same noble minded godolphin i once knew and have always loved let us say then cried emmeline no more of the pastlet us look forward only to the future and the happiness of that future at least as far as it relates to me depends dearest miss mowbray on you on me godolphin wishes me not now to see his sister i have acquiesced he wishes me even to refrain from seeing her till she has been six months a widow with this also i have complied but as it is not in my power to remain thus long in a suspence so agonizing as that i now endure he allows me to write to her and refers wholly to herself my hopes and my despair ah generous lovely emmeline you can influence the mind of your friend when she is calm give her the letter i will send to you and if you would save me from a life of lingering anguish to which death is preferable procure for me a favourable answer emmeline could not refuse a request made by fitzedward which godolphin seemed not to oppose she therefore acquiesced and saw him after he had again tenderly caressed the child depart with godolphin who desired her to return to the house in order to await lady adelinas rising where he would soon join her with an heart lightened of half the concern she had felt on this melancholy subject she now went to the apartment of her poor friend who was just awakened from the stupor rather than the sleep into which the soporifics she had taken had thrown her with an heavy and reluctant eye she looked round her as if hopeless of seeing the image now always present to her imagination emmeline approached her with the child she seemed happy to see them and desiring her to sit down by the bed side saidtell me truly what has happened have i taken any medicine that has confused my head or how happens it that i appear to have been in a long and most uneasy dream wild and half formed images still seem to float before my eyes and when i attempt to make them distinct i am but the more bewildered and uneasy think not about it then till the heaviness you complain of is gone off tell me emmeline have i really only dreamed or was a stranger here yesterday i thought that suddenly i saw fitzedward thin pale emaciated looking as if he were unhappy and then as it has of late often happened i lost at once all traces of him and in his place godolphin came and i know not what else it is all confusion and terror emmeline now considered a moment and then concluded that it would be better to relate distinctly to her since she now seemed capable of hearing it all that had really passed the preceding evening than to let her fatigue her mind by conjectures and enfeeble it by fears she therefore gave her a concise detail of what had happened from the accidental meeting with fitzedward to the parting she had herself just had with him in the garden she carefully watched the countenance of lady adelina while she was speaking and saw with pleasure that tho excessively agitated she melted into tears and heard with a calmer joy than she had dared to hope the certainty of fitzedwards tender attachment and the unhoped for reconciliation between him and her brother having indulged her tears some time she tenderly pressed the hand of emmeline and said in a faint voice that she found herself unable to rise and meet godolphin till she had recovered a little more strength of mind and that she wished to be left alone emmeline rejoiced to find her so tranquil left her and rejoined godolphin who was by this time returned and who read in the animated countenance of emmeline that she had favourable news to relate to him of his sister while they enjoyed together the prospect of lady adelinas return to health and peace of which they had both despaired the natural chearfulness of emmeline which anxiety and affection had so long obscured seemed in some degree to return and feeling that she loved godolphin better than ever for that generous placability of spirit he had shewn to the repentant fitzedward she no longer attempted to conceal her tenderness or withhold her confidence from her deserving lover they breakfasted together and afterwards as lady adelina still wished to be alone they walked over the little estate which lay round the house and emmeline allowed him to talk of the improvements he meditated when she should become its mistress the pleasure however which lightened in her eyes and glowed in her bosom was checked and diminished when the image of delamere in jealousy and despair intruded itself and she could look forward to no future happiness for herself undashed with sorrow while he remained in a state of mind so deplorable when they returned into the house barret brought to godolphin the following note dearest and most generous godolphin i find myself unequal to the task of speaking on what has passed within these last twenty four hours i wish still to see you but let our conversation turn wholly on lord westhaven of whom i am anxious to hear and spare me for the present on the subject which now blinds with tears your weak but grateful and affectionate adelina godolphin now assured her by emmeline that he would mention nothing that should give her a moments pain and that she should herself lead the conversation he soon after went up to her and emmeline in her dressing room and found her still calm tho very low and languid the name of fitzedward was carefully avoided but in the short time they were together godolphin observed that the eyes of lady adelina seemed on the entrance of any one into the room fearfully and anxiously to examine whether they brought the letter she had been taught to expect from fitzedward it was easy to see that she deeply meditated on the answer which she must give and that she felt an internal struggle which godolphin feared might again unsettle her understanding she was too faint to sit up long and desirous of being left entirely alone godolphin had for the rest of the day the happiness of entertaining emmeline apart he failed not to avail himself of it and drew from her a confession of her partiality towards him even from the first day of their acquaintance and long before she dared trust her heart to enquire into the nature of those sentiments with which it was impressed late in the evening a messenger arrived with the expected letter from fitzedward to convince godolphin of the perfect integrity with which he acted he sent him a copy of it adding that he was then on his road to london where he should await in painful solicitude the decision of lady adelina it was determined that emmeline should give her the letter the next morning and that if after reading it she retained the same languid composure which she had before shewn they should go in the evening to southampton and from thence proceed the following day to london where lord and lady westhaven so anxiously expected their arrival when emmeline delivered the letter lady adelina turned pale and trembled she left her to read it and on returning to her in about half an hour emmeline found her drowned in tears she seemed altogether unwilling to speak of the contents of the letter but assured emmeline that she was very well able to undertake the journey her brother proposed and she believed it would be rather useful than prejudicial to her as to the letter added she with a deep sigh it will not for some days be in my power to answer it every thing was by the diligence of godolphin soon prepared for their departure lady adelina her little boy emmeline and godolphin attended by their servants went the same evening to southampton from whence they began their journey the next day and resting one night at farnham arrived early on the following at the house lord westhaven had taken in grosvenor street chapter xiv the transports with which lord westhaven received his sister were considerably checked by her melancholy air and faded form the beauty and vivacity which she possessed when he last saw her were quite gone tho she was now only in her twenty second year and tears and sighs were the only language by which she could express the pleasure she felt at again seeing him imputing however this dejection entirely to her late unfortunate marriage his lordship expressed rather sorrow than wonder he admired the little boy whom he believed to be the son of godolphin and he met emmeline with that unreserved and generous kindness he had ever shewn her lady westhaven with the truest pleasure again embraced the friend of her heart and with delight emmeline met her but it was soon abated by the sanguine hopes she expressed that nothing would now long delay the happiness of lord delamere my emmeline said she will now be indeed my sister lord montreville and my mother can no longer oppose a marriage so extremely advantageous to their son she will forgive them for their long blindness and pardoning poor delamere for the involuntary error into which he was forced will constitute the happiness of him and of his family to this emmeline could only answer that she had not the least intention of marrying lady westhaven laughed at that assertion and she foresaw a persecution preparing for her on behalf of delamere which was likely to give her greater uneasiness than she had yet suffered from any event of her life lord westhaven as soon as they grew a little composed took an opportunity of leaving the rest of the party and went into his dressing room where he sent for emmeline well my lovely cousin said he when she was seated i have seen lord montreville on your business i can not say that his lordship received me with pleasure but some allowances must be made for a man who loves money on finding himself obliged to relinquish so large an estate and to refund so large a sum as he holds of yours i hope however you my lord have had no dispute on my account with the marquis oh none in the world what he thought i had no business to enquire what he said was not much as he committed the arguments against you to sir richard crofts who talked very long and as far as i know very learnedly he spoke like a lawyer and a politician i cut the matter short by telling him that i should attend to nothing but from an honest man and a gentleman that was severe my lord oh he did not feel it wrapped in his own selfsufficiency and too rich to recollect the necessity of being honest he still persisted in trying to persuade me that nothing should be done in regard to restoring your estate till all the deeds had been examined as he had his doubts whether allowing your fathers marriage to be established great part of the landed property is not entailed on the heirs male in short he only seemed desirous of gaining time and giving trouble but the first i was determined not to allow him and to shorten the second i took mr newton with me the next day and desired sir richard if he could prove any entail to produce his proofs for that he had an evasion readyhe had not had time to examine the deeds which i find are all in his hands we however were better prepared mr newton produced the papers that authenticate your birth he offered to bring a witness who was present when mr mowbray was married to miss stavordale nay even the clergyman who performed the ceremony at paris and who is found to be actually living in westmoreland the hand writing of your father is easily proved and mr newton summing up briefly all the corroborating testimonies that exist of your right to the mowbray estate concluded by telling lord montreville that at the end of two days he should wait upon his lordship for his determination whether he would dispute it in a court of law or settle it amicably with me on behalf of his niece newton then left us and i desired your uncle to allow me a few moments private conversation which as he could not refuse it obliged old crofts and that formal blockhead his son to leave us alone together i then represented to him how greatly his character must suffer should the affair become public that tho i believed myself he was really ignorant of the circumstances which gave you from the moment of your fathers death an undoubted claim to the whole of his fortune yet that the world will not believe it but will consider him as a man so cruelly insatiable so shamefully unjust as to take advantage of a defenceless orphan to accumulate riches he did not want and had no right to enjoy i added that if notwithstanding he chose to go into court he must excuse me if i forgot the near connection i had with him and appeared publicly as the assertor of your claim and of course as his enemy the marquis seemed very much hurt at the peremptory style in which i thought myself obliged to speak he declined giving any positive answer saying only that he must consult his wife and his son what the former said i know not but the latter generous in his nature and adoring you protested to his father that he would himself as your next nearest relation join in the suit against him if the estate was not immediately given up this spirited resolution of lord delamere and the opinions of several eminent lawyers whom sir richard was sent to consult at length brought lord montreville to a resolution before the expiration of the two days and last night i received a letter from him to say that he would on monday next account with you and put you in possession of your estate the management of which however and the care of your person he should reserve to himself till you were of age good god exclaimed emmeline trembling am i to meet my uncle on monday on this business yes and wherefore are you terrified at the idea of his angerhis hatred and of being compelled to live with the marchioness who always disliked me and now must detest me lord westhaven then assured her that he would be there to support her spirits that her uncle whatever might be his feelings would not express them by rudeness and asperity but would more probably be desirous of shewing kindness and seeking reconciliation yet that it was improbable he should propose her residing with lady montreville whose present state of health said he makes her incapable of leaving her room and for whose life the most serious apprehensions are entertained by her physicians emmeline thus reassured by lord westhaven on that subject and extremely glad to hear there would be no necessity for proceedings at law against her uncle returned with some chearfulness to the company where it was not encreased by the entrance of lord delamere which happened soon afterwards the very ill state of health indicated by his appearance extremely hurt her nor was she less affected by his address to her so expressive of the deepest anguish and regret she could not bear to receive him with haughtiness and coldness but mildly and with smiles returned the questions he put to her on common subjects his chagrin seemed to wear off and hope which emmeline as little wished to give again reanimated in some degree his melancholy countenance the next day and again the next he came to lord westhavens but emmeline cautiously avoided any conversation with him to which the whole company were not witnesses godolphin too was there her behaviour to him was the same and she would suffer neither to treat her with any degree of particularity godolphin who knew her reason for being reserved towards him was content and delamere who suspected not how dangerous a rival he had was compelled to remain on the footing only of a relation still hoping that time and perseverance might restore him to the happiness he had lost monday now arrived and emmeline was to wait on her uncle in berkleysquare at twelve oclock lord westhaven was ready emmeline was led by him into the coach they took up mr newton in lincolnsinn and then went to their rendezvous emmeline trembled as lord westhaven took her up stairs she remembered the terror she had once before suffered in the same house and when she entered the drawingroom could hardly support herself the marquis sir richard crofts his eldest son and lord delamere with two stewards and a lawyer were already there lord montreville coldly and gravely returned his nieces compliments sir richard malignantly eyed her from the corners of his eyes obscured by fat and crofts put on a look of pompous sagacity and consequential knowledge while lord delamere who would willingly have parted with the whole of his paternal fortune rather than with her seemed eager only to see a business concluded by which she was to receive benefit the lawyer in a set speech opened the business and expatiated largely on lord montrevilles great generosity lord westhaven looked over the accounts they appeared to have been made out right the title deeds of the estate were then produced the usual forms gone thro and papers signed which put emmeline in possession of them all passed with much silence and solemnity lord montreville said very little and ineffectually struggled to conceal the extreme reluctance with which he made this resignation when the business was completed emmeline advanced to kiss the hand of her uncle he saluted her but without any appearance of affection and coldly enquired how she intended to dispose of herself i propose my lord wholly to refer myself to your lordship as to my present residence or any other part of my conduct in which you will honour me with your advice i am sorry miss mowbray that the ill state of health of the marchioness prevents my having the pleasure of your company here however my daughter lady westhaven will of course be happy to have you remain with her till you have fixed on some plan of life or till you are of age not only till miss mowbray is of age my lord but ever both lady westhaven and myself should be gratified by having her with us said lord westhaven to this no answer was given and a long silence ensued emmeline felt distressed and at length saidi believe my lord lady westhaven will expect us they then rose and taking a formal leave of the marquis were allowed to leave the room lord delamere however took emmelines hand and as he led her to the coach implored her to indulge him with one moments conversation at any hour when they might not be interrupted but with great firmness yet with great sweetness she told him that she must be forgiven if she adhered to a resolution she had made to give no audience on the topic he wished to speak upon for many months to come almost two years exclaimed healmost two long years must i wait without knowing whether at the end of that time you will hear and pity me ah can you emmeline persist in such cruelty a good morning to your lordship said she as she got into the coach will you dine with us delamere asked lord westhaven yes and will go home with you now and dress in grosvenor street he then gave some orders to his servants and stepped into the coach i never was less disposed in my life said he to rejoin a party than i am to go back to those grave personages up stairs it is with the utmost difficulty i command my temper to meet those crofts on the most necessary business my blood boils my soul recoils at them pooh pooh cried lord westhaven you are always taking unreasonable aversions your blood is always boiling at some body or other i tell you the crofts are good necessary plodding people not too refined perhaps in points of honour nor too strict in those of honesty but excellent at the main chance as you may see by what they have done for themselves delamere then uttered against them a dreadful execration and went on to describe the whole family with great severity and with great truth till he at length talked himself into a violent passion and lord westhaven with difficulty brought him to be calm by the time they had set down mr newton and stopped at his own door at the same instant lord westhavens coach arrived there a splendid chariot most elegantly decorated came up also delamere struck with its brilliancy examined the arms and saw his own looking into it he changed countenance and said to lord westhavenupon my word crofts wife and your swiss relation de bellozane crofts wife aye i mean the woman who was once fanny delamere my sister come delamere forget these heartburnings and remember that she is your sister still i should be glad to know if it were worth my while to enquire what business bellozane has with her by this time they were in the house where lady frances and the chevalier arrived also lord westhaven met them with his usual politeness but delamere only slightly touched his hat to bellozane and sternly saluted his sister with your servant lady frances crofts he then passed them and went into lord westhavens dressing room while her ladyship regardless of his displeasure and affecting the utmost gaity talked and laughed with lord westhaven as she went up stairs emmeline followed them listening to the whispered compliments of bellozane with great coldness and lady frances entering with a fashionable flounce the drawing room where her sister was criedwell child how are you i beg your pardon for not coming to enquire after you sooner but i have had such crowds of company at belleville lodge that it was impossible to escape and heres this animal here this relation of your lords really haunts me so i was forced at last to bring him with me this speech was accompanied by a significant smile directed to bellozane lady westhaven checked by such an address from flying into the arms of her sister now expressed without any great warmth that she was glad to see her something like general conversation was attempted but lady frances who hoped to hide under the affectation of extravagant spirits the envy and mortification with which she contemplated the superior happiness of her sister soon engrossed the discourse entirely she talked only of men of the first rank or of beaux esprits their associates who had been down in parties to belleville lodge the name she had given to her villa near richmond and she repeated compliments which both the lords and the wits had made to her figure and her understanding when she seemed almost to have exhausted this interesting topic lady westhaven said as if merely for the sake of saying somethingmr crofts has been so obliging as to call here twice since we came to london but unluckily was not let in pray how does he do mr crofts oh i know very little of him at this time of the year we never meet he lives you know in burlington street and i live at belleville and if he comes thither as he sometimes does of a friday or saturday he finds me too much engaged to know whether he is there or not i believe tho he is very well and i think the last time i saw him he was nearly as lively and amusing as he usually is dont you think he was bellozane o assurement oui replied the chevalier sneeringly monsieur croff a toujours beaucoup de vivacitécest un homme fort amusant ce monsieur croff lady westhaven disgusted shocked and amazed had no power to take any share in such a dialogue and lady frances went on well but now i assure you augusta im going to be most uncommonly good and am coming tho tis a terrible heavy undertaking to pass a whole week without company with mon tres cher mari in burlingtonstreet nay i will go still farther and make a family party with you to the play which i generally detest of all things that is being really very kind said lady westhaven but since you are so tenderly disposed towards your own family would it not be well if you were to enquire after my mother you know i suppose how very ill she is how much worse tis feared she may be yes i shall certainly call replied lady frances with the utmost sang froid before i go home but as to her illness you are frightened at nothing she has only her old complaints her old complaints and are not they enough if i were in a situation to be useful to her or even as it is if lord westhaven would permit me i should certainly think it my duty constantly to attend her probably you might and it is equally probable that it would be of no use if you did she has brackley and all her own people about her and no more could be done for her even tho you were to hazard your precious life or if i who you know would not risk by it that of an heir to an earldom should sacrifice my ease and my friends to attend her the unfeeling malignity of this speech was so extremely distressing to lady westhaven that she could hardly command her tears lord westhaven saw her emotion and said augusta my love your sister is too brilliant for you you have not acquired that last polish of high life which quite effaces all other feelings nor will you perhaps ever arrive at it god forbid that i ever should cried lady westhaven unable to conceal her indignation poor thing said lady frances with the most unblushing assuranceyou have curious ideas of domestic felicity and its a thousand pities that instead of being what you are destiny had not made you the snug notable wife of a country parson with three or four hundred a yearyou would have been pure and happy to drive about in a one horse chaise make custards walk tame about the house and bring the good man a baby every year but really you are now quite out of your element she then rang the bell for her carriage which being soon ready she gaily wished her sister good day and the chevalier handed her down stairs where as she descended she said loud enough to be heard sil ya une chose au monde que je deteste plus quun notre cest la tristesse dune societé comme cela the chevalier assented with his lips but his heart and his wishes were fled towards emmeline he was however so engaged with her proud and insolent rival that he no longer dared openly to avow his predilection for her and lady frances seemed so sure of the strength of that attachment which was her disgrace that she brought him on purpose where emmeline was to shew how little she apprehended his defection lord westhaven after pausing a second ran down stairs after them and just as bellozane was stepping into the chariot took him by the arm and begged to speak to him for two minutes he apologized to lady frances and they went together into a room where lord westhaven with all the warmth which his relationship authorized remonstrated against his stay in england represented the expence and uneasiness it must occasion to the good old baron and above all exhorted him to fly immediately from the dangerous society of lady frances crofts bellozane received this advice from his cousin with a very ill grace he said that he could not discover why his lordship assumed an authority over him or pretended either to blame his past conduct or dictate his future that he came to england a stranger brought thither by his honourable passion for miss mowbray which he had a right to pursue but that mr godolphin who was his only relation then in england had either from accident or design shewn him very little attention while lady frances had with the most winning honeteté invited him to her house and supplied the want of that hospitality which his own family had not afforded him and that infinitely obliged as he was to her he should ill brook any reflection on a woman of honour who was his friend but my lord added he if your lordship will allow me to visit here as miss mowbrays favoured lover i will not only drop the acquaintance of lady frances but will put myself entirely under your lordships direction lord westhaven piqued and provoked answeredthat he had no power whatever to direct miss mowbray and if he had should never advise her to receive him be assured monsieur le chevalier that you have no chance of ever being acceptable to her and you must think no more of her bellozane equally impatient of advice and contradiction burst from him and went back to lady frances in a very ill humour delamere who had been dressing while his eldest sister remained now joined lady westhaven and emmeline in the drawing room thither also came lady adelina who during the five days they had been in town had not been well enough till this day to dine below she was now languid and faint and obliged to retire as soon as the cloth was removed to her own room emmeline attended her and when they were alone together she complained of finding herself every day more indisposed the air of london said she is not good for my child i can not help fancying he droops already and the noise of a house where there are unavoidably so many visitors and such a multitude of servants is too much for my spirits as lord westhaven is desirous of my staying in london till my sister clancarryl arrives that we may meet all together after being so many years divided i will not press my return to east cliff but i wish he would allow me to go to some village near london where i may occasionally enjoy solitude and silence for i have that upon my heart emmeline that demands both emmeline communicated her wish to godolphin the same evening who undertook to settle it with lord westhaven as his sister desired and the next day lady adelina and her little boy removed to highgate where her brother had procured her a handsome lodging and he quitting those he usually occupied in town went to reside with her after having been there a few days she sent to emmeline the following letter which she desired might be delivered by her own hand to the honourable george fitzedward i have thus long forborne to answer your letter because i have not till now been able to collect that strength of mind which is necessary when i am to obey the inexorable duty that tears me from you for ever that you yet love me well enough to solicit my hand is i own most soothing and consolatory but where fitzedward is the lethean cup without which you can not esteem mewithout which i can not esteem myself no i am not worthy the honour of being your wife it is fit my fault be punishedpunished by the cruel obligation it lays me under of renouncing the man i love fitzedward i will not dissemble i can not if i would my affection for you is become a part of my existence and can end but in the grave under the dread of your infidelity or your danger my reason was too weak to support me now that i have no longer any apprehensions of either my reason is returnedit is returned to shew me all my wretchedness and to afford me that light by which i must plunge a dagger into my own bosom had i however no objections on my own account there is one that on another appears insuperable were the marriage you solicit to take place and to be followed by a family could i bear that my william the delight and support of my life should be as an alien in his fathers house and either appear as the son of godolphin or learn to blush for his mother we must part fitzedward indeed we must or if we are obliged to meet do you at least forget that we ever met before i know that the daughter of lord westhaven in youth beauty and innocence would not have been however portionless unworthy of you but what would you receive in the widow of trelawny a mind unsettled by guilt and sorrow spirits which have lost all relish for felicity a blemished if not a ruined reputation a faded person and an exhausted heartexhausted of almost every sentiment but that so fatally predominant which now forces me to blot my paper with tears as i write this last farewel farewel most beloved fitzedwardah try if it be possible to be happy be assured i wish it even tho it be necessary for that end to drive from your memory for ever the lost adelina trelawny emmeline to whom this letter was sent open could not but approve the sentiments it contained while her heart bled for the pain it must have cost lady adelina and for that which it must inflict on fitzedward when she had dispatched a note to his lodgings to name an early hour the next day for speaking to him she went down into the drawing room where a large party of company were already assembled emmeline to avoid a particular conversation with lord delamere which he incessantly solicited placed herself near one of the card tables when at a late hour of the evening dressed in the utmost exuberance of fashion blazing in jewels and blooming in rouge entered mrs james crofts followed by the two eldest of her daughters one drest in the character of charlotte in the sorrows of werter and the other as emma the nut brown maid their air and manner were adapted as they believed to the figures of those characters as they appear in the print shops and their excessive affectation together with the gaudy appearance of their mama nearly conquered the gravity of emmeline and of many others of the company while mrs crofts paid her compliments to lady westhaven and emmeline and gave herself all those airs which she believed put her upon an equality with the circle she was in the two misses anxiously watched the impression which they concluded their charms must make on the gentlemen present their mama had told them that most likely all of them were lords or lords sons at least and the girls were not without hopes that among them there might be some of that species of men of quality whom modern novelists describe as being in the habit of carrying forcibly away beautiful young creatures with whom perchance they become enamoured and marrying them in despite of all opposition they longed above all things to meet with such adventures and to be carried off by a lord or a baronet at least whose letters afterwards to some dear charles or harry could not fail to edify the world after mrs crofts had displayed her dress and convinced the company of her being quite in a good style of life and when her daughters had committed hostilities for near an hour upon the hearts of the gentlemen they sailed out in the same state as they entered nor could all emmelines good humour prevent her smiling at the satyrical remarks made on them by some of the company nothing more strongly exciting the ridicule and contempt of people of real fashion than awkward and impotent efforts to imitate them the next day fitzedward attended at the hour emmeline appointed and received from her the letter of lady adelina with a degree of anguish which gave great pain to emmeline and godolphin still however he was not quite deprived of hope but flattered himself that the persuasions of her sister lady clancarryl who was now every day expected with her husband and family to pass the rest of the winter in london added to those of lord westhaven and the good offices of emmeline would together prevail on lady adelina to alter a resolution which rendered them both wretched some weeks however passed and she still adhered to it while the melancholy conversation which emmeline frequently had with fitzedward and the importunity and unhappiness of delamere deprived her of much of that tranquillity she might otherwise have enjoyed particularly after the recovery of lady westhaven who presented her lord with a son and the arrival of mrs stafford and her family from france lord westhaven who held a promise particularly sacred when made to the unfortunate had procured for mr stafford a lucrative employment in the west indies thither he immediately went and his wife whose spirits and health were greatly hurt was happy to accept the offer emmeline made her of going down with her children to mowbray castle the marquis of montreville had presented his niece with the furniture he had sent thither being in truth ashamed to charge it there was therefore every thing necessary and there emmeline intended mrs stafford should reside till she should be established in some residence agreeable to her which she intended to fix if possible near her own and she now felt all the advantages of that fortune which enabled her to repay the obligations she owed to her earliest friend footnote oh certainly mr crofts is always very sprightly a most entertaining personage footnote if there is any thing in the world i utterly detest tis such dismal society as that chapter xv the rank and extensive connections of lady westhaven led her unavoidably into a good deal of company but it was among persons as respectable for their virtues as their station emmeline of course often accompanied her but almost all her mornings and frequently her evenings were dedicated to lady adelina who hardly saw any body but her lady westhaven her brothers and her sister and never went out but for the air godolphin passed with her much of his time to the love and pity he had before felt for her was added veneration and esteem excited by the heroism of her conduct at her lodgings too he could see emmeline without the restraint they were under in other places there he could talk to her of his love and there she consented to hear him lady westhaven went constantly every morning to visit her mother who had lately been rather better and whose health her physicians entertained some hopes of reestablishing her own unhappy temper seemed to be the chief impediment to her recovery her violent passions unsubdued by sickness and disappointment and her immeasurable pride which even the approach of death could not conquer kept her nerves continually on the stretch and allowed her no repose of mind even when her bodily sufferings were suspended that her favourite project of uniting the only surviving branches of her own family by the marriage of lord delamere and miss otley was now for ever at an end was a perpetual source of murmuring and discontent and tho emmeline had as splendid a fortune with a person and a mind infinitely more lovely her ladyship could not yet prevail upon herself to desire that the name for which she felt such proud veneration and the fortune of her own illustrious ancestors should be enjoyed or carried down to posterity by her who had become the object of her capricious but inveterate dislike emmeline was very glad that the marchioness thro prejudice and her uncle thro shame forbore to persecute her in favour of their son but tho perfectly aware of the antipathy lady montreville entertained towards her she yet shewed her all the attention she would receive and would even constantly have waited on her had she not expressed more pain than pleasure in her presence lady frances crofts by this time fixed in burlington street for the winter called now and then on her mother but her visits were short and cold it unfortunately happened that the marchioness whose amusement was now almost solely confined to reading the daily prints had found in one of them a paragraph evidently pointed at the intimacy subsisting between lady frances and the chevalier de bellozane which had long been the topic of public scandal lady frances called upon her while her mind was under the first impression of this disgraceful circumstance and she spoke to her daughter of her improper attachment to that young foreigner with more than her usual severity lady frances far from hearing her remonstrance with calmness retorted with rudeness and asperity what she termed unjust reproaches and asserted her own right to associate with whom she pleased the marchioness grew more enraged and they parted in great wrath in consequence of which lady montreville in the inconsiderate excess of her anger sent for her husband and her son and exclaiming with all her natural acrimony against the shameful conduct of lady frances insisted upon their obliging crofts to separate his wife from her dangerous and improper acquaintance and forcing her immediately into the country lord montreville who had already heard too much of his daughters general light conduct and her particular partiality to bellozane now saw new evils gathering round him from which he knew not how to escape the fiery and impatient delamere already irritated against bellozane for his pretensions to emmeline broke forth in menace and invective and nothing but his fathers anguish and even tears prevented his flying directly to him to execute that vengeance which his mother had dictated she herself in the violence of her passion had overlooked the consequence of putting this affair into the hands of the inconsiderate and headlong delamere but when she saw him thus inflamed terror for him was added to resentment against her daughter and altogether produced such an effect on her broken constitution that in a few days afterwards her complaints returned with great violence and all remedies proving ineffectual she expired in less than a fortnight lady westhaven and emmeline attended on her themselves for the last four or five days but she was insensible and knew neither of them delamere very fond of his mother and whose feelings were painfully acute suffered for many days the most violent paroxysms of grief yet it was a considerable alleviation to reflect that he had not finally been the cause of her death lord montreville bore it with more composure and the softer tho deep sorrow of lady westhaven found relief in the constant and tender attention of her lord and the sympathy of emmeline lady frances crofts not insensible to remorse but resolutely stifling it affected to hear the news with proper concern yet as what had been for many months expected she sent constantly to enquire after her father and the marquis hoping that while her mind was softened by such a mournful event his remonstrance might make a deeper impression determined to go to her therefore the day after the remains of the marchioness had been carried to the family vault of the delameres he took his chair and went to burlington street on entering the house the servants who concluded he came to mr crofts were taking him into those apartments below which their master occupied but his lordship told them he must speak to their lady her own footman said her ladyship had given orders to be denied to her father puppysaid lord montreville where is she in her dressing room my lord he then passed alone up stairsas he went he heard the voice of laughter and gaiety and was more shocked than surprised when on opening the door he saw lady frances in a morning dishabille and the chevalier de bellozane making her tea at the entrance of her father thus unexpectedly she changed colour but soon assuming her usual assured manner said she was glad to see his lordship well enough to come out dismiss this young man said he sternly i must speak to you alone va mon ami cried lady frances with the utmost ease pour quelques moments bellozane left the room and then lord montreville with paternal affection tried to move her but she had conquered her feelings and answered with great calmnessthat conscious of her own innocence she was quite indifferent to the opinion of the world and that tho she certainly wished to be upon good terms with her own family yet if any part of it chose to think ill of her they must do so entirely from prejudice which it was little worth her while to attempt removing lord montreville now provoked beyond all endurance gave way to the indignation with which he was inflamed and denounced his malediction against her if she did not immediately dismiss bellozane and regulate her manner of life she heard him with the most callous insensibility and let him depart without making any attempt to appease his anger or calm his apprehensions from her he went down to crofts to whom he forcibly represented the necessity there was for putting an immediate stop to the scandal which the conduct of his wife occasioned pusillanimous and meanspirited crofts chose neither to risk his personal safety with the chevalier nor the diminution of his fortune by attempting to procure a divorce which would compel him to return what he loved much better than honour he saw many others do extremely well and mightily respected whose wives were yet gayer than his own and convinced that while he had money he should always obtain as much regard as he desired he rather excused to lord montreville the conduct of lady frances than shewed any disposition to resent it the marquis left him with contempt and ordered his chair to lord westhavens as he went he could not forbear reflecting on the contrast between his eldest and youngest daughter and between his eldest daughter and his niece he grew extremely anxious for lord delameres marriage with emmeline sure of finding in her an honour to his family which might console him for his present misfortunes and he deeply regretted that infatuation which had blinded him to her superior merit and hazarded losing her for ever disgusted already with the crofts he remembered that it had been in a great measure owing to them and he thought of them only with repentance and dislike he saw lord westhaven alone and relating to him all that had passed that morning besought him to consider what could be done to divide bellozane from lady frances crofts lord westhaven had seen and heard too much of the intimacy between them he was extremely hurt that so near a relation of his own should occasion such uneasiness in the family of his wife but as he had not invited him over and always discouraged his stay he had on that head nothing with which to reproach himself and all he could now do was to promise that he would speak again to bellozane and write to the baron de st alpin entreating him to press the return of his son to switzerland his lordship entered warmly into the apprehensions of lord montreville and undertook to use all his influence with delamere to prevent his running rashly into a quarrel with a young man as passionate and as violent as himself lord montreville then spoke of emmeline and expressed his wishes that the union between her and his son might speedily be accomplished but on this subject lord westhaven gave him very little hopes tho emmeline had done her utmost to conceal even from lord and lady westhaven the true state of her heart his lordship had in their frequent conferences on her affairs clearly perceived what were her sentiments but since they were in favour of his brother he could not think of attempting to alter them however sorry for delamere and could only determine to observe an absolute neutrality he did not communicate to the marquis all he thought but told him in general that emmeline seemed at present averse to every proposal of marriage and firm in the resolution she had made to remain single till she had completed her twentyfirst year lord westhaven sent for bellozane who had lately been less frequent in his visits at grosvenorstreet and who seemed to resent the coldness with which his cousins received him and to have conceived great anger at the reserve and even aversion with which emmeline treated him the servant whom his lordship dispatched with a note to bellozane returned in about ten minutes and said that the chevalier was gone to bath lord westhaven now hoped that for some time the intercourse which had given such offence and occasioned such misery would be at an end in the afternoon however crofts came in and on lady westhavens enquiry after her sister he told her that she was going that afternoon to speenhamland in her way to bath conduct so glaringly improper and unfeeling a defiance so bold to the opinions of the world and the common decencies of society extremely hurt both her ladyship and her lord the latter however found some satisfaction in reflecting that at least delamere and bellozane could not immediately meet above a month now passed with as much tranquillity as the ardent supplications of delamere to emmeline would admit lord and lady clancarryl with their family arrived in london to pass the rest of the winter and lady adelina insensibly won from her retirement by the pleasure of meeting at once her sister and her two brothers seemed to be in better health and sometimes in better spirits as she was now frequently induced to join these charming family parties she was obliged to see fitzedward among them and he entertained new hopes that she would at length conquer her scruples and accept his hand she carefully however avoided all conversation with him but in mixed company and emmeline being continually with her they were equally prevented from hearing with any degree of particularity godolphin or fitzedward the marchioness of montreville had now been dead almost two months and lady westhaven who from respect to her memory had hitherto forborne to appear in public was prevailed upon to go to a new play for the author of which a nobleman one of her friends being particularly interested he prevailed on all the people of fashion and taste whom he knew to attend on the third night of its representation lady westhaven lady clancarryl and emmeline were by his earnest entreaties induced to be among them but as lord westhaven lord clancarryl godolphin and fitzedward were absent being gone all together to the seat of the former in kent for a few days they foresaw but little pleasure in the party and lady westhaven expressed even a reluctance for which she knew not how to account the eagerness of lordto serve his friend at length overruled her objections his lordship himself and lord delamere were to attend them and they were to be joined by some other ladies there the stage box had been retained for them and they proceeded to the playhouse where they were hardly seated before lady westhaven saw with infinite mortification and alarm her sister lady frances crofts enter the next box handed by the chevalier de bellozane and accompanied by a lady of fashion indeed but of very equivocal character with whom she had lately contracted a great intimacy all attention to the play was now at an end incapable of receiving amusement lady westhaven would instantly have returned home and emmeline who saw rage and fierceness in the countenance of lord delamere was equally anxious to do so but they knew not how to account for such a wish to their party without making their fears public and while they deliberated how to act the play went on lady frances as if quite unconscious of any impropriety in her conduct spoke to them and to delamere they forced themselves to answer her with civility but her brother turning from her darted an angry look at bellozane and went to the other side of the house he from thence watched with indignation the familiar whispers which passed between her and the chevalier and reflecting on the recent death of his mother which had been hastened if not occasioned by this connection remembering how greatly the sufferings of her last hours had been embittered by it and recalling to his memory a thousand other causes of anger against bellozane he heated his imagination with the review of these injuries till he raised himself into an agony of passion which it was soon impossible for him had he been so disposed to restrain a very few minutes after the play ended lady westhaven impatient to get away before her sister beckoned to delamere and finding her servants ready told her party she was too much tired to stay the entertainment and rose with emmeline to go lordled her ladyship and delamere took the hand of emmeline the two former walked hastily thro the lobby but as the two latter followed they were suddenly stopped by rochely who making one of his solemn bows advanced close to emmeline and with great composure congratulated her in his usual slow and monotonous manner on her late acquisitions assured her of his great respect and esteem and added that as he understood she would when she came of age be possessed of a large sum of money he flattered himself she would allow him to manage it for her as lord montreville at present did declaring that nobody could be more attentive to the interest of his customers the profound gravity with which in such a place he made such a request the sordid meanness of spirit which could induce a man already so very rich to solicit custom with the avidity of a mechanic beginning business and the uncouth and formal figure of the person himself would have excited in emmeline ridicule as well as contempt at any other time but now distrest at the delay this meeting occasioned she hurried over some answer she hardly knew what and hastened towards the door just however before they reached it bellozane with lady frances crofts hanging on his arm overtook and passed them the chevalier slightly touched his hat to emmeline and lady frances nodding familiarly saidgood night good night lady frances and bellozane went on and emmeline who saw fury in the eyes of delamere now wished as much to linger behind as she had before done to hurry forward but delamere quickening his pace overtook them as they descended the steps and rushed so closely and with so much intended rudeness by bellozane that it was with the utmost difficulty he could avoid falling and dragging his fair associate with him the fiery frenchman recovering his footing turned fiercely to delamere and asked in french what he meant lord delamere in the same language replied that he meant to tell him he was a scoundrel instantly a mutual blow was exchanged the shrieks of emmeline brought the sentinels who together with the croud which immediately gathered forced them from each other lordwho had taken care of lady westhaven to her coach alarmed at emmelines not joining them and at the noise he heard now came back to see what was the matter he met her more dead than alive coming towards him attended by a stranger and she had just breath enough to implore him not to think of her but to find lord delamere and try to prevent the fatal consequence of what had just happened leaving her to the care of the gentleman he had found her with who almost supported her to the coach his lordship went forward in quest of delamere whom he met with two or three other gentlemen bellozane after stating to them the affront he had received and giving lord delamere a card had returned back into the lobby with lady frances and her friend from whence it was supposed he had gone out with them across the stage as lady frances appeared in great alarm lordnow entreated delamere to go with him to the coach where he told him his sister was in the utmost terror for his safety but enquiring eagerly whether miss mowbray was safe with her and hearing she was he said he would be in grosvenorstreet to supper and desired they would go home lordthen very warmly remonstrated on the cruelty of terrifying his sister and insisted on his going with him to the coach but they were by this time among the croud at the door where people began to go out fast and delamere whose passions were now inflamed to a degree of madness broke violently away from his lordship and rushing into the street instantly disappeared every attempt which himself his servants or some gentlemen who were witnesses to the transaction made to find him being ineffectual lordnow returned to the coach where lady westhaven was fainting in the arms of emmeline who equally alarmed and hardly able to support herself was trying to assist and console her lord instead of returning to his own family now sent a footman to desire they would go home without him and remaining in lady westhavens carriage directed it to be driven with the utmost speed to grosvenor street as they went he attempted to appease the agonizing fears of them both by persuading them that they might find lord delamere at home before them but they knew too well the ferocity with which he was capable of pursuing his vengeance when it was once awakened and arrived at home in such disorder that neither could speakthe coach however no sooner stopped than somebody ran out they had no power to ask who but the voice was that of godolphin who finding his brother likely to be detained two days longer and existing only while he could see emmeline every hour had returned alone to town and now waited their arrival from the play he was astonished at the situation he found them in as he assisted them out of the carriage he received however a brief account of the cause from lord while lady westhaven a little recovered by the sight of godolphin and the hartshorn and water she had taken found her voice for gods sake dear godolphin lose not a moment but go after my brother we dread lest he went immediately in search of bellozaneoh fly and endeavour to prevent the horrid effects that may be expected from their meeting pray go said emmeline pray go instantly godolphin needed not entreaty he took his hat and ran away directly without knowing whither to go he thought however that it was possible delamere might go to berkley square and send from thence an appointment to bellozane thither therefore he hastened but heard that lord delamere had not been at home since he dressed to dine in grosvenor street and that the marquis was gone to lord dornocks where he was to stay some days news which encreased the alarm of godolphin who had hoped that his influence might be used to prevent the rashness of his son he ordered millefleur and delameres coachman footmen and grooms to run different ways in search of their master while he went himself to the lodgings of bellozane bellozane he learnt came from bath only that morning and had dressed at his lodgings but had not been there since he now flew to the house of lady frances crofts mr crofts was gone down to his fathers and lady frances who had come from bath the same day had dined with her friend and was to be set down by her carriage after supper eagerly asking the name of this friend he was directed to charlotte street oxford street where on hastening he found lady frances who was vainly attempting to conquer the terrors that possessed her bellozane he heard had procured chairs for her and the lady with her at the stage door and had there wished them a good night tho they had both intreated of him to go home with them they added that they had refused to let him look for their carriage which was driven off in the croud lest he should meet with delamere but were greatly afraid he had gone back to the avenues of the playhouse with that design godolphin however unpromising his search yet appeared determined not to relinquish it but while he continued running from place to place lady westhaven and emmeline sat listening to every noise and terrifying themselves with conjectures the most dreadful almost as soon as godolphin was gone they had conjured lordto go on the same search but he returned not and of godolphin they heard nothing even the late hours when fashionable parties break up now passed by every coach that approached made them tremble between hope and fear but it rolled away to a distance another and another passed and their dreadful suspence still continued emmeline would have persuaded lady westhaven to go to bed but nothing could induce her to think of it she sometimes traversed the room with hurried steps sometimes sat listening at the window and sometimes ran out to the stair case where all the servants except those who had been dispatched in pursuit of lord delamere were assembled the streets were now quiet the watch called a quarter past five and convinced that if something fatal had not happened some body would have returned to them by this time their terror grew insupportable a quick rap was now heard at the door emmeline flew to the stairsis it lord delamere no madam replied a servant it is captain godolphin afraid of asking yet unable to bear another moment of suspence she flew down part of the stairs godolphin with a countenance paler than death caught her in his armswhither would you go cried he trembling as he spoke have you founddelamere i have alive and well alivebut oh godbut what wounded i fear to death keep his sister from knowing it too suddenly that was almost impossible lady westhaven had at first sat down in the drawing room in that breathless agony which precluded the power of enquiry then losing her weakness in desperation she ran down determined to know the worst and was already on the stairs emmeline white and faint leaned on godolphinwhere is he where is my brother cried lady westhaven godolphin beckoned to the servants to assist him in getting her up stairs after a moment they were all in the drawing room tell me cried she with an accent and look of despairtell me for i will know you have seen my brother he is killed i know he is killed he is alive answered godolphin hardly bearing to wound her ears with such intelligence as he had to deliverat least he was alive when i left him was alive he is wounded thenand dying it were useless and cruel to deceive you i greatly fear he is uttering a faint shriek lady westhaven now sprung towards the door and protested she would go to him wherever he was emmeline clung about her and besought her to be patientto be pacified perhaps cried she his situation may not be so desperate let us rather enquire what can be done for him than indulge the extravagance of our own despair ah tell me then wherehow lady westhaven could say no more godolphin thought it best to satisfy her i will not relate the first part of my search it was fruitless at length i saw a croud before the door of the bedford i asked what was the matter and heard that two gentlemen had fought a duel by candlelight with swords that one was killed and the other had escaped this was too much like what i expected to hear i forced my way into the room lord delamere was bleeding on the ground two surgeons were with him i cleared the room of all but them and the necessary attendants i saw him carefully conveyed to bed i left them with him and came to tell you now i must hasten back to him i will not flatter you the surgeons gave me very littleindeed no hope of his life oh my father my father exclaimed lady westhaven what will become of him when he hears this i would go to him said godolphin but that i must return to poor delamere what little he said was to request that i would stay with him go then said emmelinewe must do without you let him not miss the comfort of your presence yes answered he i must indeed go emmeline leaving lady westhaven a moment to her woman followed him out and he said to hertry i conjure you my emmeline to exert yourself for the sake of your poor friend keep her as tranquil as you can and may ye both acquire fortitude to bear what is i fear inevitable oh my father loudly exclaimed lady westhaven with a dreadful shriekwho shall dare to announce these tidings to you send continued godolphin an express to lord montreville he is at lord dornocks and dispatch another to my brother pray take care of your own health it is now impossible for me to staythe poor languishing delamere expects me he then ran hastily away and emmeline struggling with all her power against her own anguish was obliged to commit her friend to the care of her servants while she sat down to write to lord montreville her letter contained only two lines my dear lord your son is very ill we are much alarmed and lady westhaven begs you will immediately come hither do not go to berkleysquare emmeline mowbray grosvenorstreet april th this note short as it was she had the utmost difficulty to make legible a servant was sent off with it who was ordered to answer no questions and in another short and incoherent note she told to lord westhaven the melancholy truth and sent it by express into kent having thus obeyed godolphin as well as she could she returned to lady westhaven who could not be prevailed upon to go to bed but insisted on being allowed to see her brother emmeline dreadfully terrified by her obstinacy now sent for the two physicians who usually attended the family one of them had been taken by godolphin to delamere but the other instantly attended the summons every argument he could use failing entirely of effect he was obliged to administer to her a remedy which soon acting on her fatigued and exhausted spirits threw her for a short time into insensibility while poor emmeline who expected soon the arrival of the unhappy father and who waited with torturing anxiety for news from godolphin could not even sit down but wandered about the house and walked from room to room as if change of place could shorten or lessen her dreadful suspence no news however came from godolphin but a little before eight oclock the marquiss chaise stopped at the door he got out asked faulteringly of the servants for his son their looks imported sad tidings but they were ordered to profess ignorance and it was the excruciating task allotted to emmeline to inform this wretched parent that his only son the pride and support of his life had fallen and what made it still more horrid by the hand of his daughters paramour lord montreville entered the drawing room and the wild and pallid looks of his niece struck him with such horror that he could only pronounce with trembling lips the name of delamere and then throwing himself into a chair seemed to expect she should tell him what he was unable to ask she approached him but words failed her delameremy son cried he in a voice hollow and tremulous he is not dead my lord not dead wherefore is it then that you look thus oh what is it i am to know emmeline then briefly related his situation as she had heard it from godolphin she had only said that tho desperately wounded he yet lived when lord montreville gazing on her with eyes that bespoke the agony of his soul and seizing her violently by the hand saidcome then with me come to him with me now this instant he then burst out of the room still taking her with him she knew not why he wished her to follow but went unequal to resistance or enquiry his chariot was at the door they both got in and just as it was driving away millefleur ran up to it your masteryour master said lord montreville ah my lord he isyet living yet living and captain godolphin sent me to see if you was come in hopes that you might see him go on cried lord montreville with a degree of fierceness that made emmeline shudder the horses flew he continued in dreadful and gloomy silence interrupted only by deep groans emmeline had no comfort to offer and dared not speak to him at length they arrived at the place the servants assisted their lord to leave the chariot just as he got out of it dr gardner came out but too much shocked to be able to speak he waved his hand to say that all was over and almost instantly godolphin with a countenance most expressive of what he felt came out to him also my dear lord your going up will be of no use spare yourself so great a shock and suffer me to attend you home he is dead then deep and mournful silence told him it was so i will see him however said he pushing by those who would have detained him no no cried emmeline pray my lord pray my dear uncle uncle exclaimed he have i deserved to be your uncle but i am punisheddreadfully dreadfully punished a croud was now gathering and godolphin was compelled to let him proceed while he himself approached emmeline who was left half dead in the chariot ah attend not to me said she go i beg of you with my poor uncle dreadful was the scene when the miserable father beheld the body of his son in that bitter anguish which is incapable of tears he reproached himself for the obstinacy with which even against his own judgment he had opposed his marriage with emmelineinstead of seeing thus my hopes blasted for ever i might have grown old among his children and the children of my brothers daughter but i drove her to france and in consequence of that the scourge the dreadful scourge has fallen upon me i and my house are low in the dust weak and wretched infatuation dreadful sacrifice to vain and empty ambition oh my poor murdered boy then after a moments pause he turned suddenly to godolphin whose manly countenance was covered with tears tell me sir did he not wish to see his misjudging father did he leave me nothingnot even his forgiveness lord delamere said godolphin was wounded in the lungs and every effort to speak threatened his immediate dissolution he expressed a wish to see you and miss mowbray but said very little else i brought her because i knew he must wish to see her but he will see her no more a deep and hollow groan now burst from him his sorrow began to choak him and exclamation was at an end yet struggling a moment with it he said quickly to godolphindo you think he suffered great pain i believe very little my lord and he had every assistance he had instantly every assistance that skill could offer two surgeons of eminence were at supper with company in the house and they were with him before i was which was not ten minutes after the accident i never left him afterwards but to run to lady westhaven excellent young man you will still i know remain with him and do what i can not do he then paused a moment and his anguish seemed to gather strengthwhile with a look of deep and gloomy despair he approached the bed slowly and sternly invoked the vengeance of heaven on his eldest daughter and then continued with glazed and motionless eyes to gaze on the body from this dreadful torpor it was necessary to rouse him and to remove him from the room the united efforts of godolphin and the surgeons with difficulty effected it he was however at length placed in the chariot and with emmeline who was more dead than alive was conveyed to grosvenorstreet godolphin dreading the scene he was to encounter when they got thither followed them on foot and assisted lord montreville to his chamber where he entreated the servants not to allow him to see lady westhaven till they were both better able to bear the interview he then returned to emmeline who quite overcome by excessive terror and fatigue had hardly strength to speak to him and unable to support herself longer retired to bed where a violent fever seized her and for near a week she was so alarmingly ill that godolphin in the wildest distraction believed he saw her snatched from him by the inexorable hands of death lady adelina came to her the evening after delameres decease and never left her bed side while there was the least appearance of danger godolphin continued whole days in the little dressing room that adjoined to it and fitzedward who insisted on attending him during these hours of torturing suspence was unavoidably frequently in the presence of lady adelina whose every sentiment was for the time absorbed in her fear for a life so dear to them all at length emmeline tho yet too ill to leave her room was no longer in danger and lord westhaven who returned instantly to town on hearing the mournful news helped to appease the violent grief of his wife but on the more settled and silent anguish of her wretched father his good offices made not the least impression he seemed to abhor all thoughts of consolation and when the remains of poor delamere were carried to be deposited with those of his mother he shut himself up in total darkness and refused to admit even lady westhaven to participate his sorrows when she was allowed to pay her duty to him he conjured her to keep from him the sight of any of the crofts and that she would prevent even their name being repeated in his presence with their visits there was no danger of his lordships being offended for as he had in consequence of this family calamity resigned all the places he held sir richard and his two sons were already eagerly paying their court to his successor and had entered into new views and formed new political connections with an avidity which made them equally forgetful of their patrons personal afflictions and of that favour to which they owed their sudden and unmerited elevation amidst all the misery which the guilty and scandalous conduct of his wife had brought upon the family of his benefactor the point on which mr crofts felt the most solicitude was to know what portion of the delamere estate was irrevocably settled in equal divisions on the daughters if the marquis of montreville died without a son the physicians now advised lord westhaven to carry the marquis into the country as soon as possible where he might enjoy the solitude he so much desired without being excluded from the air as he was in town by being confined entirely to his bed chamber and dressing room the sight of any of his own seats places which he had so lavishly embellished for the residence of him who was now no more he could not yet endure and lord westhaven with some difficulty prevailed upon him to remove to his house in kent thither therefore the marquis and lord westhavens family removed at the end of a fortnight but emmeline tho pretty well recovered desired lady westhaven not to insist on her being of the party being convinced that tho he tried to see her with fortitude and to behave to her with tenderness the sight of her was painful to her uncle and perpetually brought to his mind his own fatal misconduct in regard to his son lady westhaven yielded reluctantly to her reasons and departed without her but as her health made her immediate departure from london necessary she went with lady adelina to highgate who now remained there only for the purpose of taking leave of lord and lady clancarryl as they were within a fortnight to return to ireland in this interval they heard that lady frances crofts infatuated still with her passion for bellozane had followed him to paris whither he had fled after his fatal encounter with her brother bellozane stung with guilt and pursued by remorse hurried from her with detestation and concealing himself in switzerland saw her no more for some time she continued to live in france in a style the most disgraceful to her family and herself nobody dared name her to her unhappy father but lord westhaven at length interposed with crofts who influenced by his authority and still more by his own desire to lessen her expences went over and found no great difficulty in procuring a lettre de cachet which confined her during pleasure to a convent chapter xvi to fix some plan for her future life emmeline now thought absolutely and immediately necessary to go to mowbray castle seemed the properest measure she could adopt and on that she appeared to determine but tho she still meant to adhere to her resolution of remaining single until she became of age the tender importunity of her lover the pressing entreaties of her friends and her own wishes to make them happy were every hour more powerfully undermining it her mind softened by grief for the death of poor delamere and more fondly attached than ever to the generous godolphin whose noble qualities that unhappy event had served to call forth anew was rendered less capable than ever of resisting his prayers and delamere on whose account her determination had been originally made could now no longer suffer by her breaking it still however she insisted upon it that a term little short of what she had named should elapse before her marriage should take place as a compliment to the memory of her unfortunate lover and to the deep sorrow of her uncle and lady westhaven here then she rested her last defence and when their encreasing solicitations obliged her to consent to shorten the term to three months godolphin undertook to make it the particular request of lord montreville and his daughter that their marriage should take place within three weeks animated by the hopes of hastening the period he went himself into kent where he pleaded so successfully to lady westhaven that she not only wrote pressingly to emmeline but prevailed on the marquis to give him a letter also in which after deploring in terms expressive of anguish and regret that unfortunate infatuation which had eventually robbed him of his son he told her that he had very little more now to wish dead as he was to the world than to see her happily married that the tender attention of the generous godolphin to that beloved son in the last hours of his life had endeared him to him above all other men that his character connections and conduct were unexceptionable and therefore his lordship added that tho he did not know that he could himself bear to see it he wished she would not hesitate to complete his happiness observing that if she thought it too early after the loss of so near a relation she might have the ceremony performed with such privacy that only the respective families need know of its celebration emmeline having now no longer a subterfuge was obliged to let godolphin take his own way he exerted himself so anxiously to get the deeds completed that before the end of three weeks they were finished lord and lady clancarryl prolonged their stay on purpose and they together with lady adelina and fitzedward were present at the ceremony when it was over lord and lady clancarryl took an affectionate leave of the bride and bridegroom and set out for ireland accompanied by fitzedward who with the most painful reluctance tearing himself from lady adelina by her express desire was yet allowed to carry with him the hope that at the end of her mourning she would relent and accede to the entreaties of all her family godolphin his emmeline his sister and her little boy took immediately afterwards the road to east cliff they continued there the months of may and june where about six weeks after their marriage they were visited by lord and lady westhaven the latter having never left her father till then and being impatient to return to him tho she assured mrs godolphin that he was much calmer and more composed than they had at first expected in the filial attention of his youngest daughter he found all the consolation his misfortunes would admit of on this side the grave and emmeline who had deeply lamented the lingering and hopeless anguish to which her uncle was condemned heard with satisfaction that resignation was however slowly blunting the anguish he had endured and that having relinquished for ever all those ambitious pursuits to which he had sacrificed solid happiness he thought only of rewarding the piety and tenderness of his youngest daughter and heard of the happiness of his niece with pleasure when lord and lady westhaven left east cliff mr and mrs godolphin and lady adelina went to mowbray castle where mrs stafford received them with transport and where they were surrounded by numberless tenants and dependants who blessed the hour of its restoration to its benevolent and lovely mistress as well as that which had given her to a man who had a heart as nobly enlarged and a spirit generously liberal as her own the comfortable establishment of mrs stafford at woodfield was a point which emmeline had much at heart and godolphin who knew it was now almost her first wish took his measures with so much success that it was soon accomplished mrs stafford however at their united request consented to stay with them while they remained at mowbray castle and emmeline had the delightful assurances of having made her happy as well as of having greatly contributed to the restored tranquillity of lady adelina mowbray castle ever so peculiarly dear to mrs godolphin and where she was now blessed with her beloved husband and her charming friends brought however to her mind the mournful remembrance of poor delamere and the tears of rapture with which the greatness of her own happiness sometimes filled her eyes were mingled with those of sorrow for his untimely death she considered him as the victim of his mothers fatal fondness and his fathers ambition yet that his early death was not immediately owing to his violent passion for her was a great consolation and with only the one source of regret which his premature fate occasioned and which being without remedy yielded inevitably to time she saw an infinite deal for which to be grateful and failed not to offer her humble acknowledgments to that providence who from dependance and indigence had raised her to the highest affluence given her in the tenderest of husbands the best the most generous and most amiable of men and had bestowed on her the means and the inclination to deserve by virtue and beneficence that heaven where only she can enjoy more perfect and lasting felicity finis
