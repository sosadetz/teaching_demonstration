dorothy wordsworths journal written at alfoxden from th january to nd may dorothy wordsworths journal written at alfoxden in footnote in the original ms there is no title the above is a descriptive one given by the editored alfoxden january th the green paths down the hillsides are channels for streams the young wheat is streaked by silver lines of water running between the ridges the sheep are gathered together on the slopes after the wet dark days the country seems more populous it peoples itself in the sunbeams the garden mimic of spring is gay with flowers the purplestarred hepatica spreads itself in the sun and the clustering snowdrops put forth their white heads at first upright ribbed with green and like a rosebud when completely opened hanging their heads downwards but slowly lengthening their slender stems the slanting woods of an unvarying brown showing the light through the thin network of their upper boughs upon the highest ridge of that round hill covered with planted oaks the shafts of the trees show in the light like the columns of a ruin st walked on the hilltopsa warm day sate under the firs in the park the tops of the beeches of a brownred or crimson those oaks fanned by the sea breeze thick with feathery seagreen moss as a grove not stripped of its leaves moss cups more proper than acorns for fairy goblets ndwalked through the wood to holford the ivy twisting round the oaks like bristled serpents the day colda warm shelter in the hollies capriciously bearing berries query are the male and female flowers on separate trees rdbright sunshine went out at oclock the sea perfectly calm blue streaked with deeper colour by the clouds and tongues or points of sand on our return of a gloomy red the sun gone down the crescent moon jupiter and venus the sound of the sea distinctly heard on the tops of the hills which we could never hear in summer we attribute this partly to the bareness of the trees but chiefly to the absence of the singing of birds the hum of insects that noiseless noise which lives in the summer air the villages marked out by beautiful beds of smoke the turf fading into the mountain road the scarlet flowers of the moss footnote compare keats miscellaneous poems there crept a little noiseless noise amongst the leaves born of the very sigh that silence heaves ed and coleridge the Ã¦olian harp the stilly murmur of the distant sea tells us of silence ed thwalked between halfpast three and halfpast five the evening cold and clear the sea of a sober grey streaked by the deeper grey clouds the half dead sound of the near sheepbell in the hollow of the sloping coombe exquisitely soothing thwent to pooles after tea the sky spread over with one continuous cloud whitened by the light of the moon which though her dim shape was seen did not throw forth so strong a light as to chequer the earth with shadows at once the clouds seemed to cleave asunder and left her in the centre of a blackblue vault she sailed along followed by multitudes of stars small and bright and sharp their brightness seemed concentrated halfmoon thwalked upon the hilltops followed the sheep tracks till we overlooked the larger coombe sat in the sunshine the distant sheepbells the sound of the stream the woodman winding along the halfmarked road with his laden pony locks of wool still spangled with the dewdrops the bluegrey sea shaded with immense masses of cloud not streaked the sheep glittering in the sunshine returned through the wood the trees skirting the wood being exposed more directly to the action of the sea breeze stripped of the network of their upper boughs which are stiff and erect like black skeletons the ground strewed with the red berries of the holly set forward before two oclock returned a little after four thwalked from seven oclock till halfpast eight upon the whole an uninteresting evening only once while we were in the wood the moon burst through the invisible veil which enveloped her the shadows of the oaks blackened and their lines became more strongly marked the withered leaves were coloured with a deeper yellow a brighter gloss spotted the hollies again her form became dimmer the sky flat unmarked by distances a white thin cloud the manufacturers dog makes a strange uncouth howl which it continues many minutes after there is no noise near it but that of the brook it howls at the murmur of the village stream thwalked only to the mill tha very stormy day william walked to the top of the hill to see the sea nothing distinguishable but a heavy blackness an immense bough riven from one of the fir trees thwilliam called me into the garden to observe a singular appearance about the moon a perfect rainbow within the bow one star only of colours more vivid the semicircle soon became a complete circle and in the course of three or four minutes the whole faded away walked to the blacksmiths and the bakers an uninteresting evening stset forward to stowey at halfpast five a violent storm in the wood sheltered under the hollies when we left home the moon immensely large the sky scattered over with clouds these soon closed in contracting the dimensions of the moon without concealing her the sound of the pattering shower and the gusts of wind very grand left the wood when nothing remained of the storm but the driving wind and a few scattering drops of rain presently all clear venus first showing herself between the struggling clouds afterwards jupiter appeared the hawthorn hedges black and pointed glittering with millions of diamond drops the hollies shining with broader patches of light the road to the village of holford glittered like another stream on our return the wind higha violent storm of hail and rain at the castle of comfort all the heavens seemed in one perpetual motion when the rain ceased the moon appearing now half veiled and now retired behind heavy clouds the stars still moving the roads very dirty february stabout two hours before dinner set forward towards mr bartholemews the wind blew so keen in our faces that we felt ourselves inclined to seek the covert of the wood there we had a warm shelter gathered a burthen of large rotten boughs blown down by the wind of the preceding night the sun shone clear but all at once a heavy blackness hung over the sea the trees almost roared and the ground seemed in motion with the multitudes of dancing leaves which made a rustling sound distinct from that of the trees still the asses pastured in quietness under the hollies undisturbed by these forerunners of the storm the wind beat furiously against us as we returned full moon she rose in uncommon majesty over the sea slowly ascending through the clouds sat with the window open an hour in the moonlight footnote mr bartholemew rented alfoxden and sublet the house to wordsworthed ndwalked through the wood and on to the downs before dinner a warm pleasant air the sun shone but was often obscured by straggling clouds the redbreasts made a ceaseless song in the woods the wind rose very high in the evening the room smoked so that we were obliged to quit it young lambs in a green pasture in the coombe thick legs large heads black staring eyes rda mild morning the windows open at breakfast the redbreasts singing in the garden walked with coleridge over the hills the sea at first obscured by vapour that vapour afterwards slid in one mighty mass along the seashore the islands and one point of land clear beyond it the distant country which was purple in the clear dull air overhung by straggling clouds that sailed over it appeared like the darker clouds which are often seen at a great distance apparently motionless while the nearer ones pass quickly over them driven by the lower winds i never saw such a union of earth sky and sea the clouds beneath our feet spread themselves to the water and the clouds of the sky almost joined them gathered sticks in the wood a perfect stillness the redbreasts sang upon the leafless boughs of a great number of sheep in the field only one standing returned to dinner at five oclock the moonlight still and warm as a summers night at nine oclock thwalked a great part of the way to stowey with coleridge the morning warm and sunny the young lasses seen on the hilltops in the villages and roads in their summer holiday clothespink petticoats and blue mothers with their children in arms and the little ones that could just walk tottering by their side midges or small flies spinning in the sunshine the songs of the lark and redbreast daisies upon the turf the hazels in blossom honeysuckles budding i saw one solitary strawberry flower under a hedge the furze gay with blossom the moss rubbed from the pailings by the sheep that leave locks of wool and the red marks with which they are spotted upon the wood thwalked to stowey with coleridge returned by woodlands a very warm day in the continued singing of birds distinguished the notes of a blackbird or thrush the sea overshadowed by a thick dark mist the land in sunshine the sheltered oaks and beeches still retaining their brown leaves observed some trees putting out red shoots query what trees are they thwalked to stowey over the hills returned to tea a cold and clear evening the roads in some parts frozen hard the sea hid by mist all the day thturned towards potsdam but finding the way dirty changed our course cottage gardens the object of our walk went up the smaller coombe to woodlands to the blacksmiths the bakers and through the village of holford still misty over the sea the air very delightful we saw nothing very new or interesting thwent up the park and over the tops of the hills till we came to a new and very delicious pathway which conducted us to the coombe sat a considerable time upon the heath its surface restless and glittering with the motion of the scattered piles of withered grass and the waving of the spiders threads on our return the mist still hanging over the sea but the opposite coast clear and the rocky cliffs distinguishable in the deep coombe as we stood upon the sunless hill we saw miles of grass light and glittering and the insects passing thwilliam gathered sticks thwalked to woodlands and to the waterfall the adderstongue and the ferns green in the low damp dell these plants now in perpetual motion from the current of the air in summer only moved by the drippings of the rocks a cloudy day thwalked with coleridge near to stowey the day pleasant but cloudy thwalked alone to stowey returned in the evening with coleridge a mild pleasant cloudy day thwalked with coleridge through the wood a mild and pleasant morning the near prospect clear the ridges of the hills fringed with wood showing the sea through them like the white sky and still beyond the dim horizon of the distant hills hanging as it were in one undetermined line between sea and sky thgathered sticks with william in the wood he being unwell and not able to go further the young birch trees of a bright red through which gleams a shade of purple sat down in a thick part of the wood the near trees still even to their topmost boughs but a perpetual motion in those that skirt the wood the breeze rose gently its path distinctly marked till it came to the very spot where we were thgathered sticks in the further wood the dell green with moss and brambles and the tall and slender pillars of the unbranching oaks i crossed the water with letters returned to wm and basil a shower met us in the wood and a ruffling breeze thwent for eggs into the coombe and to the bakers a hail shower brought home large burthens of sticks a starlight evening the sky closed in and the ground white with snow before we went to bed tha deep snow upon the ground wm and coleridge walked to mr bartholemews and to stowey wm returned and we walked through the wood into the coombe to fetch some eggs the sun shone bright and clear a deep stillness in the thickest part of the wood undisturbed except by the occasional dropping of the snow from the holly boughs no other sound but that of the water and the slender notes of a redbreast which sang at intervals on the outskirts of the southern side of the wood there the bright green moss was bare at the roots of the trees and the little birds were upon it the whole appearance of the wood was enchanting and each tree taken singly was beautiful the branches of the hollies pendent with their white burden but still showing their bright red berries and their glossy green leaves the bare branches of the oaks thickened by the snow thwalked after dinner beyond woodlands a sharp and very cold evening first observed the crescent moon a silvery line a thready bow attended by jupiter and venus in their palest hues footnote this

wood loud as if disturbed and the wind was silent rdwilliam walked with coleridge in the morning i did not go out thwent to the hilltop sat a considerable time overlooking the country towards the sea the air blew pleasantly round us the landscape mildly interesting the welsh hills capped by a huge range of tumultuous white clouds the sea spotted with white of a bluish grey in general and streaked with darker lines the near shores clear scattered farm houses halfconcealed by green mossy orchards fresh straw lying at the doors haystacks in the fields brown fallows the springing wheat like a shade of green over the brown earth and the choice meadow plots full of sheep and lambs of a soft and vivid green a few wreaths of blue smoke spreading along the ground the oaks and beeches in the hedges retaining their yellow leaves the distant prospect on the land side islanded with sunshine the sea like a basin full to the margin the dark freshploughed fields the turnips of a lively rough green returned through the wood thi lay down in the morning though the whole day was very pleasant and the evening fine we did not walk thcoleridge came in the morning and mr and mrs cruikshank walked with coleridge nearly to stowey after dinner a very clear afternoon we lay sidelong upon the turf and gazed on the landscape till it melted into more than natural loveliness the sea very uniform of a pale greyish blue only one distant bay bright and blue as a sky had there been a vessel sailing up it a perfect image of delight walked to the top of a high hill to see a fortification again sat down to feed upon the prospect a magnificent scene curiously spread out for even minute inspection though so extensive that the mind is afraid to calculate its bounds a winter prospect shows every cottage every farm and the forms of distant trees such as in summer have no distinguishing mark on our return jupiter and venus before us while the twilight still overpowered the light of the moon we were reminded that she was shining bright above our heads by our faint shadows going before us we had seen her on the tops of the hills melting into the blue sky poole called while we were absent footnote of netherstowey the agent of the earl of egmonted thi walked to stowey in the evening wm and basil went with me through the wood the prospect bright yet mildly beautiful the sea big and white swelled to the very shores but round and high in the middle coleridge returned with me as far as the wood a very bright moonlight night venus almost like another moon lost to us at alfoxden long before she goes down the large white sea march stwe rose early a thick fog obscured the distant prospect entirely but the shapes of the nearer trees and the dome of the wood dimly seen and dilated it cleared away between ten and eleven the shapes of the mist slowly moving along exquisitely beautiful passing over the sheep they almost seemed to have more of life than those quiet creatures the unseen birds singing in the mist footnote compare the recluse her voice was like a hidden bird that sang ed ndwent a part of the way home with coleridge in the morning gathered fir apples afterwards under the trees rdi went to the shoemakers william lay under the trees till my return afterwards went to the secluded farm house in search of eggs and returned over the hill a very mild cloudy evening the rose

very high wind coleridge came to avoid the smoke stayed all night we walked in the wood and sat under the trees the half of the wood perfectly still while the wind was making a loud noise behind us the still trees only gently bowed their heads as if listening to the wind the hollies in the thick wood unshaken by the blast only when it came with a greater force shaken by the rain drops falling from the bare oaks above rdwalked to crookham with coleridge and wm to make the appeal left wm there and parted with coleridge at the top of the hill a very stormy afternoon thwalked to the seaside in

september and october footnote this is not dorothys own title her journal has no titleed quitted london friday th september arrived at yarmouth on saturday noon and sailed on sunday morning at eleven oclock before we heaved the anchor i was consigned to the cabin which i did not quit till we were in still water at the mouth of the elbe on tuesday morning at ten oclock i was surprised to find when i came upon deck that we could not see the shores though we were in the river it was to my eyes a still sea but oh the gentle breezes and the gentle motion as we advanced towards cuxhaven the shores appeared low and flat and thinly peopled here and there a farmhouse cattle feeding haystacks a cottage a windmill some vessels were at anchor at cuxhaven an ugly blacklooking place dismissed a part of our crew and proceeded in the packetboat up the river cast anchor between six and seven oclock the moon shone upon the waters the shores were visible rock here and there a light from the houses ships lying at anchor not far from us we drank tea upon deck by the light of the moon i enjoyed solitude and quietness and many a recollected pleasure hearing still the unintelligible jargon of the many tongues that gabbled in the cabin went to bed between ten and eleven the party playing at cards but they were silent and suffered us to go to sleep at four oclock in the morning we were awakened by the heaving of the anchor and till seven in the intervals of sleep i enjoyed the thought that we were advancing towards hamburgh but what was our mortification on being told that there was a thick fog and that we could not sail till it was dispersed i went on to the deck the air was cold and wet the decks streaming the shores invisible no hope of clear weather at ten however the sun appeared and we saw the green shores all became clear and we set sail churches very frequent on the right with spires red blue sometimes green houses thatched or tiled and generally surrounded with low trees a beautiful low green island houses and wood as we advanced the left bank of the river became more interesting footnote ie william and dorothy wordsworth coleridge and chestered the houses warm and comfortable sheltered with trees and neatly painted blankenese a village or town scattered over the sides of three hills woody where the houses lie and sleep down below the houses halfconcealed by and halfobtruding themselves from the low trees naked boats with masts lying at the bare feet of the blankenese hills houses more and more frequent as we approach hamburgh the banks of the elbe more steep some gentlemens seats after the english fashion the spires of altona and hamburgh visible a considerable time at altona we took a boat and rowed through the narrow passages of the elbe crowded with vessels of all nations landed at the boom house where we were received by porters ready to carry our luggage to any part of the town william went to seek lodgings and the rest of the party guarded the luggage two boats were about to depart an elegant english carriage was placed in one and presently a very pretty woman conducted by a gentleman seated herself in it and they rowed off the other contained a medley crew of all ages there was an old woman with a blue cap trimmed with broad silver lace and tied under her chin she had a short coloured cloak etc while we stood in the street which was open on one side to the elbe i was much amused by the various employments and dresses of the people who passed before us there were dutch women with immense straw bonnets with flat crowns and rims in the shape of oyster shells without trimming or with only a plain riband round the crown and literally as large as a smallsized umbrella hamburgher girls with white caps with broad overhanging borders crimped and stiff and long lappets of riband hanoverians with round borders showing all the face and standing upright a profusion of riband fruitwomen with large straw hats in the shape of an inverted bowl or white handkerchiefs tied round the head like a bishops mitre jackets the most common often the petticoat and jacket of different colours the ladies without hats in dresses of all fashions soldiers with dulllooking red coats and immense cocked hats the men little differing from the english except that they have generally a pipe in their mouths after waiting about an hour we saw wm appear two porters carried our luggage upon a sort of wheelbarrow and we were conducted through dirty illpaved streets to an inn where with great difficulty and after long seeking lodgings had been procured for us breakfasted with mons de loutre chester and i went to the promenade people of all ranks and in various dresses walking backwards and forwards ladies with small baskets hanging on their arms long shawls of various colours thrown over their shoulders the women of the lower order dressed with great modesty went to the french theatre in the evening the piece a mixture of dull declamation and unmeaning rant the ballet unintelligible to us as the story was carried on in singing the body of the house very imperfectly lighted which has a good effect in bringing out the stage but the acting was not very amusing sundaywilliam went in the boat to harburgh in our road to the boat we looked into one of the large churches service was just ended the audience appeared to be simply composed of singing boys dressed in large cocked hats and a few old women who sat in the aisles met many brightlooking girls with white caps carrying black prayerbooks in their hands coleridge went to ratzeberg at five oclock in the diligence chester accompanied me towards altona the streets wide and pleasant in that quarter of the town immense crowds of people walking for pleasure and many pleasurewaggons passing and repassing passed through a nest of jews were invited to view an exhibition of waxwork the theatres open and the billiardtables attended the walks very pleasing between hamburgh and altona a large piece of ground planted with trees and intersected by gravel walks music cakes fruit carriages and footpassengers of all descriptions a very good view of the shipping and of altona and the town and spires of hamburgh i could not but remark how much the prospect would have suffered by one of our english canopies of coal smoke the ground on the opposite side of the elbe appears marshy there are many little canals or lines of water while the sun was yet shining pleasantly we were obliged to blink perpetually to turn our eyes to the church clock the gates are shut at halfpast six oclock and there is no admittance into the city after that time this idea deducts much from the pleasure of an evening walk you are haunted by it long before the time has elapsed wednesdaydined with mr klopstock had the pleasure of meeting his brother the poet a venerable old man retaining the liveliness and alertness of youth though he evidently can not be very far from the grave the party talked with much interest of the french comedy and seemed fond of music the poet and his lady were obliged to depart soon after six he sustained an animated conversation with william during the whole afternoon poor old man i could not look upon him the benefactor of his country the father of german poetry without emotion during my residence in hamburgh i have never seen anything like a quarrel in the streets but once and that was so trifling that it would scarcely have been noticed in england in the shops except the established booksellers and stationers i have constantly observed a disposition to cheat and take advantage of our ignorance of the language and money thursday th septemberwilliam and i set forward at twelve oclock to altona the elbe in the vicinity of hamburgh is so divided and spread out that the country looks more like a plain overflowed by heavy rain than the bed of a great river we went about a mile and a half beyond altona the roads dry and sandy and a causeway for footpassengers the houses on the banks of the elbe chiefly of brick seemed very warm and well built the small cottage houses seemed to have little gardens and all the gentlemens houses were surrounded by gardens quaintly disposed in beds and curious knots with evertwisting gravel walks and bending poplars the view of the elbe and the spreading country must be very interesting in a fine sunset there is a want of some atmospherical irradiation to give a richness to the view on returning home we were accosted by the first beggar whom we have seen since our arrival at hamburgh friday thsought coleridge at the booksellers and went to the promenade all the hamburghers full of admiral nelsons victory called at a bakers shop put two shillings into the bakers hands for which i was to have had four small rolls he gave me two i let him understand that i was to have four and with this view i took one shilling from him pointed to it and to two loaves and at the same time offering it to him again i took up two others in a savage manner he half knocked the rolls out of my hand and when i asked him for the other shilling he refused to return it and would neither suffer me to take bread nor give me back my money and on these terms i quitted the shop i am informed that it is the boast and glory of these people to cheat strangers that when a feat of this kind is successfully performed the man goes from the shop into his house and triumphantly relates it to his wife and family the hamburgher shopkeepers have three sorts of weights and a great part of their skill as shopkeepers consists in calculating upon the knowledge of the buyer and suiting him with scales accordingly saturday th septemberthe grand festival of the hamburghers dedicated to saint michael observed with solemnity but little festivity perhaps this might be partly owing to the raininess of the evening in the morning the churches were opened very early st christophers was quite full between eight and nine oclock it is a large heavylooking building immense without either grandeur or beauty built of brick and with few windows there are some pictures one of the saint fording the river with christ upon his backa giant figure which amused me not a little walked with coleridge and chester upon the promenade we took places in the morning in the brunswick coach for wednesday sunday st octobercoleridge and chester went to ratzeberg at seven oclock in the morning william and i set forward at halfpast eleven with an intention of going to blankenese the buildings all seem solid and warm in themselves but still they look cold from their nakedness of trees they are generally newly built and placed in gardens which are planted in front with poplars and low shrubs but the possessors seem to have no prospective view to a shelter for their children they do not plant behind their houses all the buildings of this character are near the road which runs at different distances from the edge of the bank which rises from the river this bank is generally steep scattered over with trees which are either not of ancient growth or from some cause do not thrive but serve very well to shelter and often conceal the more humble dwellings which are close to the sandy bank of the river we saw many carriages in one of them was klopstock the poet there are many inns and eatinghouses by the roadside we went to a pretty village or nest of houses about a league from blankenese and beyond to a large open field enclosed on one side with oak trees through which winds a pleasant gravel walk on the other it is open to the river when we were within about a mile and a half or two miles of altona we turned out of the road to go down to the river and pursued our way along the path that leads from house to house these houses are low never more than two storeys high built of brick or a mixture of brick and wood and thatched or tiled they have all windowshutters which are

whole prospect closed in upon us like a moorland valley upon a moor very wild but when we were at the top of the raise we saw the mountains before us the sun shone upon them here and there and

to see the mosses the river came galloping past the church as fast as it could come and when we got into easedale we saw churn milk force like a broad stream of snow at the little footbridge we stopped to look at the company of rivers which came hurrying down the vale this way and that it was a valley of streams and islands with that great waterfall at the head and lesser falls in different parts of the mountains coming down to these rivers we could hear the sound of the lesser falls but we could not see them we walked backwards and forwards till all distant objects except the white shape of the waterfall and the lines of the mountains were gone we had the crescent moon when we went out and at our return there were a few stars that shone dimly but it was a grey cloudy night

salmoncoloured breast a white cross or t upon its wings and a brownish back with faint stripes it began to pick upon the road at the distance of four yards from us and advanced nearer and nearer till it came within the length of ws stick without any apparent fear of us as we came up the white moss we met an old man who i saw was a beggar by his two bags hanging over his shoulder but from half laziness half indifference and wanting to try him if he would speak i let him pass he said nothing and my heart smote me i turned back and said you are begging ay says he i gave him something william judging from his appearance joined in i suppose you were a sailor ay he replied i have been years at sea of them on board a manofwar under sir hugh palmer why have you not a pension i have no pension

brown and glossy his shoes were small thin shoes low in the quarters pretty good they had belonged to a gentleman his coat was frock shaped coming over his thighs it had been joined up at the seams behind with paler blue to let it out and there were three bellshaped patches of darker blue behind where the buttons had been his breeches were either of fustian or grey cloth with strings hanging down whole and tight he had a checked shirt on and a small coloured handkerchief tied round his neck his bags were hung over each shoulder and lay on each side of him below his breast one was brownish and of coarse stuff the other was white with meal on the outside and his blue waistcoat was whitened with meal we overtook old fleming at rydale leading his little dutchmanlike grandchild along the slippery road the same face seemed to be natural to them boththe old man and the little childand they went hand in hand the grandfather cautious yet looking proud of his charge he had two patches of new cloth at the shoulderblades of his faded claretcoloured coat like eyes at each shoulder not worn elsewhere i found mary at home in her ridinghabit all her clothes being put up we were very sad about coleridge we stopped to look at the stone seat at the top of the hill there was a white cushion upon it round at the edge like a cushion and the rock behind looked soft as velvet of a vivid green and so tempting the snow too looked as soft as a down cushion a young foxglove like a star in the centre there were a few green lichens about it and a few withered brackens of fern here and there upon the ground near all else was a thick snow no footmark to it not the foot of a sheep we sate snugly round the fire i read to them the tale of constance and the syrian monarch in the man of lawes tale also some of the prologue wednesday rd mary wrote out the tales from chaucer for coleridge william worked at the ruined cottage and made himself very ill a broken soldier came to beg in the

of dreary bare hills but we had a glorious prospect to the left of saddleback halfway covered with snow and underneath the comfortable white houses and the village of threlkeld these houses and the village want trees about them skiddaw was behind us and dear coleridges desert home as we ascended the hills it grew very cold and slippery luckily the wind was at our backs and helped us on a sharp hail shower gathered at the head of martindale and the view upwards was very grandwild cottages seen through the hurrying hailshower the wind drove and eddied about and about and the hills looked large and swelling through the storm we thought of coleridge o the bonny nooks and windings and curlings of the beck down at the bottom of the steep green mossy banks we dined at the publichouse on porridge with a second course of christmas pies we were well received by the landlady and her little jewish daughter was glad to see us again the husband a very handsome man while we were eating our dinner a traveller came in he had walked over kirkstone that morning we were much amused by the curiosity of the landlord and landlady to learn who he was and by his mysterious manner of letting out a little bit of his errand and yet telling nothing he had business further up in the vale he left them with this piece of information to work upon and i doubt not they discovered who he was and all his business before the next day at that hour the woman told us of the riches of a mr walker formerly of grasmere we said what does he do nothing for his relations he has a sickly sister at grasmere why said the man i daresay if they had any sons to put forward he would do it for them but he has children of his own nbhis fortune is above Â£ and he has two children the landlord went about a mile and a half with us to put us in the right way the road was often very slippery the wind high and it was nearly dark before we got into the right road i was often obliged to crawl on all fours and mary fell many a time a stout young man whom we met on the hills and who knew mr clarkson very kindly set us into the right road and we inquired again near some houses and were directed by a miserable povertystruck looking woman who had been fetching water to go down a miry lane we soon got into the main road and reached mr clarksons at tea time mary h spent the next day with us and we walked on dunmallet before dinner but it snowed a little the day following being new years eve we accompanied mary to howtown bridge v dorothy wordsworths journal written at grasmere from st january to th july

gentle thaw she stayed with us till friday nd january on thursday we dined at mr myerss and on friday nd we parted from mary before our parting we sate under a wall in the sun near a cottage above stainton bridge the field in which we sate sloped downwards to a nearly level meadow round which the emont flowed in a small halfcircle as at lochleven the opposite bank is woody steep as a wall but not high and above that bank the fields slope gently and irregularly down to it these fields are surrounded by tall hedges with trees among them and there are clumps or grovelets of tall trees here and there sheep and cattle were in the fields dear mary there we parted from her i daresay as often as she passes that road she will turn in at the gate to look at this sweet prospect there was a barn and i think two or three cottages to be seen among the trees and slips of lawn and irregular fields during our stay at mr clarksons we walked every day except that stormy thursday we dined at thomas wilkinsons on friday the th and walked to penrith for mary the trees were covered with hoarfrostgrasses and trees and hedges beautiful a glorious sunset frost keener than ever next day thaw mrs clarkson amused us with many stories of her family and of persons whom she had known i wish i had set them down as i heard them when they were fresh in my memory mrs clarkson knew a clergyman and his wife who brought up ten children upon a curacy sent two sons to college and he left Â£ when he died the wife was very generous gave food and drink to all poor people she had a passion for feeding animals she killed a pig with feeding it over much when it was dead she said to be sure its a great loss but i thank god it did not die clemmed the cheshire word for starved her husband was very fond of playing backgammon and used to play whenever he could get anybody to play with him she had played much in her youth and was an excellent player but her husband knew nothing of this till one day she said to him youre fond of backgammon come play with me he was surprised she told him she had kept it to herself while she had a young family to attend to but that now she would play with him so they began to play and played every night mr c told us many pleasant stories his journey from london to wisbeck on foot when a schoolboy knife and stick postboy etc the white horse sleeping at the turnpike gate snoring the turnpike mans clock ticking the burring story the story of the mastiff bullbaiting by men at wisbeck footnote this refers probably to loch leven in argyll but its point is not obvious and dorothy wordsworth had not then been in scotlanded on saturday january rd we left eusemere at oclock in the morning i behind wm mr clarkson on his galloway the morning not very promising the wind cold the mountains large and dark but only thinly streaked with snow a strong wind we dined in grisdale on ham bread and milk we parted from mr c at one oclock it rained all the way home we struggled with the wind and often rested as we went along a hail shower met us before we reached the tarn and the way often was difficult over the snow but at the tarn the view closed in we saw nothing but mists and snow and at first the ice on the tarn below us cracked and split yet without water a dull grey white we lost our path and could see the tarn no longer we made our way out with difficulty guided by a heap of stones which we well remembered we were afraid of being bewildered in the mists till the darkness should overtake us we were long before we knew that we were in the right track but thanks to williams skill we knew it long before we could see our way before us there was no footmark upon the snow either of man or beast we saw four sheep before we had left the snow region the vale of grasmere when the mists broke away looked soft and grave of a yellow hue it was dark before we reached home o how happy and comfortable we felt ourselves sitting by our own fire when we had got off

pared by a knife the other is a larch several others are blown aside one is snapped in two we gathered together a faggot wm had tired himself with working we received a letter from mary with an

wrote to stuart i copied sonnets for him mr olliff called and asked us to tea tomorrow we stayed in the house till the sun shone more dimly and we thought the afternoon was closing in but though the calmness of the lake was gone with the bright sunshine yet it was delightfully pleasant we found no letter from coleridge one from sara which we sate upon the wall to read a sweet long letter with a most interesting account of mr patrick we cooked no dinner sate a while by the fire and then drank tea at frank ratys as we went past the nab i was surprised to see the youngest child amongst them running about by itself with a canny round fat face and rosy cheeks i called in they gave me some nuts everybody surprised that we should come over grisdale paid Â£ for letters come since december st paid also about shillings at penrith the bees were humming about the hive william raked a few stones off the garden his first garden labour this year i cut the shrubs when we returned from franks wm

paradise lost after dinner we walked to ambleside a heartrending letter from coleridge we were sad as we could be wm wrote to him we talked about wms going to london it was a mild afternoon there was an unusual softness in the prospects as we went a rich yellow upon the fields and a soft grave purple on the waters when we returned many stars were out the clouds were moveless and the sky soft purple the lake of rydale calm jupiter behind jupiter at least we call him but william says we always call the largest star jupiter when we came home we both wrote to c i was stupefied saturday january tha cold dark morning william chopped wood i brought it in a basket he asked me to set down the story of barbara wilkinsons turtle dove barbara is an old maid she had two turtle doves one of them died the first year i think the other continued to live alone in its cage for nine years but for one whole year it had a companion and daily visitora little mouse that used to come and feed with it and the dove would carry it and cover it over with its wings and make a loving noise to it the mouse though it did not testify equal delight in the doves company was yet at perfect ease the poor mouse disappeared and the dove was left solitary till its death it died of a short sickness and was buried under a tree with funeral ceremony by barbara and her maidens and one or two others on saturday th wm worked at the pedlar all the morning he kept the dinner waiting till four oclock he was much tired sunday stwm had slept very ill he was tired we walked round the two lakes grasmere was very soft and rydale was extremely beautiful from the western side nab scar was just topped by a cloud which cutting it off as high as it could be cut off made the mountain look uncommonly lofty we sate down a long time with different plans i always love to walk that way because it is the way i first came to rydale and grasmere and because our dear coleridge did also when i came with wm and years ago it was just at sunset there was a rich yellow light on the waters and the islands were reflected there today it was grave and soft but not perfectly calm william says it was much such a day as when coleridge came with him the sun shone out before we reached grasmere we sate by the roadside at the foot of the lake close to marys dear name which she had cut herself upon the stone wm cut at it with his knife to make it plainer we amused ourselves for a long time in watching the breezes some as if they came from the bottom of the lake spread in a circle brushing along the surface of the water and growing more delicate as it were thinner and of a paler colour till they died away others spread out like a peacocks tail and some went right forward this way and that in all directions the lake was still where these breezes were not but they made it all alive i found a strawberry blossom in a rock the little slender flower had more courage than the green leaves for they were but half expanded and half grown but the blossom was spread full out i uprooted it rashly and i felt as if i had been committing an outrage so i planted it again it will have but a stormy life of it but let it live if it can we found calvert here i brought a handkerchief full of mosses which i placed on the chimneypiece when calvert was gone he dined with us and carried away the encyclopÃ¦dias after they were gone i spent some time in trying to reconcile myself to the change and in rummaging out and arranging some other books in their places one good thing is thisthere is a nice elbow place for wm and he may sit for the picture of john bunyan any day mr simpson drank tea with us we paid our rent to benson footnote compare the poem to the clouds vol viii p and the fenwick note to that poemed footnote this still exists but is known to fewed monday february stwm slept badly i baked bread william worked hard at the pedlar and tired himself there was a purplish light upon mr olliffs house which made me look to the other side of the vale when i saw a strange stormy mist coming down the side of silver how of a reddish purple colour it soon came on a heavy rain a box with books came from london i sate by ws bedside and read in the pleasures of hope to him which came in the box he could not fall asleep tuesday nd february wm went into the orchard after breakfast to chop wood we walked into easedale walked backwards and forwards between goody bridge and butterlip how william wished to break off composition but was unable and so did himself harm the sun shone but it was cold william worked at the pedlar after tea i read aloud the eleventh book of paradise lost we were much impressed and also melted into tears the papers came in soon after i had laid aside the booka good thing for my wm wednesday rda rainy morning we walked to rydale for letters found one from mrs cookson and mary h it snowed upon the hills we sate down on the wall at the foot of white moss sate by the fire in

island was quite green the sun had melted all the snow wm working at his poem we sate by the fire and did not walk but read the pedlar thinking it done but w could find fault with one part of it it was uninteresting and must be altered poor wm monday morning th february it was very windy and rained hard all the morning william worked at his poem and i read a little in lessing and the grammar a chaise came past after dinner ie we set off at about past we went towards rydale for letters it was a cauld clash the rain had been so cold that it hardly melted the snow we stopped at parks to get some straw round wms shoes the young mother was sitting by a bright wood fire with her youngest child upon her lap and the other two sate on each side of the chimney the light of the fire made them a beautiful sight with their innocent countenances their rosy cheeks and glossy curling hair we sate and talked about poor ellis and our journey over the hawes before we had come to the shore of the lake we met our patient bowbent friend with his little wooden box at his back where are you going said he to rydale for letters i have two for you in my box we lifted up the lid and there they lay poor fellow he straddled and pushed on with all his might but we outstripped him far away when we had turned back with our letters i could not help comparing lots with him he goes at that slow pace every morning and after having wrought a hard days work returns at night however weary he may be takes it all quietly and though perhaps he neither feels thankfulness nor pleasure when he eats his supper and has nothing to look forward to but falling asleep in bed yet i daresay he neither murmurs nor thinks it hard he seems mechanised to labour we broke the seal of coleridges letters and i had light enough just to see that he was not ill i put it in my pocket at the top of the white moss i took it to my bosoma safer place for it the sight was wild there was a strange mountain lightness when we were at the top of the white moss i have often observed it there in the evenings being between the two valleys there is more of the sky there than any other place it has a strange effect sometimes along with the obscurity of evening or night it seems almost like a peculiar sort of light there was not much wind till we came to johns grove then it roared right out of the grove all the trees were tossing about coleridges letter somewhat damped us it spoke with less confidence about france wm wrote to him the other letter was from montagu with Â£ wm was very unwell tired when he had written he went to bed and left me to write to m h montagu and calvert and mrs coleridge i had written in his letter to coleridge we wrote to calvert to beg him not to fetch us on sunday wm left me with a little peat fire it grew less i wrote on and was starved at oclock i went to put my letters under fletchers door i never felt such a cold night there was a strong wind and it froze very hard i gathered together all the clothes i could find for i durst not go into the pantry for fear of waking wm at first when i went to bed i seemed to be warm i suppose because the cold air which i had just left no longer touched my body but i soon found that i was mistaken i could not sleep from sheer cold i had baked pies and bread in the morning coleridges letter contained prescriptions nbthe moon came out suddenly when we were at johns grove and a star or two besides tuesdaywm had slept better he fell to work and made himself unwell we did not walk a funeral came by of a poor woman who had drowned herself some say because she was hardly treated by her husband others that he was a very decent respectable man and she but an indifferent wife however this was she had only been married to him last whitsuntide and had had very indifferent health ever since she had got up in the night and drowned herself in the pond she had requested to be buried beside her mother and so she was brought in a hearse she was followed by some very decentlooking men on horseback her sisterthomas flemings wifein a chaise and some others with her and a cart full of women molly says folks thinks o their mothers poor body she has been little thought of by any body else we did a little of lessing i attempted a fable but my head ached my bones were sore with the cold of the day before and i was downright stupid we went to bed but not till wm had tired himself wednesday tha very snowy morning i was writing out the poem as we hoped for a final writing we read the first part and were delighted with it but wm afterwards got to some ugly place and went to bed tired out a wild moonlight night thursday th wm sadly tired and working at the pedlar we made up a good fire after dinner and wm brought his mattress out and lay down on the floor i read to him the life of ben jonson and some short poems of his which were too interesting for him and would not let him go to sleep i had begun with fletcher but he was too dull for me fuller says in his life of jonson speaking of his plays if his latter be not so spriteful and vigorous as his first pieces all that are old and all who desire to be old should excuse him therein he says he beheld witcombats between shakespeare and jonson and compares shakespeare to an english manofwar jonson to a great spanish galleon there is one affecting line in jonsons epitaph on his first daughter here lies to each her parents ruth mary the daughter of their youth at six months end she parted hence in safety of her innocence two beggars today i continued to read to wm we were much delighted with the poem of penshurst wm rose better i was cheerful and happy he got to work again footnote by ben jonsoned friday tha very fine bright clear hard frost wm working again i recopied the pedlar but poor wm all the time at work in the afternoon a poor woman came she said to beg but she has been used to go abegging for she has often come here her father lived to the age of she is a woman of strong bones with a complexion that has been beautiful and remained very fresh last year but now she looks broken and her little boya pretty little fellow and whom i have loved for the sake of basillooks thin and pale i observed this to her aye says she we have all been ill our house was nearly unroofed in the storm and we lived in it so for more than a week the child wears a ragged drab coat and a fur cap poor little fellow i think he seems scarcely at all grown since the first time i saw him william was with me when we met him in a lane going to skelwith bridge he looked very pretty he was walking lazily in the deep narrow lane overshadowed with the hedgerows his meal poke hung over his shoulder he said he was going a laiting poor creature he now wears the same coat he had on at that time when the woman was gone i could not help thinking that we are not half thankful enough that we are placed in that condition of life in which we are we do not so often bless god for this as we wish for this Â£ that Â£ etc etc we have not however to reproach ourselves with ever breathing a murmur this womans was but a common case the snow still lies upon the ground just at the closing in of the day i heard a cart pass the door and at the same time the dismal sound of a crying infant i went to the window and had light enough to see that a man was driving a cart which seemed not to be very full and that a woman with an infant in her arms was following close behind and a dog close to her it was a wild and melancholy sight wm rubbed his tables after candles were lighted and we sate a long time with the windows unclosed and almost finished writing the pedlar but poor wm wore himself out and me out with labour we had an affecting conversation went to bed at oclock saturday thit snowed a little this morning still at work at the pedlar altering and refitting we did not walk though it was a very fine day we received a present of eggs and milk from janet dockeray and just before she went the little boy from the hill brought us a letter from sara h and one from the frenchman in london i wrote to sara after tea and wm took out his old newspapers and the new ones came in soon after we sate after i had finished the letter talking and wm read parts of his recluse aloud to me sunday th februarya fine morning the sun shines out but it has been a hard frost in the night there are some little snowdrops that are afraid to put their white heads quite out and a few blossoms of hepatica that are halfstarved wm left me at work altering some passages of the pedlar and went into the orchard the fine day pushed him on to resolve and as soon as i had read a letter to him which i had just received from mrs clarkson he said he would go to penrith so molly was despatched for the horse i worked hard got the writing finished and all quite trim i wrote to mrs clarkson and put up some letters for mary h and off he went in his blue spencer and a pair of new pantaloons fresh from london i then sate over the fire reading ben jonsons penshurst and other things before sunset i put on my shawl and walked out the snowcovered mountains were spotted with rich sunlight a palish buffish colour i stood at the wishinggate and when i came in view of rydale i cast a long look upon the mountains beyond they were very white but i concluded that wm would have a very safe passage over kirkstone and i was quite easy about him after dinner a little before sunset i walked out about yards above glowworm rock i met a carman a highlander i suppose with four carts the first three belonging to himself the last evidently to a man and his family who had joined company with him and who i guessed to be potters the carman was cheering his horses and talking to a little lass about ten years of age who seemed to make him her companion she ran to the wall and took up a large stone to support the wheel of one of his carts and ran on before with it in her arms to be ready for him she was a beautiful creature and there was something uncommonly impressive in the lightness and joyousness of her manner her business seemed to be all pleasurepleasure in her own motions and the man looked at her as if he too was pleased and spoke to her in the same tone in which he spoke to his horses there was a wildness in her whole figure not the wildness of a mountain lass but of the road lass a traveller from her birth who had wanted neither food nor clothes her mother followed the last cart with a lovely child perhaps about a year old at her back and a goodlooking girl about fifteen years old walked beside her all the children were like the mother she had a very fresh complexion but she was blown with fagging up the steep hill and with what she carried her husband was helping the horse to drag the cart up by pushing it with his shoulder i reached home and read german till about oclock i wrote to coleridge went to bed at about oclock i slept badly for my thoughts were full of wm monday th februaryit snowed a good deal and was terribly cold after dinner it was fair but i was obliged to run all the way to the foot of the white moss to get the least bit of warmth into me i found a letter from c he was much better this was very satisfactory but his letter was not an answer to wms which i expected a letter from annette i got tea when i reached home and then set on reading german i wrote part of a letter to coleridge went to bed and slept badly tuesday tha fine morning but i had persuaded myself not to expect wm i believe because i was afraid of being disappointed i ironed all day he came just at tea time had only seen mary h for a couple of hours between eamont bridge and hartshorn tree mrs c better he had had a difficult journey over kirkstone and came home by threlkeld we spent a sweet evening he was better had altered the pedlar we went to bed pretty soon mr graham said he wished wm had been with him the other dayhe was riding in a postchaise and he heard a strange cry that he could not understand the sound continued and he called to the chaise driver to stop it was a little girl that was crying as if her heart would burst she had got up behind the chaise and her cloak had been caught by the wheel and was jammed in and it hung there she was crying after it poor thing mr graham took her into the chaise and her cloak was released from the wheel but the childs misery did not cease for her cloak was torn to rags it had been a miserable cloak before but she had no other and it was the greatest sorrow that could befall her her name was alice fell she had no parents and belonged to the next town at the next town mr g left money with some respectable people in the town to buy her a new cloak footnote see the poem alice fell in the poetical

coleridge in the evening we walked to the top of the hill then to the bridge we hung over the wall and looked at the deep stream below it came with a full steady yet a very rapid flow down to the lake the sykes made a sweet sound everywhere and looked very interesting in the twilight and that little one above mr olliffs house was very impressive a ghostly white serpent line it made a sound most distinctly heard of itself the mountains were black and steep the tops of some of them having snow yet visible footnote see poetical works vol ii p ed tuesday rd when we came out of our own doors that dear thrush was singing upon the topmost of the smooth branches of the ash tree at the top of the orchard how long it had been perched on that same tree i can not tell but we had heard its dear voice in the orchard the day through along with a cheerful undersong made by our winter friends the robins as we came home i picked up a few mosses by the roadside which i left at home we then went to johns grove there we sate a little while looking at the fading landscape the lake though the objects on the shore were fading seemed brighter than when it is perfect day and the island pushed itself upwards distinct and large all the shores marked there was a sweet sealike sound in the trees above our heads we walked backwards and forwards some time for dear johns sake then walked to look at rydale wm

whom i had seen in may now nearly two years ago when john and he were at gallow hill i sate with him at intervals all the morning took down his stanzas etc after tea i read to william that account of the little boy belonging to the tall woman and an unlucky thing it was for he could not escape from those very words and so he could not write the poem he left it unfinished and went tired to bed in our walk from rydale he had got warmed with the subject and had half cast the poem sunday morningwilliam got up at nine oclock but before he rose he had finished the beggar boy and while we were at breakfast he wrote the poem to a butterfly he ate not a morsel but sate with his shirt neck unbuttoned and his waistcoat open while he did it the thought first came upon him as we were talking about the pleasure we both always felt at the sight of a butterfly i told him that i used to chase them a little but that i was afraid of brushing the dust off their wings and did not catch them he told me how he used to kill all the white ones when he went to school because they were frenchmen i wrote it down and the other poems and i read them all over to him william began to try to alter the butterfly and tired himself monday morningwe sate reading the poems and i read a little german during ws absence a sailor who was travelling from liverpool to whitehaven called he was faint and pale

mother after dinner i read him to sleep i read spenser we walked to look at rydale the moon was a good height above the mountains she seemed far distant in the sky there were two stars beside her that twinkled in and out and seemed almost like butterflies in motion and lightness they looked to be far nearer to us than the moon wednesdaywilliam went up into the orchard and finished the poem i went and sate with w and walked backwards and forwards in the orchard till dinner time he read me his poem i read to him and my beloved slept a sweet evening as it had been a sweet day and i walked quietly along the side of rydale lake with quiet thoughtsthe hills and the lake were stillthe owls had not begun to hoot and the little birds had given over singing i looked before me and saw a red light upon silver how as if coming out of the vale below there was a light of most strange birth a light that came out of the earth and spread along the dark hillside thus i was going on when i saw the shape of my beloved in the road at a little distance we turned back to see the light but it was fadingalmost gone the owls hooted when we sate on the wall at the foot of white moss the sky broke more and more and we saw the moon now and then john gill passed us with his cart we sate on when we came in sight of our own dear grasmere the vale looked fair and quiet in the moonshine the church was there and all the cottages there were huge slowtravelling clouds in the sky that threw large masses of shade upon some of the mountains we walked backwards and forwards between home and olliffs till i was tired william kindled and began to write the poem we carried cloaks into the orchard and sate a while there i left him and he nearly finished the poem i was tired to death and went to bed before him he came down to me and read the poem to me in bed a sailor begged here today going to glasgow he spoke cheerfully in a sweet tone thursdayrydale vale was full of life and motion the wind blew briskly and the lake was covered all over with bright silver waves that were there each the twinkling of an eye then others rose up and took their place as fast as they went away the rocks glittered in the sunshine the crows and the ravens were busy and the thrushes and little birds sang i went through the fields and sate for an hour afraid to pass a cow the cow looked at me and i looked at the cow and whenever i stirred the cow gave over eating a parcel came in from birmingham with lambs play for us and for c as we came along ambleside vale in the twilight it was a grave evening there was something in the air that compelled me to various thoughtsthe hills were large closed in by the sky night was come on and the moon was overcast but as i climbed the moss the moon came out from behind a mountain mass of black clouds o the unutterable darkness of the sky and the earth below the moon and the glorious brightness of the moon itself there was a vivid sparkling streak of light at this end of rydale water but the rest was very dark and loughrigg fell and silver how were white and bright as if they were covered with hoar frost the moon retired again and appeared and disappeared several times before i reached home once there was no moonlight to be seen but upon the islandhouse and the promontory of the island where it stands that needs must be a holy place etc etc i had many very exquisite feelings and when i saw this lofty building in the waters among the dark and lofty hills with that bright soft light upon it it made me more than half a poet i was tired when i reached home and could not sit down to reading i tried to write verses but alas i gave up expecting william and went soon to bed fridaya very rainy morning i went up into the lane to collect a few green mosses to make the chimney gay against my darlings return poor c i did not wish for or expect him it rained so coleridge came in his eyes were a little swollen with the wind i was much affected by the sight of him he seemed halfstupefied william came in soon after coleridge went to bed late and william and i sate up till four oclock a letter from sara sent by mary they disputed about ben jonson my spirits were agitated very much saturday when i awoke the whole vale was covered with snow william and coleridge walked we had a little talk about going abroad after tea william read the pedlar talked about

sharp windy night thomas wilkinson came with me to barton and questioned me like a catechiser all the way every question was like the snapping of a little thread about my heart i was so full of thought of my halfread letter and other things i was glad when he left me then i had time to look at the moon while i was thinking my own thoughts the moon travelled through the clouds tinging them yellow as she passed along with two stars near her one larger than the other these stars grew and diminished as they passed from or went into the clouds at this time william as i found the next day was riding by himself between middleham and barnard castle tuesday th aprilmrs c waked me from sleep with a letter from coleridge i walked along the lake side the air was become still the lake was of a bright slate colour the hills darkening the bays shot into the low fading shores sheep resting all things quiet when i returned william was come the surprise shot through me thursday thit was a threatening misty morning but mild we set off after dinner from eusemere mrs clarkson went a short way with us but turned back the wind was furious and we thought we must have returned we first rested in the large boathouse then under a furze bush opposite mr clarksons saw the plough going in the field the wind seized our breath the lake was rough there was a boat by itself floating in the middle of the bay below water millock we rested again in the water millock lane the hawthorns are black and green the birches here and there greenish but there is yet more of purple to be seen on the twigs we got over into a field to avoid some cowspeople working a few primroses by the roadsidewoodsorrel flower the anemone scentless violets strawberries and that starry yellow flower which mrs c calls pile wort when we were in the woods beyond gowbarrow park we saw a few daffodils close to the waterside we fancied that the sea had floated the seeds ashore and that the little colony had so sprung up but as we went along there were more and yet more and at last under the boughs of the trees we saw that there was a long belt of them along the shore about the breadth of a country turnpike road i never saw daffodils so beautiful they grew among the mossy stones about and above them some rested their heads upon these stones as on a pillow for weariness and the rest tossed and reeled and danced and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the lake they looked so gay ever glancing ever changing this wind blew directly over the lake to them there was here and there a little knot and a few stragglers higher up but they were so few as not to disturb the simplicity unity and life of that one busy highway we rested again and again the bays were stormy and we heard the waves at different distances and in the middle of the water like the sea all was cheerless and gloomy so we faced the storm at dobsons i was very kindly treated by a young woman the landlady looked sour but it is her way william was sitting by a good fire when i came downstairs he soon made his way to the library piled up in a corner of the window he brought out a volume of enfields speaker another miscellany and an odd volume of congreves plays we had a glass of warm rum and water we enjoyed ourselves and wished for mary it rained and blew when we went to bed friday th april good fridaywhen i undrew curtains in the morning i was much affected by the beauty of the prospect and the change the sun shone the wind had passed away the hills looked cheerful the river was very bright as it flowed into the lake the church rises up behind a little knot of rocks the steeple not so high as an ordinary threestory house trees in a row in the garden under the wall the valley is at first broken by little woody knolls that make retiring places fairy valleys in the vale the river winds along under these hills travelling not in a bustle but not slowly to the lake we saw a fisherman in the flat meadow on the other side of the water he came towards us and threw his line over the twoarched bridge it is a bridge of a heavy construction almost bending inwards in the middle but it is grey and there is a look of ancientry in the architecture of it that pleased me as we go on the vale opens out more into one vale with somewhat of a cradle bed cottages with groups of trees on the side of the hills we passed a pair of twin children two years old sate on the next bridge which we crosseda single arch we rested again upon the turf and looked at the same bridge we observed arches in the water occasioned by the large stones sending it down in two streams a sheep came plunging through the river stumbled up the bank and passed close to us it had been frightened by an insignificant little dog on the other side its fleece dropped a glittering shower under its belly primroses by the roadside pile wort that shone like stars of gold in the sun violets strawberries retired and halfburied among the grass when we came to the foot of brothers water i left william sitting on the bridge and went along the path on the right side of the lake through the wood i was delighted with what i saw the water under the boughs of the bare old trees the simplicity of the mountains and the exquisite beauty of the path there was one grey cottage i repeated the glowworm as i walked along i hung over the gate and thought i could have stayed for ever when i returned i found william writing a poem descriptive of the sights and sounds we saw and heard there was the gentle flowing of the stream the glittering lively lake green fields without a living creature to be seen on them behind us a flat pasture with fortytwo cattle feeding to our left the road leading to the hamlet no smoke there the sun shone on the bare roofs the people were at work ploughing harrowing and sowing a dog barking now and then cocks crowing birds twittering the snow in patches at the top of the highest hills yellow palms purple and green twigs on the birches ashes with their glittering stems quite bare the hawthorn a bright green with black stems under the oak the moss of the oak glossy we went on passed two sisters at work they first passed us one with two pitchforks in her hand the other had a spade we had come to talk with them they laughed long after we were gone perhaps half in wantonness half boldness william finished his poem before we got to the foot of kirkstone there were hundreds of cattle in the vale there we ate our dinner the walk up kirkstone was very interesting the becks among the rocks were all alive william showed me the little mossy streamlet which he had before loved when he saw its bright green track in the snow the view above ambleside very beautiful there we sate and looked down on the green vale we watched the crows at a little distance from us become white as silver as they flew in the sunshine and when they went still further they looked like shapes of water passing over the green fields the whitening of ambleside church is a great deduction from the beauty of it seen from this point we called at the luffs the roddingtons there did not go in and went round by the fields i pulled off my stockings intending to wade the beck but i was obliged to put them on and we climbed over the wall at the bridge the post passed us no letters rydale lake was in its own evening brightness the island and points distinct jane ashburner came up to us when we were sitting upon the wall the garden looked pretty in the halfmoonlight halfdaylight as we went up the vale footnote see the cock is crowing etc vol ii p ed saturday tha mild warm rain we sate in the garden all the morning william dug a little i transplanted a honeysuckle the lake was still the sheep on the island reflected in the water like the greydeer we saw in gowbarrow park we walked after tea by moonlight i had been in bed in the afternoon and william had slept in his chair we walked towards rydale backwards and forwards below mr olliffs the village was beautiful in the moonlight helm crag we observed very distinct the dead hedge round bensons field bound together at the top by an interlacing of ash sticks which made a chain of silver when we faced the moon a letter from c and also one from s h i saw a robin chasing a scarlet butterfly this morning sunday thagain a mild grey morning with rising vapours we sate in the orchard william wrote the poem on the robin and the butterfly william met me at rydale with the conclusion of the poem of the robin i read it to him in bed we left out some lines footnote see vol ii p ed tuesday tha beautiful morning the sun shone william wrote a conclusion to the poem of the butterfly ive watched you now a full halfhour footnote published as a separate poemed i was quite out of spirits and went into the orchard when i came in he had finished the poem it was a beautiful afternoon the sun shone upon the level fields and they grew greener beneath the eye houses village all cheerfulpeople at work we sate in the orchard and repeated the glowworm and other poems just when william came to a well or trough which there is in lord darlingtons park he began to write that poem of the glowworm interrupted in going through the town of staindrop finished it about miles and a half beyond staindrop he did not feel the jogging of the horse while he was writing but when he had done he felt the effect of it and his fingers were cold with his gloves his horse fell with him on the other side of st helens auckland so much for the glowworm it was written coming from middleham on monday th april on tuesday th when we were sitting after tea coleridge came to the door i startled him with my voice c came up fatigued but i afterwards found he looked well william was not well and i was in low spirits wednesday stwilliam and i sauntered a little in the garden coleridge came to us and repeated the verses he wrote to sara i was affected with them and in miserable spirits the sunshine the green fields and the fair sky made me sadder even the little happy sporting lambs seemed but sorrowful to me the pile wort spread out on the grass a thousand shiny stars the primroses were there and the remains of a few daffodils the well which we cleaned out last night is still but a little muddy pond though full of water read fergusons life and a poem or two footnote can these verses have been the first draft of dejection an ode in its earliest and afterwards abandoned form it is said to have been written on nd april ed thursday nda fine mild morning we walked into easedale the sun shone coleridge talked of his plan of sowing the laburnum in the woods the waters were high for there had been a great quantity of rain in the night i was tired and sate under the shade of a holly tree that grows upon a rock and looked down the stream i then went to the single holly behind that single rock in the field and sate upon the grass till they came from the waterfall i saw them there and heard william flinging stones into the river whose roaring was loud even where i was when they returned william was repeating the poem i have thoughts that are fed by the sun it had been called to his mind by the dying away of the stunning of the waterfall when he got behind a stone friday rd april it being a beautiful morning we set off at oclock intending to stay out of doors all the morning we went towards rydale and before we got to tom dawsons we determined to go under nab scar thither we went the sun shone and we were lazy coleridge pitched upon several places to sit down upon but we could not be all of one mind respecting sun and shade so we pushed on to the foot of the scar it was very grand when we looked up very stony here and there a budding tree william observed that the umbrella yew tree that breasts the wind had lost its character as a tree and had become something like to solid wood coleridge and i pushed on before we left william sitting on the stones feasting with silence and coleridge and i sat down upon a rocky seata couch it might be under the bower of williams eglantine andrews broom he was below us and we could see him he came to us and repeated his poems while we sate beside him upon the ground he had made himself a seat in the crumbling ground afterwards we lingered long looking into the vales ambleside vale with the copses the village under the hill and the green fields rydale with a lake all alive and glittering yet but little stirred by breezes and our dear grasmere making a little round lake of natures own with never a house never a green field but the copses and the bare hills enclosing it and the river flowing out of it above rose the coniston fells in their own shape and colournot mans hills but all for themselves the sky and the clouds and a few wild creatures c went to search for something new we saw him climbing up towards a rock he called us and we found him in a bowerthe sweetest that was ever seen the rock on one side is very high and all covered with ivy which hung loosely about and bore bunches of brown berries on the other side it was higher than my head we looked down on the ambleside vale that seemed to wind away from us the village lying under the hill the firtree island was reflected beautifully about this bower there is mountainash commonash yewtree ivy holly hawthorn grasses and flowers and a carpet of moss above at the top of the rock there is another spot it is scarce a bower a little parlour only not enclosed by walls but shaped out for a restingplace by the rocks and the ground rising about it it had a sweet moss carpet we resolved to go and plant flowers in both these places tomorrow we wished for mary and sara dined late after dinner wm and i worked in the garden c received a letter from sara footnote see the waterfall and the eglantine and the oak and the broom vol ii pp ed saturday tha very wet day william called me out to see a waterfall behind the barberry tree we walked in the evening to rydale coleridge and i lingered behind c stopped up the little runnel by the roadside to make a lake we all stood to look at glowworm rocka primrose that grew there and just looked out on the road from its own sheltered bower the clouds moved as william observed in one regular body like a multitude in motiona sky all clouds over not one cloud on our return it broke a little out and we saw here and there a star one appeared but for a moment in a pale blue sky footnote see

kitchen he came on a little pony we then went to johns grove sate a while at first afterwards william lay and i lay in the trench under the fencehe with his eyes shut and listening to the waterfalls and the birds there was no one waterfall above anotherit was a sound of waters in the airthe voice of the air william heard me breathing and rustling now and then but we both lay still and unseen by one another he thought that it would be so sweet thus to lie in the grave to hear the peaceful sounds of the earth and just to know that our dear friends were near the lake was still there was a boat out silver how reflected with delicate purple and yellowish hues as i have seen spar lambs on the island and running races together by the halfdozen in the round field near us the copses greenish hawthorns green cottages smoking as i lay down on the grass i observed the glittering silver line on the ridge of the backs of the sheep owing to their situation respecting the sun which made them look beautiful but with something of strangeness like animals of another kind as if belonging to a more splendid world i got mullins and pansies friday april thwe came into the orchard directly after breakfast and sate there the lake was calm the day cloudy two fishermen by the lake side william began to write the poem of the celandine walked backwards and forwards with williamhe repeated his poem to me then he got to work again and would not give over he had not finished his dinner till oclock after dinner we took up the fur gown into the hollins above we found a sweet seat and thither we will often go we spread the gown put on each a cloak and there we lay william fell asleep he had a bad headache owing to his having been disturbed the night before with reading cs letter i did not sleep but lay with halfshut eyes looking at the prospect as on a vision almost i was so resigned to it loughrigg fell was the most distant hill then came the lake slipping in between the copses above the copse the round swelling field nearer to me a wild intermixture of rocks trees and patches of grassy ground when we turned the corner of our little shelter we saw the church and the whole vale it is a blessed place the birds were about us on all sides skobbies robins bullfinches and crows now and then flew over our heads as we were warned by the sound of the beating of the air above we stayed till the light of day was going and the little birds had begun to settle their singing but there was a thrush not far off that seemed to sing louder and clearer than the thrushes had sung when it was quite day we came in at oclock got tea wrote to coleridge and i wrote to mrs clarkson part of a letter we went to bed at minutes past with prayers that william might sleep well footnote see vol ii p ed footnote resigned is curiously used in the lake district a woman there once told me that mr ruskin was very much resigned to his own companyed saturday may strose not till halfpast a heavenly morning as soon as breakfast was over we went into the garden and sowed the scarlet beans about the house it was a clear sky i sowed the flowers william helped me we then went and sate in the orchard till dinner time it was very hot william wrote the celandine we planned a shed for the sun was too much for us after dinner we went again to our old restingplace in the hollins under the rock we first lay under the holly where we saw nothing but the holly tree and a budding elm tree mossed with the sky above our heads but that holly tree had a beauty about it more than its own knowing as we did when we arose when the sun had got low enough we went to the rock shade oh the overwhelming beauty of the vale below greener than green two ravens flew high high in the sky and the sun shone upon their bellies and their wings long after there was none of his light to be seen but a little space on the top of loughrigg fell heard the cuckoo today this first of may we went down to tea at oclock and returned after tea the landscape was fading sheep and lambs quiet among the rocks we walked towards kings and backwards and forwards the sky was perfectly cloudless nb it is often so three solitary stars in the middle of the blue vault one or two on the points of the high hills footnote doubtless the second of the two poems beginning thus pleasures newly found are sweet ed tuesday th maythough william went to bed nervous and jaded in the extreme he rose refreshed i wrote out the leech gatherer for him which he had begun the night before and of which he wrote several stanzas in bed this morning they started to walk to wytheburn it was very hot we rested several times by the wayread and repeated the leech gatherer we saw coleridge on the wytheburn side of the water he crossed the beck to us mr simpson was fishing there william and i ate luncheon and then went on towards the waterfall it is a glorious wild solitude under that lofty purple crag it stood upright by itself its own self and its shadow below one mass all else was sunshine we went on further a bird at the top of the crag was flying round and round and looked in thinness and transparency shape and motion like a moth we climbed the hill but looked in vain for a shade except at the foot of the great waterfall we came down and rested upon a mosscovered rock rising out of the bed of the river there we lay ate our dinner and stayed there till about four oclock or later william and coleridge repeated and read verses i drank a little brandy and water and was in heaven the stags horn is very beautiful and fresh springing upon the fells mountain ashes green we drank tea at a farm house we parted from coleridge at saras crag after having looked for the letters which c carved in the morning i missed them all william deepened the x with cs penknife we sate afterwards on the wall seeing the sun go down and the reflections in the still water c looked well and parted from us cheerfully hopping upon the side stones on the raise we met a woman with two little girls one in her arms the other about four years old walking by her side a pretty little thing but halfstarved young as she was she walked carefully with them alas too young for such cares and such travels the mother when we accosted her told us how her husband had left her and gone off with another woman and how she pursued them then her fury kindled and her eyes rolled about she changed again to tears she was a cockermouth woman thirty years of agea child at cockermouth when i was i was moved and gave her a shilling we had the crescent moon with the auld moon in her arms we rested often always upon the bridges reached home at about ten oclock we went soon to bed i repeated verses to william while he was in bed he was soothed and i left him this is the spot over and over again wednesday th maya very fine morning rather cooler than yesterday we planted threefourths of the bower i made bread we sate in the orchard the thrush sang all day as he always sings i wrote to the hutchinsons and to coleridge packed off thalaba william had kept off work till near bedtime when we returned from our walk then he began again and went to bed very nervous we walked in the twilight and walked till night came on the moon had the old moon in her arms but not so plain to be seen as the night before when we went to bed it was a boat without the circle i read the lovers complaint to william in bed and left him composed thursday th maya sweet morning we have put the finishing stroke to our bower and here we are sitting in the orchard it is one oclock we are sitting upon a seat under the wall which i found my brother building up when i came to him he had intended that it should have been done before i came it is a nice cool shady spot the small birds are singing lambs bleating cuckoos calling the thrush sings by fits thomas ashburners axe is going quietly without passion in the orchard hens are cackling flies humming the women talking together at their doors plum and pear trees are in blossomapple trees greenishthe opposite woods green the crows are cawing we have heard ravens the ash trees are in blossom birds flying all about us the stitchwort is coming out there is one budding lychnis the primroses are passing their prime celandine violets and wood sorrel for ever more little geraniums and pansies on the wall we walked in the evening to tail end to inquire about hurdles for the orchard shed when we came in we found a magazine and review and a letter from coleridge verses to hartley and sara h we read the review etc the moon was a perfect boat a silver boat when we were out in the evening the birch tree is all over green in small leaf more light and elegant than when it is full out it bent to the breezes as if for the love of its own delightful motions sloethorns and hawthorns in the hedges friday th maywilliam had slept uncommonly well so feeling himself strong he fell to work at the leech gatherer he wrote hard at it till dinner time then he gave over tired to deathhe had finished the poem i was making derwents frocks after dinner we sate in the orchard it was a thick hazy dull air the thrush sang almost continually the little birds were more than usually busy with their voices the sparrows are now full fledged the nest is so full that they lie upon one another they sit quietly in their nest with closed mouths i walked to rydale after tea which we drank by the kitchen fire the evening very dull a terrible kind of threatening brightness at sunset above easedale the sloethorn beautiful in

trees are just putting forth yellow knots of leaves the ashes with their flowers passing away and leaves coming out the blue hyacinth is not quite full blown gowans are coming out marsh marigolds in full glory the little star plant a star without a flower we took home a great load of gowans and planted them about the orchard after dinner i worked bread then came and mended stockings beside william he fell asleep after tea i walked to rydale for letters it was a strange night the hills were covered over with a slight covering of hail or snow just so as to give them a hoary winter look with the black rocks the woods looked miserable the coppices green as grass which looked quite unnatural and they seemed half shrivelled up as if they shrank from the air o thought i what a beautiful thing god has made winter to be by stripping the trees and letting us see their shapes and forms what a freedom does it seem to give to the storms there were several new flowers out but i had no pleasure in looking at them i walked as fast as i could back again with my letter from s h met william at the top of white moss near ten when we came in william and molly had dug the ground and

cool the young bullfinches in their partycoloured raiment bustle about among the blossoms and poise themselves like wiredancers or tumblers shaking the twigs and dashing off the blossoms there is yet one primrose in the orchard the stitchwort is fading the vetches are in abundance blossoming and seeding that pretty little wavylooking diallike yellow flower the speedwell and some others whose names

orchard after i had written to m h then on to mr olliffs intake the columbine was growing upon the rocks here and there a solitary plant sheltered and shaded by the tufts and bowers of trees it is a graceful slender creature a female seeking retirement and growing freest and most graceful where it is most alone i observed that the more shaded plants were always the tallest a short note and gooseberries from coleridge we walked upon the turf near johns grove it was a lovely night the clouds of the western sky reflected a saffron light upon the upper end of the lake all was still we went to look at rydale there was an alpine firelike red upon the tops of the mountains this was gone when we came in view of the lake but we saw the lake from a new and most beautiful point of view between two little rocks and behind a small ridge that had concealed it from us this white moss a place made for all kinds of beautiful works of art and nature woods and valleys fairy valleys and fairy tarns miniature mountains alps above alps wednesday nd junein the morning we observed that the scarlet beans were drooping in the leaves in great numbers owing we guess to an insect yesterday an old man called a greyheaded man above seventy years of age he said he had been a soldier that his wife and children had died in jamaica he had a beggars wallet over his shoulders a coat of shreds and patches altogether of a drab colour he was tall and though his body was bent he had the look of one used to have been upright i talked a while and then gave him a piece of cold bacon and some money said he youre a fine woman i could not help smiling i suppose he meant youre a kind woman afterwards a woman called travelling to glasgow after dinner we went into franks field crawled up the little glen and planned a seat found a beautiful shelllike purple fungus in franks field after tea we walked to butterlip how and backwards and forwards there all the young oak tree leaves are dry as powder a cold south wind portending rain thursday rd june a very fine rain i lay in my bed till ten oclock william much better than yesterday we walked into easedale the cuckoo sang and we watched the little birds as we sate at the door of the cowhouse the oak copses are brown as in autumn with the late frosts we have been reading the life and some of the writings of poor logan since dinner there are many affecting lines and passages in his poem eg and everlasting longings for the lost william is now sleeping with the window open lying on the window seat the thrush is singing there are i do believe a thousand buds on the honeysuckle tree all small and far from blowing save one that is retired behind the twigs close to the wall and as snug as a bird nest johns rose tree is very beautiful blended with the honeysuckle yesterday morning william walked as far as the swan with aggy fisher who was going to attend upon goans dying infant she said there are many heavier crosses than the death of an infant and went on there was a woman in this vale who buried four grownup children in one year and i have heard her say when many years were gone by that she had more pleasure in thinking of those four than of her living children for as children get up and have families of their own their duty to their parents wears out and weakens she could trip lightly by the graves of those who died when they were young as she went to church on a sunday a very affecting letter came from m h while i was sitting in the window reading miltons penseroso to william i answered this letter before i went to bed saturday tha fine showery morning i made both pies and bread but we first walked into easedale and sate under the oak trees upon the mossy stones there were one or two slight showers the gowans were flourishing along the banks of the stream the strawberry flower hanging over the brook all things soft and green in the afternoon william sate in the orchard i went there was tired and fell asleep william began a letter to john wilson sunday th junea showery morning we were writing the letter to john wilson when ellen came after dinner i walked into john fishers intake with ellen he brought us letters from coleridge mrs clarkson and sara hutchinson monday th junei wrote to mary h this morning sent the c indolence poem copied the letter to john wilson and wrote to my brother richard and mrs coleridge in the evening i walked with ellen to butterlip how it was a very sweet evening there was the cuckoo and the little birds the copses still injured but the trees in general looked most soft and beautiful in tufts i went with ellen in the morning to rydale falls tuesday th juneellen and i rode to windermere we had a fine sunny day neither hot nor cold i mounted the horse at the quarry we had no difficulties or delays but at the gates i was enchanted with some of the views from the high ray the view is very delightful rich and festive water and wood houses groves hedgerows green fields and mountains white houses large and small we passed two or three newlooking statesmens houses the curwens shrubberies looked pitiful enough under the native trees we put up our horses ate our dinner by the waterside and walked up to the station we went to the island walked round it and crossed the lake with our horse in the ferry the shrubs have been cut away in some parts of the island i observed to the boatman that i did not think it improved he replied we think it is for one could hardly see the house before it seems to me to be however no better than it was they have made no natural glades it is merely a lawn with a few miserable young trees standing as if they were halfstarved there are no sheep no cattle upon these lawns it is neither one thing nor anotherneither natural nor wholly cultivated and artificial which it was before and that great house mercy upon us if it could be concealed it would be well for all who are not pained to see the pleasantest of earthly spots deformed by man but it can not be covered even the tallest of our old oak trees would not reach to the top of it when we went into the boat there were two men standing at the landingplace one seemed to be about sixty a man with a jolly red face he looked as if he might have lived many years in mr curwens house he wore a blue jacket and trousers as the people who live close by windermere particularly at the places of chief resort he looked significantly at our boatman just as we were rowing off and said thomas mind you take the directions off that cask you know what i mean it will serve as a blind for them you know it was a blind business both for you and the coachman and all of us mind you take off the directions a winks as good as a nod with some folks and then he turned round looking at his companion with an air of selfsatisfaction and deep insight into unknown things i could hardly help laughing outright at him the laburnums blossom freely at the island and in the shrubberies on the shore they are blighted everywhere else roses of various sorts now out the brooms were in full glory everywhere veins of gold among the copses the hawthorns in the valley fading away beautiful upon the hills we reached home at three oclock after tea william went out and walked and wrote that poem the sun has long been set etc he walked on our own path and wrote the lines he called me into the orchard and there repeated them to me wednesday th june the hawthorns on the mountain sides like orchards in blossom thursday th june coleridge came in with a sack full of books etc and a branch of mountain ash he had been attacked by a cow he came over by grisdale a furious wind saturday th junea rainy morning coleridge set off before dinner we went with him to the raise but it rained so we went no further sheltered under a wall he would be sadly wet for a furious shower came on just when we parted sunday th junea fine morning sunshiny and bright but with rainy clouds william has been altering the poem to mary this morning i wrote out poems for our journey mr simpson came when we were in the orchard in the morning and brought us a beautiful drawing which he had done in the evening we walked first on our own path it was a silent night the stars were out by ones and twos but no cuckoo no little birds the air was not warm and we have observed that since tuesday th when william wrote the sun has long been set that we have had no birds singing after the evening is fairly set in we walked to our new view of rydale but it put on a sullen face there was an owl hooting in bainriggs its first halloo was so like a human shout that i was surprised when it gave its second call tremulous and lengthened out to find that the shout had come from an owl the full moon not quite full was among a company of shady island clouds and the sky bluer about it than the natural sky blue william observed that the full moon above a dark fir grove is a fine image of the descent of a superior being there was a shower which drove us into johns grove before we had quitted our favourite path we walked upon johns path before we went to view rydale monday th william wrote to mary and sara about the leech gatherer and wrote to both of them in one and to coleridge also i walked with william on our own path we were driven away by the horses that go on the commons then we went to look at rydale walked a little in the fir grove went again to the top of the hill and came home a mild and sweet night william stayed behind me i threw him the cloak out of the window the moon overcast he sate a few minutes in the orchard came in sleepy and hurried to bed i carried him his bread and butter tuesday tha sweet grey mild morning the birds sing soft and low william has not slept all night it wants only ten minutes of ten and he is in bed yet after william rose we went and sate in the orchard till dinner time we walked a long time in the evening upon our favourite path the owls hooted the night hawk sang to itself incessantly but there were no little birds no thrushes i left william writing a few lines about the night hawk and other images of the evening and went to seek for letters wednesday thwe walked towards rydale for letters one from mary we went up into rydale woods and read it there we sate near the old wall which fenced a hazel grove which william said was exactly like the filbert grove at middleham it is a beautiful spot a sloping or rather steep piece of ground with hazels growing tall and erect in clumps at distances almost seeming regular as if they had been planted i wrote to mary after dinner while william sate in the orchard i spoke of the little birds keeping us company and william told me that that very morning a bird had perched upon his leg he had been lying very still and had watched this little creature it had come under the bench where he was sitting he thoughtlessly stirred himself to look further at it and it flew on to the apple tree above him it was a little young creature that had just left its nest equally unacquainted with man and unaccustomed to struggle against the storms and winds while it was upon the apple tree the wind blew about the stiff boughs and the bird seemed bemazed and not strong enough to strive with it the swallows come to the sittingroom window as if wishing to build but i am afraid they will not have courage for it but i believe they will build in my room window they twitter and make a bustle and a little cheerful song hanging against the panes of glass with their soft white bellies close to the glass and their forked fishlike tails they swim round and round and again they come i do not now see the brownness that was in the coppices the bower hawthorn blossoms passed away those on the hills are a faint white the wild guelderrose is coming out and the wild roses i have seen no honeysuckles yet foxgloves are now frequent thursday th when i came home i found william at work attempting to alter a stanza in the poem on our going for mary which i convinced him did not need altering we sate in the house after dinner in the evening walked on our favourite path a short letter from coleridge william added a little to the ode he is writing footnote doubtless the ode intimations of immortalityed friday th junewhen we were sitting after breakfast luff came in he had rode over the fells he brought news about lord lowthers intention to pay all debts etc and a letter from mr clarkson he saw our garden was astonished at the scarlet beans etc etc etc when he was gone we wrote to coleridge m h and my brother richard about the affair william determined to go to eusemere on monday saturday ththe swallows were very busy under my window this morning coleridge when he was last here told us that for many years there being no quaker meeting at keswick a single old quaker woman used to go regularly alone every sunday to attend the meetinghouse and there used to sit and perform her worship alone in that beautiful place among those fir trees in that spacious vale under the great mountain skiddaw on thursday morning miss hudson of workington called she said i sow flowers in the parks several miles from home and my mother and i visit them and watch them how they grow this may show that botanists may be often deceived when they find rare flowers growing far from houses this was a very ordinary young woman such as in any town in the north of england one may find a score i sate up a while after william he then called me down to him i was writing to mary h i read churchills rosciad returned again to my writing and did not go to bed till he called to me the shutters were closed but i heard the birds singing there was our own thrush shouting with an impatient shout so it sounded to me the morning was still the twittering of the little birds was very gloomy the owls had hooted a quarter of an hour before now the cocks were crowing it was near daylight i put out my candle and went to bed sunday th we were in the orchard a great part of the morning after tea we walked upon our own path for a long time we talked sweetly together about the disposal of our riches we lay upon the sloping turf earth and sky were so lovely that they melted our very hearts the sky to the north was of a chastened yet rich yellow fading into pale blue and streaked and scattered over with steady islands of purple melting away into shades of pink it was like a vision to me tuesday morning i walked to rydale i waited long for the post lying in the field and looking at the distant mountains looking and listening to the river i met the post letters from montagu and richard i hurried back forwarded these to william and wrote to montagu when i came home i wrote to my brother christopher i could settle to nothing i read the midsummer nights dream and began as you like it wednesday rd june a sunshiny morning i walked to the top of the hill and sate under a wall near johns grove facing the sun i read a scene or two in as you like it coleridge and leslie came just as i had lain down after dinner c brought me williams letter he had got well to eusemere coleridge and i accompanied leslie to the boathouse it was a sullen coldish evening no sunshine but after we had parted from leslie a light came out suddenly that repaid us for all it fell only upon one hill and the island but it arrayed the grass and trees in gemlike brightness i cooked coleridges supper we sate up till one oclock thursday th junei went with c half way up the raise it was a cool morning william came in just when m had left me it was a mild rainy evening we sate together talking till the first dawning of day a happy time friday th june i went just before tea into the garden i looked up at my swallows nest and it was gone it had fallen down poor little creatures they could not themselves be more distressed than i was i went upstairs to look at the ruins they lay in a large heap upon the window ledge these swallows had been ten days employed in building this nest and it seemed to be almost finished i had watched them early in the morning in the day many and many a time and in the evenings when it was almost dark i had seen them sitting together side by side in their unfinished nest both morning and night when they first came about the window they used to hang against the panes with their white bellies and their forked tails looking like fish but then they fluttered and sang their own little twittering song as soon as the nest was broad enough a sort of ledge for them they sate both mornings and evenings but they did not pass the night there i watched them one morning when william was at eusemere for more than an hour every now and then there was a motion in their wings a sort of tremulousness and they sang a low song to one another it is now eight oclock i will go and see if my swallows are on their nest yes there they are side by side both looking down into the garden i have been out on purpose to see their faces i knew by looking at the window that they were there coleridge and william came in at about halfpast eleven they talked till after twelve wednesday th june we met an old man between the raise and lewthwaites he wore a rusty but untorn hat an excellent blue coat waistcoat and breeches and good mottled worsted stockings his beard was very thick and grey of a fortnights growth we guessed it was a regular beard like grey plush his bundle contained sheffield ware william said to him after we had asked him what his business was you are a very old man aye i am eightythree i joined in have you any children children yes plenty i have children and grandchildren and great grandchildren i have a great granddaughter a fine lass thirteen years old i then said wont they take care of you he replied much offended thank god i can take care of myself he said he had been a servant of the marquis of granbyo he was a good man hes in heaven i hope he is he then told us how he shot himself at bath that he was with him in germany and travelled with him everywhere he was a famous boxer sir and then he told us a story of his fighting with his farmer he used always to call me bland and sharp then every now and then he broke out he was a good man when we were travelling he never asked at the publichouses as it might be there pointing to the swan what we were to pay but he would put his hand into his pocket and give them what he liked and when he came out of the house he would say now they would have charged me a shilling or tenpence god help them poor creatures i asked him again about his children how many he had says he i can not tell you i suppose he confounded children and grandchildren together i have one daughter that keeps a boardingschool at skipton in craven she teaches flowering and marking and another that keeps a boardingschool at ingleton i brought up my family under the marquis he was familiar with all parts of yorkshire he asked us where we lived at grasmere the bonniest dale in all england says the old man i bought a pair of slippers from him and we sate together by the roadside when we parted i tried to lift his bundle and it was almost more than i could do after tea i wrote to coleridge and closed up my letter to m h we went soon to bed a weight of children a poor mans blessing friday nd julya very rainy morning i left william and wrote a short letter to m h and to coleridge and transcribed the alterations in the leech gatherer sunday th july william

going to grasmere was as far as it could go the swallows have completed their beautiful nest wednesday th walked on the white moss glowworms well for them children are in bed when they shine thursday th when i was coming home a postchaise passed with a little girl behind in a patched ragged cloak in the afternoon after we had talked a little william fell asleep i read the winters tale then i went to bed but did not sleep the swallows stole in and out of their nest and sate there whiles quite still whiles they sung low for two minutes or more at a time just like a muffled robin william was looking at the pedlar when i got up he arranged it and after tea i wrote it out lines the moon was behind william hurried me out in hopes that i should see her we walked first to the top of the hill to see rydale it was dark and dull but our own vale was very solemnthe shape of helm crag was quite distinct though black we walked backwards and forwards on the white moss path there was a skylike white brightness on the lake the wyke cottage right at the foot of silver how glowworms out but not so numerous as last night o beautiful place dear mary william the hour is come i must prepare to go the swallows i must leave them the wall the garden the roses all dear creatures they sang last night after i was in bed seemed to be singing to one another just before they settled to rest for the night well i must go farewell footnote several of the poems referred to in this journal are difficult if not impossible to identify the inscription of the pathway finished on the th of august the epitaph written on the th january the yorkshire wolds poem referred to on march th also the silver howe poem and that known in the wordsworth household as the tinker it is possible that some of them were intentionally suppressed the inscription of the pathway and the tinker will however soon be publisheded vi dorothy wordsworths journal written at grasmere th july to th january extracts from

reached keswick against teatime we called at calverts on the saturday evening on monday th july we went to eusemere coleridge walked with us six or seven miles he was not well and we had a melancholy parting after having sate together in silence by the roadside we turned aside to explore the country near huttonjohn and had a new and delightful walk the valley which is subject to the decaying mansion that stands at its head seems to join its testimony to that of the house to the falling away of the family greatness and the hedges are in bad condition the land wants draining and is overrun with brackens yet there is a something everywhere that tells of its former possessors the trees are left scattered about as if intended to be like a park and these are very interesting standing as they do upon the sides of the steep hills that slope down to the bed of the river a little stonybedded stream that spreads out to a considerable breadth at the village of dacre a little above dacre we came into the right road to mr clarksons after having walked through woods and fields never exactly knowing whether we were right or wrong we learnt however that we had saved halfamile we sate down by the riverside to rest and saw some swallows flying about and under the bridge and two little schoolboys were loitering among the scars seeking after their nests we reached mr clarksons at about eight oclock after a sauntering walk having lingered and loitered and sate down together that we might be alone mr and mrs c were just come from luffs we spent tuesday the th of july at eusemere and on wednesday morning the th we walked to emont bridge and mounted the coach between birds nest and hartshorn tree at greta bridge the sun shone cheerfully and a glorious ride we had over gaterly moor every building was bathed in golden light the trees were more bright than earthly trees and we saw round us miles beyond milesdarlington spire etc etc we reached leeming lane at about nine oclock supped comfortably and enjoyed our fire on thursday morning at a little before seven being the th july we got into a postchaise and went to thirsk to breakfast we were well treated but when the landlady understood that we were going to walk off and leave our luggage behind she threw out some saucy words in our hearing the day was very hot and we rested often and long before we reached the foot of the hambledon hills and while we were climbing them still oftener we were almost overpowered with thirst when i heard the trickling of a little stream of water i was before william and i stopped till he came up to me we sate a long time by this water and climbed the hill slowly i was footsore the sun shone hot the little scotch cattle panted and tossed fretfully about the view was hazy and we could see nothing from the top of the hill but an undistinct widespreading country full of trees but the buildings towns and houses were lost we stopped to examine that curious stone then walked along the flat common arrived very hungry at rivaux nothing to eat at the millers as we expected but at an exquisitely neat farmhouse we got some boiled milk and bread this strengthened us and i went down to look at the ruins thrushes were singing cattle feeding among greengrown hillocks about the ruins the hillocks were scattered over with grovelets of wild roses and other shrubs and covered with wild flowers i could have stayed in this solemn quiet spot till evening without a thought of moving but william was waiting for me so in a quarter of an hour i went away we walked upon mr duncombes terrace and looked down upon the abbey it stands in a larger valley among a brotherhood of valleys of different length and breadthall woody and running up into the hills in all directions we reached helmsly just at dusk we had a beautiful view of the castle from the top of the hill and slept at a very nice inn and were well treated floors as smooth as ice on friday morning th july we walked to kirby met people coming to helmsly fair were misdirected and walked a mile out of our way a beautiful view above pickering met mary and sara seven miles from g h sheltered from the rain beautiful glen spoiled by the large house sweet church and churchyard arrived at gallow hill at seven oclock friday evening th july sara tom and i rode up bedale wm mary sara and i went to scarborough and we walked in the abbey pasture and to wykeham and on monday the th we went off with mary in a postchaise we had an interesting ride over the wolds though it rained all the way single thorn bushes were scattered about on the turf sheepsheds here and there and now and then a little hut swelling grounds and sometimes a single tree or a clump of trees we passed through one or two little villages embosomed in tall trees after we had parted from mary there were gleams of sunshine but with showers we saw beverley in a heavy rain and yet were much pleased with the beauty of the town saw the minstera pretty clean building but injured very much with grecian architecture the country between beverley and hull very rich but miserably flatbrick houses windmills houses againdull and endless hull a frightful dirty brickhousey tradesmanlike rich vulgar place yet the riverthough the shores are so low that they can hardly be seenlooked beautiful with the evening lights upon it and boats moving about we walked a long time and returned to our dull dayroom but quiet evening one to supper tuesday thmarket day streets dirty very rainy did not leave hull till four oclock and left barton at about six rained all the way almost a beautiful village at the foot of a hill with trees a gentlemans house converted into a ladys boardingschool we left lincoln on wednesday morning th july at six oclock it rained heavily and we could see nothing but the antientry of some of the buildings as we passed along the night before however we had seen enough to make us regret this the minster stands at the edge of a hill overlooking an immense plain the country very flat as we went along the day mended we went to see the outside of the minster while the passengers were dining at peterborough the west end very grand on thursday morning th we arrived in london wm left me at the sun after various troubles and disasters we left london on saturday morning at halfpast five or six the st of july we mounted the dover coach at charing cross it was a beautiful morning the city st pauls with the river and a multitude of little boats made a most beautiful sight as we crossed westminster bridge the houses were not overhung by their cloud of smoke and they were spread out endlessly yet the sun shone so brightly with such a fierce light that there was even something like the purity of one of natures own grand spectacles footnote compare the sonnet composed upon westminster bridge september in vol ii p ed we rode on cheerfully now with the paris diligence before us now behind we walked up the steep hills a beautiful prospect everywhere till we even reached dover at first the rich populous widespreading woody country about london then the river thames ships sailing chalk cliffs trees little villages afterwards canterbury situated on a plain rich and woody but the city and cathedral disappointed me hop grounds on each side of the road some miles from canterbury then we came to a common the race ground an elevated plain villages among trees in the bed of a valley at our right and rising above this valley green hills scattered over with wood neat gentlemens houses one white house almost hid with green trees which we longed for and the parsons house as neat a place as could be which would just have suited coleridge no doubt we may have found one for tom hutchinson and sara and a good farm too we halted at a halfway housefruit carts under the shade of trees seats for guests a tempting place to the weary traveller still as we went along the country was beautiful and hilly with cottages lurking under the hills and their little plots of hop ground like vineyards it was a bad hop year a woman on the top of the coach said to me it is a sad thing for the poor people for the hopgathering is the womans harvest there is employment about the hops for women and children we saw the castle of dover and the sea beyond four or five miles before we reached it we looked at it through a long vale the castle being upon an eminence as it seemed at the end of this vale which opened to the sea the country now became less fertile but near dover it seemed more rich again many buildings stand on the flat fields sheltered with tall trees there is one old chapel that might have been there just in the same state in which it now is when this vale was as retired and as little known to travellers as our own cumberland mountain wilds thirty years ago there was also a very old building on the other side of the road which had a strange effect among the many new ones that are springing up everywhere it seemed odd that it could have kept itself pure in its ancientry among so many upstarts it was near dark when we reached dover we were told that a packet was about to sail so we went down to the customhouse in halfanhourhad our luggage examined etc etc and then we drank tea with the honourable mr knox and his tutor we arrived at calais at four oclock on sunday morning the st of july we stayed in the vessel till halfpast seven then william went for letters at about halfpast eight or nine we found out annette and c chez madame avril dans la rue de la tÃªte dor we lodged opposite two ladies in tolerably decentsized rooms but badly furnished the weather was very hot we walked by the seashore almost every evening with annette and caroline or william and i alone i had a bad cold and could not bathe at first but william did it was a pretty sight to see as we walked upon the sands when the tide was low perhaps a hundred people bathing about a quarter of a mile distant from us and we had delightful walks after the heat of the day was passedseeing far off in the west the coast of england like a cloud crested with dover castle which was but like the summit of the cloudthe evening star and the glory of the sky the reflections in the water were more beautiful than the sky itself purple waves brighter than precious stones for ever melting away upon the sands the fort a wooden building at the entrance of the harbour at calais when the evening twilight was coming on and we could not see anything of the building but its shape which was far more distinct than in perfect daylight seemed to be reared upon pillars of ebony between which pillars the sea was seen in the most beautiful colours that can be conceived nothing in romance was ever half so beautiful now came in view as the evening star sunk down and the colours of the west faded away the two lights of england lighted up by englishmen in our country to warn vessels off rocks or sands these we used to see from the pier when we could see no other distant objects but the clouds the sky and the sea itselfall was dark behind the town of calais seemed deserted of the light of heaven but there was always light and life and joy upon the sea one night i shall never forgetthe day had been very hot and william and i walked alone together upon the pier the sea was gloomy for there was a blackness over all the sky except when it was overspread with lightning which often revealed to us a distant vessel near as the waves roared and broke against the pier and they were interfused with greenish fiery light the more distant sea always black and gloomy it was also beautiful on the calm hot night to see the little boats row out of harbour with wings of fire and the sail boats with the fiery track which they cut as they went along and which closed up after them with a hundred thousand sparkles and streams of glowworm light caroline was delighted footnote compare the sonnet poetical works vol ii p beginning fair star of evening splendour of the west ed on sunday the th of august we left calais at twelve oclock in the morning and landed at dover at one on monday the th it was very pleasant to me when we were in the harbour at dover to breathe the fresh air and to look up and see the stars among the ropes of the vessel the next day was very hot we bathed and sate upon the dover cliffs and looked upon france with many a melancholy and tender thought we could see the shores almost as plain as if it were but an english lake we mounted the coach and arrived in london at six the th august it was misty and we could see nothing we stayed in london till wednesday the nd of september and arrived at gallow hill on friday september thmary first met us in the avenue she looked so fat and well that we were made very happy by the sight of her then came sara and last of all joanna tom was forking corn standing upon the corn cart we dressed ourselves immediately and got tea the garden looked gay with asters and sweet peas jack and george came on friday evening st october on saturday nd we rode to hackness william jack george and sara single i behind tom on sunday rd mary and sara were busy packing on monday th october my brother william was married to mary hutchinson i slept a good deal of the night and rose fresh and well in the morning at a little after eight oclock i saw them go down the avenue towards the church william had parted from me upstairs when they were absent my dear little sara prepared the breakfast i kept myself as quiet as i could but when i saw the two men running up the walk coming to tell us it was over i could stand it no longer and threw myself on the bed where i lay in stillness neither hearing nor seeing anything till sara came upstairs to me and said they are coming this forced me from the bed where i lay and i moved i knew not how straight forward faster than my strength could carry me till i met my beloved william and fell upon his bosom he and john hutchinson led me to the house and there i stayed to welcome my dear mary as soon as we had breakfasted we departed it rained when we set off poor mary was much agitated when she parted from her brothers and sisters and her home nothing particular occurred till we reached kirby we had sunshine and showers pleasant talk love and cheerfulness we were obliged to stay two hours at k while the horses were feeding we wrote a few lines to sara and then walked out the sun shone and we went to the churchyard after we had put a letter into the postoffice for the york herald we sauntered about and read the gravestones there was one to the memory of five children who had all died within five years and the longest lived had only lived four years footnote it may not be a too trivial detail to note that coleridges dejection an ode appeared in the morning post on wordsworths marriage dayed we left kirby at about halfpast two there is not much variety of prospect from k to helmsley but the country is very pleasant being rich and woody and helmsley itself stands very sweetly at the foot of the rising grounds of duncombe park which is scattered over with tall woods and lifting itself above the common buildings of the town stands helmsley castle now a ruin formerly inhabited by the gay duke of buckingham every foot of the road was of itself interesting to us for we had travelled along it on foot william and i when we went to fetch our dear mary and had sate upon the turf by the roadside more than once before we reached helmsley our driver told us that he could not take us any further so we stopped at the same inn where we had slept before my heart danced at the sight of its cleanly outside bright yellow walls casements overshadowed with jasmine and its low double gavelended front mary and i warmed ourselves at the kitchen fire we then walked into the garden and looked over a gate up to the old ruin which stands at the top of the mount and round about it the moats are grown up into soft green cradles hollows surrounded with green grassy hillocks and these are overshadowed by old trees chiefly ashes i prevailed upon william to go up with me to the ruins the sun shone it was warm and very pleasant one part of the castle seems to be inhabited there was a man mowing nettles in the open space which had most likely once been the castlecourt there is one gateway exceedingly beautiful children were playing upon the sloping ground we came home by the street after about an hours delay we set forward again had an excellent driver who opened the gates so dexterously that the horses never stopped mary was very much delighted with the view of the castle from the point where we had seen it before i was pleased to see again the little path which we had walked upon the gate i had climbed over and the road down which we had seen the two little boys drag a log of wood and a team of horses struggle under the weight of a great load of timber we had felt compassion for the poor horses that were under the governance of oppression and illjudging drivers and for the poor boys who seemed of an age to have been able to have dragged the log of wood merely out of the love of their own activity but from poverty and bad food they panted for weakness and were obliged to fetch their father from the town to help them duncombe house looks well from the roada large building though i believe only twothirds of the original design are completed we rode down a very steep hill to rivaux valley with woods all round us we stopped upon the bridge to look at the abbey and again when we had crossed it dear mary had never seen a ruined abbey before except whitby we recognised the cottages houses and the little valleys as we went along we walked up a long hill the road carrying us up the cleft or valley with woody hills on each side of us when we went to g h i had walked down the valley alone william followed me before we had crossed the hambledon hill and reached the point overlooking yorkshire it was quite dark we had not wanted however fair prospects before us as we drove along the flat plain of the high hill far far off from us in the western sky we saw shapes of castles ruins among groves a great spreading wood rocks and single trees a minster with its tower unusually distinct minarets in another quarter and a round grecian temple also the colours of the sky of a bright grey and the forms of a sober grey with a dome as we descended the hill there was no distinct view but of a great space only near us we saw the wild and as the people say bottomless tarn in the hollow at the side of the hill it seemed to be made visible to us only by its own light for all the hill about us was dark before we reached thirsk we saw a light before us which we at first thought was the moon then limekilns but when we drove into the marketplace it proved a large bonfire with lads dancing round it which is a sight i dearly love the inn was like an illuminated houseevery room full we asked the cause and were told by the girl that it was mr john bells birthday that he had heired his estate the landlady was very civil she did not recognise the despised foottravellers we rode on in the dark and reached leeming lane at eleven oclock the next morning we set off at about halfpast eight oclock it was a cheerful sunny morning we had a few showers but when we came to the green fields of wensley the sun shone upon them all and the ure in its many windings glittered as it flowed along under the green slopes of middleham castle mary looked about for her friend mr place and thought she had him sure on the contrary side of the vale from that on which we afterwards found he lived we went to a new built house at leyburn the same village where william and i had dined on our road to grasmere two years and threequarters ago but not the same house the landlady was very civil giving us cake and wine but the horses being out we were detained at least two hours and did not set off till two oclock we paid for thirtyfive miles ie to sedbergh but the landlady did not encourage us to hope to get beyond hawes when we passed through the village of wensley my heart melted away with dear recollectionsthe bridge the little waterspout the steep hill the church they are among the most vivid of my own inner visions for they were the first objects that i saw after we were left to ourselves and had turned our whole hearts to grasmere as a home in which we were to rest the vale looked most beautiful each way to the left the bright silver stream inlaid the flat and very green meadows winding like a serpent to the right we did not see it so far it was lost among trees and little hills i could not help observing as we went along how much more varied the prospects of wensley dale are in the summer time than i could have thought possible in the winter this seemed to be in great measure owing to the trees being in leaf and forming groves and screens and thence little openings upon recesses and concealed retreats which in winter only made a part of the one great vale the beauty of the summer time here as much excels that of the winter as the variety owing to the excessive greenness of the fields and the trees in leaf half concealing andwhere they do not concealsoftening the hard bareness of the limey white roofs one of our horses seemed to grow a little restive as we went through the first village a long village on the side of a hill it grew worse and worse and at last we durst not go on any longer we walked a while and then the post boy was obliged to take the horse out and go back for another we seated ourselves again snugly in the postchaise the wind struggled about us and rattled the window and gave a gentle motion to the chaise but we were warm and at our ease within our station was at the top of a hill opposite bolton castle the ure flowing beneath william has since written a sonnet on this our imprisonment hard was thy durance poor queen mary compared with ours footnote this sonnet was not thought worthy of being preserveded we had a sweet ride till we came to a publichouse on the side of a hill where we alighted and walked down to see the waterfalls the sun was not set and the woods and fields were spread over with the yellow light of evening which made their greenness a thousand times more green there was too much water in the river for the beauty of the falls and even the banks were less interesting than in winter nature had entirely got the better in her struggles against the giants who first cast the mould of these works for indeed it is a place that did not in winter remind one of god but one could not help feeling as if there had been the agency of some mortal instruments which nature had been struggling against without making a perfect conquest there was something so wild and new in this feeling knowing as we did in the inner man that god alone had laid his hand upon it that i could not help regretting the want of it besides it is a pleasure to a real lover of nature to give winter all the glory he can for summer will make its own way and speak its own praises we saw the pathway which william and i took at the close of evening the path leading to the rabbit warren where we lost ourselves sloe farm with its holly hedges was lost among the green hills and hedgerows in general but we found it out and were glad to look at it again william left us to seek the waterfalls at our return to the inn we found new horses and a new driver and we went on nicely to hawes where we arrived before it was quite dark we rose at six oclocka rainy morning there was a very fine view about a mile from hawes where we crossed a bridge bare and very green fields with cattle a glittering stream cottages a few illgrown trees and high hills the sun shone now before we got upon the bare hills there was a hunting lodge on our right exactly like greta hill with fir plantations about it we were very fortunate in the day gleams of sunshine passing clouds that travelled with their shadows below them mary was much pleased with garsdale it was a dear place to william and me we noted well the publichouse garsdale hall where we had baited and afterwards the mountain which had been adorned by jupiter in his glory when we were here before it was midday when we reached sedbergh and market day we were in the same room where we had spent the evening together in our road to grasmere we had a pleasant ride to kendal where we arrived at two oclock the day favoured us m and i went to see the house where dear sara had lived i am always glad to see staveley it is a place i dearly love to think ofthe first mountain village that i came to with william when we first began our pilgrimage together nothing particular occurred till we reached ings chapel the door was open and we went in it is a neat little place with a marble floor and marble communion table with a painting over it of the last supper and moses and aaron on each side the woman told us that they had painted them as near as they could by the dresses as they are described in the bible and gay enough they are the marble had been sent by richard bateman from leghorn the woman told us that a man had been at her house a few days before who told her he had helped to bring it down the red sea and she believed him gladly we arrived at grasmere at about six oclock on wednesday evening the th of october i can not describe what i felt we went by candle light into the garden and were astonished at the growth of the brooms portugal laurels etc etc etc the next day thursday we unpacked the boxes on friday th mary and i walked first upon the hillside and then in johns grove then in view of rydale the first walk that i had taken with my sister monday tha beautiful day we walked to the easedale hills to hunt waterfalls william and mary left me sitting on a stone on the solitary mountains and went to easedale tarn the approach to the tarn is very beautiful we expected to have found coleridge at home but he did not come till after dinner he was well but did not look so tuesday th octoberwe walked with coleridge to rydale wednesday thset forwards with him towards keswick and he prevailed us to go on we consented mrs c not being at home the day was delightful thursday thwe went in the evening to

getting in their corn reached home at about five oclock sunday thwe had thirteen of our neighbours to tea william came in just as we began tea saturday th octoberwilliam is gone to keswick mary went with him to the top of the raise she is returned and is now sitting near me by the fire it is a breathless grey day that leaves the golden woods of autumn quiet in their own tranquillity stately and beautiful in their decaying the lake is a perfect mirror william met stoddart at the bridge at the foot of legberthwaite dale they surprised us by their arrival at four oclock in the afternoon after tea s read chaucer to us monday st october william and s went to keswick mary and i walked to the top of the hill and looked at rydale i was much affected when i stood upon the second bar of saras gate the lake was perfectly still the sun shone on hill and vale the distant birch trees looked like large golden flowers nothing else in colour was distinct and separate but all the beautiful colours seemed to be melted into one another and joined together in one mass so that there were no differences though an endless variety when one tried to find it out the fields were of one sober yellow brown footnote this should have been entered st novembered tuesday nd novemberwilliam returned from keswick friday th i wrote to montagu and sent off letters to miss lamb and coleridge sunday thfine weather letters from coleridge that he was gone to london sara at penrith i wrote to mrs clarkson william began to translate ariosto monday tha beautiful day william got to work again at ariosto and so continued all the morning though the day was so delightful that it made my very heart long to be out of doors and see and feel the beauty of the autumn in freedom the trees on the opposite side of the lake are of a yellow brown but there are one or two trees opposite our windows an ash tree for instance quite green as in spring the fields are of their winter colour but the island is as green as ever it was william is writing out his stanzas from ariosto the evening is quiet poor coleridge sara is at keswick i hope i have read one canto of ariosto today th decemberchristmas eve william is now sitting by me at halfpast ten oclock i have been repeating some of his sonnets to him listening to his own repeating reading some of miltons and the allegro and penseroso it is a quick keen frost coleridge came this morning with wedgwood we all turned out one by one to meet him he looked well we had to tell him of the birth of his little girl born yesterday morning at six oclock william went with them to wytheburn in the chaise and m and i met w on the raise it was not an unpleasant morning the sun shone now and then and there was no wind but all things looked cheerless and distinct no meltings of sky into mountains the mountains like stone work wrought up with huge hammers last sunday was as mild a day as i ever remember mary and i went round the lakes there were flowers of various kindsthe topmost bell of a foxglove geraniums daisies a buttercup in the water but this i saw two or three days before small yellow flowers i do not know their name in the turf a large bunch of strawberry blossoms it is christmas day saturday th december i am thirtyone years of age it is a dull frosty day on thursday th december i went to keswick william rode before me to the foot of the hill nearest k there we parted close to a little watercourse which was then noisy with water but on my return a dry channel we stopped our horse close to the ledge opposite a tuft of primroses three flowers in full blossom and a bud they reared themselves up among the green moss we debated long whether we should pluck them and at last left them to live out their day which i was right glad of at my return the sunday following for there they remained uninjured either by cold or wet i stayed at keswick over new years day and returned on sunday the nd january william was alarmed at my long delay and came to within three miles of keswick coleridge stayed with us till tuesday january th w and i walked with him to ambleside we parted with him at the turning of the lane he going on horseback to the top of kirkstone on thursday th c returned and on friday the th he and sara went to keswick w accompanied them to the foot of wytheburn it was a gentle day and when william and i returned home just before sunset it was a heavenly evening a soft sky was among the hills and a summer sunshine above and blending with this sky for it was more like sky than clouds the turf looked warm and soft monday january th i lay in bed to have a drench of sleep till one oclock worked all day ominously cold tuesday january tha very cold day but the blackness of the cold made us slow to put forward and we did not walk at all mary read the prologue to chaucers tales to me in the morning william was working at his poem to c letter from keswick and from taylor on williams marriage c poorly in bad

afternoon august th and william coleridge and i left keswick on monday morning the th at twenty minutes after eleven oclock the day was very hot we walked up the hills and along all the rough road which made our walking half the days journey travelled under the foot of carrock a mountain covered with stones on the lower part above it is very rocky but sheep pasture there we saw several where there seemed to be no grass to tempt them passed the foot of grisdale and mosedale both pastoral valleys narrow and soon terminating in the mountainsgreen with scattered trees and houses and each a beautiful stream at grisdale our horse backed upon a steep bank where the road was not fenced just above a pretty mill at the foot of the valley and we had a second threatening of a disaster in crossing a narrow bridge between the two dales but this was not the fault of either man or horse slept at mr younghusbands publichouse hesket newmarket in the evening walked to caldbeck falls a delicious spot in which to breathe out a summers daylimestone rocks hanging trees pools and waterbreakscaves and caldrons which have been honoured with fairy names and no doubt continue in the fancy of the neighbourhood to resound with fairy revels tuesday august thpassed rose castle upon the caldew an ancient building of red stone with sloping gardens an ivied gateway velvet lawns old garden walls trim flowerborders with stately and luxuriant flowers we walked up to the house and stood some minutes watching the swallows that flew about restlessly and flung their shadows upon the sunbright walls of the old building the shadows glanced and twinkled interchanged and crossed each other expanded and shrunk up appeared and disappeared every instant as i observed to william and coleridge seeming more like living things than the birds themselves dined at carlisle the town in a bustle with the assizes so many strange faces known in former times and recognised that it half seemed as if i ought to know them all and together with the noise the fine ladies etc they put me into confusion this day hatfield was condemned i stood at the door of the gaolers house where he was william entered the house and coleridge saw him i fell into conversation with a debtor who told me in a dry way that he was far overlearned and another man observed to william that we might learn from hatfields fate not to meddle with pen and ink we gave a shilling to my companion whom we found out to be a friend of the family a fellowsailor with my brother john in captain wordsworths ship walked upon the city walls which are broken down in places and crumbling away and most disgusting from filth the city and neighbourhood of carlisle disappointed me the banks of the river quite flat and though the holms are rich there is not much beauty in the vale from the want of treesat least to the eye of a person coming from england and i scarcely know how but to me the holms had not a natural look there was something townish in their appearance a dulness in their strong deep green to longtownnot very interesting except from the long views over the flat country the road rough chiefly newly mended reached longtown after sunset a town of brick houses belonging chiefly to the graham family being in the form of a cross and not long it had been better called crosstown there are several shops and it is not a very small place but i could not meet with a silver thimble and bought a halfpenny brass one slept at the grahams arms a large inn here as everywhere else the people seemed utterly insensible of the enormity of hatfields offences the ostler told william that he was quite a gentleman paid every one genteelly etc etc he and mary had walked together to gretna green a heavy rain came on when they were there a returned chaise happened to pass and the driver would have taken them up but mr hopes carriage was to be sent for he did not choose to accept the chaisedrivers offer wednesday august thleft longtown after breakfast about half a mile from the town a guidepost and two roads to edinburgh and glasgow we took the lefthand road to glasgow here saw a specimen of the luxuriance of the heathplant as it grows in scotland it was in the enclosed plantationsperhaps sheltered by them these plantations appeared to be not well grown for their age the trees were stunted afterwards the road treeless over a peatmoss commonthe solway moss here and there an earthbuilt hut with its peat stack a scanty growing willow hedge round the kailgarth perhaps the cow pasturing neara little lass watching itthe dreary waste cheered by the endless singing of larks we enter scotland by crossing the river sark on the scotch side of the bridge the ground is unenclosed pasturage it was very green and scattered over with that yellow flowered plant which we call grunsel the hills heave and swell prettily enough cattle feeding a few corn fields near the river at the top of the hill opposite is springfield a village built by sir william maxwella dull uniformity in the houses as is usual when all built at one time or belonging to one individual each just big enough for two people to live in and in which a family large or small as it may happen is crammed there the marriages are performed further on though almost contiguous is gretna green upon a hill and among trees this sounds well but it is a dreary place the stone houses dirty and miserable with broken windows there is a pleasant view from the churchyard over solway firth to the cumberland mountains dined at annan on our left as we travelled along appeared the solway firth and the mountains beyond but the near country dreary those houses by the roadside which are built of stone are comfortless and dirty but we peeped into a clay biggin that was very canny and i daresay will be as warm as a swallows nest in winter the town of annan made me think of france and germany many of the houses large and gloomy the size of them outrunning the comforts one thing which was like germany pleased me the shopkeepers express their calling by some device or painting breadbakers have biscuits loaves cakes painted on their windowshutters blacksmiths horses shoes iron tools etc etc and so on through all trades reached dumfries at about nine oclockmarketday met crowds of people on the road and every one had a smile for us and our car the inn was a large house and tolerably comfortable mr rogers and his sister whom we had seen at our own cottage at grasmere a few days before had arrived there that same afternoon on their way to the highlands but we did not see them till the next morning and only for about a quarter of an hour thursday august thwent to the churchyard where burns is buried a bookseller accompanied us he showed us the outside of burnss house where he had lived the last three years of his life and where he died it has a mean appearance and is in a bye situation whitewashed dirty about the doors as almost all scotch houses are flowering plants in the windows went on to visit his grave he lies at a corner of the churchyard and his second son francis wallace beside him there is no stone to mark the spot but a hundred guineas have been collected to be expended on some sort of monument there said the bookseller pointing to a pompous monument there lies mr suchaonei have forgotten his namea remarkably clever man he was an attorney and hardly ever lost a cause he undertook burns made many a lampoon upon him and there they rest as you see we looked at the grave with melancholy and painful reflections repeating to each other his own verses is there a man whose judgment clear can others teach the course to steer yet runs himself lifes mad career wild as the wave here let him pause and through a tear survey this grave the poor inhabitant below was quick to learn and wise to know and keenly felt the friendly glow and softer flame but thoughtless follies laid him low and staind his name the churchyard is full of gravestones and expensive monuments in all sorts of fantastic shapesobeliskwise pillarwise etc in speaking of gretna green i forgot to mention that we visited the churchyard the church is like a huge house indeed so are all the churches with a steeple not a square tower or spirea sort of thing more like a glasshouse chimney than a church of england steeple gravestones in abundance few verses yet there were someno texts over the graves of married women the maiden name instead of that of the husband spouse instead of wife and the place of abode preceded by in instead of of when our guide had left us we turned again to burnss house mrs burns was gone to spend some time by the seashore with her children we spoke to the servantmaid at the door who invited us forward and we sate down in the parlour the walls were coloured with a blue wash on one side of the fire was a mahogany desk opposite to the window a clock and over the desk a print from the cotters saturday night which burns mentions in one of his letters having received as a present the house was cleanly and neat in the inside the stairs of stone scoured white the kitchen on the right side of the passage the parlour on the left in the room above the parlour the poet died and his son after him in the same room the servant told us she had lived five years with mrs burns who was now in great sorrow for the death of wallace she said that mrs burnss youngest son was at christs hospital we were glad to leave dumfries which is no agreeable place to them who do not love the bustle of a town that seems to be rising up to wealth we could think of little else but poor burns and his moving about on that unpoetic ground in our road to brownhill the next stage we passed ellisland at a little distance on our right his farmhouse we might there have had more pleasure in looking round if we had been nearer to the spot but there is no thought surviving in connexion with burnss daily life that is not heartdepressing travelled through the vale of nith here little like a vale it is so broad with irregular hills rising up on each side in outline resembling the oldfashioned valances of a bed there is a great deal of arable land the corn ripe trees here and thereplantations clumps coppices and a newness in everything so much of the gorse and broom rooted out that you wonder why it is not all gone and yet there seems to be almost as much gorse and broom as corn and they grow one among another you know not how crossed the nith the vale becomes narrow and very pleasant corn fields green hills clay cottages the rivers bed rocky with woody banks left the nith about a mile and a half and reached brownhill a lonely inn where we slept the view from the windows was pleasing though some travellers might have been disposed to quarrel with it for its general nakedness yet there was abundance of corn it is an open countryopen yet all over hills at a little distance were many cottages among trees that looked very pretty brownhill is about seven or eight miles from ellisland i fancied to myself while i was sitting in the parlour that burns might have caroused there for most likely his rounds extended so far and this thought gave a melancholy interest to the smoky walls it was as pretty a room as a thoroughly dirty one could bea square parlour painted green but so covered over with smoke and dirt that it looked not unlike green seen through black gauze there were three windows looking three ways a buffet ornamented with teacups a superfine largeish lookingglass with gilt ornaments spreading far and wide the glass spotted with dirt some ordinary alehouse pictures and above the chimneypiece a print in a much better styleas william guessed taken from a painting by sir joshua reynoldsof some lady of quality in the character of euphrosyne ay said the servantgirl seeing that we looked at it theres many travellers would give a deal for that its more admired than any in the house we could not but smile for the rest were such as may be found in the basket of any italian image and picture hawker william and i walked out after dinner coleridge was not well and slept upon the carriage cushions we made our way to the cottages among the little hills and knots of wood and then saw what a delightful country this part of scotland might be made by planting forest trees the ground all over heaves and swells like a sea but for miles there are neither trees nor hedgerows only mound fences and tracts or slips of corn potatoes cloverwith hay between and barren land but near the cottages many hills and hillocks covered with wood we passed some fine trees and paused under the shade of one close by an old mansion that seemed from its neglected state to be inhabited by farmers but i must say that many of the gentlemens houses which we have passed in scotland have an air of neglect and even of desolation it was a beech in the full glory of complete and perfect growth very tall with one thick stem mounting to a considerable height which was split into four thighs as coleridge afterwards called them each in size a fine tree passed another mansion now tenanted by a schoolmaster many boys playing upon the lawn i can not take leave of the country which we passed through today without mentioning that we saw the cumberland mountains within half a mile of ellisland burnss house the last view we had of them drayton has prettily described the connexion which this neighbourhood has with ours when he makes skiddaw say scurfell from the sky that anadale doth crown with a most amorous eye salutes me every day or at my pride looks grim oft threatning me with clouds as i oft threatning him footnote criffelj c s footnote annandalej c s these lines recurred to williams memory and we talked of burns and of the prospect he must have had perhaps from his own door of skiddaw and his companions indulging ourselves in the fancy that we might have been personally known to each other and he have looked upon those objects with more pleasure for our sakes we talked of coleridges children and family then at the foot of skiddaw and our own newborn john a few miles behind it while the grave of burnss son which we had just seen by the side of his father and some stories heard at dumfries respecting the dangers his surviving children were exposed to filled us with melancholy concern which had a kind of connexion with ourselves in recollection of this william long afterwards wrote the following address to the sons of the illfated poet ye now are panting up lifes hill tis twilight time of good and ill and more than common strength and skill must ye display if ye would give the better will its lawful sway strongbodied if ye be to bear intemperance with less harm beware but if your fathers wit ye share then then indeed ye sons of burns for watchful care there will be need for honest men delight will take to shew you favour for his sake will flatter you and fool and rake your steps pursue and of your fathers name will make a snare for you let no mean hope your souls enslave be independent generous brave your father such example gave and such revere but be admonished by his grave and think and fear friday august thopen country for a considerable way passed through the village of thornhill built by the duke of oueensberry the brotherhouses so small that they might have been built to stamp a character of insolent pride on his own huge mansion of drumlanrigg which is full in view on the opposite side of the nith this mansion is indeed very large but to us it appeared like a gathering together of little things the roof is broken into a hundred pieces cupolas etc in the shape of casters conjurors balls cups and the like the situation would be noble if the woods had been left standing but they have been cut down not long ago and the hills above and below the house are quite bare about a mile and a half from drumlanrigg is a turnpike gate at the top of a hill we left our car with the man and turned aside into a field where we looked down upon the nith which runs far below in a deep and rocky channel the banks woody the view pleasant down the river towards thornhill an open countrycorn fields pastures and scattered trees returned to the turnpike house a cold spot upon a common black cattle feeding close to the door our road led us down the hill to the side of the nith and we travelled along its banks for some miles here were clay cottages perhaps every half or quarter of a mile the bed of the stream rough with rocks banks irregular now woody now bare here a patch of broom there of corn then of pasturage and hills green or heathy above we were to have given our horse meal and water at a publichouse in one of the hamlets we passed through but missed the house for as is common in scotland it was without a signboard travelled on still beside the nith till we came to a turnpike house which stood rather high on the hillside and from the door we looked a long way up and down the river the air coldish the wind strong we asked the turnpike man to let us have some meal and water he had no meal but luckily we had part of a feed of corn brought from keswick and he procured some hay at a neighbouring house in the meantime i went into the house where was an old man with a grey plaid over his shoulders reading a newspaper on the shelf lay a volume of the scotch encyclopÃ¦dia a history of england and some other books the old man was a caller by the way the man of the house came back and we began to talk he was very intelligent had travelled all over england scotland and ireland as a gentlemans servant and now lived alone in that lonesome place he said he was tired of his bargain for he feared he should lose by it and he had indeed a troublesome office for coalcarts without number were passing by and the drivers seemed to do their utmost to cheat him there is always something peculiar in the house of a man living alone this was but halffurnished yet nothing seemed wanting for his comfort though a female who had travelled half as far would have needed fifty other things he had no other meat or drink in the house but oat bread and cheesethe cheese was made with the addition of seedsand some skimmed milk he gave us of his bread and cheese and milk which proved to be sour we had yet ten or eleven miles to travel and no food with us william lay under the wind in a cornfield below the house being not well enough to partake of the milk and bread coleridge gave our host a pamphlet the crisis of the sugar colonies he was well acquainted with burnss poems there was a politeness and a manly freedom in this mans manners which pleased me very much he told us that he had served a gentleman a captain in the armyhe did not know who he was for none of his relations had ever come to see him but he used to receive many lettersthat he had lived near dumfries till they would let him stay no longer he made such havoc with the game his whole delight from morning till night and the long year through was in field sports he would be on his feet the worst days in winter and wade through snow up to the middle after his game if he had company he was in tortures till they were gone he would then throw off his coat and put on an old jacket not worth halfacrown he drank his bottle of wine every day and two if he had better sport than usual ladies sometimes came to stay with his wife and he often carried them out in an irish jauntingcar and if they vexed him he would choose the dirtiest roads possible and spoil their clothes by jumping in and out of the car and treading upon them but for all thatand so he ended allhe was a good fellow and a clever fellow and he liked him well he would have ten or a dozen hares in the larder at once he half maintained his family with game and he himself was very fond of eating of the spoilunusual with true heartandsoul sportsmen the man gave us an account of his farm where he had lived which was so cheap and pleasant that we thought we should have liked to have had it ourselves soon after leaving the turnpike house we turned up a hill to the right the road for a little way very steep bare hills with sheep after ascending a little while we heard the murmur of a stream far below us and saw it flowing downwards on our left towards the nith and before us between steep green hills coming along a winding valley the simplicity of the prospect impressed us very much there was a single cottage by the brook side the dell was not heathy but it was impossible not to think of peter bells highland girl we now felt indeed that we were in scotland there was a natural peculiarity in this place in the scenes of the nith it had not been the same as england but yet not simple naked scotland the road led us down the hill and now there was no room in the vale but for the river and the road we had sometimes the stream to the right sometimes to the left the hills were pastoral but we did not see many sheep green smooth turf on the left no ferns on the right the heathplant grew in abundance of the most exquisite colour it covered a whole hillside or it was in streams and patches we travelled along the vale without appearing to ascend for some miles all the reaches were beautiful in exquisite proportion the hills seeming very high from being so near to us it might have seemed a valley which nature had kept to herself for pensive thoughts and tender feelings but that we were reminded at every turning of the road of something beyond by the coalcarts which were travelling towards us though these carts broke in upon the tranquillity of the glen they added much to the picturesque effect of the different views which indeed wanted nothing though perfectly bare houseless and treeless after some time our road took us upwards towards the end of the valley now the steeps were heathy all around just as we began to climb the hill we saw three boys who came down the cleft of a brow on our left one carried a fishingrod and the hats of all were braided with honeysuckles they ran after one another as wanton as the wind i can not express what a character of beauty those few honeysuckles in the hats of the three boys gave to the place what bower could they have come from we walked up the hill met two welldressed travellers the woman barefoot our little lads before they had gone far were joined by some halfdozen of their companions all without shoes and stockings they told us they lived at wanlockhead the village above pointing to the top of the hill they went to school and learned latin virgil and some of them greek homer but when coleridge began to inquire further off they ran poor things i suppose afraid of being examined when after a steep ascent we had reached the top of the hill we saw a village about half a mile before us on the side of another hill which rose up above the spot where we were after a descent a sort of valley or hollow nothing grew upon this ground or the hills above or below but heather yet round about the villagewhich consisted of a great number of huts all alike and all thatched with a few larger slated houses among them and a single modernbuilt one of a considerable sizewere a hundred patches of cultivated ground potatoes oats hay and grass we were struck with the sight of haycocks fastened down with aprons sheets pieces of sackingas we supposed to prevent the wind from blowing them away we afterwards found that this practice was very general in scotland every cottage seemed to have its little plot of ground fenced by a ridge of earth this plot contained two or three different divisions kail potatoes oats hay the houses all standing in lines or never far apart the cultivated ground was all together also and made a very strange appearance with its many greens among the dark brown hills neither tree nor shrub growing yet the grass and the potatoes looked greener than elsewhere owing to the bareness of the neighbouring hills it was indeed a wild and singular spotto use a womans illustration like a collection of patchwork made of pieces as they might have chanced to have been cut by the mantuamaker only just smoothed to fit each other the different sorts of produce being in such a multitude of plots and those so small and of such irregular shapes add to the strangeness of the village itself that we had been climbing upwards though gently for many miles and for the last mile and a half up a steep ascent and did not know of any village till we saw the boys who had come out to play the air was very cold and one could not help thinking what it must be in winter when those hills now red brown should have their three months covering of snow the village as we guessed is inhabited by miners the mines belong to the duke of queensberry the road to the village down which the lads scampered away was straight forward i must mention that we met just after we had parted from them another little fellow about six years old carrying a bundle over his shoulder he seemed poor and half starved and was scratching his fingers which were covered with the itch he was a miners son and lived at wanlockhead did not go to school but this was probably on account of his youth i mention him because he seemed to be a proof that there was poverty and wretchedness among these people though we saw no other symptom of it and afterwards we met scores of the inhabitants of this same village our road turned to the right and we saw at the distance of less than a mile a tall upright building of grey stone with several men standing upon the roof as if they were looking out over battlements it stood beyond the village upon higher ground as if presiding over ita kind of enchanters castle which it might have been a place where don quixote would have gloried in when we drew nearer we saw coming out of the side of the building a large machine or lever in appearance like a great forgehammer as we supposed for raising water out of the mines it heaved upwards once in half a minute with a slow motion and seemed to rest to take breath at the bottom its motion being accompanied with a sound between a groan and jike there would have been something in this object very striking in any place as it was impossible not to invest the machine with some faculty of intellect it seemed to have made the first step from brute matter to life and purpose showing its progress by great power william made a remark to this effect and coleridge observed that it was like a giant with one idea at all events the object produced a striking effect in that place where everything was in unison with itparticularly the building itself which was turretshaped and with the figures upon it resembled much one of the fortresses in the wooden cuts of bunyans holy war after ascending a considerable way we began to descend again and now we met a team of horses dragging an immense tree to the lead mines to repair or add to the building and presently after we came to a cart with another large tree and one horse left in it right in the middle of the highway we were a little out of humour thinking we must wait till the team came back there were men and boys without number all staring at us after a little consultation they set their shoulders to the cart and with a good heave all at once they moved it and we passed along these people were decently dressed and their manners decent there was no hooting or impudent laughter leadhills another mining village was the place of our destination for the night and soon after we had passed the cart we came in sight of it this village and the mines belong to lord hopetoun it has more stone houses than wanlockhead one large old mansion and a considerable number of old treesbeeches i believe the trees told of the coldness of the climate they were more brown than greenfar browner than the ripe grass of the little haygarths here as at wanlockhead were haycocks haystacks potatobeds and kailgarths in every possible variety of shape but i suppose from the irregularity of the ground it looked far less artificialindeed i should think that a painter might make several beautiful pictures in this village it straggles down both sides of a mountain glen as i have said there is a large mansion there is also a stone building that looks like a school and the houses are single or in clusters or rows as it may chance we passed a decentlooking inn the hopetoun arms but the house of mrs otto a widow had been recommended to us with high encomiums we did not then understand scotch inns and were not quite satisfied at first with our accommodations but all things were smoothed over by degrees we had a fire lighted in our dirty parlour tea came after a reasonable waiting and the fire with the gentle aid of twilight burnished up the room into cheerful comfort coleridge was weary but william and i walked out after tea we talked with one of the miners who informed us that the building which we had supposed to be a school was a library belonging to the village he said they had got a book into it a few weeks ago which had cost thirty pounds and that they had all sorts of books what have you shakespeare yes we have that and we found on further inquiry that they had a large library of long standing that lord hopetoun had subscribed liberally to it and that gentlemen who came with him were in the habit of making larger or smaller donations each man who had the benefit of it paid a small sum monthlyi think about fourpence the man we talked with spoke much of the comfort and quiet in which they lived one among another he made use of a noticeable expression saying that they were very peaceable people considering they lived so much undergroundwages were about thirty pounds a year they had land for potatoes warm houses plenty of coals and only six hours work each day so that they had leisure for reading if they chose he said the place was healthy that the inhabitants lived to a great age and indeed we saw no appearance of illhealth in their countenances but it is not common for people working in lead mines to be healthy and i have since heard that it is not a healthy place however this may be they are unwilling to allow it for the landlady the next morning when i said to her you have a cold climate replied ay but it is varra halesome we inquired of the man respecting the large mansion he told us that it was built as we might see in the form of an h and belonged to the hopetouns and they took their title from thence and that part of it was used as a chapel we went close to it and were a good deal amused with the building itself standing forth in bold contradiction of the story which i daresay every man of leadhills tells and every man believes that it is in the shape of an h it is but half an h and one must be very accommodating to allow it even so much for the legs are far too short footnote there is some mistake here the hopetoun title was not taken from any place in the leadhills much less from the house shaped like an hj c s we visited the buryingground a plot of land not very small crowded with graves and upright gravestones overlooking the village and the dell it was now the closing in of evening women and children were gathering in the linen for the night which was bleaching by the burnsidethe graves overgrown with grass such as by industrious culture had been raised up about the houses but there were bunches of heather here and there and with the bluebells that grew among the grass the small plot of ground had a beautiful and wild appearance william left me and i went to a shop to purchase some thread the woman had none that suited me but she would send a wee lad to the other shop in the meantime i sat with the mother and was much pleased with her manner and conversation she had an excellent fire and her cottage though very small looked comfortable and cleanly but remember i saw it only by firelight she confirmed what the man had told us of the quiet manner in which they lived and indeed her house and fireside seemed to need nothing to make it a cheerful happy spot but health and good humour there was a bookishness a certain formality in this womans language which was very remarkable she had a dark complexion dark eyes and wore a very white cap much over her face which gave her the look of a french woman and indeed afterwards the women on the roads frequently reminded us of french women partly from the extremely white caps of the elder women and still more perhaps from a certain gaiety and partycoloured appearance in their dress in general white bedgowns are very common and you rarely meet a young girl with either hat or cap they buckle up their hair often in a graceful manner i returned to the inn and went into the kitchen to speak with the landlady she had made a hundred hesitations when i told her we wanted three beds at last she confessed she had three beds and showed me into a parlour which looked damp and cold but she assured me in a tone that showed she was unwilling to be questioned further that all her beds were well aired i sat a while by the kitchen fire with the landlady and began to talk to her but much as i had heard in her praisefor the shopkeeper had told me she was a varra discreet womani can not say that her manners pleased me much but her servant made amends for she was as pleasant and cheerful a lass as was ever seen and when we asked her to do anything she answered oh yes with a merry smile and almost ran to get us what we wanted she was about sixteen years old wore shoes and stockings and had her hair tucked up with a comb the servant at brownhill was a coarselooking wench barefoot and barelegged i examined the kitchen round about it was crowded with furniture drawers cupboards dishcovers pictures pans and pots arranged without order except that the plates were on shelves and the dishcovers hung in rows these were very clean but floors passages staircase everything else dirty there were two beds in recesses in the wall above one of them i noticed a shelf with some booksit made me think of chaucers clerke of oxenforde liever had he at his beds head twenty books clothed in black and red they were baking oatbread which they cut into quarters and halfbaked over the fire and halftoasted before it there was a suspiciousness about mrs otto almost like illnature she was very jealous of any inquiries that might appear to be made with the faintest idea of a comparison between leadhills and any other place except the advantage was evidently on the side of leadhills we had nice honey to breakfast when ready to depart we learned that we might have seen the library which we had not thought of till it was too late and we were very sorry to go away without seeing it saturday august thleft leadhills at nine oclock regretting much that we could not stay another day that we might have made more minute inquiries respecting the manner of living of the miners and been able to form an estimate from our own observation of the degree of knowledge health and comfort that there was among them the air was keen and cold we might have supposed it to be three months later in the season and two hours earlier in the day the landlady had not lighted us a fire so i was obliged to get myself toasted in the kitchen and when we set off i put on both grey cloak and spencer our road carried us down the valley and we soon lost sight of leadhills for the valley made a turn almost immediately and we saw two miles perhaps before us the glen sloped somewhat rapidlyheathy bare no hut or house passed by a shepherd who was sitting upon the ground reading with the book on his knee screened from the wind by his plaid while a flock of sheep were feeding near him among the rushes and coarse grassfor as we descended we came among lands where grass grew with the heather travelled through several reaches of the glen which somewhat resembled the valley of menock on the other side of wanlockhead but it was not near so beautiful the forms of the mountains did not melt so exquisitely into each other and there was a coldness and if i may so speak a want of simplicity in the surface of the earth the heather was poor not covering a whole hillside not in luxuriant streams and beds interveined with rich verdure but patchy and stunted with here and there coarse grass and rushes but we soon came in sight of a spot that impressed us very much at the lower end of this new reach of the vale was a decayed tree beside a decayed cottage the vale spreading out into a level area which was one large field without fence and without division of a dull yellow colour the vale seemed to partake of the desolation of the cottage and to participate in its decay and yet the spot was in its nature so dreary that one would rather have wondered how it ever came to be tenanted by man than lament that it was left to waste and solitude yet the encircling hills were so exquisitely formed that it was impossible to conceive anything more lovely than this place would have been if the valley and hillsides had been interspersed with trees cottages green fields and hedgerows but all was desolate the one large field which filled up the area of the valley appeared as i have said in decay and seemed to retain the memory of its connexion with man in some way analogous to the ruined building for it was as much of a field as mr kings best pasture scattered over with his fattest cattle we went on looking before us the place losing nothing of its hold upon our minds when we discovered a woman sitting right in the middle of the field alone wrapped up in a grey cloak or plaid she sat motionless all the time we looked at her which might be nearly half an hour we could not conceive why she sat there for there were neither sheep nor cattle in the field her appearance was very melancholy in the meantime our road carried us nearer to the cottage though we were crossing over the hill to the left leaving the valley below us and we perceived that a part of the building was inhabited and that what we had supposed to be one blasted tree was eight trees four of which were entirely blasted the others partly so and round about the place was a little potato and cabbage garth fenced with earth no doubt that woman had been an inhabitant of the cottage however this might be there was so much obscurity and uncertainty about her and her figure agreed so well with the desolation of the place that we were indebted to the chance of her being there for some of the most interesting feelings that we had ever had from natural objects connected with man in dreary solitariness we had been advised to go along the new road which would have carried us down the vale but we met some travellers who recommended us to climb the hill and go by the village of crawfordjohn as being much nearer we had a long hill and after having reached the top steep and bad roads so we continued to walk for a considerable way the air was cold and clearthe sky blue we walked cheerfully along in the sunshine each of us alone only william had the charge of the horse and car so he sometimes took a ride which did but poorly recompense him for the trouble of driving i never travelled with more cheerful spirits than this day our road was along the side of a high moor i can always walk over a moor with a light foot i seem to be drawn more closely to nature in such places than anywhere else or rather i feel more strongly the power of nature over me and am better satisfied with myself for being able to find enjoyment in what unfortunately to many persons is either dismal or insipid this moor however was more than commonly interesting we could see a long way and on every side of us were larger or smaller tracts of cultivated land some were extensive farms yet in so large a waste they did but look small with farmhouses barns etc others like little cottages with enough to feed a cow and supply the family with vegetables in looking at these farms we had always one feeling why did the plough stop there why might not they as well have carried it twice as far there were no hedgerows near the farms and very few trees as we were passing along we saw an old man the first we had seen in a highland bonnet walking with a staff at a very slow pace by the edge of one of the moorland cornfields he wore a grey plaid and a dog was by his side there was a scriptural solemnity in this mans figure a sober simplicity which was most impressive scotland is the country above all others that i have seen in which a man of imagination may carve out his own pleasures there are so many inhabited solitudes and the employments of the people are so immediately connected with the places where you find them and their dresses so simple so much alike yet from their being folding garments admitting of an endless variety and falling often so gracefully after some time we descended towards a broad vale passed one farmhouse sheltered by fir trees with a burn close to it children playing linen bleaching the vale was open pastures and cornfields unfenced the land poor the village of crawfordjohn on the slope of a hill a long way before us to the left asked about our road of a man who was driving a cart he told us to go through the village then along some fields and we should come to a herds house by the burn side the highway was right through the vale unfenced on either side the people of the village who were making hay all stared at us and our carriage we inquired the road of a middleaged man dressed in a shabby black coat at work in one of the hay fields he looked like the minister of the place and when he spoke we felt assured that he was so for he was not sparing of hard words which however he used with great propriety and he spoke like one who had been accustomed to dictate our car wanted mending in the wheel and we asked him if there was a blacksmith in the village yes he replied but when we showed him the wheel he told william that he might mend it himself without a blacksmith and he would put him in the way so he fetched hammer and nails and gave his directions which william obeyed and repaired the damage entirely to his own satisfaction and the priests who did not offer to lend any assistance himself not as if he would not have been willing in case of need but as if it were more natural for him to dictate and because he thought it more fit that william should do it himself he spoke much about the propriety of every mans lending all the assistance in his power to travellers and with some ostentation of selfpraise here i observed a honeysuckle and some flowers growing in a garden the first i had seen in scotland it is a pretty cheerfullooking village but must be very cold in winter it stands on a hillside and the vale itself is very high ground unsheltered by trees left the village behind us and our road led through arable ground for a considerable way on which were growing very good crops of corn and potatoes our friend accompanied us to show us the way and coleridge and he had a scientific conversation concerning the uses and properties of lime and other manures he seemed to be a wellinformed man somewhat pedantic in his manners but this might be only the difference between scotch and english footnote probably the rev john aird minister of the parish j c s soon after he had parted from us we came upon a stony rough road over a black moor and presently to the herds house by the burn side we could hardly cross the burn dryshod over which was the only road to the cottage in england there would have been steppingstones or a bridge but the scotch need not be afraid of wetting their bare feet the hut had its little kailgarth fenced with earth there was no other enclosurebut the common heathy with coarse grass travelled along the common for some miles before we joined the great road from longtown to glasgowsaw on the bare hillsides at a distance sometimes a solitary farm now and then a plantation and one very large wood with an appearance of richer ground above but it was so very high we could not think it possible having descended considerably the common was no longer of a peatmossy brown heath colour but grass with rushes was its chief produce there was sometimes a solitary hut no enclosures except the kailgarth and sheep pasturing in flocks with shepherdboys tending them i remember one boy in particular he had no hat on and only had a grey plaid wrapped about him it is nothing to describe but on a bare moor alone with his sheep standing as he did in utter quietness and silence there was something uncommonly impressive in his appearance a solemnity which recalled to our minds the old man in the cornfield we passed many people who were mowing or raking the grass of the common it was little better than rushes but they did not mow straight forward only here and there where it was the best in such a place haycocks had an uncommon appearance to us after a long descent we came to some plantations which were not far from douglas mill the country for some time had been growing into cultivation and now it was a wide vale with large tracts of corn trees in clumps no hedgerows which always make a country look bare and unlovely for my part i was better pleased with the desert places we had left behind though no doubt the inhabitants of this place think it a varra bonny spot for the scotch are always pleased with their own abode be it what it may and afterwards at edinburgh when we were talking with a bookseller of our travels he observed that it was a fine country near douglas mill douglas mill is a single house a large inn being one of the regular stages between longtown and glasgow and therefore a fair specimen of the best of the country inns of scotland as soon as our car stopped at the door we felt the difference at an english inn of this size a waiter or the master or mistress would have been at the door immediately but we remained some time before anybody came then a barefooted lass made her appearance but she only looked at us and went away the mistress a remarkably handsome woman showed us into a large parlour we ordered muttonchops and i finished my letter to mary writing on the same windowledge on which william had written to me two years before after dinner william and i sat by a little millrace in the garden we had left leadhills and wanlockhead far above us and now were come into a warmer climate but there was no richness in the face of the country the shrubs looked cold and poor and yet there were some very fine trees within a little distance of douglas mill so that the reason perhaps why the few low shrubs and trees which were growing in the gardens seemed to be so unluxuriant might be that there being no hedgerows the general appearance of the country was naked and i could not help seeing the same coldness where perhaps it did not exist in itself to any great degree for the corn crops are abundant and i should think the soil is not bad while we were sitting at the door two of the landladys children came out the elder a boy about six years old was running away from his little brother in petticoats the ostler called out sandy tak your wee brither wi you another voice from the window sawny dinna leave your wee brither the mother then came alexander tak your wee brother by the hand alexander obeyed and the two went off in peace together we were charged eightpence for hay at this inn another symptom of our being in scotland left douglas mill at about three oclock travelled through an open corn country the tracts of corn large and unenclosed we often passed women or children who were watching a single cow while it fed upon the slips of grass between the corn william asked a strong woman about thirty years of age who looked like the mistress of a familyi suppose moved by some sentiment of compassion for her being so employedif the cow would eat the corn if it were left to itself she smiled at his simplicity it is indeed a melancholy thing to see a fullgrown woman thus waiting as it were body and soul devoted to the poor beast yet even this is better than working in a manufactory the day through we came to a moorish tract saw before us the hills of loch lomond ben lomond and another distinct each by itself not far from the roadside were some benches placed in rows in the middle of a large field with a sort of covered shed like a sentrybox but much more like those boxes which the italian puppetshowmen in london use we guessed that it was a pulpit or tent for preaching and were told that a sect met there occasionally who held that toleration was unscriptural and would have all religions but their own exterminated i have forgotten what name the man gave to this sect we could not learn that it differed in any other respect from the church of scotland travelled for some miles along the open country which was all without hedgerows sometimes arable sometimes moorish and often whole tracts covered with grunsel there was one field which one might have believed had been sown with grunsel it was so regularly covered with ita large square field upon a slope its boundary marked to our eyes only by the termination of the bright yellow contiguous to it were other fields of the same size and shape one of clover the other of potatoes all equally regular crops the oddness of this appearance the grunsel being uncommonly luxuriant and the field as yellow as gold made william laugh coleridge was melancholy upon it observing that there was land enough wasted to rear a healthy child footnote ragweedj c s we left behind us considerably to the right a single high mountain i have forgotten its name we had had it long in view saw before us the river clyde its course at right angles to our road which now made a turn running parallel with the river the town of lanerk in sight long before we came to it i was somewhat disappointed with the first view of the clyde the banks though swelling and varied had a poverty in their appearance chiefly from the want of wood and hedgerows crossed the river and ascended towards lanerk which stands upon a hill when we were within about a mile of the town william parted from coleridge and me to go to the celebrated waterfalls coleridge did not attempt to drive the horse but led him all the way we inquired for the best inn and were told that the new inn was the best but that they had very genteel apartments at the black bull and made less charges and the black bull was at the entrance of the town so we thought we would stop there as the horse was obstinate and weary but when we came to the black bull we had no wish to enter the apartments for it seemed the abode of dirt and poverty yet it was a large building the town showed a sort of french face and would have done much more had it not been for the true british tinge of coalsmoke the doors and windows dirty the shops dull the women too seemed to be very dirty in their dress the town itself is not ugly the houses are of grey stone the streets not very narrow and the marketplace decent the new inn is a handsome old stone building formerly a gentlemans house we were conducted into a parlour where people had been drinking the tables were unwiped chairs in disorder the floor dirty and the smell of liquors was most offensive we were tired however and rejoiced in our tea footnote tintoj c s the evening sun was now sending a glorious light through the street which ran from west to east the houses were of a fire red and the faces of the people as they walked westward were almost like a blacksmith when he is at work by night i longed to be out and meet with william that we might see the falls before the day was gone poor coleridge was unwell and could not go i inquired my road and a little girl told me she would go with me to the porters lodge where i might be admitted i was grieved to hear that the falls of the clyde were shut up in a gentlemans grounds and to be viewed only by means of lock and key much however as the pure feeling with which one would desire to visit such places is disturbed by useless impertinent or even unnecessary interference with nature yet when i was there the next morning i seemed to feel it a less disagreeable thing than in smaller and more delicate spots if i may use the phrase my guide a sensible little girl answered my inquiries very prettily she was eight years old read in the collection a book which all the scotch children whom i have questioned read in i found it was a collection of hymns she could repeat several of dr watts we passed through a great part of the town then turned down a steep hill and came in view of a long range of cotton mills the largest and loftiest i had ever seen climbed upwards again our road leading us along the top of the left bank of the river both banks very steep and richly wooded the girl left me at the porters lodge having asked after william i was told that no person had been there or could enter but by the gate the night was coming on therefore i did not venture to go in as i had no hope of meeting william i had a delicious walk alone through the wood the sound of the water was very solemn and even the cotton mills in the fading light of evening had somewhat of the majesty and stillness of the natural objects it was nearly dark when i reached the inn i found coleridge sitting by a good fire which always makes an inn room look comfortable in a few minutes william arrived he had heard of me at the gate and followed as quickly as he could shouting after me he was pale and exceedingly tired footnote new lanark robert owens millsj c s after he had left us he had taken a wrong road and while looking about to set himself right had met with a barefooted boy who said he would go with him the little fellow carried him by a wild path to the upper of the falls the boniton linn and coming down unexpectedly upon it he was exceedingly affected by the solemn grandeur of the place this fall is not much admired or spoken of by travellers you have never a full breast view of it it does not make a complete selfsatisfying place an abode of its own as a perfect waterfall seems to me to do but the river down which you look through a long vista of steep and ruinlike rocks the roaring of the waterfall and the solemn evening lights must have been most impressive one of the rocks on the near bank even in broad daylight as we saw it the next morning is exactly like the fractured arch of an abbey with the lights and shadows of evening upon it the resemblance must have been much more striking williams guide was a pretty boy and he was exceedingly pleased with him just as they were quitting the waterfall williams mind being full of the majesty of the scene the little fellow pointed to the top of a rock theres a fine slaebush there ay said william but there are no slaes upon it which was true enough but i suppose the child remembered the slaes of another summer though as he said he was but half seven years old namely six and a half he conducted william to the other fall and as they were going along a narrow path they came to a small cavern where william lost him and looking about saw his pretty figure in a sort of natural niche fitted for a statue from which the boy jumped out laughing delighted with the success of his trick william told us a great deal about him while he sat by the fire and of the pleasure of his walk often repeating i wish you had been with me having no change he gave the boy sixpence which was certainly if he had formed any expectations at all far beyond them but he received it with the utmost indifference without any remark of surprise or pleasure most likely he did not know how many halfpence he could get for it and twopence would have pleased him more my little girl was delighted with the sixpence i gave her and said she would buy a book with it on monday morning what a difference between the manner of living and education of boys and of girls among the lower classes of people in towns she had never seen the falls of the clyde nor had ever been further than the porters lodge the boy i daresay knew every hidingplace in every accessible rock as well as the fine slae bushes and the nut trees second week sunday august stthe morning was very hot a morning to tempt us to linger by the waterside i wished to have had the day before us expecting so much from what william had seen but when we went there i did not desire to stay longer than till the hour which we had prescribed to ourselves for it was a rule not to be broken in upon that the person who conducted us to the falls was to remain by our side till we chose to depart we left our inn immediately after breakfast the lanes were full of people going to church many of the middleaged women wore long scarlet cardinals and were without hats they brought to my mind the women of goslar as they used to go to church in their silver or gold caps with their long cloaks black or coloured the banks of the clyde from lanerk to the falls rise immediately from the river they are lofty and steep and covered with wood the road to the falls is along the top of one of the banks and to the left you have a prospect of the open country corn fields and scattered houses to the right over the river the country spreads out as it were into a plain covered over with hills no one hill much higher than another but hills all over there were endless pastures overgrown with broom and scattered trees without hedges or fences of any kind and no distinct footpaths it was delightful to see the lasses in gay dresses running like cattle among the broom making their way straight forward towards the river here and there as it might chance they waded across the stream and when they had reached the top of the opposite bank sat down by the roadside about half a mile from the town to put on their shoes and cotton stockings which they brought tied up in pockethandkerchiefs the porters lodge is about a mile from lanerk and the ladys housefor the whole belongs to a lady whose name i have forgottenis upon a hill at a little distance we walked after we had entered the private grounds perhaps two hundred yards along a gravel carriageroad then came to a little side gate which opened upon a narrow gravel path under trees and in a minute and a half or less were directly opposite to the great waterfall i was much affected by the first view of it the majesty and strength of the water for i had never before seen so large a cataract struck me with astonishment which died away giving place to more delightful feelings though there were some buildings that i could have wished had not been there though at first unnoticed the chief of them was a neat white ladylike house very near to the waterfall william and coleridge however were in a better and perhaps wiser humour and did not dislike the house indeed it was a very nicelooking place with a moderatesized garden leaving the green fields free and open this house is on the side of the river opposite to the grand house and the pleasuregrounds the waterfall cora linn is composed of two falls with a sloping space which appears to be about twenty yards between but is much more the basin which receives the fall is enclosed by noble rocks with trees chiefly hazels birch and ash growing out of their sides whenever there is any hold for them and a magnificent restingplace it is for such a river i think more grand than the falls themselves footnote lady mary rossj c s footnote corehousej c s after having stayed some time we returned by the same footpath into the main carriageroad and soon came upon what william calls an ellwide gravel walk from which we had different views of the linn we sat upon a bench placed for the sake of one of these views whence we looked down upon the waterfall and over the open country and saw a ruined tower called wallaces tower which stands at a very little distance from the fall and is an interesting object a lady and gentleman more expeditious tourists than ourselves came to the spot they left us at the seat and we found them again at another station above the falls coleridge who is always goodnatured enough to enter into conversation with anybody whom he meets in his way began to talk with the gentleman who observed that it was a majestic waterfall coleridge was delighted with the accuracy of the epithet particularly as he had been settling in his own mind the precise meaning of the words grand majestic sublime etc and had discussed the subject with william at some length the day before yes sir says coleridge it is a majestic waterfall sublime and beautiful replied his friend poor coleridge could make no answer and not very desirous to continue the conversation came to us and related the story laughing heartily the distance from one linn to the other may be half a mile or more along the same ellwide walk we came to a pleasurehouse of which the little girl had the key she said it was called the foghouse because it was lined with fog namely moss on the outside it resembled some of the huts in the prints belonging to captain cooks voyages and within was like a haystack scooped out it was circular with a domelike roof a seat all round fixed to the wall and a table in the middleseat wall roof and table all covered with moss in the neatest manner possible it was as snug as a birds nest i wish we had such a one at the top of our orchard only a great deal smaller we afterwards found that huts of the same kind were common in the pleasuregrounds of scotland but we never saw any that were so beautifully wrought as this it had however little else to recommend it the situation being chosen without judgment there was no prospect from it nor was it a place of seclusion and retirement for it stood close to the ellwide gravel walk we wished we could have shoved it about a hundred yards further on when we arrived at a bench which was also close to the walk for just below the bench the walk elbowing out into a circle there was a beautiful spring of clear water which we could see rise up continually at the bottom of a round stone basin full to the brim the water gushing out at a little outlet and passing away under the walk a reason was wanted for placing the hut where it is what a good one would this little spring have furnished for bringing it hither along the whole of the path were openings at intervals for views of the river but as almost always happens in gentlemens grounds they were injudiciously managed you were prepared for a dead standby a parapet a painted seat or some other device we stayed some time at the boniton fall which has one great advantage over the other falls that it is at the termination of the pleasuregrounds and we see no traces of the boundaryline yet except under some accidental circumstances such as a sunset like that of the preceding evening it is greatly inferior to the cora linn we returned to the inn to dinner the landlord set the first dish upon the table as is common in england and we were well waited upon this first dish was true scottisha boiled sheeps head with the hair singed off coleridge and i ate heartily of it we had barley broth in which the sheeps head had been boiled a party of tourists whom we had met in the pleasuregrounds drove from the door while we were waiting for dinner i guess they were fresh from england for they had stuffed the pockets of their carriage with bundles of heather roots and all just as if scotland grew no heather but on the banks of the clyde they passed away with their treasure towards loch lomond a party of boys dressed all alike in blue very neat were standing at the chaisedoor we conjectured they were charity scholars but found on inquiry that they were apprentices to the cotton factory we were told that they were well instructed in reading and writing we had seen in the morning a flock of girls dressed in grey coming out of the factory probably apprentices also after dinner set off towards hamilton but on foot for we had to turn aside to the cartland rocks and our car was to meet us on the road a guide attended us who might almost in size and certainly in activity have been compared with williams companion who hid himself in the niche of the cavern his method of walking and very quick step soon excited our attention i could hardly keep up with him he paddled by our side just reaching to my shoulder like a little dog with his long snout pushed before himfor he had an enormous nose and walked with his head foremost i said to him how quick you walk he replied that was not quick walking and when i asked him what he called so he said five miles an hour and then related in how many hours he had lately walked from lanerk to edinburgh done some errands and returned to lanerki have forgotten the particulars but it was a very short timeand added that he had an old father who could walk at the rate of four miles an hour for twentyfour miles any day and had never had an hours sickness in his life then said i he has not drunk much strong liquor yes enough to drown him from his eager manner of uttering this i inferred that he himself was a drinker and the man who met us with the car told william that he gained a great deal of money as an errandgoer but spent it all in tippling he had been a shoemaker but could not bear the confinement on account of a weakness in his chest the neighbourhood of lanerk is exceedingly pleasant we came to a sort of district of glens or little valleys that cleave the hills leaving a cheerful open country above them with no superior hills but an undulating surface our guide pointed to the situation of the cartland crags we were to cross a narrow valley and walk down on the other side and then we should be at the spot but the little fellow made a sharp turn down a footpath to the left saying we must have some conversation here he paddled on with his small pawing feet till we came right opposite to a gentlemans house on the other side of the valley when he halted repeating some words i have forgotten what which were taken up by the most distinct echo i ever heardthis is saying little it was the most distinct echo that it is possible to conceive it shouted the names of our fireside friends in the very tone in which william and coleridge spoke but it seemed to make a joke of me and i could not help laughing at my own voice it was so shrill and pert exactly as if some one had been mimicking it very successfully with an intention of making me ridiculous i wished joanna had been there to laugh for the echo is an excellent laugher and would have almost made her believe that it was a true story which william has told of her and the mountains we turned back crossed the valley went through the orchard and plantations belonging to the gentlemans house by the bye we observed to our guide that the echo must bring many troublesome visitors to disturb the quiet of the owner of that house oh no said he he glories in much company he was a native of that neighbourhood had made a moderate fortune abroad purchased an estate built the house and raised the plantations and further had made a convenient walk through his woods to the cartland crags the house was modest and neat and though not adorned in the best taste and though the plantations were of fir we looked at it with great pleasure there was such true liberality and kindheartedness in leaving his orchard path open and his walks unobstructed by gates i hope this goodness is not often abused by plunderers of the appletrees which were hung with tempting apples close to the path at the termination of the little valley we descended through a wood along a very steep path to a muddy stream running over limestone rocks turned up to the left along the bed of the stream and soon we were closed in by rocks on each side they were very loftyof limestone trees starting out of them high and low overhanging the stream or shooting up towards the sky no place of the kind could be more beautiful if the stream had been clear but it was of a muddy yellow colour had it been a large river one might have got the better of the unpleasantness of the muddy water in the grandeur of its roaring the boiling up of the foam over the rocks or the obscurity of its pools we had been told that the cartland crags were better worth going to see than the falls of the clyde i did not think so but i have seen rocky dells resembling this before with clear water instead of that muddy stream and never saw anything like the falls of the clyde it would be a delicious spot to have near ones house one would linger out many a day in the cool shade of the caverns and the stream would soothe one by its murmuring still being an old friend one would not love it the less for its homely face even we as we passed along could not help stopping for a long while to admire the beauty of the lazy foam for ever in motion and never moved away in a still place of the water covering the whole surface of it with streaks and lines and evervarying circles wild marjoram grew upon the rocks in great perfection and beauty our guide gave me a bunch and said he should come hither to collect a store for tea for the winter and that it was varra halesome he drank none else we walked perhaps half a mile along the bed of the river but it might seem to be much further than it was owing to the difficulty of the path and the sharp and many turnings of the glen passed two of wallaces caves there is scarce a noted glen in scotland that has not a cave for wallace or some other hero before we left the river the rocks became less lofty turned into a wood through which was a convenient path upwards met the owner of the house and the echoground and thanked him for the pleasure which he had provided for us and other travellers by making such pretty pathways it was four oclock when we reached the place where the car was waiting we were anxious to be off as we had fifteen miles to go but just as we were seating ourselves we found that the cushions were missing william was forced to go back to the town a mile at least and coleridge and i waited with the car it rained and we had some fear that the evening would be wet but the rain soon ceased though the sky continued gloomyan unfortunate circumstance for we had to travel through a beautiful country and of that sort which is most set off by sunshine and pleasant weather travelled through the vale or trough of the clyde as it is called for ten or eleven miles having the river on our right we had fine views both up and down the river for the first three or four miles our road being not close to it but above its banks along the open country which was here occasionally intersected by hedgerows left our car in the road and turned down a field to the fall of stonebyres another of the falls of the clyde which i had not heard spoken of therefore it gave me the more pleasure we saw it from the top of the bank of the river at a little distance it has not the imposing majesty of cora linn but it has the advantage of being left to itself a grand solitude in the heart of a populous country we had a prospect above and below it of cultivated grounds with haystacks houses hills but the rivers banks were lonesome steep and woody with rocks near the fall a little further on came more into company with the river sometimes we were close to it sometimes above it but always at no great distance and now the vale became more interesting and amusing it is very populous with villages hamlets single cottages or farmhouses embosomed in orchards and scattered over with gentlemens houses some of them very ugly tall and obtrusive others neat and comfortable we seemed now to have got into a country where poverty and riches were shaking hands together pears and apples of which the crop was abundant hung over the road often growing in orchards unfenced or there might be bunches of broom along the roadside in an interrupted line that looked like a hedge till we came to it and saw the gaps bordering on these fruitful orchards perhaps would be a patch its chief produce being gorse or broom there was nothing like a moor or common anywhere but small plots of uncultivated ground were left high and low among the potatoes corn cabbages which grew intermingled now among trees now bare the trough of the clyde is indeed a singular and very interesting region it is somewhat like the upper part of the vale of nith but above the nith is much less cultivated groundwithout hedgerows or orchards or anything that looks like a rich country we met crowds of people coming from the kirk the lasses were gaily dressed often in white gowns coloured satin bonnets and coloured silk handkerchiefs and generally with their shoes and stockings in a bundle hung on their arm before we left the river the vale became much less interesting resembling a poor english country the fields being large and unluxuriant hedges it had been dark long before we reached hamilton and william had some difficulty in driving the tired horse through the town at the inn they hesitated about being able to give us beds the house being brimfulllights at every window we were rather alarmed for our accommodations during the rest of the tour supposing the house to be filled with tourists but they were in general only regular travellers for out of the main road from town to town we saw scarcely a carriage and the inns were empty there was nothing remarkable in the treatment we met with at this inn except the lazy impertinence of the waiter it was a townish place with a great larder set out the house throughout dirty monday august ndimmediately after breakfast walked to the duke of hamiltons house to view the picturegallery chiefly the famous picture of daniel in the lions den by rubens it is a large building without grandeur a heavy lumpish mass after the fashion of the hopetoun h only five times the size and with longer legs which makes it gloomy we entered the gate passed the porters lodge where we saw nobody and stopped at the front door as william had done two years before with sir william rushs family we were met by a little meanlooking man shabbily dressed out of livery who we found was the porter after scanning us over he told us that we ought not to have come to that door we said we were sorry for the mistake but as one of our party had been there two years before and was admitted by the same entrance we had supposed it was the regular way after many hesitations and having kept us five minutes waiting in the large hall while he went to consult with the housekeeper he informed us that we could not be admitted at that time the housekeeper being unwell but that we might return in an hour he then conducted us through long gloomy passages to an obscure door at the corner of the house we asked if we might be permitted to walk in the park in the meantime and he told us that this would not be agreeable to the dukes family we returned to the inn discontented enough but resolved not to waste an hour if there were anything else in the neighbourhood worth seeing the waiter told us there was a curious place called baroncleugh with gardens cut out in rocks and we determined to go thither we had to walk through the town which may be about as large as penrith and perhaps a mile further along a dusty turnpike road the morning was hot sunny and windy and we were half tired before we reached the place but were amply repaid for our trouble footnote the house belonging to the earls of hopetoun at leadhills not that which bears this name about twelve miles from edinburghj c s the general face of the country near hamilton is much in the ordinary english style not very hilly with hedgerows corn fields and stone houses the clyde is here an open river with low banks and the country spreads out so wide that there is no appearance of a regular vale baroncleugh is in a beautiful deep glen through which runs the river avon a stream that falls into the clyde the house stands very sweetly in complete retirement it has its gardens and terraces one above another with flights of steps between boxtrees and yewtrees cut in fantastic shapes flowerborders and summerhouses and still below apples and pears were hanging in abundance on the branches of large old trees which grew intermingled with the natural wood elms beeches etc even to the waters edge the whole place is in perfect harmony with the taste of our ancestors and the yews and hollies are shaven as nicely and the gravel walks and flowerborders kept in as exact order as if the spirit of the first architect of the terraces still presided over them the opposite bank of the river is left in its natural wildness and nothing was to be seen higher up but the deep dell its steep banks being covered with fine trees a beautiful relief or contrast to the garden which is one of the most elaborate old things ever seen a little hanging garden of babylon i was sorry to hear that the owner of this sweet place did not live there always he had built a small thatched house to eke out the old one it was a neat dwelling with no false ornaments we were exceedingly sorry to quit this spot which is left to nature and past times and should have liked to have pursued the glen further up we were told that there was a ruined castle and the walk itself must be very delightful but we wished to reach glasgow in good time and had to go again to hamilton house returned to the town by a much shorter road and were very angry with the waiter for not having directed us to it but he was too great a man to speak three words more than he could help we stopped at the proper door of the dukes house and seated ourselves humbly upon a bench waiting the pleasure of the porter who after a little time informed us that we could not be admitted giving no reason whatever when we got to the inn we could just gather from the waiter that it was not usual to refuse admittance to strangers but that was all he could not or would not help us so we were obliged to give it up which mortified us for i had wished much to see the picture william vowed that he would write that very night to lord archibald hamilton stating the whole matter which he did from glasgow i ought to have mentioned the park though as we were not allowed to walk there we saw but little of it it looked pleasant as all parks with fine trees must be but as it seemed to be only a large nearly level plain it could not be a particularly beautiful park though it borders upon the clyde and the avon runs i believe through it after leaving the solitude of the glen of baroncleugh quitted hamilton at about eleven oclock there is nothing interesting between hamilton and glasgow till we came to bothwell castle a few miles from hamilton the country is cultivated but not rich the fields large a perfect contrast to the huddling together of hills and trees corn and pasture grounds haystacks cottages orchards broom and gorse but chiefly broom that had amused us so much the evening before in passing through the trough of the clyde a native of scotland would not probably be satisfied with the account i have given of the trough of the clyde for it is one of the most celebrated scenes in scotland we certainly received less pleasure from it than we had expected but it was plain that this was chiefly owing to the unfavourable circumstances under which we saw ita gloomy sky and a cold blighting wind it is a very beautiful district yet there as in all the other scenes of scotland celebrated for their fertility we found something which gave us a notion of barrenness of what was not altogether genial the new fir and larch plantations here as in almost every other part of scotland contributed not a little to this effect crossed the clyde not far from hamilton and had the river for some miles at a distance from us on our left but after having gone it might be three miles we came to a porters lodge on the left side of the road where we were to turn to bothwell castle which is in lord douglass grounds the woman who keeps the gate brought us a book in which we wrote down our names went about half a mile before we came to the pleasuregrounds came to a large range of stables where we were to leave the car but there was no one to unyoke the horse so william was obliged to do it himself a task which he performed very awkwardly being then new to it we saw the ruined castle embosomed in trees passed the house and soon found ourselves on the edge of a steep brow immediately above and overlooking the course of the river clyde through a deep hollow between woods and green steeps we had approached at right angles from the main road to the place over a flat and had seen nothing before us but a nearly level country terminated by distant slopes the clyde hiding himself in his deep bed it was exceedingly delightful to come thus unexpectedly upon such a beautiful region the castle stands nobly overlooking the clyde when we came up to it i was hurt to see that flowerborders had taken place of the natural overgrowings of the ruin the scattered stones and wild plants it is a large and grand pile of red freestone harmonizing perfectly with the rocks of the river from which no doubt it has been hewn when i was a little accustomed to the unnaturalness of a modern garden i could not help admiring the excessive beauty and luxuriance of some of the plants particularly the purpleflowered clematis and a broadleaved creeping plant without flowers which scrambled up the castle wall along with the ivy and spread its vinelike branches so lavishly that it seemed to be in its natural situation and one could not help thinking that though not selfplanted among the ruins of this country it must somewhere have its natural abode in such places if bothwell castle had not been close to the douglas mansion we should have been disgusted with the possessors miserable conception of adorning such a venerable ruin but it is so very near to the house that of necessity the pleasuregrounds must have extended beyond it and perhaps the neatness of a shaven lawn and the complete desolation natural to a ruin might have made an unpleasing contrast and besides being within the precincts of the pleasuregrounds and so very near to the modern mansion of a noble family it has forfeited in some degree its independent majesty and becomes a tributary to the mansion its solitude being interrupted it has no longer the same command over the mind in sending it back into past times or excluding the ordinary feelings which we bear about us in daily life we had then only to regret that the castle and house were so near to each other and it was impossible not to regret it for the ruin presides in state over the river far from city or town as if it might have had a peculiar privilege to preserve its memorials of past ages and maintain its own character and independence for centuries to come we sat upon a bench under the high trees and had beautiful views of the different reaches of the river above and below on the opposite bank which is finely wooded with elms and other trees are the remains of an ancient priory built upon a rock and rock and ruin are so blended together that it is impossible to separate the one from the other nothing can be more beautiful than the little remnants of this holy place elm treesfor we were near enough to distinguish them by their branchesgrow out of the walls and overshadow a small but very elegant window it can scarcely be conceived what a grace the castle and priory impart to each other and the river clyde flows on smooth and unruffled below seeming to my thoughts more in harmony with the sober and stately images of former times than if it had roared over a rocky channel forcing its sound upon the ear it blended gently with the warbling of the smaller birds and chattering of the larger ones that had made their nests in the ruins in this fortress the chief of the english nobility were confined after the battle of bannockburn if a man is to be a prisoner he scarcely could have a more pleasant place to solace his captivity but i thought that for close confinement i should prefer the banks of a lake or the seaside the greatest charm of a brook or river is in the liberty to pursue it through its windings you can then take it in whatever mood you like silent or noisy sportive or quiet the beauties of a brook or river must be sought and the pleasure is in going in search of them those of a lake or of the sea come to you of themselves these rude warriors cared little perhaps about either and yet if one may judge from the writings of chaucer and from the old romances more interesting passions were connected with natural objects in the days of chivalry than now though going in search of scenery as it is called had not then been thought of i had heard nothing of bothwell castle at least nothing that i remembered therefore perhaps my pleasure was greater compared with what i received elsewhere than others might feel at our return to the stables we found an inferior groom who helped william to yoke the horse and was very civil we grew hungry before we had travelled many miles and seeing a large publichouseit was in a walled court some yards from the roadcoleridge got off the car to inquire if we could dine there and was told we could have nothing but eggs it was a miserable place very like a french house indeed we observed in almost every part of scotland except edinburgh that we were reminded ten times of france and germany for once of england saw nothing remarkable after leaving bothwell except the first view of glasgow at some miles distance terminated by the mountains of loch lomond the suburbs of glasgow extend very far houses on each side of the highwayall ugly and the inhabitants dirty the roads are very wide and everything seems to tell of the neighbourhood of a large town we were annoyed by carts and dirt and the road was full of people who all noticed our car in one way or other the children often sent a hooting after us wearied completely we at last reached the town and were glad to walk leading the car to the first decent inn which was luckily not far from the end of the town william who gained most of his roadknowledge from ostlers had been informed of this house by the ostler at hamilton it proved quiet and tolerably cheap a new buildingthe saracens head i shall never forget how glad i was to be landed in a little quiet backparlour for my head was beating with the noise of carts which we had left and the wearisomeness of the disagreeable objects near the highway but with my first pleasant sensations also came the feeling that we were not in an english innpartly from its halfunfurnished appearance which is common in scotland for in general the deal wainscots and doors are unpainted and partly from the dirtiness of the floors having dined william and i walked to the postoffice and after much seeking found out a quiet timberyard wherein to sit down and read our letter we then walked a considerable time in the streets which are perhaps as handsome as streets can be which derive no particular effect from their situation in connexion with natural advantages such as rivers sea or hills the trongate an old street is very picturesquehigh houses with an intermixture of gable fronts towards the street the new town is built of fine stone in the best style of the very best london streets at the west end of the town but not being of brick they are greatly superior one thing must strike every stranger in his first walk through glasgowan appearance of business and bustle but no coaches or gentlemens carriages during all the time we walked in the streets i only saw three carriages and these were travelling chaises i also could not but observe a want of cleanliness in the appearance of the lower orders of the people and a dulness in the dress and outside of the whole mass as they moved along we returned to the inn before it was dark i had a bad headache and was tired and we all went to bed soon tuesday august rda cold morning walked to the bleachingground a large field bordering on the clyde the banks of which are perfectly flat and the general face of the country is nearly so in the neighbourhood of glasgow this field the whole summer through is covered with women of all ages children and young girls spreading out their linen and watching it while it bleaches the scene must be very cheerful on a fine day but it rained when we were there and though there was linen spread out in all parts and great numbers of women and girls were at work yet there would have been many more on a fine day and they would have appeared happy instead of stupid and cheerless in the middle of the field is a washhouse whither the inhabitants of this large town rich and poor send or carry their linen to be washed there are two very large rooms with each a cistern in the middle for hot water and all round the rooms are benches for the women to set their tubs upon both the rooms were crowded with washers there might be a hundred or two or even three for it is not easy to form an accurate notion of so great a number however the rooms were large and they were both full it was amusing to see so many women arms head and face all in motion all busy in an ordinary household employment in which we are accustomed to see at the most only three or four women employed in one place the women were very civil i learnt from them the regulations of the house but i have forgotten the particulars the substance of them is that so much is to be paid for each tub of water so much for a tub and the privilege of washing for a day and so much to the general overlookers of the linen when it is left to be bleached an old man and woman have this office who were walking about two melancholy figures footnote glasgow greenj c s the shops at glasgow are large and like london shops and we passed by the largest coffeeroom i ever saw you look across the piazza of the exchange and see to the end of the coffeeroom where there is a circular window the width of the room perhaps there might be thirty gentlemen sitting on the circular bench of the window each reading a newspaper they had the appearance of figures in a fantoccine or men seen at the extremity of the operahouse diminished into puppets i am sorry i did not see the high church both william and i were tired and it rained very hard after we had left the bleachingground besides i am less eager to walk in a large town than anywhere else so we put it off and i have since repented of my irresolution dined and left glasgow at about three oclock in a heavy rain we were obliged to ride through the streets to keep our feet dry and in spite of the rain every person as we went along stayed his steps to look at us indeed we had the pleasure of spreading smiles from one end of glasgow to the otherfor we travelled the whole length of the town a set of schoolboys perhaps there might be eight with satchels over their shoulders and except one or two without shoes and stockings yet very well dressed in jackets and trousers like gentlemens children followed us in great delight admiring the car and longing to jump up at last though we were seated they made several attempts to get on behind and they looked so pretty and wild and at the same time so modest that we wished to give them a ride and there being a little hill near the end of the town we got off and four of them who still remained the rest having dropped into their homes by the way took our places and indeed i would have walked two miles willingly to have had the pleasure of seeing them so happy when they were to ride no longer they scampered away laughing and rejoicing new houses are rising up in great numbers round glasgow citizenlike houses and new plantations chiefly of fir the fields are frequently enclosed by hedgerows but there is no richness nor any particular beauty for some miles the first object that interested us was a gentlemans house upon a green plain or holm almost close to the clyde sheltered by tall trees a quiet modest mansion and though whitewashed being an old building and no other house near it or in connexion with it and standing upon the level field which belonged to it its own domain the whole scene together brought to our minds an image of the retiredness and sober elegance of a nunnery but this might be owing to the greyness of the afternoon and our having come immediately from glasgow and through a country which till now had either had a townish taint or at best little of rural beauty while we were looking at the house we overtook a foottraveller who like many others began to talk about our car we alighted to walk up a hill and continuing the conversation the man told us with something like a national pride that it belonged to a scotch lord lord semple he added that a little further on we should see a much finer prospect as fine a one as ever we had seen in our lives accordingly when we came to the top of the hill it opened upon us most magnificently we saw the clyde now a stately seariver winding away mile after mile spotted with boats and ships each side of the river hilly the right populous with single houses and villagesdunglass castle upon a promontory the whole view terminated by the rock of dumbarton at five or six miles distance which stands by itself without any hills near it like a searock we travelled for some time near the river passing through clusters of houses which seemed to owe their existence rather to the wealth of the river than the land for the banks were mostly bare and the soil appeared poor even near the water the left side of the river was generally uninhabited and moorish yet there are some beautiful spots for instance a noblemans house where the fields and trees were rich and in combination with the river looked very lovely as we went along william and i were reminded of the views upon the thames in kent which though greatly superior in richness and softness are much inferior in grandeur not far from dumbarton we passed under some rocky copsecovered hills which were so like some of the hills near grasmere that we could have half believed they were the same arrived at dumbarton before it was dark having pushed on briskly that we might have start of a traveller at the inn who was following us as fast as he could in a gig every front room was full and we were afraid we should not have been admitted they put us into a little parlour dirty and smelling of liquors the table uncleaned and not a chair in its place we were glad however of our sorry accommodations footnote no doubt erskine house the seat of lord blantyre jc s while tea was preparing we lolled at our ease and though the roomwindow overlooked the stableyard and at our entrance there appeared to be nothing but gloom and unloveliness yet while i lay stretched upon the carriage cushions on three chairs i discovered a little side peep which was enough to set the mind at work it was no more than a smoky vessel lying at anchor with its bare masts a clay hut and the shelving bank of the river with a green pasture above perhaps you will think that there is not much in this as i describe it it is true but the effect produced by these simple objects as they happened to be combined together with the gloom of the evening was exceedingly wild our room was parted by a slender partition from a large diningroom in which were a number of officers and their wives who after the first hour never ceased singing dancing laughing or loud talking the ladies sang some pretty songs a great relief to us we went early to bed but poor coleridge could not sleep for the noise at the street door he lay in the parlour below stairs it is no uncommon thing in the best inns of scotland to have shuttingup beds in the sittingrooms wednesday august thas soon as breakfast was over william and i walked towards the castle a short mile from the town we overtook two young men who on our asking the road offered to conduct us though it might seem it was not easy to miss our way for the rock rises singly by itself from the plain on which the town stands the rock of dumbarton is very grand when you are close to it but at a little distance under an ordinary sky and in open day it is not grand but curiously wild the castle and fortifications add little effect to the general view of the rock especially since the building of a modern house which is whitewashed and consequently jars wherever it is seen with the natural character of the place there is a path up to the house but it being low water we could walk round the rock which we resolved to do on that side next the town green grass grows to a considerable height up the rock but wherever the river borders upon it it is naked stone i never saw rock in nobler masses or more deeply stained by time and weather nor is this to be wondered at for it is in the very eye of seastorms and landstorms of mountain winds and water winds it is of all colours but a rusty yellow predominates as we walked along we could not but look up continually and the mass above being on every side so huge it appeared more wonderful than when we saw the whole together we sat down on one of the large stones which lie scattered near the base of the rock with seaweed growing amongst them above our heads the rock was perpendicular for a considerable height nay as it seemed to the very top and on the brink of the precipice a few sheep two of them rams with twisted horns stood as if on the lookout over the wide country at the same time we saw a sentinel in his red coat walking backwards and forwards between us and the sky with his firelock over his shoulder the sheep i suppose owing to our being accustomed to see them in similar situations appeared to retain their real size while on the contrary the soldier seemed to be diminished by the distance till he almost looked like a puppet moved with wires for the pleasure of children or an eight years old drummer in his stiff manly dress beside a company of grenadiers i had never before perhaps thought of sheep and men in soldiers dresses at the same time and here they were brought together in a strange fantastic way as will be easily conceived the fearlessness and stillness of those quiet creatures on the brow of the rock pursuing their natural occupations contrasted with the restless and apparently unmeaning motions of the dwarf soldier added not a little to the general effect of this place which is that of wild singularity and the whole was aided by a blustering wind and a gloomy sky coleridge joined us and we went up to the top of the rock the road to a considerable height is through a narrow cleft in which a flight of steps is hewn the steps nearly fill the cleft and on each side the rocks form a high and irregular wall it is almost like a long sloping cavern only that it is roofed by the sky we came to the barracks soldiers wives were hanging out linen upon the rails while the wind beat about them furiouslythere was nothing which it could set in motion but the garments of the women and the linen upon the rails the grassfor we had now come to green grasswas close and smooth and not one pile an inch above another and neither tree nor shrub the standard pole stood erect without a flag the rock has two summits one much broader and higher than the other when we were near to the top of the lower eminence we had the pleasure of finding a little garden of flowers and vegetables belonging to the soldiers there are three distinct and very noble prospectsthe first up the clyde towards glasgowdunglass castle seen on its promontoryboats sloops hills and many buildings the second down the river to the seagreenock and portglasgow and the distant mountains at the entrance of loch long and the third extensive and distant view is up the leven which here falls into the clyde to the mountains of loch lomond the distant mountains in all these views were obscured by mists and dingy clouds but if the grand outline of any one of the views can be seen it is sufficient recompense for the trouble of climbing the rock of dumbarton the soldier who was our guide told us that an old ruin which we came to at the top of the higher eminence had been a windmillan inconvenient station though certainly a glorious place for wind perhaps if it really had been a windmill it was only for the use of the garrison we looked over cannons on the batterywalls and saw in an open field below the yeomanry cavalry exercising while we could hear from the town which was full of soldiers dumbartons drums beat bonny o yet while we stood upon this eminence rising up so far as it doesinland and having the habitual old english feeling of our own security as islanderswe could not help looking upon the fortress in spite of its cannon and soldiers and the rumours of invasion as set up against the hostilities of wind and weather rather than for any other warfare on our return we were invited into the guardroom about halfway down the rock where we were shown a large rusty sword which they called wallaces sword and a trout boxed up in a well close by where they said he had been confined for upwards of thirty years for the pleasure of the soldiers who were anxious that we should see him we took some pains to spy him out in his black den and at last succeeded it was pleasing to observe how much interest the poor soldiersthough themselves probably new to the placeseemed to attach to this antiquated inhabitant of their garrison when we had reached the bottom of the rock along the same road by which we had ascended we made our way over the rough stones left bare by the tide round the bottom of the rock to the point where we had set off this is a wild and melancholy walk on a blustering cloudy day the naked bed of the river scattered over with seaweed grey swampy fields on the other shore seabirds flying overhead the high rock perpendicular and bare we came to two very large fragments which had fallen from the main rock coleridge thought that one of them was as large as bowderstone william and i did not but it is impossible to judge accurately we probably without knowing it compared them with the whole mass from which they had fallen which from its situation we consider as one rock or stone and there is no object of the kind for comparison with the bowderstone when we leave the shore of the clyde grass begins to show itself on the rock go a considerable waystill under the rockalong a flat field and pass immediately below the white house which wherever seen looks so ugly footnote a rock in borrowdale cumberlanded left dumbarton at about eleven oclock the sky was cheerless and the air ungenial which we regretted as we were going to loch lomond and wished to greet the first of the scottish lakes with our cheerfullest and best feelings crossed the leven at the end of dumbarton and when we looked behind had a pleasing view of the town bridge and rock but when we took in a reach of the river at the distance of perhaps half a mile the swamp ground being so near a town and not in its natural wildness but seemingly half cultivated with houses here and there gave us an idea of extreme poverty of soil or that the inhabitants were either indolent or miserable we had to travel four miles on the banks of the water of leven before we should come to loch lomond having expected a grand river from so grand a lake we were disappointed for it appeared to me not to be very much larger than the emont and is not near so beautiful but we must not forget that the day was cold and gloomy near dumbarton it is like a river in a flat country or under the influence of tides but a little higher up it resembles one of our rivers flowing through a vale of no extreme beauty though prettily wooded the hills on each side not very high sloping backwards from the bed of the vale which is neither very narrow nor very wide the prospect terminated by ben lomond and other mountains the vale is populous but looks as if it were not inhabited by cultivators of the earth the houses are chiefly of stone often in rows by the riverside they stand pleasantly but have a tradish look as if they might have been offsets from glasgow we saw many bleachyards but no other symptom of a manufactory except something in the houses that was not rural and a want of independent comforts perhaps if the river had been glittering in the sun and the smoke of the cottages rising in distinct volumes towards the sky as i have seen in the vale or basin below pillsden in dorsetshire when every cottage hidden from the eye pointed out its lurkingplace by an upright wreath of white smoke the whole scene might have excited ideas of perfect cheerfulness here as on the nith and much more than in the trough of the clyde a great portion of the ground was uncultivated but the hills being less wild the river more stately and the ground not heaved up so irregularly and tossed about the imperfect cultivation was the more to be lamented particularly as there were so many houses near the river in a small enclosure by the wayside is a pillar erected to the memory of dr smollett who was born in a village at a little distance which we could see at the same time and where i believe some of the family still reside there is a long latin inscription which coleridge translated for my benefit the latin is miserably badas coleridge said such as poor smollett who was an excellent scholar would have been ashamed of footnote the inscription on the pillar was written by professor george stuart of edinburgh john ramsay of ochtertyre and dr samuel johnson for dr johnsons share in the work see crokers boswell p j c s before we came to loch lomond the vale widened and became less populous we climbed over a wall into a large field to have a better front view of the lake than from the road this view is very much like that from mr clarksons windows the mountain in front resembles hallan indeed is almost the same but ben lomond is not seen standing in such majestic company as helvellyn and the meadows are less beautiful than ulswater the reach of the lake is very magnificent you see it as ulswater is seen beyond the promontory of old church winding away behind a large woody island that looks like a promontory the outlet of the lakewe had a distinct view of it in the fieldis very insignificant the bulk of the river is frittered away by small alder bushes as i recollect i do not remember that it was reedy but the ground had a swampy appearance and here the vale spreads out wide and shapeless as if the river were born to no inheritance had no sheltering cradle no hills of its own as we have seen this does not continue long it flows through a distinct though not a magnificent vale but having lost the pastoral character which it had in the youthful days of smollettif the description in his ode to his native stream be a faithful oneit is less interesting than it was then the road carried us sometimes close to the lake sometimes at a considerable distance from it over moorish grounds or through halfcultivated enclosures we had the lake on our right which is here so wide that the opposite hills not being high are cast into insignificance and we could not distinguish any buildings near the water if any there were it is however always delightful to travel by a lake of clear waters if you see nothing else but a very ordinary country but we had some beautiful distant views one in particular down the high road through a vista of overarching trees and the near shore was frequently very pleasing with its gravel banks bendings and small bays in one part it was bordered for a considerable way by irregular groups of forest trees or single stragglers which although not large seemed old their branches were stunted and knotty as if they had been striving with storms and had half yielded to them under these trees we had a variety of pleasing views across the lake and the very rolling over the road and looking at its smooth and beautiful surface was itself a pleasure it was as smooth as a gravel walk and of the bluish colour of some of the roads among the lakes of the north of england passed no very remarkable place till we came to sir james colquhouns house which stands upon a large flat woody peninsula looking towards ben lomond there must be many beautiful walks among the copses of the peninsula and delicious views over the water but the general surface of the country is poor and looks as if it ought to be rich and well peopled for it is not mountainous nor had we passed any hills which a cumbrian would dignify with the name of mountains there was many a little plain or gentlysloping hill covered with poor heath or broom without trees where one should have liked to see a cottage in a bower of wood with its patch of corn and potatoes and a green field with a hedge to keep it warm as we advanced we perceived less of the coldness of poverty the hills not having so large a space between them and the lake the surface of the hills being in its natural state is always beautiful but where there is only a half cultivated and half peopled soil near the banks of a lake or river the idea is forced upon one that they who do live there have not much of cheerful enjoyment but soon we came to just such a place as we had wanted to see the road was close to the water and a hill bare rocky or with scattered copses rose above it a deep shade hung over the road where some little boys were at play we expected a dwellinghouse of some sort and when we came nearer saw three or four thatched huts under the trees and at the same moment felt that it was a paradise we had before seen the lake only as one wide plain of water but here the portion of it which we saw was bounded by a high and steep heathy and woody island opposite which did not appear like an island but the main shore and framed out a little oblong lake apparently not so broad as rydalewater with one small island covered with trees resembling some of the most beautiful of the holms of windermere and only a narrow rivers breadth from the shore this was a place where we should have liked to have lived and the only one we had seen near loch lomond how delightful to have a little shed concealed under the branches of the fairy island the cottages and the island might have been made for the pleasure of each other it was but like a natural garden the distance was so small nay one could not have forgiven any one living there not compelled to daily labour if he did not connect it with his dwelling by some feeling of domestic attachment like what he has for the orchard where his children play i thought what a place for william he might row himself over with twenty strokes of the oars escaping from the business of the house and as safe from intruders with his boat anchored beside him as if he had locked himself up in the strong tower of a castle we were unwilling to leave this sweet spot but it was so simple and therefore so rememberable that it seemed almost as if we could have carried it away with us it was nothing more than a small lake enclosed by trees at the ends and by the wayside and opposite by the island a steep bank on which the purple heath was seen under low oak coppicewood a group of houses overshadowed by trees and a bending road there was one remarkable tree an old larch with hairy branches which sent out its main stem horizontally across the road an object that seemed to have been singled out for injury where everything else was lovely and thriving tortured into that shape by storms which one might have thought could not have reached it in that sheltered place we were now entering into the highlands i believe luss is the place where we were told that country begins but at these cottages i would have gladly believed that we were there for it was like a new region the huts were after the highland fashion and the boys who were playing wore the highland dress and philabeg on going into a new country i seem to myself to waken up and afterwards it surprises me to remember how much alive i have been to the distinctions of dress household arrangements etc etc and what a spirit these little things give to wild barren or ordinary places the cottages are within about two miles of luss came in view of several islands but the lake being so very wide we could see little of their peculiar beauties and they being large hardly looked like islands passed another gentlemans house which stands prettily in a bay and soon after reached luss where we intended to lodge on seeing the outside of the inn we were glad that we were to have such pleasant quarters it is a nicelooking white house by the roadside but there was not much promise of hospitality when we stopped at the door no person came out till we had shouted a considerable time a barefooted lass showed me upstairs and again my hopes revived the house was clean for a scotch inn and the view very pleasant to the lake over the top of the villagea cluster of thatched houses among trees with a large chapel in the midst of them like most of the scotch kirks which we had seen this building resembles a big house but it is a much more pleasing building than they generally are and has one of our rustic belfries not unlike that at ambleside with two bells hanging in the open air we chose one of the back rooms to sit in being more snug and they looked upon a very sweet prospecta stream tumbling down a cleft or glen on the hillside rocky coppice ground a rural lane such as we have from house to house at grasmere and a few outhouses we had a poor dinner and sour ale but as long as the people were civil we were contented footnote camstraddan house and bayj c s coleridge was not well so he did not stir out but william and i walked through the village to the shore of the lake when i came close to the houses i could not but regret a want of loveliness correspondent with the beauty of the situation and the appearance of the village at a little distance not a single ornamented garden we saw potatoes and cabbages but never a honeysuckle yet there were wild gardens as beautiful as any that ever man cultivated overgrowing the roofs of some of the cottages flowers and creeping plants how elegant were the wreaths of the bramble that had built its own bower upon the riggins in several parts of the village therefore we had chiefly to regret the want of gardens as they are symptoms of leisure and comfort or at least of no painful industry here we first saw houses without windows the smoke coming out of the open windowplaces the chimneys were like stools with four legs a hole being left in the roof for the smoke and over that a slate placed upon four stickssometimes the whole leaned as if it were going to fall the fields close to luss lie flat to the lake and a river as large as our stream near the church at grasmere flows by the end of the village being the same which comes down the glen behind the inn it is very much like our streambeds of blue pebbles upon the shores we walked towards the head of the lake and from a large pasture field near luss a gentle eminence had a very interesting view back upon the village and the lake and islands beyond we then perceived that luss stood in the centre of a spacious bay and that close to it lay another small one within the larger where the boats of the inhabitants were lying at anchor a beautiful natural harbour the islands as we look down the water are seen in great beauty inchtavannach the same that framed out the little peaceful lake which we had passed in the morning towers above the rest the lake is very wide here and the opposite shores not being lofty the chief part of the permanent beauty of this view is among the islands and on the near shore including the low promontories of the bay of luss and the village and we saw it under its dullest aspectthe air cold the sky gloomy without a glimpse of sunshine on a splendid evening with the light of the sun diffused over the whole islands distant hills and the broad expanse of the lake with its creeks bays and little slips of water among the islands it must be a glorious sight up the lake there are no islands ben lomond terminates the view without any other large mountains no clouds were upon it therefore we saw the whole size and form of the mountain yet it did not appear to me so large as skiddaw does from derwentwater continued our walk a considerable way towards the head of the lake and went up a high hill but saw no other reach of the water the hills on the luss side become much steeper and the lake having narrowed a little above luss was no longer a very wide lake where we lost sight of it came to a bark hut by the shores and sate for some time under the shelter of it while we were here a poor woman with a little child by her side begged a penny of me and asked where she could find quarters in the village she was a travelling beggar a native of scotland had often heard of that water but was never there before this womans appearance while the wind was rustling about us and the waves breaking at our feet was very melancholy the waters looked wide the hills many and dark and far offno house but at luss i thought what a dreary waste must this lake be to such poor creatures struggling with fatigue and poverty and unknown ways we ordered tea when we reached the inn and desired the girl to light us a fire she replied i dinna ken whether shell gie fire meaning her mistress we told her we did not wish her mistress to give fire we only desired her to let her make it and we would pay for it the girl brought in the teathings but no fire and when i asked if she was coming to light it she said her mistress was not varra willing to gie fire at last however on our insisting upon it the fire was lighted we got tea by candlelight and spent a comfortable evening i had seen the landlady before we went out for as had been usual in all the country inns there was a demur respecting beds notwithstanding the house was empty and there were at least halfadozen spare beds her countenance corresponded with the unkindness of denying us a fire on a cold night for she was the most cruel and hatefullooking woman i ever saw she was overgrown with fat and was sitting with her feet and legs in a tub of water for the dropsyprobably brought on by whiskydrinking the sympathy which i felt and expressed for her on seeing her in this wretched conditionfor her legs were swollen as thick as millpostsseemed to produce no effect and i was obliged after five minutes conversation to leave the affair of the beds undecided coleridge had some talk with her daughter a smart lass in a cotton gown with a bandeau round her head without shoes and stockings she told coleridge with some pride that she had not spent all her time at luss but was then fresh from glasgow it came on a very stormy night the wind rattled every window in the house and it rained heavily william and coleridge had bad beds in a twobedded room in the garrets though there were empty rooms on the first floor and they were disturbed by a drunken man who had come to the inn when we were gone to sleep thursday august thwe were glad when we awoke to see that it was a fine morningthe sky was bright blue with quickmoving clouds the hills cheerful lights and shadows vivid and distinct the village looked exceedingly beautiful this morning from the garret windowsthe stream glittering near it while it flowed under trees through the level fields to the lake after breakfast william and i went down to the waterside the roads were as dry as if no drop of rain had fallen which added to the pure cheerfulness of the appearance of the village and even of the distant prospect an effect which i always seem to perceive from clearly bright roads for they are always brightened by rain after a storm but when we came among the houses i regretted even more than last night because the contrast was greater the slovenliness and dirt near the doors and could not but remember with pain from the contrast the cottages of somersetshire covered with roses and myrtle and their small gardens of herbs and flowers while lingering by the shore we began to talk with a man who offered to row us to inchtavannach but the sky began to darken and the wind being high we doubted whether we should venture therefore made no engagement he offered to sell me some thread pointing to his cottage and added that many english ladies carried thread away from luss presently after coleridge joined us and we determined to go to the island i was sorry that the man who had been talking with us was not our boatman william by some chance had engaged another we had two rowers and a strong boat so i felt myself bold though there was a great chance of a high wind the nearest point of inchtavannach is not perhaps more than a mile and a quarter from luss we did not land there but rowed round the end and landed on that side which looks towards our favourite cottages and their own island which wherever seen is still their own it rained a little when we landed and i took my cloak which afterwards served us to sit down upon in our road up the hill when the day grew much finer with gleams of sunshine this island belongs to sir james colquhoun who has made a convenient road that winds gently to the top of it we had not climbed far before we were stopped by a sudden burst of prospect so singular and beautiful that it was like a flash of images from another world we stood with our backs to the hill of the island which we were ascending and which shut out ben lomond entirely and all the upper part of the lake and we looked towards the foot of the lake scattered over with islands without beginning and without end the sun shone and the distant hills were visible some through sunny mists others in gloom with patches of sunshine the lake was lost under the low and distant hills and the islands lost in the lake which was all in motion with travelling fields of light or dark shadows under rainy clouds there are many hills but no commanding eminence at a distance to confine the prospect so that the land seemed endless as the water what i had heard of loch lomond or any other place in great britain had given me no idea of anything like what we beheld it was an outlandish scenewe might have believed ourselves in north america the islands were of every possible variety of shape and surfacehilly and level large and small bare rocky pastoral or covered with wood immediately under my eyes lay one large flat island bare and green so flat and low that it scarcely appeared to rise above the water with straggling peatstacks and a single hut upon one of its outshooting promontoriesfor it was of a very irregular shape though perfectly flat another its next neighbour and still nearer to us was covered over with heath and coppicewood the surface undulating with flat or sloping banks towards the water and hollow places cradlelike valleys behind these two islands with inchtavannach where we were standing were intermingled with the water i might say interbedded and interveined with it in a manner that was exquisitely pleasing there were bays innumerable straits or passages like calm rivers landlocked lakes and to the main water stormy promontories the solitary hut on the flat green island seemed unsheltered and desolate and yet not wholly so for it was but a broad rivers breadth from the covert of the wood of the other island near to these is a miniature an islet covered with trees on which stands a small ruin that looks like the remains of a religious house it is overgrown with ivy and were it not that the arch of a window or gateway may be distinctly seen it would be difficult to believe that it was not a tuft of trees growing in the shape of a ruin rather than a ruin overshadowed by trees when we had walked a little further we saw below us on the nearest large island where some of the wood had been cut down a hut which we conjectured to be a bark hut it appeared to be on the shore of a little forest lake enclosed by inchtavannach where we were and the woody island on which the hut stands beyond we had the same intricate view as before and could discover dumbarton rock with its double head there being a mist over it it had a ghostlike appearanceas i observed to william and coleridge something like the tor of glastonbury from the dorsetshire hills right before us on the flat island mentioned before were several small single trees or shrubs growing at different distances from each other close to the shore but some optical delusion had detached them from the land on which they stood and they had the appearance of so many little vessels sailing along the coast of it i mention the circumstance because with the ghostly image of dumbarton castle and the ambiguous ruin on the small island it was much in the character of the scene which was throughout magical and enchantinga new world in its great permanent outline and composition and changing at every moment in every part of it by the effect of sun and wind and mist and shower and cloud and the blending lights and deep shades which took the place of each other traversing the lake in every direction the whole was indeed a strange mixture of soothing and restless images of images inviting to rest and others hurrying the fancy away into an activity still more pleasing than repose yet intricate and homeless that is without lasting abidingplace for the mind as the prospect was there was no perplexity we had still a guide to lead us forward wherever we looked it was a delightful feeling that there was something beyond meanwhile the sense of quiet was never lost sight of the little peaceful lakes among the islands might make you forget that the great water loch lomond was so near and yet are more beautiful because you know that it is so they have their own bays and creeks sheltered within a shelter when we had ascended to the top of the island we had a view up to ben lomond over the long broad water without spot or rock and looking backwards saw the islands below us as on a map this view as may be supposed was not nearly so interesting as those we had seen before we hunted out all the houses on the shore which were very few there was the village of luss the two gentlemens houses our favourite cottages and here and there a hut but i do not recollect any comfortablelooking farmhouses and on the opposite shore not a single dwelling the whole scene was a combination of natural wildness loveliness beauty and barrenness or rather bareness yet not comfortless or cold but the whole was beautiful we were too far off the more distant shore to distinguish any particular spots which we might have regretted were not better cultivated and near luss there was no want of houses after we had left the island having been so much taken with the beauty of the bark hut and the little lake by which it appeared to stand we desired the boatman to row us through it and we landed at the hut walked upon the island for some time and found out sheltered places for cottages there were several woodmens huts which with some scattered firtrees and others in irregular knots that made a delicious murmuring in the wind added greatly to the romantic effect of the scene they were built in the form of a cone from the ground like savages huts the door being just large enough for a man to enter with stooping straw beds were raised on logs of wood tools lying about and a forked bough of a tree was generally suspended from the roof in the middle to hang a kettle upon it was a place that might have been just visited by new settlers i thought of ruth and her dreams of romantic love and then he said how sweet it were a fisher or a hunter there a gardener in the shade still wandering with an easy mind to build a household fire and find a home in every glade footnote see ruth stanza xiiied we found the main lake very stormy when we had left the shelter of the islands and there was again a threatening of rain but it did not come on i wanted much to go to the old ruin but the boatmen were in a hurry to be at home they told us it had been a stronghold built by a man who lived there alone and was used to swim over and make depredations on the shorethat nobody could ever lay hands on him he was such a good swimmer but at last they caught him in a net the men pointed out to us an island belonging to sir james colquhoun on which were a great quantity of deer arrived at the inn at about twelve oclock and prepared to depart immediately we should have gone with great regret if the weather had been warmer and the inn more comfortable when we were leaving the door a party with smart carriage and servants drove up and i observed that the people of the house were just as slow in their attendance upon them as on us with one single horse and outlandish hibernian vehicle when we had travelled about two miles the lake became considerably narrower the hills rocky covered with copses or bare rising more immediately from the bed of the water and therefore we had not so often to regret the want of inhabitants passed by or saw at a distance sometimes a single cottage or two or three together but the whole space between luss and tarbet is a solitude to the eye we were reminded of ulswater but missed the pleasant farms and the mountains were not so interesting we had not seen them in companies or brotherhoods rising one above another at a long distance ben lomond stood alone opposite to us majestically overlooking the lake yet there was something in this mountain which disappointed mea want of massiveness and simplicity perhaps from the top being broken into three distinct stages the road carried us over a bold promontory by a steep and high ascent and we had a long view of the lake pushing itself up in a narrow line through an avenue of mountains terminated by the mountains at the head of the lake of which ben lui if i do not mistake is the most considerable the afternoon was showery and misty therefore we did not see this prospect so distinctly as we could have wished but there was a grand obscurity over it which might make the mountains appear more numerous i have said so much of this lake that i am tired myself and i fear i must have tired my friends we had a pleasant journey to tarbet more than half of it on foot for the road was hilly and after we had climbed one small hill we were not desirous to get into the car again seeing another before us and our path was always delightful near the lake and frequently through woods when we were within about half a mile of tarbet at a sudden turning looking to the left we saw a very craggytopped mountain amongst other smooth ones the rocks on the summit distinct in shape as if they were buildings raised up by man or uncouth images of some strange creature we called out with one voice thats what we wanted alluding to the framelike uniformity of the sidescreens of the lake for the last five or six miles as we conjectured this singular mountain was the famous cobbler near arrochar tarbet was before us in the recess of a deep large bay under the shelter of a hill when we came up to the village we had to inquire for the inn there being no signboard it was a wellsized white house the best in the place we were conducted upstairs into a sittingroom that might make any goodhumoured travellers happya square room with windows on each side looking one way towards the mountains and across the lake to ben lomond the other there was a pretty stone house before ie towards the lake some huts scattered trees two or three green fields with hedgerows and a little brook making its way towards the lake the fields are almost flat and screened on that side nearest the head of the lake by a hill which pushing itself out forms the bay of tarbet and towards the foot by a gentle slope and trees the lake is narrow and ben lomond shuts up the prospect rising directly from the water we could have believed ourselves to be by the side of ulswater at glenridden or in some other of the inhabited retirements of that lake we were in a sheltered place among mountains it was not an open joyous bay with a cheerful populous village like luss but a pastoral and retired spot with a few single dwellings the people of the inn stared at us when we spoke without giving us an answer immediately which we were at first disposed to attribute to coarseness of manners but found afterwards that they did not understand us at once erse being the language spoken in the family nothing but salt meat and eggs for dinnerno potatoes the house smelt strongly of herrings which were hung to dry over the kitchen fire walked in the evening towards the head of the lake the road was steep over the hill and when we had reached the top of it we had long views up and down the water passed a troop of women who were resting themselves by the roadside as if returning from their days labour amongst them was a man who had walked with us a considerable way in the morning and told us he was just come from america where he had been for some yearswas going to his own home and should return to america he spoke of emigration as a glorious thing for them who had money poor fellow i do not think that he had brought much back with him for he had worked his passage over i much suspected that a bundle which he carried upon a stick tied in a pockethandkerchief contained his all he was almost blind he said as were many of the crew he intended crossing the lake at the ferry but it was stormy and he thought he should not be able to get over that day i could not help smiling when i saw him lying by the roadside with such a company about him not like a wayfaring man but seeming as much at home and at his ease as if he had just stepped out of his hut among them and they had been neighbours all their lives passed one pretty house a large thatched dwelling with outhouses but the prospect above and below was solitary the sun had long been set before we returned to the inn as travellers we were glad to see the moon over the top of one of the hills but it was a cloudy night without any peculiar beauty or solemnity after tea we made inquiries respecting the best way to go to loch ketterine the landlord could give but little information and nobody seemed to know anything distinctly of the place though it was but ten miles off we applied to the maidservant who waited on us she was a finelooking young woman dressed in a white bedgown her hair fastened up by a comb and without shoes and stockings when we asked her about the trossachs she could give us no information but on our saying do you know loch ketterine she answered with a smile i should know that loch for i was bred and born there after much difficulty we learned from her that the trossachs were at the foot of the lake and that by the way we were to go we should come upon them at the head should have to travel ten miles to the foot of the water and that there was no inn by the way the girl spoke english very distinctly but she had few words and found it difficult to understand us she did not much encourage us to go because the roads were bad and it was a long way and there was no puttingup for the like of us we determined however to venture and throw ourselves upon the hospitality of some cottager or gentleman we desired the landlady to roast us a couple of fowls to carry with us there are always plenty of fowls at the doors of a scotch inn and eggs are as regularly brought to table at breakfast as bread and butter footnote this distinction between the foot and head is not very clear what is meant is this they would have to travel the whole length of the lake from the west to the east end of it before they came to the trossachs the pass leading away from the east end of the lakej c s friday august thwe did not set off till between ten and eleven oclock much too late for a long days journey our boatman lived at the pretty white house which we saw from the windows we called at his door by the way and even when we were near the house the outside looked comfortable but within i never saw anything so miserable from dirt and dirt alone it reminded one of the house of a decayed weaver in the suburbs of a large town with a sickly wife and a large family but william says it was far worse that it was quite hottentotish after long waiting and many clumsy preparations we got ourselves seated in the boat but we had not floated five yards before we perceived that if any of the partyand there was a little highland woman who was going over the water with us the boatman his helper and ourselvesshould stir but a few inches leaning to one side or the other the boat would be full in an instant and we at the bottom besides it was very leaky and the woman was employed to lade out the water continually it appeared that this crazy vessel was not the mans own and that his was lying in a bay at a little distance he said he would take us to it as fast as possible but i was so much frightened i would gladly have given up the whole days journey indeed not one of us would have attempted to cross the lake in that boat for a thousand pounds we reached the larger boat in safety after coasting a considerable way near the shore but just as we were landing william dropped the bundle which contained our food into the water the fowls were no worse but some sugar ground coffee and peppercake seemed to be entirely spoiled we gathered together as much of the coffee and sugar as we could and tied it up and again trusted ourselves to the lake the sun shone and the air was calmluckily it had been so while we were in the crazy boatwe had rocks and woods on each side of us or bare hills seldom a single cottage and there was no rememberable place till we came opposite to a waterfall of no inconsiderable size that appeared to drop directly into the lake close to it was a hut which we were told was the ferryhouse on the other side of the lake was a pretty farm under the mountains beside a river the cultivated grounds lying all together and sloping towards the lake from the mountain hollow down which the river came it is not easy to conceive how beautiful these spots appeared after moving on so long between the solitary steeps we went a considerable way further and landed at rob roys caves which are in fact no caves but some fine rocks on the brink of the lake in the crevices of which a man might hide himself cunningly enough the water is very deep below them and the hills above steep and covered with wood the little highland woman who was in size about a match for our guide at lanerk accompanied us hither there was something very gracious in the manners of this woman she could scarcely speak five english words yet she gave me whenever i spoke to her as many intelligible smiles as i had needed english words to answer me and helped me over the rocks in the most obliging manner she had left the boat out of goodwill to us or for her own amusement she had never seen these caves before but no doubt had heard of them the tales of rob roys exploits being told familiarly round the ingles hereabouts for this neighbourhood was his home we landed at inversneyde the ferryhouse by the waterfall and were not sorry to part with our boatman who was a coarse hardfeatured man and speaking of the french uttered the basest and most cowardly sentiments his helper a youth fresh from the isle of skye was innocent of this fault and though but a bad rower was a far better companion he could not speak a word of english and sang a plaintive gaelic air in a low tone while he plied his oar the ferryhouse stood on the bank a few yards above the landingplace where the boat lies it is a small hut under a steep wood and a few yards to the right looking towards the hut is the waterfall the fall is not very high but the stream is considerable as we could see by the large black stones that were lying bare but the rains if they had reached this place had had little effect upon the waterfall its noise was not so great as to form a contrast with the stillness of the bay into which it falls where the boat and house and waterfall itself seemed all sheltered and protected the highland woman was to go with us the two first miles of our journey she led us along a bye footpath a shorter way up the hill from the ferryhouse there is a considerable settling in the hills that border loch lomond at the passage by which we were to cross to loch ketterine ben lomond terminating near the ferryhouse is on the same side of the water with it and about three miles above tarbet we had to climb right up the hill which is very steep and when close under it seemed to be high but we soon reached the top and when we were there had lost sight of the lake and now our road was over a moor or rather through a wide moorland hollow having gone a little way we saw before us at the distance of about half a mile a very large stone building a singular structure with a high wall round it naked hill above and neither field nor tree near but the moor was not overgrown with heath merely but grey grass such as cattle might pasture upon we could not conjecture what this building was it appeared as if it had been built strong to defend it from storms but for what purpose william called out to us that we should observe that place well for it was exactly like one of the spittals of the alps built for the reception of travellers and indeed i had thought it must be so before he spoke this building from its singular structure and appearance made the place which is itself in a country like scotland nowise remarkable take a character of unusual wildness and desolationthis when we first came in view of it and afterwards when we had passed it and looked back three pyramidal mountains on the opposite side of loch lomond terminated the view which under certain accidents of weather must be very grand our highland companion had not english enough to give us any information concerning this strange building we could only get from her that it was a large house which was plain enough we walked about a mile and a half over the moor without seeing any other dwelling but one hut by the burnside with a peatstack and a tenyardssquare enclosure for potatoes then we came to several clusters of houses even hamlets they might be called but where there is any land belonging to the highland huts there are so many outbuildings near which differ in no respect from the dwellinghouses except that they send out no smoke that one house looks like two or three near these houses was a considerable quantity of cultivated ground potatoes and corn and the people were busy making hay in the hollow places of the open vale and all along the sides of the becks it was a pretty sight altogethermen and women dogs the little running streams with linen bleaching near them and cheerful sunny hills and rocks on every side we passed by one patch of potatoes that a florist might have been proud of no carnationbed ever looked more gay than this square plot of ground on the waste common the flowers were in very large bunches and of an extraordinary size and of every conceivable shade of colouring from snowwhite to deep purple it was pleasing in that place where perhaps was never yet a flower cultivated by man for his own pleasure to see these blossoms grow more gladly than elsewhere making a summer garden near the mountain dwellings at one of the clusters of houses we parted with our companion who had insisted on bearing my bundle while she stayed with us i often tried to enter into conversation with her and seeing a small tarn before us was reminded of the pleasure of fishing and the manner of living there and asked her what sort of food was eaten in that place if they lived much upon fish or had mutton from the hills she looked earnestly at me and shaking her head replied oh yes eat fishno papists eat everything the tarn had one small island covered with wood the stream that runs from it falls into loch ketterine which after we had gone a little beyond the tarn we saw at some distance before us pursued the road a mountain horsetrack till we came to a corner of what seemed the head of the lake and there sate down completely tired and hopeless as to the rest of our journey the road ended at the shore and no houses were to be seen on the opposite side except a few widely parted huts and on the near side was a trackless heath the land at the head of the lake was but a continuation of the common we had come along and was covered with heather intersected by a few straggling footpaths coleridge and i were faint with hunger and could go no further till we had refreshed ourselves so we ate up one of our fowls and drank of the water of loch ketterine but william could not be easy till he had examined the coast so he left us and made his way along the moor across the head of the lake coleridge and i as we sate had what seemed to us but a dreary prospecta waste of unknown ground which we guessed we must travel over before it was possible for us to find a shelter we saw a long way down the lake it was all moor on the near side on the other the hills were steep from the water and there were large coppicewoods but no cheerful green fields and no road that we could see we knew however that there must be a road from house to house but the whole lake appeared a solitudeneither boats islands nor houses no grandeur in the hills nor any loveliness in the shores when we first came in view of it we had said it was like a barren ulswaterulswater dismantled of its grandeur and cropped of its lesser beauties when i had swallowed my dinner i hastened after william and coleridge followed me walked through the heather with some labour for perhaps half a mile and found william sitting on the top of a small eminence whence we saw the real head of the lake which was pushed up into the vale a considerable way beyond the promontory where we now sate the view up the lake was very pleasing resembling thirlemere below armath there were rocky promontories and woody islands and what was most cheering to us a neat white house on the opposite shore but we could see no boats so in order to get to it we should be obliged to go round the head of the lake a long and weary way after coleridge came up to us while we were debating whether we should turn back or go forward we espied a man on horseback at a little distance with a boy following him on foot no doubt a welcome sight and we hailed him we should have been glad to have seen either man woman or child at this time but there was something uncommon and interesting in this mans appearance which would have fixed our attention wherever we had met him he was a complete highlander in dress figure and face and a very finelooking man hardy and vigorous though past his prime while he stood waiting for us in his bonnet and plaid which never look more graceful than on horseback i forgot our errand and only felt glad that we were in the highlands william accosted him with sir do you speak english he replied a little he spoke however sufficiently well for our purpose and very distinctly as all the highlanders do who learn english as a foreign language but in a long conversation they want words he informed us that he himself was going beyond the trossachs to callander that no boats were kept to let but there were two gentlemens houses at this end of the lake one of which we could not yet see it being hidden from us by a part of the hill on which we stood the other house was that which we saw opposite to us both the gentlemen kept boats and probably might be able to spare one of their servants to go with us after we had asked many questions which the highlander answered with patience and courtesy he parted from us going along a sort of horsetrack which a footpassenger if he once get into it need not lose if he be careful when he was gone we again debated whether we should go back to tarbet or throw ourselves upon the mercy of one of the two gentlemen for a nights lodging what we had seen of the main body of the lake made us little desire to see more of it the highlander upon the naked heath in his highland dress upon his carefulgoing horse with the boy following him was worth it all but after a little while we resolved to go on ashamed to shrink from an adventure pursued the horsetrack and soon came in sight of the other gentlemans house which stood on the opposite side of the vale a little above the lake it was a white house no trees near it except a new plantation of firs but the fields were green sprinkled over with haycocks and the brook which comes down the valley and falls into the lake ran through them it was like a newmade farm in a mountain vale and yet very pleasing after the depressing prospect which had been before us our road was rough and not easy to be kept it was between five and six oclock when we reached the brook side where coleridge and i stopped and william went up towards the house which was in a field where about half a dozen people were at work he addressed himself to one who appeared like the master and all drew near him staring at william as nobody could have stared but out of sheer rudeness except in such a lonely place he told his tale and inquired about boats there were no boats and no lodging nearer than callander ten miles beyond the foot of the lake a laugh was on every face when william said we were come to see the trossachs no doubt they thought we had better have stayed at our own homes william endeavoured to make it appear not so very foolish by informing them that it was a place much celebrated in england though perhaps little thought of by them and that we only differed from many of our countrymen in having come the wrong way in consequence of an erroneous direction after a little time the gentleman said we should be accommodated with such beds as they had and should be welcome to rest in their house if we pleased william came back for coleridge and me the men all stood at the door to receive us and now their behaviour was perfectly courteous we were conducted into the house by the same man who had directed us hither on the other side of the lake and afterwards we learned that he was the father of our hostess he showed us into a room upstairs begged we would sit at our ease walk out or do just as we pleased it was a large square deal wainscoted room the wainscot black with age yet had never been painted it did not look like an english room and yet i do not know in what it differed except that in england it is not common to see so large and wellbuilt a room so illfurnished there were two or three large tables and a few old chairs of different sorts as if they had been picked up one did not know how at sales or had belonged to different rooms of the house ever since it was built we sat perhaps threequarters of an hour and i was about to carry down our wet coffee and sugar and ask leave to boil it when the mistress of the house entered a tall finelooking woman neatly dressed in a darkcoloured gown with a white handkerchief tied round her head she spoke to us in a very pleasing manner begging permission to make tea for us an offer which we thankfully accepted encouraged by the sweetness of her manners i went downstairs to dry my feet by the kitchen fire she lent me a pair of stockings and behaved to me with the utmost attention and kindness she carried the teathings into the room herself leaving me to make tea and set before us cheese and butter and barley cakes these cakes are as thin as our oatbread but instead of being crisp are soft and leathery yet we being hungry and the butter delicious ate them with great pleasure but when the same bread was set before us afterwards we did not like it after tea william and i walked out we amused ourselves with watching the highlanders at work they went leisurely about everything and whatever was to be done all followed old men and young and little children we were driven into the house by a shower which came on with the evening darkness and the people leaving their work paused at the same time i was pleased to see them a while after sitting round a blazing fire in the kitchen father and soninlaw master and man and the mother with her little child on her knee when i had been there before tea i had observed what a contrast there was between the mistress and her kitchen she did not differ in appearance from an english country lady but her kitchen roof walls and floor of mud was all black alike yet now with the light of a bright fire upon so many happy countenances the whole room made a pretty sight we heard the company laughing and talking long after we were in bed indeed i believe they never work till they are tired the children could not speak a word of english they were very shy at first but after i had caressed the eldest and given her a red leather purse with which she was delighted she took hold of my hand and hung about me changing her sidelong looks for pretty smiles her mother lamented they were so far from school they should be obliged to send the children down into the lowlands to be taught reading and english callander the nearest town was twenty miles from them and it was only a small place they had their groceries from glasgow she said that at callander was their nearest church but sometimes got a preaching at the garrison in explaining herself she informed us that the large building which had puzzled us in the morning had been built by government at the request of one of the dukes of montrose for the defence of his domains against the attacks of rob roy i will not answer for the truth of this perhaps it might have been built for this purpose and as a check on the highlands in general certain it is however that it was a garrison soldiers used to be constantly stationed there and have only been withdrawn within the last thirteen or fourteen years mrs macfarlane attended me to my room she said she hoped i should be able to sleep upon blankets and said they were fresh from the fauld footnote she means that they stop work before they are tireded saturday august thbefore i rose mrs macfarlane came into my room to see if i wanted anything and told me she should send the servant up with a basin of whey saying we make very good whey in this country indeed i thought it the best i had ever tasted but i can not tell how this should be for they only make skimmedmilk cheeses i asked her for a little bread and milk for our breakfast but she said it would be no trouble to make tea as she must make it for the family so we all breakfasted together the cheese was set out as before with plenty of butter and barleycakes and fresh baked oaten cakes which no doubt were made for us they had been kneaded with cream and were excellent all the party pressed us to eat and were very jocose about the necessity of helping out their coarse bread with butter and they themselves ate almost as much butter as bread in talking of the french and the present times their language was what most people would call jacobinical they spoke much of the oppressions endured by the highlanders further up of the absolute impossibility of their living in any comfort and of the cruelty of laying so many restraints on emigration then they spoke with animation of the attachment of the clans to their lairds the laird of this place glengyle where we live could have commanded so many men who would have followed him to the death and now there are none left it appeared that mr macfarlane and his wifes brother mr macalpine farmed the place inclusive of the whole vale upwards to the mountains and the mountains themselves under the lady of glengyle the mother of the young laird a minor it was a sheepfarm speaking of another neighbouring laird they said he had gone like the rest of them to edinburgh left his lands and his own people spending his money where it brought him not any esteem so that he was of no value either at home or abroad we mentioned rob roy and the eyes of all glistened even the lady of the house who was very diffident and no great talker exclaimed he was a good man rob roy he had been dead only about eighty years had lived in the next farm which belonged to him and there his bones were laid he was a famous swordsman having an arm much longer than other men he had a greater command with his sword as a proof of the length of his arm they told us that he could garter his tartan stockings below the knee without stooping and added a dozen different stories of single combats which he had fought all in perfect goodhumour merely to prove his prowess i daresay they had stories of this kind which would hardly have been exhausted in the long evenings of a whole december week rob roy being as famous here as ever robin hood was in the forest of sherwood he also robbed from the rich giving to the poor and defending them from oppression they tell of his confining the factor of the duke of montrose in one of the islands of loch ketterine after having taken his money from himthe dukes rentsin open day while they were sitting at table he was a formidable enemy of the duke but being a small laird against a greater was overcome at last and forced to resign all his lands on the braes of loch lomond including the caves which we visited on account of the money he had taken from the duke and could not repay footnote there is a mistake here his bones were laid about fifteen or twenty miles from thence in balquhidder kirkyard but it was under the belief that his grave is near the head of loch ketterine in one of those pinfoldlike burial grounds of neglected and desolate appearance which the traveller meets with in the highlands of scotland that the wellknown poem on rob roys grave was composedj c s when breakfast was ended the mistress desired the person whom we took to be her husband to return thanks he said a short grace and in a few minutes they all went off to their work we saw them about the door following one another like a flock of sheep with the children after whatever job they were engaged in mrs macfarlane told me she would show me the buryingplace of the lairds of glengyle and took me to a square enclosure like a pinfold with a stone ball at every corner we had noticed it the evening before and wondered what it could be it was in the middle of a planting as they call plantations which was enclosed for the preservation of the trees therefore we had to climb over a high wall it was a dismal spot containing four or five graves overgrown with long grass nettles and brambles against the wall was a marble monument to the memory of one of the lairds of whom they spoke with veneration some english verses were inscribed upon the marble purporting that he had been the father of his clan a brave and good man when we returned to the house she said she would show me what curious feathers they had in their country and brought out a bunch carefully wrapped up in paper on my asking her what bird they came from oh she replied it is a great beast we conjectured it was an eagle and from her description of its ways and the manner of destroying it we knew it was so she begged me to accept of some of the feathers telling me that some ladies wore them in their heads i was much pleased with the gift which i shall preserve in memory of her kindness and simplicity of manners and the highland solitude where she lived we took leave of the family with regret they were handsome healthy and happylooking people it was ten oclock when we departed we had learned that there was a ferryboat kept at three miles distance and if the man was at home he would row us down the lake to the trossachs our walk was mostly through coppicewoods along a horseroad upon which narrow carts might travel passed that white house which had looked at us with such a friendly face when we were on the other side it stood on the slope of a hill with green pastures below it plots of corn and coppicewood and behind a rocky steep covered with wood it was a very pretty place but the morning being cold and dull the opposite shore appeared dreary near to the white house we passed by another of those little pinfold squares which we knew to be a buryingplace it was in a sloping green field among woods and within sound of the beating of the water against the shore if there were but a gentle breeze to stir it i thought if i lived in that house and my ancestors and kindred were buried there i should sit many an hour under the walls of this plot of earth where all the household would be gathered together we found the ferryman at work in the field above his hut and he was at liberty to go with us but being wet and hungry we begged that he would let us sit by his fire till we had refreshed ourselves this was the first genuine highland hut we had been in we entered by the cowhouse the housedoor being within at right angles to the outer door the woman was distressed that she had a bad fire but she heaped up some dry peats and heather and blowing it with her breath in a short time raised a blaze that scorched us into comfortable feelings a small part of the smoke found its way out of the hole of the chimney the rest through the open windowplaces one of which was within the recess of the fireplace and made a frame to a little picture of the restless lake and the opposite shore seen when the outer door was open the woman of the house was very kind whenever we asked her for anything it seemed a fresh pleasure to her that she had it for us she always answered with a sort of softening down of the scotch exclamation hoot ho yes yell get that and hied to her cupboard in the spence we were amused with the phrase yell get that in the highlands which appeared to us as if it came from a perpetual feeling of the difficulty with which most things are procured we got oatmeal butter bread and milk made some porridge and then departed it was rainy and cold with a strong wind coleridge was afraid of the cold in the boat so he determined to walk down the lake pursuing the same road we had come along there was nothing very interesting for the first three or four miles on either side of the water to the right uncultivated heath or poor coppicewood and to the left a scattering of meadow ground patches of corn coppicewoods and here and there a cottage the wind fell and it began to rain heavily on this william wrapped himself in the boatmans plaid and lay at the bottom of the boat till we came to a place where i could not help rousing him we were rowing down that side of the lake which had hitherto been little else than a moorish ridge after turning a rocky point we came to a bay closed in by rocks and steep woods chiefly of fullgrown birch the lake was elsewhere ruffled but at the entrance of this bay the breezes sunk and it was calm a small island was near and the opposite shore covered with wood looked soft through the misty rain william rubbing his eyes for he had been asleep called out that he hoped i had not let him pass by anything that was so beautiful as this and i was glad to tell him that it was but the beginning of a new land after we had left this bay we saw before us a long reach of woods and rocks and rocky points that promised other bays more beautiful than what we had passed the ferryman was a goodnatured fellow and rowed very industriously following the ins and outs of the shore he was delighted with the pleasure we expressed continually repeating how pleasant it would have been on a fine day i believe he was attached to the lake by some sentiment of pride as his own domainhis being almost the only boat upon itwhich made him seeing we were willing gazers take far more pains than an ordinary boatman he would often say after he had compassed the turning of a point this is a bonny part and he always chose the bonniest with greater skill than our prospecthunters and picturesque travellers places screened from the windsthat was the first point the rest followed of coursericher growing trees rocks and banks and curves which the eye delights in the second bay we came to differed from the rest the hills retired a short space from the lake leaving a few level fields between on which was a cottage embosomed in trees the bay was defended by rocks at each end and the hills behind made a shelter for the cottage the only dwelling i believe except one on this side of loch ketterine we now came to steeps that rose directly from the lake and passed by a place called in the gaelic the den of the ghosts which reminded us of lodore it is a rock or mass of rock with a stream of large black stones like the naked or driedup bed of a torrent down the side of it birchtrees start out of the rock in every direction and cover the hill above further than we could see the water of the lake below was very deep black and calm our delight increased as we advanced till we came in view of the termination of the lake seeing where the river issues out of it through a narrow chasm between the hills footnote goblins cavej c s here i ought to rest as we rested and attempt to give utterance to our pleasure but indeed i can impart but little of what we felt we were still on the same side of the water and being immediately under the hill within a considerable bending of the shore we were enclosed by hills all round as if we had been upon a smaller lake of which the whole was visible it was an entire solitude and all that we beheld was the perfection of loveliness and beauty we had been through many solitary places since we came into scotland but this place differed as much from any we had seen before as if there had been nothing in common between them no thought of dreariness or desolation found entrance here yet nothing was to be seen but water wood rocks and heather and bare mountains above we saw the mountains by glimpses as the clouds passed by them and were not disposed to regret with our boatman that it was not a fine day for the near objects were not concealed from us but softened by being seen through the mists the lake is not very wide here but appeared to be much narrower than it really is owing to the many promontories which are pushed so far into it that they are much more like islands than promontories we had a longing desire to row to the outlet and look up into the narrow passage through which the river went but the point where we were to land was on the other side so we bent our course right across and just as we came in sight of two huts which have been built by lady perth as a shelter for those who visit the trossachs coleridge hailed us with a shout of triumph from the door of one of them exulting in the glory of scotland the huts stand at a small distance from each other on a high and perpendicular rock that rises from the bed of the lake a road which has a very wild appearance has been cut through the rock yet even here among these bold precipices the feeling of excessive beautifulness overcomes every other while we were upon the lake on every side of us were bays within bays often more like tiny lakes or pools than bays and these not in long succession only but all round some almost on the broad breast of the water the promontories shot out so far after we had landed we walked along the road to the uppermost of the huts where coleridge was standing from the door of this hut we saw benvenue opposite to usa high mountain but clouds concealed its top its side rising directly from the lake is covered with birchtrees to a great height and seamed with innumerable channels of torrents but now there was no water in them nothing to break in upon the stillness and repose of the scene nor do i recollect hearing the sound of water from any side the wind being fallen and the lake perfectly still the place was all eye and completely satisfied the sense and the heart above and below us to the right and to the left were rocks knolls and hills which wherever anything could growand that was everywhere between the rockswere covered with trees and heather the trees did not in any place grow so thick as an ordinary wood yet i think there was never a bare space of twenty yards it was more like a natural forest where the trees grow in groups or singly not hiding the surface of the ground which instead of being green and mossy was of the richest purple the heather was indeed the most luxuriant i ever saw it was so tall that a child of ten years old struggling through it would often have been buried head and shoulders and the exquisite beauty of the colour near or at a distance seen under the trees is not to be conceived but if i were to go on describing for evermore i should give but a faint and very often a false idea of the different objects and the various combinations of them in this most intricate and delicious place besides i tired myself out with describing at loch lomond so i will hasten to the end of my tale this reminds me of a sentence in a little pamphlet written by the minister of callander descriptive of the environs of that place after having taken up at least six closelyprinted pages with the trossachs he concludes thus in a word the trossachs beggar all descriptiona conclusion in which everybody who has been there will agree with him i believe the word trossachs signifies many hills it is a name given to all the eminences at the foot of loch ketterine and about half a mile beyond we left the hut retracing the few yards of road which we had climbed our boat lay at anchor under the rock in the last of all the compartments of the lake a small oblong pool almost shut up within itself as several others had appeared to be by jutting points of rock the termination of a long outshooting of the water pushed up between the steps of the main shore where the huts stand and a broad promontory which with its hillocks and points and lesser promontories occupies the centre of the foot of the lake a person sailing through the lake up the middle of it would just as naturally suppose that the outlet was here as on the other side and so it might have been with the most trifling change in the disposition of the ground for at the end of this slip of water the lake is confined only by a gentle rising of a few yards towards an opening between the hills a narrow pass or valley through which the river might have flowed the road is carried through this valley which only differs from the lower part of the vale of the lake in being excessively narrow and without water it is enclosed by mountains rocky mounds hills and hillocks scattered over with birchtrees and covered with dutch myrtle and heather even surpassing what we had seen before our mother eve had no fairer though a more diversified garden to tend than we found within this little close valley it rained all the time but the mists and calm air made us ample amends for a wetting at the opening of the pass we climbed up a low eminence and had an unexpected prospect suddenly before usanother lake small compared with loch ketterine though perhaps four miles long but the misty air concealed the end of it the transition from the solitary wildness of loch ketterine and the narrow valley or pass to this scene was very delightful it was a gentle place with lovely open bays one small island corn fields woods and a group of cottages this vale seemed to have been made to be tributary to the comforts of man loch ketterine for the lonely delight of nature and kind spirits delighting in beauty the sky was grey and heavyfloating mists on the hillsides which softened the objects and where we lost sight of the lake it appeared so near to the sky that they almost touched one another giving a visionary beauty to the prospect while we overlooked this quiet scene we could hear the stream rumbling among the rocks between the lakes but the mists concealed any glimpse of it which we might have had this small lake is called loch achray we returned of course by the same road our guide repeated over and over again his lamentations that the day was so bad though we had often told himnot indeed with much hope that he would believe usthat we were glad of it as we walked along he pulled a leafy twig from a birchtree and after smelling it gave it to me saying how sweet and halesome it was and that it was pleasant and very halesome on a fine summers morning to sail under the banks where the birks are growing this reminded me of the old scotch songs in which you continually hear of the puing the birks common as birches are in the north of england i believe their sweet smell is a thing unnoticed among the peasants we returned again to the huts to take a farewell look we had shared our food with the ferryman and a traveller whom we had met here who was going up the lake and wished to lodge at the ferryhouse so we offered him a place in the boat coleridge chose to walk we took the same side of the lake as before and had much delight in visiting the bays over again but the evening began to darken and it rained so heavily before we had gone two miles that we were completely wet it was dark when we landed and on entering the house i was sick with cold the good woman had provided according to her promise a better fire than we had found in the morning and indeed when i sate down in the chimneycorner of her smoky biggin i thought i had never been more comfortable in my life coleridge had been there long enough to have a pan of coffee boiling for us and having put our clothes in the way of drying we all sate down thankful for a shelter we could not prevail upon the man of the house to draw near the fire though he was cold and wet or to suffer his wife to get him dry clothes till she had served us which she did though most willingly not very expeditiously a cumberland man of the same rank would not have had such a notion of what was fit and right in his own house or if he had one would have accused him of servility but in the highlander it only seemed like politeness however erroneous and painful to us naturally growing out of the dependence of the inferiors of the clan upon their laird he did not however refuse to let his wife bring out the whiskybottle at our request she keeps a dram as the phrase is indeed i believe there is scarcely a lonely house by the wayside in scotland where travellers may not be accommodated with a dram we asked for sugar butter barleybread and milk and with a smile and a stare more of kindness than wonder she replied yell get that bringing each article separately we caroused our cups of coffee laughing like children at the strange atmosphere in which we were the smoke came in gusts and spread along the walls and above our heads in the chimney where the hens were roosting like light clouds in the sky we laughed and laughed again in spite of the smarting of our eyes yet had a quieter pleasure in observing the beauty of the beams and rafters gleaming between the clouds of smoke they had been crusted over and varnished by many winters till where the firelight fell upon them they were as glossy as black rocks on a sunny day cased in ice when we had eaten our supper we sate about half an hour and i think i had never felt so deeply the blessing of a hospitable welcome and a warm fire the man of the house repeated from time to time that we should often tell of this night when we got to our homes and interposed praises of this his own lake which he had more than once when we were returning in the boat ventured to say was bonnier than loch lomond our companion from the trossachs who it appeared was an edinburgh drawingmaster going during the vacation on a pedestrian tour to john o groats house was to sleep in the barn with william and coleridge where the man said he had plenty of dry hay i do not believe that the hay of the highlands is often very dry but this year it had a better chance than usual wet or dry however the next morning they said they had slept comfortably when i went to bed the mistress desiring me to go ben attended me with a candle and assured me that the bed was dry though not sic as i had been used to it was of chaff there were two others in the room a cupboard and two chests on one of which stood the milk in wooden vessels covered over i should have thought that milk so kept could not have been sweet but the cheese and butter were good the walls of the whole house were of stone unplastered it consisted of three apartmentsthe cowhouse at one end the kitchen or house in the middle and the spence at the other end the rooms were divided not up to the rigging but only to the beginning of the roof so that there was a free passage for light and smoke from one end of the house to the other i went to bed some time before the family the door was shut between us and they had a bright fire which i could not see but the light it sent up among the varnished rafters and beams which crossed each other in almost as intricate and fantastic a manner as i have seen the underboughs of a large beechtree withered by the depth of the shade above produced the most beautiful effect that can be conceived it was like what i should suppose an underground cave or temple to be with a dripping or moist roof and the moonlight entering in upon it by some means or other and yet the colours were more like melted gems i lay looking up till the light of the fire faded away and the man and his wife and child had crept into their bed at the other end of the room i did not sleep much but passed a comfortable night for my bed though hard was warm and clean the unusualness of my situation prevented me from sleeping i could hear the waves beat against the shore of the lake a little syke close to the door made a much louder noise and when i sate up in my bed i could see the lake through an open windowplace at the beds head add to this it rained all night i was less occupied by remembrance of the trossachs beautiful as they were than the vision of the highland hut which i could not get out of my head i thought of the fairyland of spenser and what i had read in romance at other times and then what a feast would it be for a london pantomimemaker could he but transplant it to drury lane with all its beautiful colours end of vol i the project gutenberg ebook of journals of dorothy wordsworth vol ii

scotland ad continued third week sunday august thwe were desirous to have crossed the mountains above glengyle to glenfalloch at the head of loch lomond but it rained so heavily that it was impossible so the ferryman engaged to row us to the point where coleridge and i had rested while william was going on our doubtful adventure the hostess provided us with tea and sugar for our breakfast the water was boiled in an iron pan and dealt out to us in a jug a proof that she does not often drink tea though she said she had always tea and sugar in the house she and the rest of the family breakfasted on curds and whey as taken out of the pot in which she was making cheese she insisted upon my taking some also and her husband joined in with the old story that it was varra halesome i thought it exceedingly good and said to myself that they lived nicely with their cow she was meat drink and company before breakfast the housewife was milking behind the chimney and i thought i had seldom heard a sweeter fireside sound in an evening sitting over a sleepy lowburnt fire it would lull one like the purring of a cat when we departed the good woman shook me cordially by the hand saying she hoped that if ever we came into scotland again we would come and see her the lake was calm but it rained so heavily that we could see little landed at about ten oclock almost wet to the skin and with no prospect but of streaming rains faced the mountainroad to loch lomond we recognised the same objects passed beforethe tarn the potatobed and the cottages with their burnies which were no longer as one might say household streams but made us only think of the mountains and rocks they came from indeed it is not easy to imagine how different everything appeared the mountains with mists and torrents alive and always changing but the low grounds where the inhabitants had been at work the day before were melancholy with here and there a few haycocks and hay scattered about wet as we were william and i turned out of our path to the garrison house a few rooms of it seemed to be inhabited by some wretchedly poor families and it had all the desolation of a large decayed mansion in the suburbs of a town abandoned of its proper inhabitants and become the abode of paupers in spite of its outside bravery it was but a poor protection against the sword of winter keen and cold we looked at the building through the arch of a broken gateway of the courtyard in the middle of which it stands upon that stormy day it appeared more than desolate there was something about it even frightful when beginning to descend the hill towards loch lomond we overtook two girls who told us we could not cross the ferry till evening for the boat was gone with a number of people to church one of the girls was exceedingly beautiful and the figures of both of them in grey plaids falling to their feet their faces only being uncovered excited our attention before we spoke to them but they answered us so sweetly that we were quite delighted at the same time that they stared at us with an innocent look of wonder i think i never heard the english language sound more sweetly than from the mouth of the elder of these girls while she stood at the gate answering our inquiries her face flushed with the rain her pronunciation was clear and distinct without difficulty yet slow like that of a foreign speech they told us we might sit in the ferryhouse till the return of the boat went in with us and made a good fire as fast as possible to dry our wet clothes we learnt that the taller was the sister of the ferryman and had been left in charge with the house for the day that the other was his wifes sister and was come with her mother on a visitan old woman who sate in a corner beside the cradle nursing her little grandchild we were glad to be housed with our feet upon a warm hearthstone and our attendants were so active and goodhumoured that it was pleasant to have to desire them to do anything the younger was a delicate and unhealthylooking girl but there was an uncommon meekness in her countenance with an air of premature intelligence which is often seen in sickly young persons the other made me think of peter bells highland girl as light and beauteous as a squirrel as beauteous and as wild footnote see peter bell part iii stanza ed she moved with unusual activity which was chastened very delicately by a certain hesitation in her looks when she spoke being able to understand us but imperfectly they were both exceedingly desirous to get me what i wanted to make me comfortable i was to have a gown and petticoat of the mistresss so they turned out her whole wardrobe upon the parlour floor talking erse to one another and laughing all the time it was long before they could decide which of the gowns i was to have they chose at last no doubt thinking that it was the best a lightcoloured sprigged cotton with long sleeves and they both laughed while i was putting it on with the blue linsey petticoat and one or the other or both together helped me to dress repeating at least half a dozen times you never had on the like of that before they held a consultation of several minutes over a pair of coarse woollen stockings gabbling erse as fast as their tongues could move and looked as if uncertain what to do at last with great diffidence they offered them to me adding as before that i had never worn the like of them when we entered the house we had been not a little glad to see a fowl stewing in barleybroth and now when the wettest of our clothes were stripped off began again to recollect that we were hungry and asked if we could have dinner oh yes ye may get that the elder replied pointing to the pan on the fire conceive what a busy house it wasall our wet clothes to be dried dinner prepared and set out for us four strangers and a second cooking for the family add to this two rough callans as they called them boys about eight years old were playing beside us the poor baby was fretful all the while the old woman sang doleful erse songs rocking it in its cradle the more violently the more it cried then there were a dozen cookings of porridge and it could never be fed without the assistance of all three the hut was after the highland fashion but without anything beautiful except its situation the floor was rough and wet with the rain that came in at the door so that the lasses bare feet were as wet as if they had been walking through street puddles in passing from one room to another the windows were open as at the other hut but the kitchen had a bed in it and was much smaller and the shape of the house was like that of a common english cottage without its comfort yet there was no appearance of povertyindeed quite the contrary the peep out of the open doorplace across the lake made some amends for the want of the long roof and elegant rafters of our boatmans cottage and all the while the waterfall which we could not see was roaring at the end of the hut which seemed to serve as a soundingboard for its noise so that it was not unlike sitting in a house where a mill is going the dashing of the waves against the shore could not be distinguished yet in spite of my knowledge of this i could not help fancying that the tumult and storm came from the lake and went out several times to see if it was possible to row over in safety after long waiting we grew impatient for our dinner at last the pan was taken off and carried into the other room but we had to wait at least another half hour before the ceremony of dishing up was completed yet with all this bustle and difficulty the manner in which they and particularly the elder of the girls performed everything was perfectly graceful we ate a hearty dinner and had time to get our clothes quite dry before the arrival of the boat the girls could not say at what time it would be at home on our asking them if the church was far off they replied not very far and when we asked how far they said perhaps about four or five miles i believe a church of england congregation would hold themselves excused for nonattendance three parts of the year having but half as far to go but in the lonely parts of scotland they make little of a journey of nine or ten miles to a preaching they have not perhaps an opportunity of going more than once in a quarter of a year and setting piety aside have other motives to attend they hear the news public and private and see their friends and neighbours for though the people who meet at these times may be gathered together from a circle of twenty miles diameter a sort of neighbourly connexion must be so brought about there is something exceedingly pleasing to my imagination in this gathering together of the inhabitants of these secluded districtsfor instance the borderers of these two large lakes meeting at the deserted garrison which i have described the manner of their travelling is on foot on horseback and in boats across the watersyoung and old rich and poor all in their best dress if it were not for these sabbathday meetings one summer month would be like another summer month one winter month like anotherdetached from the goingson of the world and solitary throughout from the time of earliest childhood they will be like landingplaces in the memory of a person who has passed his life in these thinly peopled regions they must generally leave distinct impressions differing from each other so much as they do in circumstances in time and place etcsome in the open fields upon hills in houses under large rocks in storms and in fine weather but i have forgotten the fireside of our hut after long waiting the girls who had been on the lookout informed us that the boat was coming i went to the waterside and saw a cluster of people on the opposite shore but being yet at a distance they looked more like soldiers surrounding a carriage than a group of men and women red and green were the distinguishable colours we hastened to get ourselves ready as soon as we saw the party approach but had longer to wait than we expected the lake being wider than it appears to be as they drew near we could distinguish men in tartan plaids women in scarlet cloaks and green umbrellas by the halfdozen the landing was as pretty a sight as ever i saw the bay which had been so quiet two days before was all in motion with small waves while the swoln waterfall roared in our ears the boat came steadily up being pressed almost to the waters edge by the weight of its cargo perhaps twenty people landed one after another it did not rain much but the women held up their umbrellas they were dressed in all the colours of the rainbow and with their scarlet cardinals the tartan plaids of the men and scotch bonnets made a gay appearance there was a joyous bustle surrounding the boat which even imparted something of the same character to the waterfall in its tumult and the restless grey waves the young men laughed and shouted the lasses laughed and the elder folks seemed to be in a bustle to be away i remember well with what haste the mistress of the house where we were ran up to seek after her child and seeing us how anxiously and kindly she inquired how we had fared if we had had a good fire had been well waited upon etc etc all this in three minutesfor the boatman had another party to bring from the other side and hurried us off the hospitality we had met with at the two cottages and mr macfarlanes gave us very favourable impressions on this our first entrance into the highlands and at this day the innocent merriment of the girls with their kindness to us and the beautiful figure and face of the elder come to my mind whenever i think of the ferryhouse and waterfall of loch lomond and i never think of the two girls but the whole image of that romantic spot is before me a living image as it will be to my dying day the following poem was written by william not long after our return from scotland footnote to a highland girl in memorials of a tour in scotland ed sweet highland girl a very shower of beauty is thy earthly dower twice seven consenting years have shed their utmost bounty on thy head and these grey rocks this household lawn these trees a veil just half withdrawn this fall of water that doth make a murmur near the silent lake this little bay a quiet road that holds in shelter thy abode in truth together ye do seem like something fashiond in a dream such forms as from their covert peep when earthly cares are laid asleep yet dream and vision as thou art i bless thee with a human heart god shield thee to thy latest years i neither know thee nor thy peers and yet my eyes are filled with tears with earnest feeling i shall pray for thee when i am far away for never saw i mien or face in which more plainly i could trace benignity and homebred sense ripening in perfect innocence here scattered like a random seed remote from men thou dost not need th embarrassd look of shy distress and maidenly shamefacedness thou wearst upon thy forehead clear the freedom of a mountaineer a face with gladness overspread sweet smiles by humankindness bred and seemliness complete that sways thy courtesies about thee plays with no restraint but such as springs from quick and eager visitings of thoughts that lie beyond the reach of thy few words of english speech a bondage sweetly brookd a strife that gives thy gestures grace and life so have i not unmoved in mind seen birds of tempestloving kind thus beating up against the wind what hand but would a garland cull for thee who art so beautiful o happy pleasure here to dwell beside thee in some heathy dell adopt your homely ways and dress a shepherd thou a shepherdess but i could frame a wish for thee more like a grave reality thou art to me but as a wave of the wild sea and i would have some claim upon thee if i could though but of common neighbourhood what joy to hear thee and to see thy elder brother i would be thy fatheranything to thee now thanks to heaven that of its grace hath led me to this lonely place joy have i had and going hence i bear away my recompence in spots like these it is we prize our memory feel that she hath eyes then why should i be loth to stir i feel this place is made for her to give new pleasure like the past continued long as life shall last nor am i loth though pleased at heart sweet highland girl from thee to part for i methinks till i grow old as fair before me shall behold as i do now the cabin small the lake the bay the waterfall and thee the spirit of them all we were rowed over speedily by the assistance of two youths who went backwards and forwards for their own amusement helping at the oars and pulled as if they had strength and spirits to spare for a year to come we noticed that they had uncommonly fine teeth and that they and the boatman were very handsome people another merry crew took our place in the boat we had three miles to walk to tarbet it rained but not heavily the mountains were not concealed from us by the mists but appeared larger and more grand twilight was coming on and the obscurity under which we saw the objects with the sounding of the torrents kept our minds alive and wakeful all was solitary and hugesky water and mountains mingled together while we were walking forward the road leading us over the top of a brow we stopped suddenly at the sound of a halfarticulate gaelic hooting from the field close to us it came from a little boy whom we could see on the hill between us and the lake wrapped up in a grey plaid he was probably calling home the cattle for the night his appearance was in the highest degree moving to the imagination mists were on the hillsides darkness shutting in upon the huge avenue of mountains torrents roaring no house in sight to which the child might belong his dress cry and appearance all different from anything we had been accustomed to it was a text as william has since observed to me containing in itself the whole history of the highlanders lifehis melancholy his simplicity his poverty his superstition and above all that visionariness which results from a communion with the unworldliness of nature when we reached tarbet the people of the house were anxious to know how we had fared particularly the girl who had waited upon us our praises of loch ketterine made her exceedingly happy and she ventured to say of which we had heard not a word before that it was bonnier to her fancy than loch lomond the landlord who was not at home when we had set off told us that if he had known of our going he would have recommended us to mr macfarlanes or the other farmhouse adding that they were hospitable people in that vale coleridge and i got tea and william and the drawingmaster chose supper they asked to have a broiled fowl a dish very common in scotland to which the mistress replied would not a boiled one do as well they consented supposing that it would be more easily cooked but when the fowl made its appearance to their great disappointment it proved a cold one that had been stewed in the broth at dinner monday august thit rained heavily this morning and having heard so much of the long rains since we came into scotland as well as before we had no hope that it would be over in less than three weeks at the least so poor coleridge being very unwell determined to send his clothes to edinburgh and make the best of his way thither being afraid to face much wet weather in an open carriage william and i were unwilling to be confined at tarbet so we resolved to go to arrochar a mile and a half on the road to inverary where there is an inn celebrated as a place of good accommodation for travellers coleridge and i set off on foot and william was to follow with the car but a heavy shower coming on coleridge left me to shelter in a hut and wait for william while he went on before this hut was unplastered and without windows crowded with beds uncomfortable and not in the simplicity of the ferrymans house a number of good clothes were hanging against the walls and a green silk umbrella was set up in a corner i should have been surprised to see an umbrella in such a place before we came into the highlands but umbrellas are not so common anywhere as therea plain proof of the wetness of the climate even five minutes after this a girl passed us without shoes and stockings whose gown and petticoat were not worth half a crown holding an umbrella over her bare head we turned at a guidepost to the new inn and after descending a little and winding round the bottom of a hill saw at a small distance a white house half hidden by tall trees upon a lawn that slopes down to the side of loch long a sealoch which is here very narrow right before us across the lake was the cobbler which appeared to rise directly from the water but in fact it overtopped another hill being a considerable way behind the inn looked so much like a gentlemans house that we could hardly believe it was an inn we drove down the broad gravel walk and making a sweep stopped at the front door were shown into a large parlour with a fire and my first thought was how comfortable we should be but coleridge who had arrived before us checked my pleasure the waiter had shown himself disposed to look coolly upon us and there had been a hint that we could not have bedsa party was expected who had engaged all the beds we conjectured this might be but a pretence and ordered dinner in the hope that matters would clear up a little and we thought they could not have the heart to turn us out in so heavy a rain if it were possible to lodge us we had a nice dinner yet would have gladly changed our roasted lamb and pickles and the gentlemanwaiter with his napkin in his pocket for the more homely fare of the smoky hut at loch ketterine and the good womans busy attentions with the certainty of a hospitable shelter at night after dinner i spoke to the landlord himself but he was not to be moved he could not even provide one bed for me so nothing was to be done but either to return to tarbet with coleridge or that william and i should push on the next stage to cairndow we had an interesting close view from the windows of the room where we sate looking across the lake which did not differ in appearance as we saw it here from a freshwater lake the sloping lawn on which the house stood was prettily scattered over with trees but we had seen the place to great advantage at our first approach owing to the mists upon the mountains which had made them seem exceedingly high while the strange figures on the cobbler appeared and disappeared like living things but as the day cleared we were disappointed in what was more like the permanent effect of the scene the mountains were not so lofty as we had supposed and the low grounds not so fertile yet still it is a very interesting i may say beautiful place the rain ceased entirely so we resolved to go on to cairndow and had the satisfaction of seeing that our landlord had not told us an untruth concerning the expected company for just before our departure we saw on the opposite side of the vale a coach with four horses another carriage and two or three men on horsebacka striking procession as it moved along between the bare mountain and the lake twenty years ago perhaps such a sight had not been seen here except when the duke of argyle or some other highland chieftain might chance to be going with his family to london or edinburgh they had to cross a bridge at the head of the lake which we could not see so after disappearing about ten minutes they drove up to the doorthree old ladies two waitingwomen and store of menservants the old ladies were as gaily dressed as bullfinches in springtime we heard the next day that they were the renowned miss waughs of carlisle and that they enjoyed themselves over a game of cards in the evening left arrochar at about four oclock in the afternoon coleridge accompanied us a little way we portioned out the contents of our purse before our parting and after we had lost sight of him drove heavily along crossed the bridge and looked to the right up the vale which is soon terminated by mountains it was of a yellow green with but few trees and few houses seagulls were flying above it our roadthe same along which the carriages had comewas directly under the mountains on our right hand and the lake was close to us on our left the waves breaking among stones overgrown with yellow seaweed fishermens boats and other larger vessels than are seen on freshwater lakes were lying at anchor near the opposite shore seabirds flying overhead the noise of torrents mingled with the beating of the waves and misty mountains enclosed the valea melancholy but not a dreary scene often have i in looking over a map of scotland followed the intricate windings of one of these sealochs till pleasing myself with my own imaginations i have felt a longing almost painful to travel among them by land or by water this was the first sealoch we had seen we came prepared for a new and great delight and the first impression which william and i received as we drove rapidly through the rain down the lawn of arrochar the objects dancing before us was even more delightful than we had expected but as i have said when we looked through the window as the mists disappeared and the objects were seen more distinctly there was less of sheltered valleycomfort than we had fancied to ourselves and the mountains were not so grand and now that we were near to the shore of the lake and could see that it was not of fresh water the wreck the broken seashells and scattered seaweed gave somewhat of a dull and uncleanly look to the whole lake and yet the water was clear and might have appeared as beautiful as that of loch lomond if with the same pure pebbly shore perhaps had we been in a more cheerful mood of mind we might have seen everything with a different eye the stillness of the mountains the motion of the waves the streaming torrents the seabirds the fishingboats were all melancholy yet still occupied as my mind was with other things i thought of the long windings through which the waters of the sea had come to this inland retreat visiting the inner solitudes of the mountains and i could have wished to have mused out a summers day on the shores of the lake from the foot of these mountains whither might not a little barque carry one away though so far inland it is but a slip of the great ocean seamen fishermen and shepherds here find a natural home we did not travel far down the lake but turning to the right through an opening of the mountains entered a glen called glen croe our thoughts were full of coleridge and when we were enclosed in the narrow dale with a length of winding road before us a road that seemed to have insinuated itself into the very heart of the mountainsthe brook the road bare hills floating mists scattered stones rocks and herds of black cattle being all that we could seei shivered at the thought of his being sickly and alone travelling from place to place the cobbler on our right was preeminent above the other hills the singular rocks on its summit seen so near were like ruinscastles or watchtowers after we had passed one reach of the glen another opened out long narrow deep and houseless with herds of cattle and large stones but the third reach was softer and more beautiful as if the mountains had there made a warmer shelter and there were a more gentle climate the rocks by the riverside had dwindled away the mountains were smooth and green and towards the end where the glen sloped upwards it was a cradlelike hollow and at that point where the slope became a hill at the very bottom of the curve of the cradle stood one cottage with a few fields and beds of potatoes there was also another house near the roadside which appeared to be a herdsmans hut the dwelling in the middle of the vale was a very pleasing object i said within myself how quietly might a family live in this pensive solitude cultivating and loving their own fields but the herdsmans hut being the only one in the vale had a melancholy face not being attached to any particular plot of land one could not help considering it as just kept alive and above ground by some dreary connexion with the long barren tract we had travelled through the afternoon had been exceedingly pleasant after we had left the vale of arrochar the sky was often threatening but the rain blew off and the evening was uncommonly fine the sun had set a short time before we had dismounted from the car to walk up the steep hill at the end of the glen clouds were moving all over the skysome of a brilliant yellow hue which shed a light like bright moonlight upon the mountains we could not have seen the head of the valley under more favourable circumstances the passing away of a storm is always a time of life and cheerfulness especially in a mountainous country but that afternoon and evening the sky was in an extraordinary degree vivid and beautiful we often stopped in ascending the hill to look down the long reach of the glen the road following the course of the river as far as we could see the farm and cottage hills smooth towards the base and rocky higher up were the sole objects before us this part of glen croe reminded us of some of the dales of the north of englandgrisdale above ulswater for instance but the length of it and the broad highway which is always to be seen at a great distance a sort of centre of the vale a point of reference gives to the whole of the glen and each division of it a very different character at the top of the hill we came to a seat with the wellknown inscription rest and be thankful on the same stone it was recorded that the road had been made by col wades regiment the seat is placed so as to command a full view of the valley and the long long road which with the fact recorded and the exhortation makes it an affecting restingplace we called to mind with pleasure a seat under the braes of loch lomond on which i had rested where the traveller is informed by an inscription upon a stone that the road was made by col lascelles regiment there the spot had not been chosen merely as a restingplace for there was no steep ascent in the highway but it might be for the sake of a spring of water and a beautiful rock or more probably because at that point the labour had been more than usually toilsome in hewing through the rock soon after we had climbed the hill we began to descend into another glen called glen kinglas we now saw the western sky which had hitherto been hidden from us by the hilla glorious mass of clouds uprising from a sea of distant mountains stretched out in length before us towards the westand close by us was a small lake or tarn from the reflection of the crimson clouds the water appeared of a deep red like melted rubies yet with a mixture of a grey or blackish hue the gorgeous light of the sky with the singular colour of the lake made the scene exceedingly romantic yet it was more melancholy than cheerful with all the power of light from the clouds there was an overcasting of the gloom of evening a twilight upon the hills we descended rapidly into the glen which resembles the lower part of glen croe though it seemed to be inferior in beauty but before we had passed through one reach it was quite dark and i only know that the steeps were high and that we had the company of a foaming stream and many a vagrant torrent crossed us dashing down the hills the road was bad and uncertain how we should fare we were eager and somewhat uneasy to get forward but when we were out of the close glen and near to cairndow as a traveller had told us the moon showed her clear face in the sky revealing a spacious vale with a broad loch and sloping corn fields the hills not very high this cheerful sight put us into spirits and we thought it was at least no dismal place to sit up all night in if they had no beds and they could not refuse us a shelter we were however well received and sate down in a neat parlour with a good fire tuesday august thbreakfasted before our departure and ate a herring fresh from the water at our landlords earnest recommendationmuch superior to the herrings we get in the north of england though we rose at seven could not set off before nine oclock the servants were in bed the kettle did not boilindeed we were completely out of patience but it had always been so and we resolved to go off in future without breakfast cairndow is a single house by the side of the loch i believe resorted to by gentlemen in the fishing season it is a pleasant place for such a purpose but the vale did not look so beautiful as by moonlightit had a sort of seacoldness without mountain grandeur there is a ferry for footpassengers from cairndow to the other side of the water and the road along which all carriages go is carried round the head of the lake perhaps a distance of three miles footnote i should rather think soj c s after we had passed the landingplace of the ferry opposite to cairndow we saw the lake spread out to a great width more like an arm of the sea or a great river than one of our lakes it reminded us of the severn at the chepstow passage but the shores were less rich and the hills higher the sun shone which made the morning cheerful though there was a cold wind our road never carried us far from the lake and with the beating of the waves the sparkling sunshiny water boats the opposite hills and on the side on which we travelled the chance cottages the coppice woods and common business of the fields the ride could not but be amusing but what most excited our attention was at one particular place a cluster of fishingboats at anchor in a still corner of the lake a small bay or harbour by the wayside they were overshadowed by fishermens nets hung out to dry which formed a dark awning that covered them like a tent overhanging the water on each side and falling in the most exquisitely graceful folds there was a monastic pensiveness a funereal gloom in the appearance of this little company of vessels which was the more interesting from the general liveliness and glancing motions of the water they being perfectly still and silent in their sheltered nook when we had travelled about seven miles from cairndow winding round the bottom of a hill we came in view of a great basin or elbow of the lake completely out of sight of the long track of water we had coasted we seemed now to be on the edge of a very large almost circular lake the town of inverary before us a line of white buildings on a low promontory right opposite and close to the waters edge the whole landscape a showy scene and bursting upon us at once a traveller who was riding by our side called out can that be the castle recollecting the prints which we had seen we knew it could not but the mistake is a natural one at that distance it is so little like an ordinary town from the mixture of regularity and irregularity in the buildings with the expanse of water and pleasant mountains the scattered boats and sloops and those gathered together it had a truly festive appearance a few steps more brought us in view of the castle a stately turreted mansion but with a modern air standing on a lawn retired from the water and screened behind by woods covering the sides of high hills to the top and still beyond by bare mountains our road wound round the semicircular shore crossing two bridges of lordly architecture the town looked pretty when we drew near to it in connexion with its situation different from any place i had ever seen yet exceedingly like what i imaged to myself from representations in rareeshows or pictures of foreign placesvenice for examplepainted on the scene of a playhouse which one is apt to fancy are as cleanly and gay as they look through the magnifyingglass of the rareeshow or in the candlelight dazzle of a theatre at the door of the inn though certainly the buildings had not that delightful outside which they appeared to have at a distance yet they looked very pleasant the range bordering on the water consisted of little else than the inn being a large house with very large stables the county gaol the opening into the main street into the town and an arched gateway the entrance into the duke of argyles private domain we were decently well received at the inn but it was overrich in waiters and large rooms to be exactly to our taste though quite in harmony with the neighbourhood before dinner we went into the dukes pleasuregrounds which are extensive and of course command a variety of lively and interesting views walked through avenues of tall beechtrees and observed some that we thought even the tallest we had ever seen but they were all scantily covered with leaves and the leaves exceedingly smallindeed some of them in the most exposed situations were almost bare as if it had been winter travellers who wish to view the inside of the castle send in their names and the duke appoints the time of their going but we did not think that what we should see would repay us for the trouble there being no pictures and the house which i believe has not been built above half a century is fitted up in the modern style if there had been any reliques of the ancient costume of the castle of a highland chieftain we should have been sorry to have passed it sate after dinner by the fireside till near sunset for it was very cold though the sun shone all day at the beginning of this our second walk we passed through the town which is but a doleful example of scotch filth the houses are plastered or roughcast and washed yellowwell built well sized and sashwindowed bespeaking a connexion with the duke such a dependence as may be expected in a small town so near to his mansion and indeed he seems to have done his utmost to make them comfortable according to our english notions of comfort they are fit for the houses of people living decently upon a decent trade but the windows and doorsteads were as dirty as in a dirty bystreet of a large town making a most unpleasant contrast with the comely face of the buildings towards the water and the ducal grandeur and natural festivity of the scene smoke and blackness are the wild growth of a highland hut the mud floors can not be washed the doorsteads are trampled by cattle and if the inhabitants be not very cleanly it gives one little pain but dirty people living in twostoried stone houses with dirty sash windows are a melancholy spectacle anywhere giving the notion either of vice or the extreme of wretchedness returning through the town we went towards the castle and entered the dukes grounds by a porters lodge following the carriageroad through the park which is prettily scattered over with trees and slopes gently towards the lake a great number of limetrees were growing singly not beautiful in their shape but i mention them for the resemblance to one of the same kind we had seen in the morning which formed a shade as impenetrable as the roof of any house the branches did not spread far nor any one branch much further than another on the outside it was like a green bush shorn with shears but when we sate upon a bench under it looking upwards in the middle of the tree we could not perceive any green at all it was like a hundred thousand magpies nests clustered and matted together the twigs and boughs being so intertwined that neither the light of the midday sun nor showers of hail or rain could pierce through them the limetrees on the lawn resembled this tree both in shape and in the manner of intertwisting their twigs but they were much smaller and not an impenetrable shade the views from the castle are delightful opposite is the lake girt with mountains or rather smooth high hills to the left appears a very steep rocky hill called duniquoich hill on the top of which is a building like a watchtower it rises boldly and almost perpendicular from the plain at a little distance from the river arey that runs through the grounds to the right is the town overtopped by a sort of spire or pinnacle of the church a thing unusual in scotland except in the large towns and which would often give an elegant appearance to the villages which from the uniformity of the huts and the frequent want of tall trees they seldom exhibit in looking at an extensive prospect or travelling through a large vale the trough of the clyde for instance i could not help thinking that in england there would have been somewhere a tower or spire to warn us of a village lurking under the covert of a wood or bank or to point out some particular spot on the distant hills which we might look at with kindly feelings i well remember how we used to love the little nest of trees out of which ganton spire rose on the distant wolds opposite to the windows at gallow hill the spire of inverary is not of so beautiful a shape as those of the english churches and not being one of a class of buildings which is understood at once seen near or at a distance is a less interesting object but it suits well with the outlandish trimness of the buildings bordering on the water indeed there is no one thing of the many gathered together in the extensive circuit of the basin or vale of inverary that is not in harmony with the effect of the whole place the castle is built of a beautiful hewn stone in colour resembling our blue slates the authortourists have quarrelled with the architecture of it but we did not find much that we were disposed to blame a castle in a deep glen overlooking a roaring stream and defended by precipitous rocks is no doubt an object far more interesting but dropping all ideas of danger or insecurity the natural retinue in our minds of an ancient highland chieftaintake a duke of argyle at the end of the eighteenth century let him have his house in grosvenor square his london liveries and daughters glittering at st jamess and i think you will be satisfied with his present mansion in the highlands which seems to suit with the present times and its situation and that is indeed a noble one for a modern duke of the mountainous district of argyleshire with its bare valleys its rocky coasts and sea lochs there is in the natural endowments of inverary something akin to every feature of the general character of the county yet even the very mountains and the lake itself have a kind of princely festivity in their appearance i do not know how to communicate the feeling but it seemed as if it were no insult to the hills to look on them as the shield and enclosure of the ducal domain to which the water might delight in bearing its tribute the hills near the lake are smooth so smooth that they might have been shaven or swept the shores too had somewhat of the same effect being bare and having no roughness no woody points yet the whole circuit being very large and the hills so extensive the scene was not the less cheerful and festive rejoicing in the light of heaven behind the castle the hills are planted to a great height and the pleasuregrounds extend far up the valley of arey we continued our walk a short way along the river and were sorry to see it stripped of its natural ornaments after the fashion of mr brown and left to tell its talefor it would not be silent like the river at blenheimto naked fields and the planted trees on the hills we were disgusted with the stables outhouses or farmhouses in different parts of the grounds behind the castle they were broad outspreading fantastic and unintelligible buildings footnote capability brownj c s sate in the park till the moonlight was perceived more than the light of day we then walked near the town by the waterside i observed that the children who were playing did not speak erse but a much worse english than is spoken by those highlanders whose common language is the erse i went into the town to purchase tea and sugar to carry with us on our journey we were tired when we returned to the inn and went to bed directly after tea my room was at the very top of the houseone flight of steps after anotherbut when i drew back the curtains of my window i was repaid for the trouble of panting upstairs by one of the most splendid moonlight prospects that can be conceived the whole circuit of the hills the castle the two bridges the tower on duniquoich hill and the lake with many boatsfit scene for summer midnight festivities i should have liked to have seen a bevy of scottish ladies sailing with music in a gay barge william to whom i have read this tells me that i have used the very words of browne of ottery coleridges fellowtownsman as i have seen when on the breast of thames a heavenly bevy of sweet english dames in some calm evening of delightful may with music give a farewell to the day or as they would with an admired tone greet nights ascension to her ebon throne brownes britannias pastorals wednesday august stwe had a long days journey before us without a regular baitingplace on the road so we breakfasted at inverary and did not set off till nine oclock having as usual to complain of the laziness of the servants our road was up the valley behind the castle the same we had gone along the evening before further up though the plantations on the hills are noble the valley was cold and naked wanting hedgerows and comfortable houses we travelled several miles under the plantations the vale all along seeming to belong almost exclusively to the castle it might have been better distinguished and adorned as we thought by neater farmhouses and cottages than are common in scotland and snugger fields with warm hedgerows at the same time testifying as boldly its adherence to the chief at that point of the valley where the pleasuregrounds appear to end we left our horse at a cottage door and turned a few steps out of the road to see a waterfall which roared so loud that we could not have gone by without looking about for it even if we had not known that there was one near inverary the waterfall is not remarkable for anything but the good taste with which it has been left to itself though there is a pleasureroad from the castle to it as we went further up the valley the roads died away and it became an ordinary scotch glen the poor pasturage of the hills creeping down into the valley where it was little better for the shelter i mean little greener than on the hillsides but a man must be of a churlish nature if with a mind free to look about he should not find such a glen a pleasing place to travel through though seeing little but the busy brook with here and there a bush or tree and cattle pasturing near the thinlyscattered dwellings but we came to one spot which i can not forget a single green field at the junction of another brook with the arey a peninsula surrounded with a close row of trees which overhung the streams and under their branches we could just see a neat white house that stood in the middle of the field enclosed by the trees before us was nothing but bare hills and the road through the bare glen a person who has not travelled in scotland can scarcely imagine the pleasure we have had from a stone house though fresh from the workmens hands square and sharp there is generally such an appearance of equality in poverty through the long glens of scotland giving the notion of savage ignoranceno house better than another and barns and houses all alike this house had however other recommendations of its own even in the fertile parts of somersetshire it would have been a delicious spot here mid mountain wild set like a little nest it was a restingplace for the fancy and to this day i often think of it the cottage and its green covert as an image of romance a place of which i have the same sort of knowledge as of some of the retirements the little valleys described so livelily by spenser in his fairy queen we travelled on the glen now becoming entirely bare passed a miserable hut on a naked hillside not far from the road where we were told by a man who came out of it that we might refresh ourselves with a dram of whisky went over the hill and saw nothing remarkable till we came in view of loch awe a large lake far below us among high mountainsone very large mountain right opposite which we afterwards found was called cruachan the day was pleasantsunny gleams and a fresh breeze the lakewe looked across itas bright as silver which made the islands three or four in number appear very green we descended gladly invited by the prospect before us travelling downwards along the side of the hill above a deep glen woody towards the lower part near the brook the hills on all sides were high and bare and not very stony it made us think of the descent from newlands into buttermere though on a wider scale and much inferior in simple majesty after walking down the hill a long way we came to a bridge under which the water dashed through a dark channel of rocks among trees the lake being at a considerable distance below with cultivated lands between close upon the bridge was a small hamlet a few houses near together and huddled up in treesa very sweet spot the only retired village we had yet seen which was characterized by beautiful wildness with sheltering warmth we had been told at inverary that we should come to a place where we might give our horse a feed of corn and found on inquiry that there was a little publichouse here or rather a hut where they kept a dram it was a cottage like all the rest without a signboard the woman of the house helped to take the horse out of harness and being hungry we asked her if she could make us some porridge to which she replied that we should get that and i followed her into the house and sate over her hearth while she was making it as to fire there was little sign of it save the smoke for a long time she having no fuel but green wood and no bellows but her breath my eyes smarted exceedingly but the woman seemed so kind and cheerful that i was willing to endure it for the sake of warming my feet in the ashes and talking to her the fire was in the middle of the room a crook being suspended from a crossbeam and a hole left at the top for the smoke to find its way out by it was a rude highland hut unadulterated by lowland fashions but it had not the elegant shape of the ferryhouse at loch ketterine and the fire being in the middle of the room could not be such a snug place to draw to on a winters night footnote cladichj c s we had a long afternoon before us with only eight miles to travel to dalmally and having been told that a ferryboat was kept at one of the islands we resolved to call for it and row to the island so we went to the top of an eminence and the man who was with us set some children to work to gather sticks and withered leaves to make a smoky firea signal for the boatman whose hut is on a flat green island like a sheep pasture without trees and of a considerable size the man told us it was a rabbitwarren there were other small islands on one of which was a ruined house fortification or small castle we could not learn anything of its history only a girl told us that formerly gentlemen lived in such places immediately from the waters edge rose the mountain cruachan on the opposite side of the lake it is woody near the water and craggy above with deep hollows on the surface we thought it the grandest mountain we had seen and on saying to the man who was with us that it was a fine mountain yes he replied it is an excellent mountain adding that it was higher than ben lomond and then told us some wild stories of the enormous profits it brought to lord breadalbane its lawful owner the shape of loch awe is very remarkable its outlet being at one side and only about eight miles from the head and the whole lake twentyfour miles in length we looked with longing after that branch of it opposite to us out of which the water issues it seemed almost like a river gliding under steep precipices what we saw of the larger branch or what might be called the body of the lake was less promising the banks being merely gentle slopes with not very high mountains behind and the ground moorish and cold the children after having collected fuel for our fire began to play on the green hill where we stood as heedless as if we had been trees or stones and amused us exceedingly with their activity they wrestled rolled down the hill pushing one another over and over again laughing screaming and chattering erse they were all without shoes and stockings which making them fearless of hurting or being hurt gave a freedom to the action of their limbs which i never saw in english children they stood upon one another body breast or face or any other part sometimes one was uppermost sometimes another and sometimes they rolled all together so that we could not know to which body this leg or that arm belonged we waited watching them till we were assured that the boatman had noticed our signalby the bye if we had received proper directions at loch lomond on our journey to loch ketterine we should have made our way down the lake till we had come opposite to the ferrymans house where there is a hut and the people who live there are accustomed to call him by the same signal as here luckily for us we were not so well instructed for we should have missed the pleasure of receiving the kindness of mr and mrs macfarlane and their family a young woman who wanted to go to the island accompanied us to the waterside the walk was pleasant through fields with hedgerows the greenest fields we had seen in scotland but we were obliged to return without going to the island the poor man had taken his boat to another place and the waters were swollen so that we could not go close to the shore and show ourselves to him nor could we make him hear by shouting on our return to the publichouse we asked the woman what we should pay her and were not a little surprised when she answered three shillings our horse had had a sixpenny feed of miserable corn not worth threepence the rest of the charge was for skimmed milk oatbread porridge and blue milk cheese we told her it was far too much and giving her halfacrown departed i was sorry she had made this unreasonable demand because we had liked the woman and we had before been so well treated in the highland cottages but on thinking more about it i satisfied myself that it was no scheme to impose upon us for she was contented with the halfcrown and would i daresay have been so with two shillings if we had offered it her at first not being accustomed to fix a price upon porridge and milk to such as we at least when we asked her she did not know what to say but seeing that we were travelling for pleasure no doubt she concluded we were rich and that what was a small gain to her could be no great loss to us when we had gone a little way we saw before us a young man with a bundle over his shoulder hung on a stick bearing a great boy on his back seeing that they were travellers we offered to take the boy on the car to which the man replied that he should be more than thankful and set him up beside me they had walked from glasgow and that morning from inverary the boy was only six years old but said his father he is a stout walker and a fine fellow he was smartly dressed in tight clean clothes and a nice round hat he was going to stay with his grandmother at dalmally i found him good company though i could not draw a single word out of him it was a pleasure to see his happiness gleaming through the shy glances of his healthy countenance passed a pretty chapel by the lakeside and an island with a farmhouse upon it and corn and pasture fields but as we went along we had frequent reason to regret the want of english hedgerows and english culture for the ground was often swampy or moorish near the lake where comfortable dwellings among green fields might have been when we came near to the end of the lake we had a steep hill to climb so william and i walked and we had such confidence in our horse that we were not afraid to leave the car to his guidance with the child in it we were soon however alarmed at seeing him trot up the hill a long way before us the child having raised himself up upon the seat was beating him as hard as he could with a little stick which he carried in his hand and when he saw our eyes were on him he sate down i believe very sorry to resign his office the horse slackened his pace and no accident happened when we had ascended halfway up the hill directed by the man i took a nearer footpath and at the top came in view of a most impressive scene a ruined castle on an island almost in the middle of the last compartment of the lake backed by a mountain cove down which came a roaring stream the castle occupied every foot of the island that was visible to us appearing to rise out of the water mists rested upon the mountain side with spots of sunshine between there was a mild desolation in the low grounds a solemn grandeur in the mountains and the castle was wild yet stately not dismantled of its turrets nor the walls broken down though completely in ruin after having stood some minutes i joined william on the high road and both wishing to stay longer near this place we requested the man to drive his little boy on to dalmally about two miles further and leave the car at the inn he told us that the ruin was called kilchurn castle that it belonged to lord breadalbane and had been built by one of the ladies of that family for her defence during her lords absence at the crusades for which purpose she levied a tax of seven years rent upon her tenants he said that from that side of the lake it did not appear in very dry weather to stand upon an island but that it was possible to go over to it without being wetshod we were very lucky in seeing it after a great flood for its enchanting effect was chiefly owing to its situation in the lake a decayed palace rising out of the plain of waters i have called it a palace for such feeling it gave to me though having been built as a place of defence a castle or fortress we turned again and reascended the hill and sate a long time in the middle of it looking on the castle and the huge mountain cove opposite and william addressing himself to the ruin poured out these verses footnote not very probablej c s footnote address to kilchurn castle upon loch aweed child of loudthroated war the mountain stream roars in thy hearing but thy hour of rest is come and thou art silent in thy age we walked up the hill again and looking down the vale had a fine view of the lake and islands resembling the views down windermere though much less rich our walk to dalmally was pleasant the vale makes a turn to the right beyond the head of the lake and the village of dalmally which is in fact only a few huts the manse or ministers house the chapel and the inn stands near the river which flows into the head of the lake the whole vale is very pleasing the lower part of the hillsides being sprinkled with thatched cottages cultivated ground in small patches near them which evidently belonged to the cottages we were overtaken by a gentleman who rode on a beautiful white pony like lilly and was followed by his servant a highland boy on another pony a little creature not much bigger than a large mastiff on which were slung a pair of crutches and a tartan plaid the gentleman entered into conversation with us and on our telling him that we were going to glen coe he advised us instead of proceeding directly to tyndrum the next stage to go round by the outlet of loch awe to loch etive and thence to glen coe we were glad to change our plan for we wanted much to see more of loch awe and he told us that the whole of the way by loch etive was pleasant and the road to tyndrum as dreary as possible indeed we could see it at that time several miles before us upon the side of a bleak mountain and he said that there was nothing but moors and mountains all the way we reached the inn a little before sunset ordered supper and i walked out crossed a bridge to look more nearly at the parsonagehouse and the chapel which stands upon a bank close to the river a pretty stream overhung in some parts by trees the vale is very pleasing but like all the other scotch vales we had yet seen it told of its kinship with the mountains and of poverty or some neglect on the part of man thursday september stwe had been attended at supper by a civil boy whom we engaged to rouse us at six oclock and to provide us each a basin of milk and bread and have the car ready all which he did punctually and we were off in good time the morning was not unpleasant though rather cold and we had some fear of rain crossed the bridge and passed by the manse and chapel our road carrying us back again in the direction we had come but on the opposite side of the river passed close to many of the houses we had seen on the hillside which the lame gentleman had told us belonged to lord breadalbane and were attached to little farms or crofts as he called them lord breadalbane had lately laid out a part of his estates in this way as an experiment in the hope of preventing discontent and emigration we were sorry we had not an opportunity of seeing into these cottages and of learning how far the people were happy or otherwise the dwellings certainly did not look so comfortable when we were near to them as from a distance but this might be chiefly owing to what the inhabitants did not feel as an evilthe dirt about the doors we saw howevera sight always painful to metwo or three women each creeping after her single cow while it was feeding on the slips of grass between the corngrounds went round the head of the lake and onwards close to the lakeside kilchurn castle was always interesting though not so grand as seen from the other side with its own mountain cove and roaring stream it combined with the vale of dalmally and the distant hillsa beautiful scene yet overspread with a gentle desolation as we went further down we lost sight of the vale of dalmally the castle which we often stopped to look back upon was very beautiful seen in combination with the opposite shore of the lakeperhaps a little bay a tuft of trees or a slope of the hill travelled under the foot of the mountain cruachan along an excellent road having the lake close to us on our left woods overhead and frequent torrents tumbling down the hills the distant views across the lake were not peculiarly interesting after we were out of sight of kilchurn castle the lake being wide and the opposite shore not rich and those mountains which we could see were not high came opposite to the village where we had dined the day before and losing sight of the body of the lake pursued the narrow channel or pass which is i believe three miles long out of which issues the river that flows into loch etive we were now enclosed between steep hills on the opposite side entirely bare on our side bare or woody the branch of the lake generally filling the whole area of the vale it was a pleasing solitary scene the long reach of naked precipices on the other side rose directly out of the water exceedingly steep not rugged or rocky but with scanty sheep pasturage and large beds of small stones purple dovecoloured or red such as are called screes in cumberland and westmoreland these beds or rather streams of stones appeared as smooth as the turf itself nay i might say as soft as the feathers of birds which they resembled in colour there was no building on either side of the water in many parts only just room for the road and on the other shore no footing as it might seem for any creature larger than the mountain sheep and they in treading amongst the shelving stones must often send them down into the lake below footnote the pass of awej c s after we had wound for some time through the valley having met neither foottraveller horse nor cart we started at the sight of a single vessel just as it turned round the point of a hill coming into the reach of the valley where we were she floated steadily through the middle of the water with one large sail spread out full swollen by the breeze that blew her right towards us i can not express what romantic images this vessel brought along with herhow much more beautiful the mountains appeared the lake how much more graceful there was one man on board who sate at the helm and he having no companion made the boat look more silent than if we could not have seen him i had almost said the ship for on that narrow water it appeared as large as the ships which i have watched sailing out of a harbour of the sea a little further on we passed a stone hut by the lakeside near which were many charcoal sacks and we conjectured that the vessel had been depositing charcoal brought from other parts of loch awe to be carried to the ironworks at loch etive a little further on we came to the end of the lake but where exactly it ended was not easy to determine for the river was as broad as the lake and we could only say when it became positively a river by the rushing of the water it is indeed a grand stream the quantity of water being very large frequently forming rapids and always flowing very quickly but its greatness is shortlived for after a course of three miles it is lost in the great waters of loch etive a sea loch crossed a bridge and climbing a hill towards taynuilt our baitingplace we saw a hollow to the right below us through which the river continued its course between rocks and steep banks of wood william turned aside to look into the dell but i was too much tired we had left it two or three hundred yards behind an open river the hills enclosing the branch of the lake having settled down into irregular slopes we were glad when we reached taynuilt a village of huts with a chapel and one stone house which was the inn it had begun to rain and i was almost benumbed with the cold besides having a bad headache so it rejoiced me to see kind looks on the landladys face and that she was willing to put herself in a bustle for our comfort we had a good fire presently and breakfast was set outeggs preserved gooseberries excellent cream cheese and butter but no wheat bread and the oaten cakes were so hard i could not chew them we wished to go upon loch etive so having desired the landlady to prepare a fowl for supper and engaged beds which she promised us willinglya proof that we were not in the great roadwe determined to find our way to the lake and endeavour to procure a boat it rained heavily but we went on hoping the sky would clear up walked through unenclosed fields a sort of halfdesolate country but when we came to the mouth of the river which issues out of loch awe and which we had to cross by a ferry looking up that river we saw that the vale down which it flowed was richly wooded and beautiful we were now among familiar fireside names we could see the town of bunawe a place of which the old woman with whom william lodged ten years at hawkshead used to tell tales half as long as an ancient romance it is a small village or port on the same side of loch etive on which we stood and at a little distance is a house built by a mr knott of coniston waterhead a partner in the ironfoundry at bunawe in the service of whose family the old woman had spent her youth it was an ugly yellowdaubed building staring this way and that but william looked at it with pleasure for poor ann tysons sake we hailed the ferryboat and a little boy came to fetch us he rowed up against the stream with all his might for a considerable way and then yielding to it the boat was shot towards the shore almost like an arrow from a bow it was pleasing to observe the dexterity with which the lad managed his oars glorying in the appearance of dangerfor he observed us watching him and afterwards while he conveyed us over his pride redoubled for my part i was completely dizzy with the swiftness of the motion footnote the village dame with whom he lived when a schoolboy at hawksheaded we could not have a boat from the ferry but were told that if we would walk to a house half a mile up the river we had a chance of getting one i went a part of the way with william and then sate down under the umbrella near some houses a woman came out to talk with me and pressed me to take shelter in her house which i refused afraid of missing william she eyed me with extreme curiosity asking fifty questions respecting the object of our journey she told me that it rained most parts of the year there and that there was no chance of fine weather that day and i believe when william came to tell me that we could have a boat she thought i was half crazed we went down to the shore of the lake and after having sate some time under a wall the boatman came to us and we went upon the water at first it did not rain heavily and the air was not cold and before we had gone far we rejoiced that we had not been fainthearted the loch is of a considerable width but the mountains are so very high that whether we were close under them or looked from one shore to the other they maintained their dignity i speak of the higher part of the loch above the town of bunawe and the large river for downwards they are but hills and the water spreads out wide towards undetermined shores on our right was the mountain cruachan rising directly from the lake and on the opposite side another mountain called ben durinish craggy and exceedingly steep with wild wood growing among the rocks and stones footnote duirinnised we crossed the water which was very rough in the middle but calmer near the shores and some of the rocky basins and little creeks among the rocks were as still as a mirror and they were so beautiful with the reflection of the orangecoloured seaweed growing on the stones or rocks that a child with a childs delight in gay colours might have danced with joy at the sight of them it never ceased raining and the tops of the mountains were concealed by mists but as long as we could see across the water we were contented for though little could be seen of the true shapes and permanent appearances of the mountains we saw enough to give us the most exquisite delight the powerful lake which filled the large vale roaring torrents clouds floating on the mountain sides sheep that pastured there seabirds and land birds we sailed a considerable way without coming to any houses or cultivated fields there was no horseroad on either side of the loch but a person on foot as the boatman told us might make his way at the foot of ben durinish namely on that side of the loch on which we were there was however not the least track to be seen and it must be very difficult and laborious we happened to say that we were going to glen coe which would be the journey of a long day and a half when one of the men pointing to the head of the loch replied that if we were there we should be but an hours walk from glen coe though it continued raining and there was no hope that the rain would cease we could not help wishing to go by that way it was an adventure we were not afraid of trusting ourselves to the hospitality of the highlanders and we wanted to give our horse a days rest his back having been galled by the saddle the owner of the boat who understood english much better than the other man his helper said he would make inquiries about the road at a farmhouse a little further on he was very ready to talk with us and was rather an interesting companion he spoke after a slow and solemn manner in book and sermon language and phrases a stately speech such as grave livers do in scotland use footnote see resolution and independence stanza xived when we came to the farmhouse of which the man had spoken william and he landed to make the necessary inquiries it was a thatched house at the foot of the high mountain ben durinisha few patches or little beds of corn belonging to it but the spot was pastoral the green grass growing to the walls of the house the dwellinghouse was distinguished from the outer buildings which were numerous making it look like two or three houses as is common in scotland by a chimney and one small window with sashpanes on one side was a little woody glen with a precipitous stream that fell into the bay which was perfectly still and bordered with the rich orangecolour reflected from the seaweed cruachan on the other side of the lake was exceedingly grand and appeared of an enormous height spreading out two large arms that made a cove down which fell many streams swoln by the rain and in the hollow of the cove were some huts which looked like a village the top of the mountain was concealed from us by clouds and the mists floated high and low upon the sides of it william came back to the boat highly pleased with the cheerful hospitality and kindness of the woman of the house who would scarcely permit him and his guide to go away without taking some refreshment she was the only person at home so they could not obtain the desired information but william had been well repaid for the trouble of landing indeed rainy as it was i regretted that i had not landed also for i should have wished to bear away in my memory a perfect image of this placethe view from the doors as well as the simple highland comforts and contrivances which were near it i think i never saw a retirement that would have so completely satisfied me if i had wanted to be altogether shut out from the world and at the same time among the grandest of the works of god but it must be remembered that mountains are often so much dignified by clouds mists and other accidents of weather that one could not know them again in the full sunshine of a summers noon but whatever the mountains may be in their own shapes the farmhouse with its pastoral grounds and corn fields won from the mountain its warm outhouses in irregular stages one above another on the side of the hill the rocks the stream and sheltering bay must at all times be interesting objects the household boat lay at anchor chained to a rock which like the whole border of the lake was edged with seaweed and some fishingnets were hung upon polesaffecting images which led our thoughts out to the wide ocean yet made these solitudes of the mountains bear the impression of greater safety and more deep seclusion the rain became so heavy that we should certainly have turned back if we had not felt more than usual courage from the pleasure we had enjoyed which raised hope where none was there were some houses a little higher up and we determined to go thither and make further inquiries we could now hardly see to the other side of the lake yet continued to go on and presently heard some people pushing through a thicket close to us on which the boatman called out theres one that can tell us something about the road to glen coe for he was born there we looked up and saw a ragged lame fellow followed by some others with a fishingrod over his shoulder and he was making such good speed through the boughs that one might have half believed he was the better for his lame leg he was the head of a company of tinkers who as the men told us travel with their fishingrods as duly as their hammers on being hailed by us the whole company stopped and their lame leader and our boatmen shouted to each other in ersea savage cry to our ears in that lonely and romantic place we could not learn from the tinker all we wished to know therefore when we came near to the houses william landed again with the owner of the boat the rain was now so heavy that we could see nothing at allnot even the houses whither william was going we had given up all thought of proceeding further at that time but were desirous to know how far that road to glen coe was practicable for us they met with an intelligent man who was at work with others in a hay field though it rained so heavily he gave them the information they desired and said that there was an acquaintance of his between that place and glen coe who he had no doubt would gladly accommodate us with lodging and anything else we might need when william returned to the boat we shaped our course back again down the water leaving the head of loch etive not only unvisited but unseento our great regret the rain was very heavy the wind had risen and both wind and tide were against us so that it was hard labour for the boatmen to push us on they kept as close to the shore as they could to be under the wind but at the doubling of many of the rocky points the tide was so strong that it was difficult to get on at all and i was sometimes afraid that we should be dashed against the rocks though i believe indeed there was not much danger came down the same side of the lake under ben durinish and landed at a ferryhouse opposite to bunawe where we gave the men a glass of whisky but our chief motive for landing was to look about the place which had a most wild aspect at that time it was a low promontory pushed far into the water narrowing the lake exceedingly in the obscurity occasioned by the mist and rain it appeared to be an island it was stained and weatherbeaten a rocky place seeming to bear no produce but such as might be cherished by cold and storms lichens or the incrustations of sea rocks we rowed right across the water to the mouth of the river of loch awe our boat following the ferryboat which was conveying the tinker crew to the other side whither they were going to lodge as the men told us in some kiln which they considered as their right and privilegea lodging always to be found where there was any arable landfor every farm has its kiln to dry the corn in another proof of the wetness of the climate the kilns are built of stone covered in and probably as good a shelter as the huts in which these highland vagrants were born they gather sticks or heather for their fire and as they are obstinate beggars for the men said they would not be denied they probably have plenty of food with little other trouble than that of wandering in search of it for their smutty faces and tinker equipage serve chiefly for a passport to a free and careless life it rained very heavily and the wind blew when we crossed the lake and their boat and ours went tilting over the high waves they made a romantic appearance three women were of the party two men rowed them over the lame fellow sate at one end of the boat and his companion at the other each with an enormous fishingrod which looked very graceful something like masts to the boat when we had landed at the other side we saw them after having begged at the ferryhouse strike merrily through the fields no doubt betaking themselves to their shelter for the night we were completely wet when we reached the inn the landlady wanted to make a fire for me upstairs but i went into her own parlour to undress and her daughter a pretty little girl who could speak a few words of english waited on me i rewarded her with one of the penny books bought at dumfries for johnny with which she was greatly delighted we had an excellent supperfresh salmon a fowl gooseberries and cream and potatoes good beds and the next morning boiled milk and bread and were only charged seven shillings and sixpence for the wholehorse liquor supper and the two breakfasts we thought they had made a mistake and told them sofor it was only just half as much as we had paid the day before at dalmally the case being that dalmally is in the main road of the tourists the landlady insisted on my bringing away a little cup instead of our tin can which she told me had been taken from the car by some children we set no little value on this cup as a memorial of the good womans honesty and kindness and hoped to have brought it home friday september nddeparted at about seven oclock this morning having to travel eight miles down loch etive and then to cross a ferry our road was at first at a considerable distance from the lake and out of sight of it among undulating hills covered with coppice woods resembling the country between coniston and windermere but it afterwards carried us close to the waters edge and in this part of our ride we were disappointed we knew that the high mountains were all at the head of the lake therefore had not expected the same awful grandeur which we beheld the day before and perceived by glimpses but the gentleman whom we met with at dalmally had told us that there were many fine situations for gentlemens seats on this part of the lake which had made us expect greater loveliness near the shores and better cultivation it is true there are pleasant bays with grounds prettily sloping to the water and coppice woods where houses would stand in shelter and sun looking on the lake but much is yet wantingwaste lands to be ploughed peatmosses drained hedgerows reared and the woods demand a grant of longer life than is now their privilege but after we had journeyed about six miles a beautiful scene opened upon us the morning had been gloomy and at this time the sun shone out scattering the clouds we looked right down the lake that was covered with streams of dazzling sunshine which revealed the indentings of the dark shores on a bold promontory on the same side of the loch where we were stood an old castle an irregular tall building not without majesty and beyond with leagues of water between our eyes settled upon the island of mull a high mountain green in the sunshine and overcast with cloudsan object as inviting to the fancy as the evening sky in the west and though of a terrestrial green almost as visionary we saw that it was an island of the sea but were unacquainted with its name it was of a gemlike colour and as soft as the sky the shores of loch etive in their moorish rocky wildness their earthly bareness as they lay in length before us produced a contrast which with the pure sea the brilliant sunshine the long distance contributed to the aÃ«rial and romantic power with which the mountain island was invested soon after we came to the ferry the boat being on the other shore we had to wait a considerable time though the water was not wide and our call was heard immediately the boatmen moved with surly tardiness as if glad to make us know that they were our masters at this point the lake was narrowed to the breadth of not a very wide river by a round ear or promontory on the side on which we were and a low ridge of peatmossy ground on the other it was a dreary place shut out from the beautiful prospect of the isle of mull and dunstaffnage castleso the fortress was called four or five men came over with the boat the horse was unyoked and being harshly driven over rough stones which were as slippery as ice with slimy seaweed he was in terror before he reached the boat and they completed the work by beating and pushing him by main force over the ridge of the boat for there was no open end or plank or any other convenience for shipping either horse or carriage i was very uneasy when we were launched on the water a blackguardlooking fellow blind of one eye which i could not but think had been put out in some strife or other held him by force like a horsebreaker while the poor creature fretted and stamped with his feet against the bare boards frightening himself more and more with every stroke and when we were in the middle of the water i would have given a thousand pounds to have been sure that we should reach the other side in safety the tide was rushing violently in making a strong eddy with the stream of the loch so that the motion of the boat and the noise and foam of the waves terrified him still more and we thought it would be impossible to keep him in the boat and when we were just far enough from the shore to have been all drowned he became furious and plunging desperately his hindlegs were in the water then recovering himself he beat with such force against the boatside that we were afraid he should send his feet through all the while the men were swearing terrible oaths and cursing the poor beast redoubling their curses when we reached the landingplace and whipping him ashore in brutal triumph we had only room for half a heartful of joy when we set foot on dry land for another ferry was to be crossed five miles further we had intended breakfasting at this house if it had been a decent place but after this affair we were glad to pay the men off and depart though i was not well and needed refreshment the people made us more easy by assuring us that we might easily swim the horse over the next ferry the first mile or two of our road was over a peatmoss we then came near to the seashore and had beautiful views backwards towards the island of mull and dunstaffnage castle and forward where the sea ran up between the hills in this part on the opposite side of the small bay or elbow of the sea was a gentlemans house on a hillside and a building on the hilltop which we took for a lighthouse but were told that it belonged to the mansion and was only lighted up on rejoicing daysthe lairds birthday for instance footnote lochnell housej c s before we had left the peatmoss to travel close to the seashore we delighted ourselves with looking on a range of green hills in shape like those bordering immediately upon the sea abrupt but not high they were in fact a continuation of the same but retiring backwards and rising from the black peatmoss these hills were of a delicate green uncommon in scotland a foaming rivulet ran down one part and near it lay two herdsmen full in the sun with their dogs among a troop of black cattle which were feeding near and sprinkled over the whole range of hillsa pastoral scene to our eyes the more beautiful from knowing what a delightful prospect it must overlook we now came under the steeps by the seaside which were bold rocks mouldering scars or fresh with green grass under the brow of one of these rocks was a buryingground with many upright gravestones and haycocks between and fenced round by a wall neatly sodded near it were one or two houses with outhouses under a group of trees but no chapel the neatness of the buryingground would in itself have been noticeable in any part of scotland where we have been but it was more interesting from its situation than for its own sakewithin the sound of the gentlest waves of the sea and near so many quiet and beautiful objects there was a range of hills opposite which we were here first told were the hills of morven so much sung of by ossian we consulted with some men respecting the ferry who advised us by all means to send our horse round the loch and go ourselves over in the boat they were very civil and seemed to be intelligent men yet all disagreed about the length of the loch though we were not two miles from it one said it was only six miles long another ten or fifteen and afterwards a man whom we met told us it was twenty we lost sight of the sea for some time crossing a halfcultivated space then reached loch creran a large irregular sea loch with low sloping banks coppice woods and uncultivated grounds with a scattering of corn fields as it appeared to us very thinly inhabited mountains at a distance we found only women at home at the ferryhouse i was faint and cold and went to sit by the fire but though very much needing refreshment i had not heart to eat anything therethe house was so dirty and there were so many wretchedly dirty women and children yet perhaps i might have got over the dirt though i believe there are few ladies who would not have been turned sick by it if there had not been a most disgusting combination of laziness and coarseness in the countenances and manners of the women though two of them were very handsome it was a small hut and four women were living in it one the mother of the children and mistress of the house the others i supposed to be lodgers or perhaps servants but there was no work amongst them they had just taken from the fire a great pan full of potatoes which they mixed up with milk all helping themselves out of the same vessel and the little children put in their dirty hands to dig out of the mess at their pleasure i thought to myself how light the labour of such a house as this little sweeping no washing of floors and as to scouring the table i believe it was a thing never thought of after a long time the ferryman came home but we had to wait yet another hour for the tide in the meanwhile our horse took fright in consequence of his terror at the last ferry ran away with the car and dashed out umbrellas greatcoats etc but luckily he was stopped before any serious mischief was done we had determined whatever it cost not to trust ourselves with him again in the boat but sending him round the lake seemed almost out of the question there being no road and probably much difficulty in going round with a horse so after some deliberation with the ferryman it was agreed that he should swim over the usual place of ferrying was very broad but he was led to the point of a peninsula at a little distance it being an unusual affairindeed the people of the house said that he was the first horse that had ever swum overwe had several men on board and the mistress of the house offered herself as an assistant we supposed for the sake of a share in eighteenpennyworth of whisky which her husband called for without ceremony and of which she and the young lasses who had helped to push the boat into the water partook as freely as the men at first i feared for the horse he was frightened and strove to push himself under the boat but i was soon tolerably easy for he went on regularly and well and after from six to ten minutes swimming landed in safety on the other side poor creature he stretched out his nostrils and stared wildly while the man was trotting him about to warm him and when he put him into the car he was afraid of the sound of the wheels for some time our road was up a glen the banks chiefly covered with coppice woods an unpeopled but though without grandeur not a dreary tract came to a moor and descended into a broad vale which opened to loch linnhe an arm of the sea the prospect being shut in by high mountains on which the sun was shining among mists and resting clouds a village and chapel stood on the opposite hill the hills sloped prettily down to the bed of the vale a large level areathe grounds in general cultivated but not rich we went perhaps half a mile down the vale when our road struck right across it towards the village on the hillside we overtook a tall welllooking man seemingly about thirty years of age driving a cart of whom we inquired concerning the road and the distance to portnacroish our baitingplace we made further inquiries respecting our future journey which he answered in an intelligent manner being perfectly acquainted with the geography of scotland he told us that the village which we saw before us and the whole tract of country was called appin william said that it was a pretty wild place to which the man replied sir it is a very bonny place if you did but see it on a fine day mistaking williams praise for a halfcensure i must say however that we hardly ever saw a thoroughly pleasing place in scotland which had not something of wildness in its aspect of one sort or other it came from many causes here the sea or sealoch of which we only saw as it were a glimpse crossing the vale at the foot of it the high mountains on the opposite shore the unenclosed hills on each side of the vale with black cattle feeding on them the simplicity of the scattered huts the halfsheltered halfexposed situation of the village the imperfect culture of the fields the distance from any city or large town and the very names of morven and appin particularly at such a time when old ossians old friends sunbeams and mists as like ghosts as any in the midafternoon could be were keeping company with them william did all he could to efface the unpleasant impression he had made on the highlander and not without success for he was kind and communicative when we walked up the hill towards the village he had been a great traveller in ireland and elsewhere but i believe that he had visited no place so beautiful to his eyes as his native home the strath of appin under the heathy hills we arrived at portnacroish soon after parting from this man it is a small villagea few huts and an indifferent inn by the side of the loch ordered a fowl for dinner had a fire lighted and went a few steps from the door up the road and turning aside into a field stood at the top of a low eminence from which looking down the loch to the sea through a long vista of hills and mountains we beheld one of the most delightful prospects that even when we dream of fairer worlds than this it is possible for us to conceive in our hearts a covering of clouds rested on the long range of the hills of morven mists floated very near to the water on their sides and were slowly shifting about yet the sky was clear and the sea from the reflection of the sky of an ethereal or sapphire blue which was intermingled in many places and mostly by gentle gradations with beds of bright dazzling sunshine green islands lay on the calm water islands far greener for so it seemed than the grass of other places and from their excessive beauty their unearthly softness and the great distance of many of them they made us think of the islands of the blessed in the vision of mirzaa resemblance more striking from the long tract of mist which rested on the top of the steeps of morven the view was endless and though not so wide had something of the intricacy of the islands and water of loch lomond as we saw them from inchtavannach and yet how different at loch lomond we could never forget that it was an inland lake of fresh water nor here that it was the sea itself though among multitudes of hills immediately below us on an island a few yards from the shore stood an old keep or fortress the vale of appin opened to the waterside with cultivated fields and cottages if there were trees near the shore they contributed little to the delightful effect of the scene it was the immeasurable water the lofty mistcovered steeps of morven to the right the emerald islands without a bush or tree the celestial colour and brightness of the calm sea and the innumerable creeks and bays the communion of land and water as far as the eye could travel my description must needs be languid for the sight itself was too fair to be remembered we sate a long time upon the hill and pursued our journey at about four oclock had an indifferent dinner but the cheese was so excellent that william wished to buy the remainder but the woman would not consent to sell it and forced us to accept a large portion of it footnote castle stalkerj c s we had to travel up the loch leaving behind us the beautiful scene which we had viewed with such delight before dinner often while we were climbing the hill did we stop to look back and when we had gone twenty or thirty yards beyond the point where we had the last view of it we left the car to the care of some children who were coming from school and went to take another farewell always in the hope of bearing away a more substantial remembrance travelled for some miles along a road which was so smooth it was more like a gravel walk in a gentlemans grounds than a public highway probably the country is indebted for this excellent road to lord tweeddale now a prisoner in france his house stands upon an eminence within a mile of portnacroish commanding the same prospect which i have spoken of except that it must lose something in not having the old fortress at the foot of itindeed it is not to be seen at all from the house or grounds footnote george seventh marquis of tweeddale being in france in was detained by bonaparte and died at verdun th august j c s we travelled under steep hills stony or smooth with coppicewoods and patches of cultivated land and houses here and there and at every hundred yards i may almost venture to say a streamlet narrow as a ribbon came tumbling down and crossing our road fell into the lake below on the opposite shore the hillsnamely the continuation of the hills of morvenwere stern and severe rising like upright walls from the waters edge and in colour more resembling rocks than hills as they appeared to us we did not see any house or any place where it was likely a house could stand for many miles but as the loch was broad we could not perhaps distinguish the objects thoroughly a little after sunset our road led us from the vale of the loch we came to a small river a bridge a mill and some cottages at the foot of a hill and close to the loch did not cross the bridge but went up the brook having it on our left and soon found ourselves in a retired valley scattered over with many grey huts and surrounded on every side by green hills the hay grounds in the middle of the vale were unenclosed which was enough to keep alive the scottish wildness here blended with exceeding beauty for there were trees growing irregularly or in clumps all through the valley rocks or stones here and there which with the people at work haycocks sprinkled over the fields made the vale look full and populous it was a sweet time of the evening the moon was up but there was yet so much of day that her light was not perceived our road was through open fields the people suspended their work as we passed along and leaning on their pitchforks or rakes with their arms at their sides or hanging down some in one way some in another and no two alike they formed most beautiful groups the outlines of their figures being much more distinct than by day and all that might have been harsh or unlovely softened down the dogs were as usual attendant on their masters and watching after us they barked aloud yet even their barking hardly disturbed the quiet of the place i can not say how long this vale was it made the larger half of a circle or a curve deeper than that of half a circle before it opened again upon the loch it was less thoroughly cultivated and woody after the last turningthe hills steep and lofty we met a very tall stout man a fine figure in a highland bonnet with a little girl driving home their cow he accosted us saying that we were late travellers and that we had yet four miles to go before we should reach ballachulisha long way uncertain as we were respecting our accommodations he told us that the vale was called the strath of duror and when we said it was a pretty place he answered indeed it was and that they lived very comfortably there for they had a good master lord tweeddale whose imprisonment he lamented speaking earnestly of his excellent qualities at the end of the vale we came close upon a large bay of the loch formed by a rocky hill a continuation of the ridge of high hills on the left side of the strath making a very grand promontory under which was a hamlet a cluster of huts at the waters edge with their little fleet of fishingboats at anchor and behind among the rocks a hundred slips of corn slips and patches often no bigger than a garden such as a child eight years old would make for sport it might have been the work of a small colony from china there was something touching to the heart in this appearance of scrupulous industry and excessive labour of the soil in a country where hills and mountains and even valleys are left to the care of nature and the pleasure of the cattle that feed among them it was indeed a very interesting place the more so being in perfect contrast with the few houses at the entrance of the stratha sea hamlet without trees under a naked stony mountain yet perfectly sheltered standing in the middle of a large bay which half the winds that travel over the lake can never visit the other a little bowery spot with its river bridge and mill might have been a hundred miles from the seaside the moon was now shining and though it reminded us how far the evening was advanced we stopped for many minutes before we could resolve to go on we saw nothing stirring neither men women nor cattle but the linen was still bleaching by the stony rivulet which ran near the houses in waterbreaks and tiny cataracts for the first half mile after we had left this scene there was nothing remarkable and afterwards we could only see the hills the sky the moon and moonlight water when we came within it might be half a mile of ballachulish the place where we were to lodge the loch narrowed very much the hills still continuing high i speak inaccurately for it split into two divisions the one along which we went being called loch leven the road grew very bad and we had an anxious journey till we saw a light before us which with great joy we assured ourselves was from the inn but what was our distress when on going a few steps further we came to a bridge half broken down with bushes laid across to prevent travellers from going over after some perplexity we determined that i should walk on to the house before usfor we could see that the bridge was safe for footpassengersand ask for assistance by great good luck at this very moment four or five men came along the road towards us and offered to help william in driving the car through the water which was not very deep at that time though only a few days before the damage had been done to the bridge by a flood i walked on to the inn ordered tea and was conducted into a lodgingroom i desired to have a fire and was answered with the old scruple about giving firewith at the same time an excuse that it was so latethe girl however would ask the landlady who was lyingin the fire was brought immediately and from that time the girl was very civil i was not however quite at ease for william stayed long and i was going to leave my fire to seek after him when i heard him at the door with the horse and car the horse had taken fright with the roughness of the riverbed and the rattling of the wheelsthe second fright in consequence of the ferryand the men had been obliged to unyoke him and drag the car through a troublesome affair for william but he talked less of the trouble and alarm than of the pleasure he had felt in having met with such true goodwill and ready kindness in the highlanders they drank their glass of whisky at the door wishing william twenty good wishes and asking him twice as many questionsif he was married if he had an estate where he lived etc etc this inn is the ferryhouse on the main road up into the highlands by fortwilliam and here coleridge though unknown to us had slept three nights before saturday september rdwhen we have arrived at an unknown place by moonlight it is never a moment of indifference when i quit it again with the morning light especially if the objects have appeared beautiful or in any other way impressive or interesting i have kept back unwilling to go to the window that i might not lose the picture taken to my pillow at night so it was at ballachulish and instantly i felt that the passing away of my own fancies was a loss the place had appeared exceedingly wild by moonlight i had mistaken cornfields for naked rocks and the lake had appeared narrower and the hills more steep and lofty than they really were we rose at six oclock and took a basin of milk before we set forward on our journey to glen coe it was a delightful morning the road excellent and we were in good spirits happy that we had no more ferries to cross and pleased with the thought that we were going among the grand mountains which we saw before us at the head of the loch we travelled close to the waters edge and were rolling along a smooth road when the horse suddenly backed frightened by the upright shafts of a roller rising from behind the wall of a field adjoining the road william pulled whipped and struggled in vain we both leapt upon the ground and the horse dragged the car after him he going backwards down the bank of the loch and it was turned over half in the water the horse lying on his back struggling in the harness a frightful sight i gave up everything thought that the horse would be lamed and the car broken to pieces luckily a man came up in the same moment and assisted william in extricating the horse and after an hours delay with the help of strings and pockethandkerchiefs we mended the harness and set forward again william leading the poor animal all the way for the regular beating of the waves frightened him and any little gushing stream that crossed the road would have sent him off the village where the blacksmith lived was before usa few huts under the mountains and as it seemed at the head of the loch but it runs further up to the left being narrowed by a hill above the village near which at the edge of the water was a slate quarry and many large boats with masts on the water below high mountains shutting in the prospect which stood in single distinguishable shapes yet clustered togethersimple and bold in their forms and their surfaces of all characters and all colourssome that looked as if scarified by fire others green and there was one that might have been blasted by an eternal frost its summit and sides for a considerable way down being as white as hoarfrost at eight oclock on a winters morning no clouds were on the hills the sun shone bright but the wind blew fresh and cold when we reached the blacksmiths shop i left william to help to take care of the horse and went into the house the mistress with a child in her arms and two or three running about received me very kindly making many apologies for the dirty house which she partly attributed to its being saturday but i could plainly see that it was dirt of all days i sat in the midst of it with great delight for the womans benevolent happy countenance almost converted her slovenly and lazy way of leaving all things to take care of themselves into a comfort and a blessing it was not a highland hut but a slated house built by the master of the quarry for the accommodation of his blacksmiththe shell of an english cottage as if left unfinished by the workmen without plaster and with floor of mud two beds with not overclean bedclothes were in the room luckily for me there was a good fire and a boiling kettle the woman was very sorry she had no butter none was to be had in the village she gave me oaten and barley bread we talked over the fire i answered her hundred questions and in my turn put some to her she asked me as usual if i was married how many brothers i had etc etc i told her that william was married and had a fine boy to which she replied and the mans a decent man too her nextdoor neighbour came in with a baby on her arm to request that i would accept of some fish which i broiled in the ashes she joined in our conversation but with more shyness than her neighbour being a very young woman she happened to say that she was a stranger in that place and had been bred and born a long way off on my asking her where she replied at leadhills and when i told her that i had been there a joy lighted up her countenance which i shall never forget and when she heard that it was only a fortnight before her eyes filled with tears i was exceedingly affected with the simplicity of her manners her tongue was now let loose and she would have talked for ever of leadhills of her mother of the quietness of the people in general and the goodness of mrs otto who she told me was a varra discreet woman she was sure we should be well put up at mrs ottos and praised her house and furniture indeed it seemed she thought all earthly comforts were gathered together under the bleak heights that surround the villages of wanlockhead and leadhills and afterwards when i said it was a wild country thereabouts she even seemed surprised and said it was not half so wild as where she lived now one circumstance which she mentioned of mrs otto i must record both in proof of her discretion and the sobriety of the people at leadhills namely that no liquor was ever drunk in her house after a certain hour of the nighti have forgotten what hour but it was an early one i am sure not later than ten the blacksmith who had come in to his breakfast was impatient to finish our job that he might go out into the hayfield for it being a fine day every plot of hayground was scattered over with haymakers on my saying that i guessed much of their hay must be spoiled he told me no for that they had high winds which dried it quicklythe people understood the climate were clever at the work and got it in with a blink he hastily swallowed his breakfast dry bread and a basin of weak tea without sugar and held his baby on his knee till he had done the women and i were again left to the fireside and there were no limits to their joy in me for they discovered another bond of connexion i lived in the same part of england from which mr rose the superintendent of the slatequarries and his wife had come oh said mrs stuartso her neighbour called her they not giving each other their christian names as is common in cumberland and westmorelandoh said she what would not i give to see anybody that came from within four or five miles of leadhills they both exclaimed that i must see mrs rose she would make much of meshe would have given me tea and bread and butter and a good breakfast i learned from the two women mrs stuart and mrs duncanso the other was calledthat stuart had come from leadhills for the sake of better wages to take the place of duncan who had resigned his office of blacksmith to the quarries as far as i could learn in a pet intending to go to america that his wife was averse to go and that the scheme for this cause and through other difficulties had been given up he appeared to be a goodtempered man and made us a most reasonable charge for mending the car his wife told me that they must give up the house in a short time to the other blacksmith she did not know whither they should go but her husband being a good workman could find employment anywhere she hurried me out to introduce me to mrs rose who was at work in the hayfield she was exceedingly glad to see one of her countrywomen and entreated that i would go up to her house it was a substantial plain house that would have held halfadozen of the common huts she conducted me into a sittingroom upstairs and set before me red and white wine with the remnant of a loaf of wheaten bread which she took out of a cupboard in the sittingroom and some delicious butter she was a healthy and cheerfullooking woman dressed like one of our country lasses and had certainly had no better education than peggy ashburner but she was as a chief in this secluded place a madam of the village and seemed to be treated with the utmost respect in our way to and from the house we met several people who interchanged friendly greetings with her but always as with one greatly superior she attended me back to the blacksmiths and would not leave me till she had seen us set forward again on our journey mrs duncan and mrs stuart shook me cordially nay affectionately by the hand i tried to prevail upon the former who had been my hostess to accept of some money but in vain she would not take a farthing and though i told her it was only to buy something for her little daughter even seemed grieved that i should think it possible i forgot to mention that while the blacksmith was repairing the car we walked to the slatequarry where we saw again some of the kind creatures who had helped us in our difficulties the night before the hovel under which they split their slates stood upon an outjutting rock a part of the quarry rising immediately out of the water and commanded a fine prospect down the loch below ballachulish and upwards towards the grand mountains and the other horn of the vale where the lake was concealed the blacksmith drove our car about a mile of the road we then hired a man and horse to take me and the car to the top of glen coe being afraid that if the horse backed or took fright we might be thrown down some precipice but before we departed we could not resist our inclination to climb up the hill which i have mentioned as appearing to terminate the loch the mountains though inferior to those of glen coe on the other side are very majestic and the solitude in which we knew the unseen lake was bedded at their feet was enough to excite our longings we climbed steep after steep far higher than they appeared to us and i was going to give up the accomplishment of our aim when a glorious sight on the mountain before us made me forget my fatigue a slight shower had come on its skirts falling upon us and half the opposite side of the mountain was wrapped up in rainbow light covered as by a veil with one dilated rainbow so it continued for some minutes and the shower and rainy clouds passed away as suddenly as they had come and the sun shone again upon the tops of all the hills in the meantime we reached the wishedfor point and saw to the head of the loch perhaps it might not be so beautiful as we had imaged it in our thoughts but it was beautiful enough not to disappoint usa narrow deep valley a perfect solitude without house or hut one of the hills was thinly sprinkled with scotch firs which appeared to be the survivors of a large forest they were the first natural wild scotch firs we had seen though thinned of their numbers and left comparatively to a helpless struggle with the elements we were much struck with the gloom and even grandeur of the trees hastened back again to join the car but were tempted to go a little out of our way to look at a nice white house belonging to the laird of glen coe which stood sweetly in a green field under the hill near some tall trees and coppice woods at this house the horrible massacre of glen coe began which we did not know when we were there but the house must have been rebuilt since that time we had a delightful walk through fields among copses and by a riverside we could have fancied ourselves in some part of the north of england unseen before it was so much like it and yet so different i must not forget one place on the opposite side of the water where we longed to livea snug white house on the mountainside surrounded by its own green fields and woods the high mountain above the loch below and inaccessible but by means of boats a beautiful spot indeed it was but in the retired parts of scotland a comfortable white house is itself such a pleasant sight that i believe without our knowing how or why it makes us look with a more loving eye on the fields and trees than for their own sakes they deserve at about one oclock we set off william on our own horse and i with my highland driver he was perfectly acquainted with the country being a sort of carrier or carriermerchant or shopkeeper going frequently to glasgow with his horse and cart to fetch and carry goods and merchandise he knew the name of every hill almost every rock and i made good use of his knowledge but partly from laziness and still more because it was inconvenient i took no notes and now i am little better for what he told me he spoke english tolerably but seldom understood what was said to him without a whats your wull we turned up to the right and were at the foot of the glenthe lairds house can not be said to be in the glen the afternoon was delightfulthe sun shone the mountaintops were clear the lake glittered in the great vale behind us and the stream of glen coe flowed down to it glittering among aldertrees the meadows of the glen were of the freshest green one newbuilt stone house in the first reach some huts hillocks covered with wood aldertrees scattered all over looking backward we were reminded of patterdale and the head of ulswater but forward the greatness of the mountains overcame every other idea the impression was as we advanced up to the head of this first reach as if the glen were nothing its loneliness and retirementas if it made up no part of my feeling the mountains were all in all that which fronted usi have forgotten its namewas exceedingly lofty the surface stony nay the whole mountain was one mass of stone wrinkled and puckered up together at the second and last reachfor it is not a winding valeit makes a quick turning almost at right angles to the first and now we are in the depths of the mountains no trees in the glen only green pasturage for sheep and here and there a plot of hayground and something that tells of former cultivation i observed this to the guide who said that formerly the glen had had many inhabitants and that there as elsewhere in the highlands there had been a great deal of corn where now the lands were left waste and nothing fed upon them but cattle i can not attempt to describe the mountains i can only say that i thought those on our rightfor the other side was only a continued high ridge or craggy barrier broken along the top into petty spiral formswere the grandest i had ever seen it seldom happens that mountains in a very clear air look exceedingly high but these though we could see the whole of them to their very summits appeared to me more majestic in their own nakedness than our imaginations could have conceived them to be had they been half hidden by clouds yet showing some of their highest pinnacles they were such forms as milton might be supposed to have had in his mind when he applied to satan that sublime expression his stature reached the sky the first division of the glen as i have said was scattered over with rocks trees and woody hillocks and cottages were to be seen here and there the second division is bare and stony huge mountains on all sides with a slender pasturage in the bottom of the valley and towards the head of it is a small lake or tarn and near the tarn a single inhabited dwelling and some unfenced haygrounda simple impressive scene our road frequently crossed large streams of stones left by the mountaintorrents losing all appearance of a road after we had passed the tarn the glen became less interesting or rather the mountains from the manner in which they are looked at but again a little higher up they resume their grandeur the river is for a short space hidden between steep rocks we left the road and going to the top of one of the rocks saw it foaming over stones or lodged in dark black dens birchtrees grew on the inaccessible banks and a few old scotch firs towered above them at the entrance of the glen the mountains had been all without trees but here the birches climb very far up the side of one of them opposite to us half concealing a rivulet which came tumbling down as white as snow from the very top of the mountain leaving the rock we ascended a hill which terminated the glen we often stopped to look behind at the majestic company of mountains we had left before us was no single paramount eminence but a mountain waste mountain beyond mountain and a barren hollow or basin into which we were descending we parted from our companion at the door of a whisky hovel a building which when it came out of the workmens hands with its unglassed windows would in that forlorn region have been little better than a howling place for the winds and was now half unroofed on seeing a smoke i exclaimed is it possible any people can live there when at least half a dozen men women and children came to the door they were about to rebuild the hut and i suppose that they or some other poor creatures would dwell there through the winter dealing out whisky to the starved travellers the sun was now setting the air very cold the sky clear i could have fancied that it was wintertime with hard frost our guide pointed out kings house to us our restingplace for the night we could just distinguish the house at the bottom of the moorish hollow or basini call it so for it was nearly as broad as longlying before us with three miles of naked road winding through it every foot of which we could see the road was perfectly white making a dreary contrast with the ground which was of a dull earthy brown long as the line of road appeared before us we could scarcely believe it to be three milesi suppose owing to its being unbroken by any one object and the moor naked as the road itself but we found it the longest three miles we had yet travelled for the surface was so stony we had to walk most of the way the house looked respectable at a distancea large square building cased in blue slates to defend it from stormsbut when we came close to it the outside forewarned us of the poverty and misery within scarce a blade of grass could be seen growing upon the open ground the heathplant itself found no nourishment there appearing as if it had but sprung up to be blighted there was no enclosure for a cow no appropriated ground but a small plot like a churchyard in which were a few starveling dwarfish potatoes which had no doubt been raised by means of the dung left by travellers horses they had not come to blossoming and whether they would either yield fruit or blossom i know not the first thing we saw on entering the door was two sheep hung up as if just killed from the barren moor their bones hardly sheathed in flesh after we had waited a few minutes looking about for a guide to lead us into some corner of the house a woman seemingly about forty years old came to us in a great bustle screaming in erse with the most horrible guineahen or peacock voice i ever heard first to one person then another she could hardly spare time to show us upstairs for crowds of men were in the housedrovers carriers horsemen travellers all of whom she had to provide with supper and she was as she told us the only woman there never did i see such a miserable such a wretched placelong rooms with ranges of beds no other furniture except benches or perhaps one or two crazy chairs the floors far dirtier than an ordinary house could be if it were never washedas dirty as a house after a sale on a rainy day and the rooms being large and the walls naked they looked as if more than half the goods had been sold out we sate shivering in one of the large rooms for threequarters of an hour before the woman could find time to speak to us again she then promised a fire in another room after two travellers who were going a stage further had finished their whisky and said we should have supper as soon as possible she had no eggs no milk no potatoes no loafbread or we should have preferred tea with length of time the fire was kindled and after another hours waiting supper camea shoulder of mutton so hard that it was impossible to chew the little flesh that might be scraped off the bones and some sorry soup made of barley and water for it had no other taste after supper the woman having first asked if we slept on blankets brought in two pair of sheets which she begged that i would air by the fire for they would be dirtied belowstairs i was very willing but behold the sheets were so wet that it would have been at least a twohours job before a far better fire than could be mustered at kings housefor that nothing might be wanting to make it a place of complete starvation the peats were not dry and if they had not been helped out by decayed wood dug out of the earth along with them we should have had no fire at all the woman was civil in her fierce wild way she and the house upon that desolate and extensive wild and everything we saw made us think of one of those places of rendezvous which we read of in novelsferdinand count fathom or gil blaswhere there is one woman to receive the booty and prepare the supper at night she told us that she was only a servant but that she had now lived there five years and that when but a young lassie she had lived there also we asked her if she had always served the same master nay nay many masters for they were always changing i verily believe that the woman was attached to the place like a cat to the empty house when the family who brought her up are gone to live elsewhere the sheets were so long in drying that it was very late before we went to bed we talked over our days adventures by the fireside and often looked out of the window towards a huge pyramidal mountain at the entrance of glen coe all between the dreary waste was clear almost as sky the moon shining full upon it a rivulet ran amongst stones near the house and sparkled with light i could have fancied that there was nothing else in that extensive circuit over which we looked that had the power of motion footnote buchail the shepherd of etivej c s in comparing the impressions we had received at glen coe we found that though the expectations of both had been far surpassed by the grandeur of the mountains we had upon the whole both been disappointed and from the same cause we had been prepared for images of terror had expected a deep denlike valley with overhanging rocks such as william has described in these lines speaking of the alps brook and road were fellowtravellers in this gloomy pass and with them did we journey several hours at a slow step the immeasurable height of woods decaying never to be decayed the stationary blasts of waterfalls and everywhere along the hollow rent winds thwarting winds bewilderd and forlorn the torrents shooting from the clear blue sky the rocks that mutterd close upon our ears black drizzling crags that spake by the wayside as if a voice were in them the sick sight and giddy prospect of the raving stream the unfetterd clouds and region of the heavens tumult and peace the darkness and the light were all like workings of one mind the features of the same face blossoms upon one tree characters of the great apocalypse the types and symbols of eternity of first and last and midst and without end footnote see the simplon pass in poetical works vol ii p ed the place had nothing of this character the glen being open to the eye of day the mountains retiring in independent majesty even in the upper part of it where the stream rushed through the rocky chasm it was but a deep trench in the vale not the vale itself and could only be seen when we were close to it fourth week sunday september thwe had desired to be called at six oclock and rose at the first summons our beds had proved better than we expected and we had not slept ill but poor coleridge had passed a wretched night here four days before this we did not know but since when he told us of it the notion of what he must have suffered with the noise of drunken people about his ears all night himself sick and tired has made our discomfort cling to my memory and given these recollections a twofold interest i asked if it was possible to have a couple of eggs boiled before our departure the woman hesitated she thought i might and sent a boy into the outhouses to look about who brought in one egg after long searching early as we had risen it was not very early when we set off for everything at kings house was in unisonequally uncomfortable as the woman had told us the night before they had no hay and that was a loss there were neither stalls nor bedding in the stable so that william was obliged to watch the horse while it was feeding for there were several others in the stable all standing like wild beasts ready to devour each others portion of corn this with the slowness of the servant and other hindrances took up much time and we were completely starved for the morning was very cold as i believe all the mornings in that desolate place are when we had gone about a quarter of a mile i recollected that i had left the little cup given me by the kind landlady at taynuilt which i had intended that john should hereafter drink out of in memory of our wanderings i would have turned back for it but william pushed me on unwilling that we should lose so much time though indeed he was as sorry to part with it as myself our road was over a hill called the black mount for the first mile or perhaps more after we left kings house we ascended on foot then came upon a new road one of the finest that was ever trod and as we went downwards almost all the way afterwards we travelled very quickly the motion was pleasant the different reaches and windings of the road were amusing the sun shone the mountaintops were clear and cheerful and we in good spirits in a bustle of enjoyment though there never was a more desolate region mountains behind before and on every side i do not remember to have seen either patch of grass flower or flowering heather within three or four miles of kings house the low ground was not rocky but black and full of white frostbleached stones the prospect only varied by pools seen everywhere both near and at a distance as far as the ground stretched out below us these were interesting spots round which the mind assembled living objects and they shone as bright as mirrors in the forlorn waste we passed neither tree nor shrub for milesi include the whole space from glen coeyet we saw perpetually traces of a long decayed forest pieces of black mouldering wood through such a country as this we had travelled perhaps seven and a half miles this morning when after descending a hill we turned to the right and saw an unexpected sight in the moorland hollow into which we were entering a small lake bounded on the opposite side by a grove of scotch firs two or three cottages at the head of it and a lot of cultivated ground with scattered haycocks the road along which we were going after having made a curve considerably above the tarn was seen winding through the trees on the other side a beautiful object and luckily for us a drove of cattle happened to be passing there at the very time a stream coursing the road with offstragglers to the borders of the lake and under the trees on the sloping ground in conning over our many wanderings i shall never forget the gentle pleasure with which we greeted the lake of inveroran and its few grey cottages we suffered our horse to slacken his pace having now no need of the comfort of quick motion though we were glad to think that one of those cottages might be the publichouse where we were to breakfast a forestnow as it appeared dwindled into the small grove bordering the lakehad not many years ago spread to that side of the vale where we were large stumps of trees which had been cut down were yet remaining undecayed and there were some single trees left alive as if by their battered black boughs to tell us of the storms that visit the valley which looked now so sober and peaceful when we arrived at the huts one of them proved to be the inn a thatched house without a signboard we were kindly received had a fire lighted in the parlour and were in such good humour that we seemed to have a thousand comforts about us but we had need of a little patience in addition to this good humour before breakfast was brought and at last it proved a disappointment the butter not eatable the barleycakes fusty the oatbread so hard i could not chew it and there were only four eggs in the house which they had boiled as hard as stones before we had finished breakfast two foottravellers came in and seated themselves at our table one of them was returning after a long absence to fortwilliam his native home he had come from egypt and many years ago had been on a recruiting party at penrith and knew many people there he seemed to think his own country but a dismal land there being no bell in the parlour i had occasion to go several times and ask for what we wanted in the kitchen and i would willingly have given twenty pounds to have been able to take a lively picture of it about seven or eight travellers probably drovers with as many dogs were sitting in a complete circle round a large peatfire in the middle of the floor each with a mess of porridge in a wooden vessel upon his knee a pot suspended from one of the black beams was boiling on the fire two or three women pursuing their household business on the outside of the circle children playing on the floor there was nothing uncomfortable in this confusion happy busy or vacant faces all looked pleasant and even the smoky air being a sort of natural indoor atmosphere of scotland served only to give a softening i may say harmony to the whole we departed immediately after breakfast our road leading us as i have said near the lakeside and through the grove of firs which extended backward much further than we had imagined after we had left it we came again among bare moorish wastes as before under the mountains so that inveroran still lives in our recollection as a favoured place a flower in the desert descended upon the whole i believe very considerably in our way to tyndrum but it was a road of long ups and downs over hills and through hollows of uncultivated ground a chance farm perhaps once in three miles a glittering rivulet bordered with greener grass than grew on the broad waste or a broken fringe of alders or birches partly concealing and partly pointing out its course arrived at tyndrum at about two oclock it is a cold spot though as i should suppose situated lower than inveroran and though we saw it in the hottest time of the afternoon sun it had a far colder aspect from the want of trees we were here informed that coleridge who we supposed was gone to edinburgh had dined at this very house a few days before in his road to fortwilliam by the help of the cook who was called in the landlady made out the very day it was the day after we parted from him as she expressed it the day after the great speet namely the great rain we had a moorfowl and muttonchops for dinner well cooked and a reasonable charge the house was clean for a scotch inn and the people about the doors were well dressed in one of the parlours we saw a company of nine or ten with the landlady seated round a plentiful tablea sight which made us think of the fatted calf in the alehouse pictures of the prodigal son there seemed to be a whole harvest of meats and drinks and there was something of festivity and picturelike gaiety even in the freshcoloured dresses of the people and their sunday faces the white tablecloth glasses english dishes etc were all in contrast with what we had seen at inveroran the places were but about nine miles asunder both among hills the rank of the people little different and each house appeared to be a house of plenty we were i think better pleased with our treatment at this inn than any of the lonely houses on the road except taynuilt but coleridge had not fared so well and was dissatisfied as he has since told us and the two travellers who breakfasted with us at inveroran had given a bad account of the house left tyndrum at about five oclock a gladsome afternoon the road excellent and we bowled downwards through a pleasant vale though not populous or well cultivated or woody but enlivened by a river that glittered as it flowed on the side of a sunny hill a knot of men and women were gathered together at a preaching we passed by many droves of cattle and shetland ponies which accident stamped a character upon places else unrememberablenot an individual character but the soul the spirit and solitary simplicity of many a highland region we had about eleven miles to travel before we came to our lodging and had gone five or six almost always descending and still in the same vale when we saw a small lake before us after the vale had made a bending to the left it was about sunset when we came up to the lake the afternoon breezes had died away and the water was in perfect stillness one grovelike island with a ruin that stood upon it overshadowed by the trees was reflected on the water this building which on that beautiful evening seemed to be wrapped up in religious quiet we were informed had been raised for defence by some highland chieftain all traces of strength or war or danger are passed away and in the mood in which we were we could only look upon it as a place of retirement and peace the lake is called loch dochart we passed by two others of inferior beauty and continued to travel along the side of the same river the dochart through an irregular undetermined valepoor soil and much waste land at that time of the evening when by looking steadily we could discover a few pale stars in the sky we saw upon an eminence the bound of our horizon though very near to us and facing the bright yellow clouds of the west a group of figures that made us feel how much we wanted in not being painters two herdsmen with a dog beside them were sitting on the hill overlooking a herd of cattle scattered over a large meadow by the riverside their forms looked at through a fading light and backed by the bright west were exceedingly distinct a beautiful picture in the quiet of a sabbath evening exciting thoughts and images of almost patriarchal simplicity and grace we were much pleased with the situation of our inn where we arrived between eight and nine oclock the river was at the distance of a broad field from the door we could see it from the upper windows and hear its murmuring the moon shone enlivening the large corn fields with cheerful light we had a bad supper and the next morning they made us an unreasonable charge and the servant was uncivil because forsooth we had no wine nbthe travellers in the morning had spoken highly of this inn footnote suiej c s quÃ¦re luibed monday september thafter drinking a basin of milk we set off again at a little after six oclocka fine morningeight miles to killinthe river dochart always on our left the face of the country not very interesting though not unpleasing reminding us of some of the vales of the north of england though meagre nippedup or shrivelled compared with them there were rocks and rocky knolls as about grasmere and wytheburn and copses but of a starveling growth the cultivated ground poor within a mile or two of killin the land was better cultivated and looking down the vale we had a view of loch tay into which the dochart falls close to the town the river took up a roaring voice beating its way over a rocky descent among large black stones islands in the middle turning the stream this way and that the whole course of the river very wide we crossed it by means of three bridges which make one continued bridge of a great length on an island below the bridge is a gateway with tall pillars leading to an old buryingground belonging to some noble family it has a singular appearance and the place is altogether uncommon and romantica remnant of ancient grandeur extreme natural wildnessthe sound of roaring water and withal the ordinary halfvillage halftown bustle of an everyday place footnote the burialplace of macnab of macnabj c s the inn at killin is one of the largest on the scotch road it stands pleasantly near the chapel at some distance from the river dochart and out of reach of its tumultuous noise and another broad stately and silent stream which you can not look at without remembering its boisterous neighbour flows close under the windows of the inn and beside the churchyard in which are many graves that river falls into the lake at the distance of nearly a mile from the mouth of the dochart it is bordered with tall trees and corn fields bearing plentiful crops the richest we had seen in scotland after breakfast we walked onwards expecting that the stream would lead us into some considerable vale but it soon became little better than a common rivulet and the glen appeared to be short indeed we wondered how the river had grown so great all at once our horse had not been able to eat his corn and we waited a long time in the hope that he would be better at eleven oclock however we determined to set off and give him all the ease possible by walking up the hills and not pushing beyond a slow walk we had fourteen miles to travel to kenmore by the side of loch tay crossed the same bridge again and went down the south side of the lake we had a delightful view of the village of killin among rich green fields corn and wood and up towards the two horns of the vale of tay the valley of the dochart and the other valley with its fullgrown river the prospect terminated by mountains we travelled through lanes woods or open fields never close to the lake but always near it for many miles the road being carried along the side of a hill which rose in an almost regularly receding steep from the lake the opposite shore did not much differ from that down which we went but it seemed more thinly inhabited and not so well cultivated the sun shone the cottages were pleasant and the goingson of the harvestfor all the inhabitants were at work in the corn fieldsmade the way cheerful but there is an uniformity in the lake which comparing it with other lakes made it appear tiresome it has no windings i should even imagine although it is so many miles long that from some points not very high on the hills it may be seen from one end to the other there are few bays no lurkingplaces where the water hides itself in the land no outjutting points or promontories no islands and there are no commanding mountains or precipices i think that this lake would be the most pleasing in springtime or in summer before the corn begins to change colour the long tracts of hills on each side of the vale having at this season a kind of patchy appearance for the corn fields in general were very small mere plots and of every possible shade of bright yellow when we came in view of the foot of the lake we perceived that it ended as it had begun in pride and loveliness the village of kenmore with its neat church and cleanly houses stands on a gentle eminence at the end of the water the view though not near so beautiful as that of killin is exceedingly pleasing left our car and turned out of the road at about the distance of a mile from the town and after having climbed perhaps a quarter of a mile we were conducted into a lockedup plantation and guessed by the sound that we were near the cascade but could not see it our guide opened a door and we entered a dungeonlike passage and after walking some yards in total darkness found ourselves in a quaint apartment stuck over with moss hung about with stuffed foxes and other wild animals and ornamented with a library of wooden books covered with old leather backs the mock furniture of a hermits cell at the end of the room through a large bowwindow we saw the waterfall and at the same time looking down to the left the village of kenmore and a part of the lakea very beautiful prospect memorandum by the author the transcript of the first part of this journal and the second as far as page were written before the end of the year i do not know exactly when i concluded the remainder of the second part but it was resumed on the nd of february the third part was begun at the end of the month of april and finished on the st of may footnote it is difficult to know what the author meant by the first second and third parts of her journal as it is divided into separate weeks throughout it is not of much consequence however and the above short memoranduminserted in the course of the transcripthas a special interest as showing that the work of copying her journal was carried on by dorothy wordsworth from to ed on resuming her work of copying the author wrote april th i am setting about a task which however free and happy the state of my mind i could not have performed well at this distance of time but now i do not know that i shall be able to go on with it at all i will strive however to do the best i can setting before myself a different object from that hitherto aimed at which was to omit no incident however trifling and to describe the country so minutely that you should where the objects were the most interesting feel as if you had been with us i shall now only attempt to give you an idea of those scenes which pleased us most dropping the incidents of the ordinary days of which many have slipped from my memory and others which remain it would be difficult and often painful to me to endeavour to draw out and disentangle from other thoughts i the less regret my inability to do more because in describing a great part of what we saw from the time we left kenmore my work would be little more than a repetition of what i have said before or where it was not so a longer time was necessary to enable us to bear away what was most interesting than we could afford to give monday september thwe arrived at kenmore after sunset tuesday september thwalked before breakfast in lord breadalbanes grounds which border upon the river tay the higher elevations command fine views of the lake and the walks are led along the rivers banks and shaded with tall trees but it seemed to us that a bad taste had been at work the banks being regularly shaven and cut as if by rule and line one or two of such walks i should well have liked to see but they are all equally trim and i could not but regret that the fine trees had not been left to grow out of a turf that cattle were permitted to feed upon there was one avenue which would well have graced the ruins of an abbey or some stately castle it was of a very great length perfectly straight the trees meeting at the top in a cathedral arch lessening in perspectivethe boughs the roof the stems the pillars i never saw so beautiful an avenue we were told that some improver of pleasuregrounds had advised lord b to cut down the trees and lay the whole open to the lawn for the avenue is very near his house his own better taste or that of some other person i suppose had saved them from the axe many workmen were employed in building a large mansion something like that of inverary close to the old house which was yet standing the situation as we thought very bad considering that lord breadalbane had the command of all the ground at the foot of the lake including hills both high and low it is in a hollow without prospect either of the lake or river or anything elseseeing nothing and adorning nothing after breakfast left kenmore and travelled through the vale of tay i believe fifteen or sixteen miles but in the course of this we turned out of our way to the falls of moness a stream tributary to the tay which passes through a narrow glen with very steep banks a path like a woodmans track has been carried through the glen which though the private property of a gentleman has not been taken out of the hands of nature but merely rendered accessible by this path which ends at the waterfalls they tumble from a great height and are indeed very beautiful falls and we could have sate with pleasure the whole morning beside the cool basin in which the waters rest surrounded by high rocks and overhanging trees in one of the most retired parts of the dell we met a young man coming slowly along the path intent upon a book which he was reading he did not seem to be of the rank of a gentleman though above that of a peasant passed through the village of aberfeldy at the foot of the glen of moness the birks of aberfeldy are spoken of in some of the scotch songs which no doubt grew in the stream of moness but near the village we did not see any trees that were remarkable except a row of laburnums growing as a common field hedge their leaves were of a golden colour and as lively as the yellow blossoms could have been in the spring afterwards we saw many laburnums in the woods which we were told had been planted though i remember that withering speaks of the laburnum as one of the british plants and growing in scotland the twigs and branches being stiff were not so graceful as those of our garden laburnums but i do not think i ever before saw any that were of so brilliant colours in their autumnal decay in our way to and from moness we crossed the tay by a bridge of ambitious and ugly architecture many of the bridges in scotland are so having eyeholes between the arches not in the battlements but at the outspreading of the pillar of the arch which destroys its simplicity and takes from the appearance of strength and security without adding anything of lightness we returned by the same road to the village of weem where we had left our car the vale of tay was very wide having been so from within a short distance of kenmore the reaches of the river are long and the ground is more regularly cultivated than in any vale we had yet seenchiefly corn and very large tracts afterwards the vale becomes narrow and less cultivated the reaches shorteron the whole resembling the vale of nith but we thought it inferior in beauty one among the cottages in this narrow and wilder part of the vale fixed our attention almost as much as a chinese or a turk would do passing through the vale of grasmere it was a cottage i believe little differing in size and shape from all the rest but it was like a visitor a stranger come into the highlands or a model set up of what may be seen in other countries the walls were neatly plastered or roughcast the windows of clean bright glass and the door was paintedbefore it a flowergarden fenced with a curiouslyclipped hedge and against the wall was placed the sign of a spinningwheel we could not pass this humble dwelling so distinguished by an appearance of comfort and neatness without some conjectures respecting the character and manner of life of the person inhabiting it leisure he must have had and we pleased ourselves with thinking that some selftaught mind might there have been nourished by knowledge gathered from books and the simple duties and pleasures of rural life at logierait the village where we dined the vale widens again and the tummel joins the tay and loses its name but the tay falls into the channel of the tummel continuing its course in the same direction almost at right angles to the former course of the tay we were sorry to find that we had to cross the tummel by a ferry and resolved not to venture in the same boat with the horse dined at a little publichouse kept by a young widow very talkative and laboriously civil she took me out to the backdoor and said she would show me a place which had once been very grand and opening a door in a high wall i entered a ruinous courtyard in which was a large old mansion the walls entire and very strong but the roof broken in the woman said it had been a palace of one of the kings of scotland it was a striking and even an affecting object coming upon it as i did unawaresa royal residence shut up and hidden while yet in its strength by mean cottages there was no appearance of violence but decay from desertion and i should think that it may remain many years without undergoing further visible change the woman and her daughter accompanied us to the ferry and crossed the water with us the woman said but with not much appearance of honest heartfeeling that she could not be easy to let us go without being there to know how we sped so i invited the little girl to accompany her that she might have a ride in the car the men were cautious and the horse got over with less alarm than we could have expected our way was now up the vale along the banks of the tummel an impetuous river the mountains higher than near the tay and the vale more wild and the different reaches more interesting when we approached near to fascally near the junction of the garry with the tummel the twilight was far advanced and our horse not being perfectly recovered we were fearful of taking him on to blairatholefive miles further besides the pass of killicrankie was within half a mile and we were unwilling to go through a place so celebrated in the dark therefore being joined by a traveller we inquired if there was any publichouse near he said there was and that though the accommodations were not good we might do well enough for one night the host and his wife being very honest people it proved to be rather better than a common cottage of the country we seated ourselves by the fire william called for a glass of whisky and asked if they could give us beds the woman positively refused to lodge us though we had every reason to believe that she had at least one bed for me we entreated again and again in behalf of the poor horse but all in vain she urged though in an uncivil way that she had been sitting up the whole of one or two nights before on account of a fair and that now she wanted to go to bed and sleep so we were obliged to remount our car in the dark and with a tired horse we moved on and went through the pass of killicrankie hearing only the roaring of the river and seeing a black chasm with jaggedtopped black hills towering above afterwards the moon rose and we should not have had an unpleasant ride if our horse had been in better plight and we had not been annoyed as we were almost at every twenty yards by people coming from a fair held that day near blairno pleasant prognostic of what might be our accommodation at the inn where we arrived between ten and eleven oclock and found the house in an uproar but we were civilly treated and were glad after eating a morsel of cold beef to retire to rest and i fell asleep in spite of the noisy drunkards below stairs who had outstayed the fair wednesday september throse early and went before breakfast to the duke of athols gardens and pleasuregrounds where we completely tired ourselves with a threehours walk having been directed to see all the waterfalls we submitted ourselves to the gardener who dragged us from place to place calling our attention to it might be halfadozeni can not say how manydripping streams very pretty in themselves if we had had the pleasure of discovering them but they were generally robbed of their grace by the obtrusive ornaments which were first seen the whole neighbourhood a great country seems to belong to the duke of athol in his domain are hills and mountains glens and spacious plains rivers and innumerable torrents but near blair are no old woods and the plantations except those at a little distance from the house appear inconsiderable being lost to the eye in so extensive a circuit the castle stands on low ground and far from the garry commanding a prospect all round of distant mountains a bare and cold scene and from the irregularity and width of it not so grand as one should expect knowing the great height of some of the mountains within the dukes park are three glens the glen of the river tilt and two others which if they had been planted more judiciously would have been very sweet retirements but they are choked up the whole hollow of the glensi do not speak of the tilt for that is rich in natural woodbeing closely planted with trees and those chiefly firs but many of the old firtrees are as single trees very fine on each side of the glen is an ellwide gravel walk which the gardener told us was swept once a week it is conducted at the top of the banks on each side at nearly equal height and equal distance from the stream they lead you up one of these paths and down the othervery wearisome as you will believemile after mile we went into the garden where there was plenty of fruitgooseberries hanging as thick as possible upon the trees ready to drop off i thought the gardener might have invited us to refresh ourselves with some of his fruit after our long fatigue one part of the garden was decorated with statues images as poor mr gill used to call those at racedown dressed in gay painted clothes and in a retired corner of the grounds under some tall trees appeared the figure of a favourite old gamekeeper of one of the former dukes in the attitude of pointing his gun at the gamereported to be a striking likeness said the gardener looking at some of the tall larches with long hairy twigs very beautiful trees he told us that they were among the first which had ever been planted in scotland that a duke of athol had brought a single larch from london in a pot in his coach from which had sprung the whole family that had overspread scotland this probably might not be accurate for others might afterwards have come or seed from other trees he told us many anecdotes of the present duke which i wish i could perfectly remember he is an indefatigable sportsman hunts the wild deer on foot attended by twelve highlanders in the highland dress which he himself formerly used to wear he will go out at four oclock in the morning and not return till night his fine family athols honest men and athols bonny lasses to whom burns in his bumpers drank health and long life are dwindled away of nine i believe only four are left the mother of them is dead in a consumption and the duke married again we rested upon the heather seat which burns was so loth to quit that moonlight evening when he first went to blair castle and had a pleasure in thinking that he had been under the same shelter and viewed the little waterfall opposite with some of the happy and pure feelings of his better mind the castle has been modernized which has spoiled its appearance it is a large irregular pile not handsome but i think may have been picturesque and even noble before it was docked of its battlements and whitewashed the most interesting object we saw at blair was the chapel shaded by trees in which the body of the impetuous dundee lies buried this quiet spot is seen from the windows of the inn whence you look at the same time upon a high wall and a part of the towna contrast which i know not why made the chapel and its grove appear more peaceful as if kept so for some sacred purpose we had a very nice breakfast which we sauntered over after our weary walk being come to the most northerly point of our destined course we took out the map loth to turn our backs upon the highlands and looking about for something which we might yet see we fixed our eyes upon two or three spots not far distant and sent for the landlord to consult with him one of them was loch rannoch a freshwater lake which he told us was bordered by a natural pine forest that its banks were populous and that the place being very remote we might there see much of the simplicity of the highlanders life the landlord said that we must take a guide for the first nine or ten miles but afterwards the road was plain before us and very good so at about ten oclock we departed having engaged a man to go with us the falls of bruar which we wished to visit for the sake of burns are about three miles from blair and our road was in the same direction for two miles after having gone for some time under a bare hill we were told to leave the car at some cottages and pass through a little gate near a brook which crossed the road we walked upwards at least three quarters of a mile in the hot sun with the stream on our right both sides of which to a considerable height were planted with firs and larches intermingledchildren of poor burnss song for his sake we wished that they had been the natural trees of scotland birches ashes mountainashes etc however sixty or seventy years hence they will be no unworthy monument to his memory at present nothing can be uglier than the whole chasm of the hillside with its formal walks i do not mean to condemn them for for aught i know they are as well managed as they could be but it is not easy to see the use of a pleasurepath leading to nothing up a steep and naked hill in the midst of an unlovely tract of country though by the side of a tumbling stream of clear water it does not surely deserve the name of a pleasurepath it is three miles from the duke of athols house and i do not believe that one person living within five miles of the place would wish to go twice to it the falls are high the rocks and stones fretted and gnawed by the water i do not wonder at the pleasure which burns received from this stream i believe we should have been much pleased if we had come upon it as he did at the bottom of the hill we took up our car and turning back joined the man who was to be our guide crossed the garry and went along a moor without any road but straggling carttracks soon began to ascend a high hill and the ground grew so roughroad there was nonethat we were obliged to walk most of the way ascended to a considerable height and commanded an extensive prospect bounded by lofty mountains and having crossed the top of the fell we parted with our guide being in sight of the vale into which we were to descend and to pursue upwards till we should come to loch rannoch a lake as described to us bedded in a forest of scotch pines when left to ourselves we sate down on the hillside and looked with delight into the deep vale below which was exceedingly green not regularly fenced or cultivated but the level area scattered over with bushes and trees and through that level ground glided a glassy river not in serpentine windings but in direct turnings backwards and forwards and then flowed into the head of the lake of tummel but i will copy a rough sketch which i made while we sate upon the hill which imperfect as it is will give a better idea of the course of the riverwhich i must add is more curious than beautifulthan my description the ground must be often overflowed in winter for the water seemed to touch the very edge of its banks at this time the scene was soft and cheerful such as invited us downwards and made us proud of our adventure coming near to a cluster of huts we turned thither a few steps out of our way to inquire about the road these huts were on the hill placed side by side in a figure between a square and a circle as if for the sake of mutual shelter like haystacks in a farmyardno trees near them we called at one of the doors and three hale stout men came out who could speak very little english and stared at us with an almost savage look of wonder one of them took much pains to set us forward and went a considerable way down the hill till we came in sight of the cart road which we were to follow but we had not gone far before we were disheartened it was with the greatest difficulty william could lead the horse and car over the rough stones and to sit in it was impossible the road grew worse and worse therefore we resolved to turn back having no reason to expect anything better for we had been told that after we should leave the untracked ground all would be fair before us we knew ourselves where we stood to be about eight miles distant from the point where the river tummel after having left the lake joins the garry at fascally near the pass of killicrankie therefore we resolved to make our way thither and endeavour to procure a lodging at the same publichouse where it had been refused to us the night before the road was likely to be very bad but knowing the distance we thought it more prudent than to venture farther with nothing before us but uncertainty we were forced to unyoke the horse and turn the car ourselves owing to the steep banks on either side of the road and after much trouble we got him in again and set our faces down the vale towards loch tummel william leading the car and i walking by his side for the first two or three miles we looked down upon the lake our road being along the side of the hill directly above it on the opposite side another range of hills rose up in the same mannerfarmhouses thinly scattered among the copses near the water and cultivated ground in patches the lake does not wind nor are the shores much varied by baysthe mountains not commanding but the whole a pleasing scene our road took us out of sight of the water and we were obliged to procure a guide across a high moor where it was impossible that the horse should drag us at all the ground being exceedingly rough and untracked of course fatiguing for foottravellers and on foot we must travel after some time the river tummel again served us for a guide when it had left the lake it was no longer a gentle stream a mirror to the sky but we could hear it roaring at a considerable distance between steep banks of rock and wood we had to cross the garry by a bridge a little above the junction of the two rivers and were now not far from the publichouse to our great joy for we were very weary with our laborious walk i do not think that i had walked less than sixteen miles and william much more to which add the fatigue of leading the horse and the rough roads and you will not wonder that we longed for rest we stopped at the door of the house and william entered as before and again the woman refused to lodge us in a most inhuman manner giving no other reason than that she would not do it we pleaded for the poor horse entreated soothed and flattered but all in vain though the night was cloudy and dark we begged to sit by the fire till morning and to this she would not consent indeed if it had not been for the sake of the horse i would rather have lain in a barn than on the best of featherbeds in the house of such a cruel woman we were now after our long days journey five miles from the inn at blair whither we at first thought of returning but finally resolved to go to a publichouse which we had seen in a village we passed through about a mile above the ferry over the tummel having come from that point to blair for the sake of the pass of killicrankie and blair itself and had now the same road to measure back again we were obliged to leave the pass of killicrankie unseen but this disturbed us little at a time when we had seven miles to travel in the dark with a poor beast almost sinking with fatigue for he had not rested once all day we went on spiritless and at a dreary pace passed by one house which we were half inclined to go up to and ask for a nights lodging and soon after being greeted by a gentle voice from a poor woman whom till she spoke though we were close to her we had not seen we stopped and asked if she could tell us where we might stay all night and put up our horse she mentioned the publichouse left behind and we told our tale and asked her if she had no house to which she could take us yes to be sure she had a house but it was only a small cottage and she had no place for the horse and how we could lodge in her house she could not tell but we should be welcome to whatever she had so we turned the car and she walked by the side of it talking to us in a tone of human kindness which made us friends at once i remember thinking to myself as i have often done in a stagecoach though never with half the reason to prejudge favourably what sort of countenance and figure shall we see in this woman when we come into the light and indeed it was an interesting moment when after we had entered her house she blew the embers on the hearth and lighted a candle to assist us in taking the luggage out of the car her husband presently arrived and he and william took the horse to the publichouse the poor woman hung the kettle over the fire we had tea and sugar of our own and she set before us barley cakes and milk which she had just brought in i recollect she said she had been west to fetch it the highlanders always direct you by east and west north and southvery confusing to strangers she told us that it was her business to keep the gate for mr who lived at just belowthat is to receive messages take in letters etc her cottage stood by the side of the road leading to his house within the gate having as we saw in the morning a dressedup porters lodge outside but within was nothing but the naked walls unplastered and floors of mud as in the common huts she said that they lived rentfree in return for their services but spoke of her place and mr with little respect hinting that he was very proud and indeed her appearance and subdued manners and that soft voice which had prepossessed us so much in her favour seemed to belong to an injured and oppressed being we talked a great deal with her and gathered some interesting facts from her conversation which i wish i had written down while they were fresh in my memory they had only one child yet seemed to be very poor not discontented but languid and willing to suffer rather than rouse to any effort though it was plain she despised and hated her master and had no wish to conceal it she hardly appeared to think it worth while to speak ill of him we were obliged to sit up very late while our kind hostess was preparing our beds william lay upon the floor on some hay without sheets my bed was of chaff i had plenty of covering and a pair of very nice strong clean sheetsshe said with some pride that she had good linen i believe the sheets had been of her own spinning perhaps when she was first married or before and she probably will keep them to the end of her life of poverty thursday september thbefore breakfast we walked to the pass of killicrankie a very fine scene the river garry forcing its way down a deep chasm between rocks at the foot of high rugged hills covered with wood to a great height the pass did not however impress us with awe or a sensation of difficulty or danger according to our expectations but the road being at a considerable height on the side of the hill we at first only looked into the dell or chasm it is much grander seen from below near the rivers bed everybody knows that this pass is famous in military history when we were travelling in scotland an invasion was hourly looked for and one could not but think with some regret of the times when from the now depopulated highlands forty or fifty thousand men might have been poured down for the defence of the country under such leaders as the marquis of montrose or the brave man who had so distinguished himself upon the ground where we were standing i will transcribe a sonnet suggested to william by this place and written in october six thousand veterans practised in wars game tried men at killicrankie were arrayd against an equal host that wore the plaid shepherds and herdsmen like a whirlwind came the highlanders the slaughter spread like flame and garry thundering down his mountain road was stoppd and could not breathe beneath the load of the dead bodies twas a day of shame for them whom precept and the pedantry of cold mechanic battle do enslave oh for a single hour of that dundee who on that day the word of onset gave like conquest might the men of england see and her foes find a like inglorious grave we turned back again and going down the hill below the pass crossed the same bridge we had come over the night before and walked through lady perths grounds by the side of the garry till we came to the tummel and then walked up to the cascade of the tummel the fall is inconsiderable scarcely more than an ordinary wear but it makes a loud roaring over large stones and the whole scene is grandhills mountains woods and rocks is a very pretty place all but the house stoddarts print gives no notion of it the house stands upon a small plain at the junction of the two rivers a close deep spot surrounded by high hills and woods after we had breakfasted william fetched the car and while we were conveying the luggage to the outside of the gate where it stood mr mal apropos came very near to the door called the woman out and railed at her in the most abusive manner for harbouring people in that way she soon slipped from him and came back to us i wished that william should go and speak to her master for i was afraid that he might turn the poor woman away but she would not suffer it for she did not care whether they stayed or not in the meantime mr continued scolding her husband indeed he appeared to be not only proud but very ignorant insolent and lowbred the woman told us that she had sometimes lodged poor travellers who were passing along the road and permitted others to cook their victuals in her house for which mr had reprimanded her before but as she said she did not value her place and it was no matter in sounding forth the dispraise of mr i ought not to omit mentioning that the poor woman had great delight in talking of the excellent qualities of his mother with whom she had been a servant and lived many years after having interchanged good wishes we parted with our charitable hostess who telling us her name entreated us if ever we came that way again to inquire for her we travelled down the tummel till it is lost in the tay and then in the same direction continued our course along the vale of tay which is very wide for a considerable way but gradually narrows and the river always a fine stream assumes more dignity and importance two or three miles before we reached dunkeld we observed whole hillsides the property of the duke of athol planted with firtrees till they are lost among the rocks near the tops of the hills in forty or fifty years these plantations will be very fine being carried from hill to hill and not bounded by a visible artificial fence reached dunkeld at about three oclock it is a pretty small town with a respectable and rather large ruined abbey which is greatly injured by being made the nest of a modern scotch kirk with sash windowsvery incongruous with the noble antique towera practice which we afterwards found is not uncommon in scotland sent for the dukes gardener after dinner and walked with him into the pleasuregrounds intending to go to the falls of the bran a mountain stream which here joins the tay after walking some time on a shaven turf under the shade of old trees by the side of the tay we left the pleasuregrounds and crossing the river by a ferry went up a lane on the hill opposite till we came to a locked gate by the roadside through which we entered into another part of the dukes pleasuregrounds bordering on the bran the glen being for a considerable wayfor aught i know two milesthridded by gravel walks the walks are quaintly enough intersected here and there by a baby garden of fine flowers among the rocks and stones the waterfall which we came to see warned us by a loud roaring that we must expect it we were first however conducted into a small apartment where the gardener desired us to look at a painting of the figure of ossian which while he was telling us the story of the young artist who performed the work disappeared parting in the middle flying asunder as if by the touch of magic and lo we are at the entrance of a splendid room which was almost dizzy and alive with waterfalls that tumbled in all directionsthe great cascade which was opposite to the window that faced us being reflected in innumerable mirrors upon the ceiling and against the walls we both laughed heartily which no doubt the gardener considered as high commendation for he was very eloquent in pointing out the beauties of the place we left the bran and pursued our walk through the plantations where we readily forgave the duke his little devices for their sakes they are already no insignificant woods where the trees happen to be oaks birches and others natural to the soil and under their shade the walks are delightful from one hill through different openings under the trees we looked up the vale of tay to a great distance a magnificent prospect at that time of the evening woody and richcorn green fields and cattle the winding tay and distant mountains looked down the river to the town of dunkeld which lies low under irregular hills covered with wood to their rocky summits and bounded by higher mountains which are bare the hill of birnam no longer birnam wood was pointed out to us after a very long walk we parted from our guide when it was almost dark and he promised to call on us in the morning to conduct us to the gardens friday september thaccording to appointment the gardener came with his keys in his hand and we attended him whithersoever he chose to lead in spite of past experience at blair we had however no reason to repent for we were repaid for the trouble of going through the large gardens by the apples and pears of which he gave us liberally and the walks through the woods on that part of the grounds opposite to where we had been the night before were very delightful the dukes house is neither large nor grand being just an ordinary gentlemans house upon a green lawn and whitewashed i believe the old abbey faces the house on the east side and appears to stand upon the same green lawn which though close to the town is entirely excluded from it by high walls and trees we had been undetermined respecting our future course when we came to dunkeld whether to go on directly to perth and edinburgh or to make a circuit and revisit the trossachs we decided upon the latter plan and accordingly after breakfast set forward towards crieff where we intended to sleep and the next night at callander the first part of our road after having crossed the ferry was up the glen of the bran looking backwards we saw dunkeld very pretty under the hills and surrounded by rich cultivated ground but we had not a good distant view of the abbey left our car and went about a hundred yards from the road to see the rumbling brig which though well worth our going out of the way even much further disappointed us as places in general do which we hear much spoken of as savage tremendous etcand no wonder for they are usually described by people to whom rocks are novelties the gardener had told us that we should pass through the most populous glen in scotland the glen of amulree it is not populous in the usual way with scattered dwellings but many clusters of houses hamlets such as we had passed near the tummel which had a singular appearance being like small encampments were generally without trees and in high situationsevery house the same as its neighbour whether for men or cattle there was nothing else remarkable in the glen we halted at a lonely inn at the foot of a steep barren moor which we had to cross then after descending considerably came to the narrow glen which we had approached with no little curiosity not having been able to procure any distinct description of it at dunkeld when we were hesitating what road to take we wished to know whether that glen would be worth visiting and accordingly put several questions to the waiter and among other epithets used in the course of interrogation we stumbled upon the word grand to which he replied no i do not think there are any gentlemens seats in it however we drew enough from this describer and the gardener to determine us finally to go to callander the narrow glen being in the way entered the glen at a small hamlet at some distance from the head and turning aside a few steps ascended a hillock which commanded a view to the top of ita very sweet scene a green valley not very narrow with a few scattered trees and huts almost invisible in a misty gleam of afternoon light at this hamlet we crossed a bridge and the road led us down the glen which had become exceedingly narrow and so continued to the end the hills on both sides heathy and rocky very steep but continuous the rocks not single or overhanging not scooped into caverns or sounding with torrents there are no trees no houses no traces of cultivation not one outstanding object it is truly a solitude the road even making it appear still more so the bottom of the valley is mostly smooth and level the brook not noisy everything is simple and undisturbed and while we passed through it the whole place was shady cool clear and solemn at the end of the long valley we ascended a hill to a great height and reached the top when the sun on the point of setting shed a soft yellow light upon every eminence the prospect was very extensive over hollows and plains no towns and few houses visiblea prospect extensive as it was in harmony with the secluded dell and fixing its own peculiar character of removedness from the world and the secure possession of the quiet of nature more deeply in our minds the following poem was written by william on hearing of a tradition relating to it which we did not know when we were there in this still place remote from men sleeps ossian in the narrow glen in this still place where murmurs on but one meek streamlet only one he sung of battles and the breath of stormy war and violent death and should methinks when all was passd have rightfully been laid at last where rocks were rudely heapd and rent as by a spirit turbulent where sights were rough and sounds were wild and everything unreconciled in some complaining dim retreat where fear and melancholy meet but this is calm there can not be a more entire tranquillity does then the bard sleep here indeed or is it but a groundless creed what matters it i blame them not whose fancy in this lonely spot was moved and in this way expressd their notion of its perfect rest a convent even a hermits cell would break the silence of this dell it is not quiet is not ease but something deeper far than these the separation that is here is of the grave and of austere and happy feelings of the dead and therefore was it rightly said that ossian last of all his race lies buried in this lonely place having descended into a broad cultivated vale we saw nothing remarkable observed a gentlemans house which stood pleasantly among trees it was dark some time before we reached crieff a small town though larger than dunkeld footnote monzie probablyj c s saturday september throse early and departed without breakfast we were to pass through one of the most celebrated vales of scotland strath erne we found it a wide long and irregular vale with many gentlemens seats under the hills woods copses frequent cottages plantations and much cultivation yet with an intermixture of barren ground indeed except at killin and dunkeld there was always something which seemed to take from the composure and simplicity of the cultivated scenes there is a struggle to overcome the natural barrenness and the end not attained an appearance of something doing or imperfectly done a passing with labour from one state of society into another when you look from an eminence on the fields of grasmere vale the heart is satisfied with a simple undisturbed pleasure and no less on one of the green or heathy dells of scotland where there is no appearance of change to be or having been but such as the seasons make strath erne is so extensive a vale that had it been in england there must have been much inequality as in wensley dale but at wensley there is a unity a softness a melting together which in the large vales of scotland i never perceived the difference at strath erne may come partly from the irregularity the undefined outline of the hills which enclose it but it is caused still more by the broken surface i mean broken as to colour and produce the want of hedgerows and also the great number of new fir plantations after some miles it becomes much narrower as we approach nearer the mountains at the foot of the lake of the same name loch erne breakfasted at a small publichouse a wretchedly dirty cottage but the people were civil and though we had nothing but barley cakes we made a good breakfast for there were plenty of eggs walked up a high hill to view the seat of mr dundas now lord melvillea spot where if he have gathered much wisdom from his late disgrace or his long intercourse with the world he may spend his days as quietly as he need desire it is a secluded valley not rich but with plenty of wood there are many pretty paths through the woods and moss huts in different parts after leaving the cottage where we breakfasted the country was very pleasing yet still with a want of richness but this was less perceived being huddled up in charcoal woods and the vale narrow loch erne opens out in a very pleasing manner seen from a hill along which the road is carried through a wood of low trees but it does not improve afterwards lying directly from east to west without any perceivable bendings and the shores are not much broken or varied not populous and the mountains not sufficiently commanding to make up for the deficiencies dined at the head of the lake i scarcely know its length but should think not less than four or five miles and it is wide in proportion the inn is in a small villagea decent house walked about half a mile along the road to tyndrum which is through a bare glen and over a mountain pass it rained when we pursued our journey again and continued to rain for several hours the road which we were to take was up another glen down which came a stream that fell into the lake on the opposite side at the head of it so after having crossed the main vale a little above the lake we entered into the smaller glen the road delightfully smooth and dryone gentlemans house very pleasant among large coppice woods after going perhaps three miles up this valley we turned to the left into another which seemed to be much more beautiful it was a level valley notlike that which we had passeda wide sloping cleft between the hills but having a quiet slowpaced stream which flowed through level green grounds tufted with trees intermingled with cottages the tops of the hills were hidden by mists and the objects in the valley seen through misty rain which made them look exceedingly soft and indeed partly concealed them and we always fill up what we are left to guess at with something as beautiful as what we see this valley seemed to have less of the appearance of barrenness or imperfect cultivation than any of the same character we had passed through indeed we could not discern any traces of it it is called strath eyer strath is generally applied to a broad vale but this though open is not broad footnote glen oglej c s we next came to a lake called loch lubnaig a name which signifies winding in shape it somewhat resembles ulswater but is much narrower and shorter being only four miles in length the character of this lake is simple and grand on the side opposite to where we were is a range of steep craggy mountains one of whichlike place fellencroaching upon the bed of the lake forces it to make a considerable bending i have forgotten the name of this precipice it is a very remarkable one being almost perpendicular and very rugged we on the other side travelled under steep and rocky hills which were often covered with low woods to a considerable height there were one or two farmhouses and a few cottages a neat white dwelling on the side of the hill over against the bold steep of which i have spoken had been the residence of the famous traveller bruce who all his travels ended had arranged the history of them in that solitudeas deep as any abyssinian oneamong the mountains of his native country where he passed several years whether he died there or not we did not learn but the manner of his death was remarkable and affectingfrom a fall downstairs in his own house after so many dangers through which fortitude and courage had never failed to sustain him the house stands sweetly surrounded by coppicewoods and green fields on the other side i believe were no houses till we came near to the outlet where a few low huts looked very beautiful with their dark brown roofs near a stream which hurried down the mountain and after its turbulent course travelled a short way over a level green and was lost in the lake footnote ardhullaryj c s within a few miles of callander we come into a grand region the mountains to a considerable height were covered with wood enclosing us in a narrow passage the stream on our right generally concealed by wood made a loud roaring at one place in particular it fell down the rocks in a succession of cascades the scene is much celebrated in scotland and is called the pass of leny it was nearly dark when we reached callander we were wet and cold and glad of a good fire the inn was comfortable we drank tea and after tea the waiter presented us with a pamphlet descriptive of the neighbourhood of callander which we brought away with us and i am very sorry i lost it fifth week sunday september thimmediately after breakfast the morning being fine we set off with cheerful spirits towards the trossachs intending to take up our lodging at the house of our old friend the ferryman a boy accompanied us to convey the horse and car back to callander from the head of loch achray the country near callander is very pleasing but as almost everywhere else imperfectly cultivated we went up a broad vale through which runs the stream from loch ketterine and came to loch vennachar a larger lake than loch achray the small one which had given us such unexpected delight when we left the pass of the trossachs loch vennachar is much larger but greatly inferior in beauty to the image which we had conceived of its neighbour and so the reality proved to us when we came up to that little lake and saw it before us in its true shape in the cheerful sunshine the trossachs overtopped by benledi and other high mountains enclose the lake at the head and those houses which we had seen before with their corn fields sloping towards the water stood very prettily under low woods the fields did not appear so rich as when we had seen them through the veil of mist but yet as in framing our expectations we had allowed for a much greater difference so we were even a second time surprised with pleasure at the same spot went as far as these houses of which i have spoken in the car and then walked on intending to pursue the road up the side of loch ketterine along which coleridge had come but we had resolved to spend some hours in the neighbourhood of the trossachs and accordingly coasted the head of loch achray and pursued the brook between the two lakes as far as there was any track here we found to our surprisefor we had expected nothing but heath and rocks like the rest of the neighbourhood of the trossachsa secluded farm a plot of verdant ground with a single cottage and its company of outhouses we turned back and went to the very point from which we had first looked upon loch achray when we were here with coleridge it was no longer a visionary scene the sun shone into every crevice of the hills and the mountaintops were clear after some time we went into the pass from the trossachs and were delighted to behold the forms of objects fully revealed and even surpassing in loveliness and variety what we had conceived the mountains i think appeared not so high but on the whole we had not the smallest disappointment the heather was fading though still beautiful sate for halfanhour in lady perths shed and scrambled over the rocks and through the thickets at the head of the lake i went till i could make my way no further and left william to go to the top of the hill whence he had a distinct view as on a map of the intricacies of the lake and the course of the river returned to the huts and after having taken a second dinner of the food we had brought from callander set our faces towards the head of loch ketterine i can add nothing to my former description of the trossachs except that we departed with our old delightful remembrances endeared and many new ones the path or roadfor it was neither the one nor the other but something between bothis the pleasantest i have ever travelled in my life for the same length of waynow with marks of sledges or wheels or none at all bare or green as it might happen now a little descent now a level sometimes a shady lane at others an open track through green pastures then again it would lead us into thick coppicewoods which often entirely shut out the lake and again admitted it by glimpses we have never had a more delightful walk than this evening ben lomond and the three pointedtopped mountains of loch lomond which we had seen from the garrison were very majestic under the clear sky the lake perfectly calm the air sweet and mild i felt that it was much more interesting to visit a place where we have been before than it can possibly be the first time except under peculiar circumstances the sun had been set for some time when being within a quarter of a mile of the ferrymans hut our path having led us close to the shore of the calm lake we met two neatly dressed women without hats who had probably been taking their sunday evenings walk one of them said to us in a friendly soft tone of voice what you are stepping westward i can not describe how affecting this simple expression was in that remote place with the western sky in front yet glowing with the departed sun william wrote the following poem long after in remembrance of his feelings and mine what you are stepping westward yea twould be a wildish destiny if we who thus together roam in a strange land and far from home were in this place the guests of chance yet who would stop or fear to advance though home or shelter he had none with such a sky to lead him on the dewy ground was dark and cold behind all gloomy to behold and stepping westward seemd to be a kind of heavenly destiny i liked the greeting twas a sound of something without place or bound and seemd to give me spiritual right to travel through that region bright the voice was soft and she who spake was walking by her native lake the salutation was to me the very sound of courtesy its power was felt and while my eye was fixd upon the glowing sky the echo of the voice enwrought a human sweetness with the thought of travelling through the world that lay before me in my endless way we went up to the door of our boatmans hut as to a home and scarcely less confident of a cordial welcome than if we had been approaching our own cottage at grasmere it had been a very pleasing thought while we were walking by the side of the beautiful lake that few hours as we had been there there was a home for us in one of its quiet dwellings accordingly so we found it the good woman who had been at a preaching by the lakeside was in her holiday dress at the door and seemed to be rejoiced at the sight of us she led us into the hut in haste to supply our wants we took once more a refreshing meal by her fireside and though not so merry as the last time we were not less happy bating our regrets that coleridge was not in his old place i slept in the same bed as before and listened to the household stream which now only made a very low murmuring monday september threjoiced in the morning to see the sun shining upon the hills when i first looked out through the open windowplace at my beds head we rose early and after breakfast our old companion who was to be our guide for the day rowed us over the water to the same point where coleridge and i had sate down and eaten our dinner while william had gone to survey the unknown coast we intended to cross loch lomond follow the lake to glenfalloch above the head of it and then come over the mountains to glengyle and so down the glen and passing mr macfarlanes house back again to the ferryhouse where we should sleep so a third time we went through the mountain hollow now familiar ground the inhabitants had not yet got in all their hay and were at work in the fields our guide often stopped to talk with them and no doubt was called upon to answer many inquiries respecting us two strangers at the ferryhouse of inversneyde we had not the happy sight of the highland girl and her companion but the good woman received us cordially gave me milk and talked of coleridge who the morning after we parted from him had been at her house to fetch his watch which he had forgotten two days before he has since told me that he questioned her respecting the miserable condition of her hut which as you may remember admitted the rain at the door and retained it in the hollows of the mud floor he told her how easy it would be to remove these inconveniences and to contrive something at least to prevent the wind from entering at the windowplaces if not a glass window for light and warmth by day she replied that this was very true but if they made any improvements the laird would conclude that they were growing rich and would raise their rent the ferryman happened to be just ready at the moment to go over the lake with a poor man his wife and child the little girl about three years old cried all the way terrified by the water when we parted from this family they going down the lake and we up it i could not but think of the difference in our condition to that poor woman who with her husband had been driven from her home by want of work and was now going a long journey to seek it elsewhere every step was painful toil for she had either her child to bear or a heavy burthen i walked as she did but pleasure was my object and if toil came along with it even that was pleasurepleasure at least it would be in the remembrance we were i believe nine miles from glenfalloch when we left the boat to us with minds at ease the walk was delightful it could not be otherwise for we passed by a continual succession of rocks woods and mountains but the houses were few and the ground cultivated only in small portions near the water consequently there was not that sort of variety which leaves distinct separate remembrances but one impression of solitude and greatness while the highlander and i were plodding on together side by side interspersing long silences with now and then a question or a remark looking down to the lake he espied two small rocky islands and pointing to them said to me it will be gay and dangerous sailing there in stormy weather when the water is high in giving my assent i could not help smiling but i afterwards found that a like combination of words is not uncommon in scotland for at edinburgh william being afraid of rain asked the ostler what he thought who looking up to the sky pronounced it to be gay and dull and therefore rain might be expected the most remarkable object we saw was a huge single stone i believe three or four times the size of bowder stone the top of it which on one side was sloping like the roof of a house was covered with heather william climbed up the rock which would have been no easy task but to a mountaineer and we constructed a rope of pockethandkerchiefs garters plaids coats etc and measured its height it was so many times the length of williams walkingstick but unfortunately having lost the stick we have lost the measure the ferryman told us that a preaching was held there once in three months by a certain ministeri think of arrocharwho engages as a part of his office to perform the service the interesting feelings we had connected with the highland sabbath and highland worship returned here with double force the rock though on one side a high perpendicular wall in no place overhung so as to form a shelter in no place could it be more than a screen from the elements why then had it been selected for such a purpose was it merely from being a central situation and a conspicuous object or did there belong to it some inheritance of superstition from old times it is impossible to look at the stone without asking how came it hither had then that obscurity and unaccountableness that mystery of power which is about it any influence over the first persons who resorted hither for worship or have they now on those who continue to frequent it the lake is in front of the perpendicular wall and behind at some distance and totally detached from it is the continuation of the ridge of mountains which forms the vale of loch lomonda magnificent temple of which this spot is a noble sanctum sanctorum footnote this is none other than the wellknown scottish word geyindifferently tolerable considerablej c s we arrived at glenfalloch at about one or two oclock it is no village there being only scattered huts in the glen which may be four miles long according to my remembrance the middle of it is very green and level and tufted with trees higher up where the glen parts into two very narrow ones is the house of the laird i daresay a pretty place the view from the door of the publichouse is exceedingly beautiful the river flows smoothly into the lake and the fields were at that time as green as possible looking backward ben lomond very majestically shuts in the view the top of the mountain as seen here being of a pyramidal form it is much grander than with the broken outline and stage above stage as seen from the neighbourhood of luss we found nobody at home at the inn but the ferryman shouted wishing to have a glass of whisky and a young woman came from the hayfield dressed in a white bedgown without hat or cap there was no whisky in the house so he begged a little whey to drink with the fragments of our cold meat brought from callander after a short rest in a cool parlour we set forward again having to cross the river and climb up a steep mountain on the opposite side of the valley i observed that the people were busy bringing in the hay before it was dry into a sort of fauld or yard where they intended to leave it ready to be gathered into the house with the first threatening of rain and if not completely dry brought out again our guide bore me in his arms over the stream and we soon came to the foot of the mountain the most easy rising for a short way at first was near a naked rivulet which made a fine cascade in one place afterwards the ascent was very laborious being frequently almost perpendicular it is one of those moments which i shall not easily forget when at that point from which a step or two would have carried us out of sight of the green fields of glenfalloch being at a great height on the mountain we sate down and heard as if from the heart of the earth the sound of torrents ascending out of the long hollow glen to the eye all was motionless a perfect stillness the noise of waters did not appear to come this way or that from any particular quarter it was everywhere almost one might say as if exhaled through the whole surface of the green earth glenfalloch coleridge has since told me signifies the hidden vale but william says if we were to name it from our recollections of that time we should call it the vale of awful sound we continued to climb higher and higher but the hill was no longer steep and afterwards we pursued our way along the top of it with many small ups and downs the walk was very laborious after the climbing was over being often exceedingly stony or through swampy moss rushes or rough heather as we proceeded continuing our way at the top of the mountain encircled by higher mountains at a great distance we were passing without notice a heap of scattered stones round which was a belt of green grassgreen and as it seemed rich where all else was either poor heather and coarse grass or unprofitable rushes and spongy moss the highlander made a pause saying this place is much changed since i was here twenty years ago he told us that the heap of stones had been a hut where a family was then living who had their winter habitation in the valley and brought their goats thither in the summer to feed on the mountains and that they were used to gather them together at night and morning to be milked close to the door which was the reason why the grass was yet so green near the stones it was affecting in that solitude to meet with this memorial of manners passed away we looked about for some other traces of humanity but nothing else could we find in that place we ourselves afterwards espied another of those ruins much more extensivethe remains as the man told us of several dwellings we were astonished at the sagacity with which our highlander discovered the track where often no track was visible to us and scarcely even when he pointed it out it reminded us of what we read of the hottentots and other savages he went on as confidently as if it had been a turnpike roadthe more surprising as when he was there before it must have been a plain track for he told us that fishermen from arrochar carried herrings regularly over the mountains by that way to loch ketterine when the glens were much more populous than now descended into glengyle above loch ketterine and passed through mr macfarlanes grounds that is through the whole of the glen where there was now no house left but his we stopped at his door to inquire after the family though with little hope of finding them at home having seen a large company at work in a hay field whom we conjectured to be his whole householdas it proved except a servantmaid who answered our inquiries we had sent the ferryman forward from the head of the glen to bring the boat round from the place where he left it to the other side of the lake passed the same farmhouse we had such good reason to remember and went up to the buryingground that stood so sweetly near the waterside the ferryman had told us that rob roys grave was there so we could not pass on without going up to the spot there were several tombstones but the inscriptions were either wornout or unintelligible to us and the place choked up with nettles and brambles you will remember the description i have given of the spot i have nothing here to add except the following poem which it suggested to william footnote see rob roys grave in poetical works vol ii p ed a famous man is robin hood the english balladsingers joy and scotland boasts of one as good she has her own rob roy then clear the weeds from off his grave and let us chaunt a passing stave in honour of that outlaw brave heaven gave rob roy a daring heart and wondrous length and strength of arm nor craved he more to quell his foes or keep his friends from harm yet robin was as wise as brave as wise in thought as bold in deed for in the principles of things he sought his moral creed said generous rob what need of books burn all the statutes and their shelves they stir us up against our kind and worse against ourselves we have a passion make a law too false to guide us or control and for the law itself we fight in bitterness of soul and puzzled blinded thus we lose distinctions that are plain and few these find i graven on my heart that tells me what to do the creatures see of flood and field and those that travel on the wind with them no strife can last they live in peace and peace of mind for why because the good old rule suffices them the simple plan that they should take who have the power and they should keep who can a lesson which is quickly learnd a signal this which all can see thus nothing here provokes the strong to tyrannous cruelty and freakishness of mind is checkd he tamed who foolishly aspires while to the measure of their might all fashion their desires all kinds and creatures stand and fall by strength of prowess or of wit tis gods appointment who must sway and who is to submit since then said robin right is plain and longest life is but a day to have my ends maintain my rights ill take the shortest way and thus among these rocks he lived through summers heat and winters snow the eagle he was lord above and rob was lord below so was itwould at least have been but through untowardness of fate for polity was then too strong he came an age too late or shall we say an age too soon for were the bold man living now how might he flourish in his pride with buds on every bough then rents and landmarks rights of chase sheriffs and factors lairds and thanes would all have seemd but paltry things not worth a moments pains rob roy had never lingerd here to these few meagre vales confined but thought how wide the world the times how fairly to his mind and to his sword he would have said do thou my sovereign will enact from land to land through half the earth judge thou of law and fact tis fit that we should do our part becoming that mankind should learn that we are not to be surpassd in fatherly concern of old things all are over old of good things none are good enough ill shew that i can help to frame a world of other stuff i too will have my kings that take from me the sign of life and death kingdoms shall shift about like clouds obedient to my breath and if the word had been fulfilld as might have been then thought of joy france would have had her present boast and we our brave rob roy oh say not so compare them not i would not wrong thee champion brave would wrong thee nowhere least of all here standing by thy grave for thou although with some wild thoughts wild chieftain of a savage clan hadst this to boast ofthou didst love the liberty of man and had it been thy lot to live with us who now behold the light thou wouldst have nobly stirrd thyself and battled for the right for robin was the poor mans stay the poor mans heart the poor mans hand and all the oppressd who wanted strength had robins to command bear witness many a pensive sigh of thoughtful herdsman when he strays alone upon loch veols heights and by loch lomonds braes and far and near through vale and hill are faces that attest the same kindling with instantaneous joy at sound of rob roys name soon after we saw our boat coming over the calm water it was late in the evening and i was stiff and weary as well i might after such a long and toilsome walk so it was no poor gratification to sit down and be conscious of advancing in our journey without further labour the stars were beginning to appear but the brightness of the west was not yet gonethe lake perfectly still and when we first went into the boat we rowed almost close to the shore under steep crags hung with birches it was like a newdiscovered country of which we had not dreamed for in walking down the lake owing to the road in that part being carried at a considerable height on the hillside the rocks and the indentings of the shore had been hidden from us at this time those rocks and their images in the calm water composed one mass the surfaces of both equally distinct except where the water trembled with the motion of our boat having rowed a while under the bold steeps we launched out further when the shores were no longer abrupt we hardly spoke to each other as we moved along receding from the west which diffused a solemn animation over the lake the sky was cloudless and everything seemed at rest except our solitary boat and the mountainstreamsseldom heard and but faintly i think i have rarely experienced a more elevated pleasure than during our short voyage of this night the good woman had long been looking out for us and had prepared everything for our refreshment and as soon as we had finished supper or rather tea we went to bed william i doubt not rested well and for my part i slept as soundly on my chaff bed as ever i have done in childhood after the long days playing of a summers holiday tuesday th septemberagain a fine morning i strolled into the green field in which the house stands while the woman was preparing breakfast and at my return found one of her neighbours sitting by the fire a feeble paralytic old woman after having inquired concerning our journey the day before she said i have travelled far in my time and told me she had married an english soldier who had been stationed at the garrison they had had many children who were all dead or in foreign countries and she had returned to her native place where now she had lived several years and was more comfortable than she could ever have expected to be being very kindly dealt with by all her neighbours pointing to the ferryman and his wife she said they were accustomed to give her a day of their labour in digging peats in common with others and in that manner she was provided with fuel and by like voluntary contributions with other necessaries while this infirm old woman was relating her story in a tremulous voice i could not but think of the changes of things and the days of her youth when the shrill fife sounding from the walls of the garrison made a merry noise through the echoing hills i asked myself if she were to be carried again to the deserted spot after her course of life no doubt a troublesome one would the silence appear to her the silence of desolation or of peace after breakfast we took a final leave of our hostess and attended by her husband again set forward on foot my limbs were a little stiff but the morning being uncommonly fine i did not fear to aim at the accomplishment of a plan we had laid of returning to callander by a considerable circuit we were to go over the mountains from loch ketterine a little below the ferryhouse on the same side of the water descending to loch voil a lake from which issues the stream that flows through strath eyer into loch lubnaig our road as is generally the case in passing from one vale into another was through a settling between the hills not far from a small stream we had to climb considerably the mountain being much higher than it appears to be owing to its retreating in what looks like a gradual slope from the lake though we found it steep enough in the climbing our guide had been born near loch voil and he told us that at the head of the lake if we would look about for it we should see the buryingplace of a part of his family the macgregors a clan who had long possessed that district a circumstance which he related with no unworthy pride of ancestry we shook hands with him at parting not without a hope of again entering his hut in company with others whom we loved continued to walk for some time along the top of the hill having the high mountains of loch voil before us and ben lomond and the steeps of loch ketterine behind came to several deserted mountain huts or shiels and rested for some time beside one of them upon a hillock of its green plot of monumental herbage william here conceived the notion of writing an ode upon the affecting subject of those relics of human society found in that grand and solitary region the spot of ground where we sate was even beautiful the grass being uncommonly verdant and of a remarkably soft and silky texture after this we rested no more till we came to the foot of the mountain where there was a cottage at the door of which a woman invited me to drink some whey this i did while william went to inquire respecting the road at a new stone house a few steps further he was told to cross the brook and proceed to the other side of the vale and that no further directions were necessary for we should find ourselves at the head of the lake and on a plain road which would lead us downward we waded the river and crossed the vale perhaps half a mile or more the mountains all round are very high the vale pastoral and unenclosed not many dwellings and but few trees the mountains in general smooth near the bottom they are in large unbroken masses combining with the vale to give an impression of bold simplicity near the head of the lake at some distance from us we discovered the burialplace of the macgregors and did not view it without some interest with its ornamental balls on the four corners of the wall which i daresay have been often looked at with elevation of heart by our honest friend of loch ketterine the lake is divided right across by a narrow slip of flat land making a small lake at the head of the large one the whole may be about five miles long as we descended the scene became more fertile our way being pleasantly variedthrough coppices or open fields and passing farmhouses though always with an intermixture of uncultivated ground it was harvesttime and the fields were quietlymight i be allowed to say pensivelyenlivened by small companies of reapers it is not uncommon in the more lonely parts of the highlands to see a single person so employed the following poem was suggested to william by a beautiful sentence in thomas wilkinsons tour in scotland footnote see the solitary reaper in poetical works vol ii p with note appendeded behold her single in the field yon solitary highland lass reaping and singing by herself stop here or gently pass alone she cuts and binds the grain and sings a melancholy strain oh listen for the vale profound is overflowing with the sound no nightingale did ever chaunt so sweetly to reposing bands of travellers in some shady haunt among arabian sands no sweeter voice was ever heard in springtime from the cuckoobird breaking the silence of the seas among the farthest hebrides will no one tell me what she sings perhaps the plaintive numbers flow for old unhappy faroff things and battles long ago or is it some more humble lay familiar matter of today some natural sorrow loss or pain that has been and may be again whateer the theme the maiden sung as if her song could have no ending i saw her singing at her work and oer the sickle bending i listend till i had my fill and as i mounted up the hill the music in my heart i bore long after it was heard no more towards the foot of the lake on the opposite side which was more barren than that on which we travelled was a bare road up a steep hill which leads to glen finlas formerly a royal forest it is a wild and rocky glen as we had been told by a person who directed our notice to its outlet at loch achray the stream which passes through it falls into that lake near the head at the end of loch voil the vale is wide and populouslarge pastures with many cattle large tracts of corn we walked downwards a little way and then crossed over to the same road along which we had travelled from loch erne to callander being once again at the entrance of strath eyer it might be about four or five oclock in the afternoon we were ten miles from callander exceedingly tired and wished heartily for the poor horse and car walked up strath eyer and saw in clear air and sunshine what had been concealed from us when we travelled before in the mist and rain we found it less woody and rich than it had appeared to be but with all deductions a very sweet valley not far from loch lubnaig though not in view of it is a long village with two or three publichouses and being in despair of reaching callander that night without overfatigue we resolved to stop at the most respectablelooking house and should it not prove wretched indeed to lodge there if there were beds for us at any rate it was necessary to take some refreshment the woman of the house spoke with gentleness and civility and had a good countenance which reconciled me to stay though i had been averse to the scheme dreading the dirt usual in scotch publichouses by the wayside she said she had beds for us and clean sheets and we desired her to prepare them immediately it was a twostoried house light built though in other respects no better than the huts andas all the slated cottages aremuch more uncomfortable in appearance except that there was a chimney in the kitchen at such places it is fit that travellers should make up their minds to wait at least an hour longer than the time necessary to prepare whatever meal they may have ordered which we i may truly say did with most temperate philosophy i went to talk with the mistress who was baking barley cakes which she wrought out with her hands as thin as the oaten bread we make in cumberland i asked her why she did not use a rollingpin and if it would not be much more convenient to which she returned me no distinct answer and seemed to give little attention to the question she did not know or that was what they were used to or something of the sort it was a tedious process and i thought could scarcely have been managed if the cakes had been as large as ours but they are considerably smaller which is a great loss of time in the baking this woman whose common language was the gaelic talked with me a very good english asking many questions yet without the least appearance of an obtrusive or impertinent curiosity and indeed i must say that i never in those women with whom i conversed observed anything on which i could put such a construction they seemed to have a faith ready for all and as a child when you are telling him stories asks for more more so they appeared to delight in being amused without effort of their own minds among other questions she asked me the old one over again if i was married and when i told her that i was not she appeared surprised and as if recollecting herself said to me with a pious seriousness and perfect simplicity to be sure there is a great promise for virgins in heaven and then she began to tell how long she had been married that she had had a large family and much sickness and sorrow having lost several of her children we had clean sheets and decent beds wednesday september throse early and departed before breakfast the morning was dry but cold travelled as before along the shores of loch lubnaig and along the pass of the roaring stream of leny and reached callander at a little past eight oclock after breakfast set off towards stirling intending to sleep there the distance eighteen miles we were now entering upon a populous and more cultivated country having left the mountains behind therefore i shall have little to tell for what is most interesting in such a country is not to be seen in passing through it as we did half way between callander and stirling is the village of doune and a little further on we crossed a bridge over a pleasant river the teith above the river stands a ruined castle of considerable size upon a woody bank we wished to have had time to go up to the ruin long before we reached the town of stirling saw the castle single on its stately and commanding eminence the rock or hill rises from a level plain the print in stoddarts book does indeed give a good notion of its form the surrounding plain appears to be of a rich soil well cultivated the crops of ripe corn were abundant we found the town quite full not a vacant room in the inn it being the time of the assizes there was no lodging for us and hardly even the possibility of getting anything to eat in a byenook of the house walked up to the castle the prospect from it is very extensive and must be exceedingly grand on a fine evening or morning with the light of the setting or rising sun on the distant mountains but we saw it at an unfavourable time of day the midafternoon and were not favoured by light and shade the forth makes most intricate and curious turnings so that it is difficult to trace them even when you are overlooking the whole it flows through a perfect level and in one place cuts its way in the form of a large figure of eight stirling is the largest town we had seen in scotland except glasgow it is an old irregular place the streets towards the castle on one side very steep on the other the hill or rock rises from the fields the architecture of a part of the castle is very fine and the whole building in good repair some parts indeed are modern at stirling we bought burnss poems in one volume for two shillings went on to falkirk ten or eleven miles i do not recollect anything remarkable after we were out of sight of stirling castle except the carron ironworks seen at a distancethe sky above them was red with a fiery light in passing through a turnpike gate we were greeted by a highland drover who with many others was coming from a fair at falkirk the road being covered all along with horsemen and cattle he spoke as if we had been well known to him asking us how we had fared on our journey we were at a loss to conceive why he should interest himself about us till he said he had passed us on the black mountain near kings house it was pleasant to observe the effect of solitary places in making men friends and to see so much kindness which had been produced in such a chance encounter retained in a crowd no beds in the inns at falkirkevery room taken up by the people come to the fair lodged in a private house a neat clean placekind treatment from the old man and his daughter thursday september thbreakfasted at linlithgow a small town the house is yet shown from which the regent murray was shot the remains of a royal palace where queen mary was born are of considerable extent the banks of gardens and fishponds may yet be distinctly traced though the whole surface is transformed into smooth pasturage where cattle graze the castle stands upon a gentle eminence the prospect not particularly pleasing though not otherwise it is bare and wide the shell of a small ancient church is standing into which are crammed modern pews galleries and pulpitvery ugly and discordant with the exterior nothing very interesting till we came to edinburgh dined by the way at a small town or village upon a hill the back part of the houses on one side overlooking an extensive prospect over flat corn fields i mention this for the sake of a pleasant hour we passed sitting on the bank where we read some of burnss poems in the volume which we had bought at stirling arrived at edinburgh a little before sunset as we approached the castle rock resembled that of stirlingin the same manner appearing to rise from a plain of cultivated ground the firth of forth being on the other side and not visible drove to the white hart in the grassmarket an inn which had been mentioned to us and which we conjectured would better suit us than one in a more fashionable part of the town it was not noisy and tolerably cheap drank tea and walked up to the castle which luckily was very near much of the daylight was gone so that except it had been a clear evening which it was not we could not have seen the distant prospect friday september ththe sky the evening before as you may remember the ostler told us had been gay and dull and this morning it was downright dismal very dark and promising nothing but a wet day and before breakfast was over the rain began though not heavily we set out upon our walk and went through many streets to holyrood house and thence to the hill called arthurs seat a high hill very rocky at the top and below covered with smooth turf on which sheep were feeding we climbed up till we came to st anthonys well and chapel as it is called but it is more like a hermitage than a chapela small ruin which from its situation is exceedingly interesting though in itself not remarkable we sate down on a stone not far from the chapel overlooking a pastoral hollow as wild and solitary as any in the heart of the highland mountains there instead of the roaring of torrents we listened to the noises of the city which were blended in one loud indistinct buzza regular sound in the air which in certain moods of feeling and at certain times might have a more tranquillizing effect upon the mind than those which we are accustomed to hear in such places the castle rock looked exceedingly large through the misty air a cloud of black smoke overhung the city which combined with the rain and mist to conceal the shapes of the housesan obscurity which added much to the grandeur of the sound that proceeded from it it was impossible to think of anything that was little or mean the goingson of trade the strife of men or everyday city businessthe impression was one and it was visionary like the conceptions of our childhood of bagdad or balsora when we have been reading the arabian nights entertainments though the rain was very heavy we remained upon the hill for some time then returned by the same road by which we had come through green flat fields formerly the pleasuregrounds of holyrood house on the edge of which stands the old roofless chapel of venerable architecture it is a pity that it should be suffered to fall down for the walls appear to be yet entire very near to the chapel is holyrood house which we could not but lament has nothing ancient in its appearance being sashwindowed and not an irregular pile it is very like a building for some national establishmenta hospital for soldiers or sailors you have a description of it in stoddarts tour therefore i need not tell you what we saw there when we found ourselves once again in the streets of the city we lamented over the heavy rain and indeed before leaving the hill much as we were indebted to the accident of the rain for the peculiar grandeur and affecting wildness of those objects we saw we could not but regret that the firth of forth was entirely hidden from us and all distant objects and we strained our eyes till they ached vainly trying to pierce through the thick mist we walked industriously through the streets street after street and in spite of wet and dirt were exceedingly delighted the old town with its irregular houses stage above stage seen as we saw it in the obscurity of a rainy day hardly resembles the work of men it is more like a piling up of rocks and i can not attempt to describe what we saw so imperfectly but must say that high as my expectations had been raised the city of edinburgh far surpassed all expectation gladly would we have stayed another day but could not afford more time and our notions of the weather of scotland were so dismal notwithstanding we ourselves had been so much favoured that we had no hope of its mending so at about six oclock in the evening we departed intending to sleep at an inn in the village of roslin about five miles from edinburgh the rain continued till we were almost at roslin but then it was quite dark so we did not see the castle that night saturday september ththe morning very fine we rose early and walked through the glen of roslin past hawthornden and considerably further to the house of mr walter scott at lasswade roslin castle stands upon a woody bank above a stream the north esk too large i think to be called a brook yet an inconsiderable river we looked down upon the ruin from higher ground near it stands the chapel a most elegant building a ruin though the walls and roof are entire i never passed through a more delicious dell than the glen of roslin though the water of the stream is dingy and muddy the banks are rocky on each side and hung with pine wood about a mile from the castle on the contrary side of the water upon the edge of a very steep bank stands hawthornden the house of drummond the poet whither ben jonson came on foot from london to visit his friend we did hear to whom the house at present belongs and some other particulars but i have a very indistinct recollection of what was told us except that many old trees had been lately cut down after hawthornden the glen widens ceases to be rocky and spreads out into a rich vale scattered over with gentlemens seats arrived at lasswade before mr and mrs scott had risen and waited some time in a large sittingroom breakfasted with them and stayed till two oclock and mr scott accompanied us back almost to roslin having given us directions respecting our future journey and promised to meet us at melrose two days after footnote see lockharts memoirs of the life of sir walter scott vol i pp for an account of this visit lockhart says i have drawn up the account of this meeting from my recollection partly of mr ws conversation partly from that of his sisters charming diary which he was so kind as to read to me on the th may ed we ordered dinner on our return to the inn and went to view the inside of the chapel of roslin which is kept locked up and so preserved from the injuries it might otherwise receive from idle boys but as nothing is done to keep it together it must in the end fall the architecture within is exquisitely beautiful the stone both of the roof and walls is sculptured with leaves and flowers so delicately wrought that i could have admired them for hours and the whole of their groundwork is stained by time with the softest colours some of those leaves and flowers were tinged perfectly green and at one part the effect was most exquisite three or four leaves of a small fern resembling that which we call adders tongue grew round a cluster of them at the top of a pillar and the natural product and the artificial were so intermingled that at first it was not easy to distinguish the living plant from the other they being of an equally determined green though the fern was of a deeper shade we set forward again after dinner the afternoon was pleasant travelled through large tracts of ripe corn interspersed with larger tracts of moorlandthe houses at a considerable distance from each other no longer thatched huts but farmhouses resembling those of the farming counties in england having many cornstacks close to them dark when we reached peebles found a comfortable oldfashioned publichouse had a neat parlour and drank tea sixth week sunday september ththe town of peebles is on the banks of the tweed after breakfast walked up the river to neidpath castle about a mile and a half from the town the castle stands upon a green hill overlooking the tweed a strong squaretowered edifice neglected and desolate though not in ruin the garden overgrown with grass and the high walls that fenced it broken down the tweed winds between green steeps upon which and close to the riverside large flocks of sheep pasturing higher still are the grey mountains but i need not describe the scene for william has done it better than i could do in a sonnet which he wrote the same day the five last lines at least of his poem will impart to you more of the feeling of the place than it would be possible for me to do footnote see in the memorials of a tour in scotland the sonnet composed at castleed degenerate douglas thou unworthy lord whom mere despite of heart could so far please and love of havoc for with such disease fame taxes him that he could send forth word to level with the dust a noble horde a brotherhood of venerable trees leaving an ancient dome and towers like these beggard and outraged many hearts deplored the fate of those old trees and oft with pain the traveller at this day will stop and gaze on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed for shelterd places bosoms nooks and bays and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed and the green silent pastures yet remain i was spared any regret for the fallen woods when we were there not then knowing the history of them the soft low mountains the castle and the decayed pleasuregrounds the scattered trees which have been left in different parts and the road carried in a very beautiful line along the side of the hill with the tweed murmuring through the unfenced green pastures spotted with sheep together composed an harmonious scene and i wished for nothing that was not there when we were with mr scott he spoke of cheerful days he had spent in that castle not many years ago when it was inhabited by professor ferguson and his family whom the duke of queensberry its churlish owner forced to quit it we discovered a very fine echo within a few yards of the building the town of peebles looks very pretty from the road in returning it is an old town built of grey stone the same as the castle welldressed people were going to church sent the car before and walked ourselves and while going along the main street william was called aside in a mysterious manner by a person who gravely examined himwhether he was an irishman or a foreigner or what he was i suppose our car was the occasion of suspicion at a time when every one was talking of the threatened invasion we had a days journey before us along the banks of the tweed a name which has been sweet to my ears almost as far back as i can remember anything after the first mile or two our road was seldom far from the river which flowed in gentleness though perhaps never silent the hills on either side high and sometimes stony but excellent pasturage for sheep in some parts the vale was wholly of this pastoral character in others we saw extensive tracts of corn ground even spreading along whole hillsides and without visible fences which is dreary in a flat country but there is no dreariness on the banks of the tweedthe hills whether smooth or stony uncultivated or covered with ripe corn had the same pensive softness near the corn tracts were large farmhouses with many cornstacks the stacks and house and outhouses together i recollect in one or two places upon the hills at a little distance seemed almost as large as a small village or hamlet it was a clear autumnal day without wind and being sunday the business of the harvest was suspended and all that we saw and felt and heard combined to excite one sensation of pensive and still pleasure passed by several old halls yet inhabited and others in ruin but i have hardly a sufficiently distinct recollection of any of them to be able to describe them and i now at this distance of time regret that i did not take notes in one very sweet part of the vale a gate crossed the road which was opened by an old woman who lived in a cottage close to it i said to her you live in a very pretty place yes she replied the water of tweed is a bonny water the lines of the hills are flowing and beautiful the reaches of the vale long in some places appear the remains of a forest in others you will see as lovely a combination of forms as any traveller who goes in search of the picturesque need desire and yet perhaps without a single tree or at least if trees there are they shall be very few and he shall not care whether they are there or not the road took us through one long village but i do not recollect any other yet i think we never had a miles length before us without a house though seldom several cottages together the loneliness of the scattered dwellings the more stately edifices decaying or in ruin or if inhabited not in their pride and freshness aided the general effect of the gently varying scenes which was that of tender pensiveness no bursting torrents when we were there but the murmuring of the river was heard distinctly often blended with the bleating of sheep in one place we saw a shepherd lying in the midst of a flock upon a sunny knoll with his face towards the skyhappy picture of shepherd life the transitions of this vale were all gentle except one a scene of which a gentlemans house was the centre standing low in the vale the hills above it covered with gloomy fir plantations and the appearance of the house itself though it could scarcely be seen was gloomy there was an allegorical aira person fond of spenser will understand mein this uncheerful spot single in such a country the house was hearsed about with a black wood we have since heard that it was the residence of lord traquair a roman catholic nobleman of a decayed family we left the tweed when we were within about a mile and a half or two miles of clovenford where we were to lodge turned up the side of a hill and went along sheepgrounds till we reached the spota single stone house without a tree near it or to be seen from it on our mentioning mr scotts name the woman of the house showed us all possible civility but her slowness was really amusing i should suppose it is a house little frequented for there is no appearance of an inn mr scott who she told me was a very clever gentleman goes there in the fishing season but indeed mr scott is respected everywhere i believe that by favour of his name one might be hospitably entertained throughout all the borders of scotland we dined and drank teadid not walk out for there was no temptation a confined barren prospect from the window at clovenford being so near to the yarrow we could not but think of the possibility of going thither but came to the conclusion of reserving the pleasure for some future time in consequence of which after our return william wrote the poem which i shall here transcribe footnote see in memorials of a tour in scotland yarrow unvisiteded from stirling castle we had seen the mazy forth unravelld had trod the banks of clyde and tay and with the tweed had travelld and when we came to clovenford then said my winsome marrow whateer betide well turn aside and see the braes of yarrow let yarrow folk frae selkirk town who have been buying selling go back to yarrowtis their own each maiden to her dwelling on yarrows banks let herons feed hares couch and rabbits burrow but we will downwards with the tweed nor turn aside to yarrow theres gala water leader haughs both lying right before us and dryburgh where with chiming tweed the lintwhites sing in chorus theres pleasant teviot dale a land made blithe with plough and harrow why throw away a needful day to go in search of yarrow whats yarrow but a river bare that glides the dark hills under there are a thousand such elsewhere as worthy of your wonder strange words they seemd of slight and scorn my truelove sighd for sorrow and lookd me in the face to think i thus could speak of yarrow oh green said i are yarrows holms and sweet is yarrow flowing fair hangs the apple frae the rock but we will leave it growing oer hilly path and open strath well wander scotland thorough but though so near we will not turn into the dale of yarrow let beeves and homebred kine partake the sweets of burnmill meadow the swan on still st marys lake float double swan and shadow we will not see them will not go today nor yet tomorrow enough if in our hearts we know theres such a place as yarrow be yarrow stream unseen unknown it must or we shall rue it we have a vision of our own ah why should we undo it the treasured dreams of times long past well keep them winsome marrow for when were there although tis fair twill be another yarrow if care with freezing years should come and wandering seem but folly should we be loth to stir from home and yet be melancholy should life be dull and spirits low twill sooth us in our sorrow that earth hath something yet to show the bonny holms of yarrow the next day we were to meet mr scott and again join the tweed i wish i could have given you a better idea of what we saw between peebles and this place i have most distinct recollections of the effect of the whole days journey but the objects are mostly melted together in my memory and though i should recognise them if we revisit the place i can not call them out so as to represent them to you with distinctness william in attempting in verse to describe this part of the tweed says of it more pensive in sunshine than others in moonshine which perhaps may give you more power to conceive what it is than all i have said monday september thwe rose early and went to melrose six miles before breakfast after ascending a hill descended and overlooked a dell on the opposite side of which was an old mansion surrounded with trees and steep gardens a curious and pleasing yet melancholy spot for the house and gardens were evidently going to decay and the whole of the small dell except near the house was unenclosed and uncultivated being a sheepwalk to the top of the hills descended to gala water a pretty stream but much smaller than the tweed into which the brook flows from the glen i have spoken of near the gala is a large modern house the situation very pleasant but the old building which we had passed put to shame the fresh colouring and meagre outline of the new one went through a part of the village of galashiels pleasantly situated on the bank of the stream a pretty place it once has been but a manufactory is established there and a townish bustle and ugly stone houses are fast taking place of the brownroofed thatched cottages of which a great number yet remain partly overshadowed by trees left the gala and after crossing the open country came again to the tweed and pursued our way as before near the river perhaps for a mile or two till we arrived at melrose the valley for this short space was not so pleasing as before the hills more broken and though the cultivation was general yet the scene was not rich while it had lost its pastoral simplicity at melrose the vale opens out wide but the hills are high all roundsingle distinct risings after breakfast we went out intending to go to the abbey and in the street met mr scott who gave us a cordial greeting and conducted us thither himself he was here on his own ground for he is familiar with all that is known of the authentic history of melrose and the popular tales connected with it he pointed out many pieces of beautiful sculpture in obscure corners which would have escaped our notice the abbey has been built of a pale red stone that part which was first erected of a very durable kind the sculptured flowers and leaves and other minute ornaments being as perfect in many places as when first wrought the ruin is of considerable extent but unfortunately it is almost surrounded by insignificant houses so that when you are close to it you see it entirely separated from many rural objects and even when viewed from a distance the situation does not seem to be particularly happy for the vale is broken and disturbed and the abbey at a distance from the river so that you do not look upon them as companions of each other and surely this is a national barbarism within these beautiful walls is the ugliest church that was ever beheldif it had been hewn out of the side of a hill it could not have been more dismal there was no neatness nor even decency and it appeared to be so damp and so completely excluded from fresh air that it must be dangerous to sit in it the floor is unpaved and very rough what a contrast to the beautiful and graceful order apparent in every part of the ancient design and workmanship mr scott went with us into the gardens and orchards of a mr riddel from which we had a very sweet view of the abbey through trees the town being entirely excluded dined with mr scott at the inn he was now travelling to the assizes at jedburgh in his character of sheriff of selkirk and on that account as well as for his own sake he was treated with great respect a small part of which was vouchsafed to us as his friends though i could not persuade the woman to show me the beds or to make any sort of promise till she was assured from the sheriff himself that he had no objection to sleep in the same room with william tuesday september thmr scott departed very early for jedburgh and we soon followed intending to go by dryburgh to kelso it was a fine morning we went without breakfast being told that there was a publichouse at dryburgh the road was very pleasant seldom out of sight of the tweed for any length of time though not often close to it the valley is not so pleasantly defined as between peebles and clovenford yet so soft and beautiful and in many parts pastoral but that peculiar and pensive simplicity which i have spoken of before was wanting yet there was a fertility chequered with wildness which to many travellers would be more than a compensation the reaches of the vale were shorter the turnings more rapid the banks often clothed with wood in one place was a lofty scar at another a green promontory a small hill skirted by the river the hill above irregular and green and scattered over with trees we wished we could have brought the ruins of melrose to that spot and mentioned this to mr scott who told us that the monks had first fixed their abode there and raised a temporary building of wood the monastery of melrose was founded by a colony from rievaux abbey in yorkshire which building it happens to resemble in the colour of the stone and i think partly in the style of architecture but is much smaller that is has been much smaller for there is not at rievaux any one single part of the ruin so large as the remains of the church at melrose though at rievaux a far more extensive ruin remains it is also much grander and the situation at present much more beautiful that ruin not having suffered like melrose abbey from the encroachments of a town the architecture at melrose is i believe superior in the exactness and taste of some of the minute ornamental parts indeed it is impossible to conceive anything more delicate than the workmanship especially in the imitations of flowers we descended to dryburgh after having gone a considerable way upon high ground a heavy rain when we reached the village and there was no publichouse a welldressed wellspoken woman courteouslyshall i say charitablyinvited us into her cottage and permitted us to make breakfast she showed us into a neat parlour furnished with prints a mahogany table and other things which i was surprised to see for her husband was only a daylabourer but she had been lady buchans waitingmaid which accounted for these luxuries and for a noticeable urbanity in her manners all the cottages in this neighbourhood if i am not mistaken were covered with red tiles and had chimneys after breakfast we set out in the rain to the ruins of dryburgh abbey which are near lord buchans house and like bothwell castle appropriated to the pleasure of the owner we rang a bell at the gate and instead of a porter an old woman came to open it through a narrow sidealley cut in a thick plantation of evergreens on entering saw the thatch of her hut just above the trees and it looked very pretty but the poor creature herself was a figure to frighten a childbowed almost double having a hooked nose and overhanging eyebrows a complexion stained brown with smoke and a cap that might have been worn for months and never washed no doubt she had been cowering over her peat fire for if she had emitted smoke by her breath and through every pore the odour could not have been stronger this ancient woman by right of office attended us to show off the curiosities and she had her tale as perfect though it was not quite so long a one as the gentleman swiss whom i remember to have seen at blenheim with his slender wand and dainty white clothes the house of lord buchan and the abbey stand upon a large flat peninsula a green holm almost covered with fruittrees the ruins of dryburgh are much less extensive than those of melrose and greatly inferior both in the architecture and stone which is much mouldered away lord buchan has trained peartrees along the walls which are bordered with flowers and gravel walks and he has made a pigeonhouse and a fine room in the ruin ornamented with a curiouslyassorted collection of busts of eminent men in which lately a ball was given yet deducting for all these improvements which are certainly much less offensive than you could imagine it is a very sweet ruin standing so enclosed in wood which the towers overtop that you can not know that it is not in a state of natural desolation till you are close to it the opposite bank of the tweed is steep and woody but unfortunately many of the trees are firs the old woman followed us after the fashion of other guides but being slower of foot than a younger person it was not difficult to slip away from the scent of her poor smokedried body she was sedulous in pointing out the curiosities which i doubt not she had a firm belief were not to be surpassed in england or scotland having promised us a sight of the largest and oldest yewtree ever seen she conducted us to it it was a goodly tree but a mere dwarf compared with several of our own countrynot to speak of the giant of lorton we returned to the cottage and waited some time in hopes that the rain would abate but it grew worse and worse and we were obliged to give up our journey to kelso taking the direct road to jedburgh we had to ford the tweed a wide river at the crossingplace it would have been impossible to drive the horse through for he had not forgotten the fright at connel ferry so we hired a man to lead us after crossing the water the road goes up the bank and we had a beautiful view of the ruins of the abbey peering above the trees of the woody peninsula which in shape resembles that formed by the tees at lickburn but is considerably smaller lord buchans house is a very neat modest building and almost hidden by trees it soon began to rain heavily crossing the teviot by a stone bridgethe vale in that part very widethere was a great deal of ripe corn but a want of trees and no appearance of richness arrived at jedburgh half an hour before the judges were expected out of court to dinner we gave in our passportthe name of mr scott the sheriffand were very civilly treated but there was no vacant room in the house except the judges sittingroom and we wanted to have a fire being exceedingly wet and cold i was conducted into that room on condition that i would give it up the moment the judge came from court after i had put off my wet clothes i went up into a bedroom and sate shivering there till the people of the inn had procured lodgings for us in a private house footnote compare lockharts memoirs of the life of sir walter scott vol i p ed we were received with hearty welcome by a good woman who though above seventy years old moved about as briskly as if she was only seventeen those parts of the house which we were to occupy were neat and clean she showed me every corner and before i had been ten minutes in the house opened her very drawers that i might see what a stock of linen she had then asked me how long we should stay and said she wished we were come for three months she was a most remarkable person the alacrity with which she ran upstairs when we rung the bell and guessed at and strove to prevent our wants was surprising she had a quick eye and keen strong features and a joyousness in her motions like what used to be in old molly when she was particularly elated i found afterwards that she had been subject to fits of dejection and illhealth we then conjectured that her overflowing gaiety and strength might in part be attributed to the same cause as her former dejection her husband was deaf and infirm and sate in a chair with scarcely the power to move a limban affecting contrast the old woman said they had been a very hardworking pair they had wrought like slaves at their tradeher husband had been a currier and she told me how they had portioned off their daughters with money and each a featherbed and that in their old age they had laid out the little they could spare in building and furnishing that house and she added with pride that she had lived in her youth in the family of lady egerton who was no high lady and now was in the habit of coming to her house whenever she was at jedburgh and a hundred other things for when she once began with lady egerton she did not know how to stop nor did i wish it for she was very entertaining mr scott sate with us an hour or two and repeated a part of the lay of the last minstrel when he was gone our hostess came to see if we wanted anything and to wish us goodnight on all occasions her manners were governed by the same spirit there was no withdrawing ones attention from her we were so much interested that william long afterwards thought it worth while to express in verse the sensations which she had excited and which then remained as vividly in his mind as at the moment when we lost sight of jedburgh footnote see in memorials of a tour in scotland the matron of jedborough and her husbanded age twine thy brows with fresh spring flowers and call a train of laughing hours and bid them dance and bid them sing and thou too mingle in the ring take to thy heart a new delight

youthful glee and she will dance and sing with thee nay start not at that figurethere him who is rooted to his chair look at him look again for he hath long been of thy family with legs that move not

almost as life can bring hath calld for thee a second spring repaid thee for that sore distress by no untimely joyousness which makes of thine a blissful state and cheers thy melancholy mate wednesday september stthe house where we lodged was airy and even cheerful though one of a line of houses bordering on the churchyard which is the highest part of the town overlooking a great portion of it to the opposite hills the kirk is as at melrose within the walls of a conventual church but the ruin is much less beautiful and the church a very neat one the churchyard was full of graves and exceedingly slovenly and dirty one most indecent practice i observed several women brought their linen to the flat tabletombstones and having spread it upon them began to batter as hard as they could with a wooden roller a substitute for a mangle after mr scotts business in the courts was over he walked with us up the jedsylvan jed it has been properly called by thomsonfor the banks are yet very woody though wood in large quantities has been felled within a few years there are some fine red scars near the river in one or two of which we saw the entrances to caves said to have been used as places of refuge in times of insecurity walked up to ferniehurst an old hall in a secluded situation now inhabited by farmers the neighbouring ground had the wildness of a forest being irregularly scattered over with fine old trees the wind was tossing their branches and sunshine dancing among the leaves and i happened to exclaim what a life there is in trees on which mr scott observed that the words reminded him of a young lady who had been born and educated on an island of the orcades and came to spend a summer at kelso and in the neighbourhood of edinburgh she used to say that in the new world into which she was come nothing had disappointed her so much as trees and woods she complained that they were lifeless silent and compared with the grandeur of the everchanging ocean even insipid at first i was surprised but the next moment i felt that the impression was natural mr scott said that she was a very sensible young woman and had read much she talked with endless rapture and feeling of the power and greatness of the ocean and with the same passionate attachment returned to her native island without any probability of quitting it again footnote compare lockharts memoirs of the life of sir walter scott vol i p ed the valley of the jed is very solitary immediately under ferniehurst we walked down the river wading almost up to the knees in fern which in many parts overspread the forestground it made me think of our walks at alfoxden and of our own parkthough at ferniehurst is no park at presentand the slim fawns that we used to startle from their couchingplaces among the fern at the top of the hill we were accompanied on our walk by a young man from the braes of yarrow an acquaintance of mr scotts who having been much delighted with some of williams poems which he had chanced to see in a newspaper had wished to be introduced to him he lived in the most retired part of the dale of yarrow where he had a farm he was fond of reading and wellinformed but at first meeting as shy as any of our grasmere lads and not less rustic in his appearance he had been in the highlands and gave me such an account of loch rannoch as made us regret that we had not persevered in our journey thither especially as he told us that the bad road ended at a very little distance from the place where we had turned back and that we should have come into another good road continued all along the shore of the lake he also mentioned that there was a very fine view from the steeple at dunkeld footnote william laidlawed the town of jedburgh in returning along the road as it is seen through the gently winding narrow valley looks exceedingly beautiful on its low eminence surmounted by the conventual tower which is arched over at the summit by light stonework resembling a coronet the effect at a distance is very graceful the hills all round are high and rise rapidly from the town which though it stands considerably above the river yet from every side except that on which we walked appears to stand in a bottom we had our dinner sent from the inn and a bottle of wine that we might not disgrace the sheriff who supped with us in the eveningstayed late and repeated some of his poem thursday september ndafter breakfast the minister dr somerville called upon us with mr scott and we went to the manse a very pretty house with pretty gardens and in a beautiful situation though close to the town dr somerville and his family complained bitterly of the devastation that had been made among the woods within view from their windows which looked up the jed he conducted us to the church which under his directions has been lately repaired and is a very neat place within dr somerville spoke of the dirt and other indecencies in the churchyard and said that he had taken great pains to put a stop to them but wholly in vain the business of the assizes closed this day and we went into court to hear the judge pronounce his charge which was the most curious specimen of old womans oratory and newspaperparagraph loyalty that was ever heard when all was over they returned to the inn in procession as they had come to the sound of a trumpet the judge first in his robes of red the sheriffs next in large cocked hats and inferior officers following a show not much calculated to awe the beholders after this we went to the inn the landlady and her sister inquired if we had been comfortable and lamented that they had not had it in their power to pay us more attention i began to talk with them and found out that they were from cumberland they knew captain and mrs wordsworth who had frequently been at jedburgh mrs wordsworths sister having married a gentleman of that neighbourhood they spoke of them with great pleasure i returned to our lodgings to take leave of the old woman who told me that i had behaved very discreetly and seemed exceedingly sorry that we were leaving her so soon she had been out to buy me some pears saying that i must take away some jeddered pears we learned afterwards that jedburgh is famous in scotland for pears which were first cultivated there in the gardens of the monks mr scott was very glad to part from the judge and his retinue to travel with us in our car to hawick his servant drove his own gig the landlady very kindly had put up some sandwiches and cheesecakes for me and all the family came out to see us depart passed the monastery gardens which are yet gardens where there are many remarkably large old peartrees we soon came into the vale of teviot which is open and cultivated and scattered over with hamlets villages and many gentlemens seats yet though there is no inconsiderable quantity of wood you can never in the wide and cultivated parts of the teviot get rid of the impression of barrenness and the fir plantations which in this part are numerous are for ever at war with simplicity one beautiful spot i recollect of a different character which mr scott took us to see a few yards from the road a stone bridge crossed the water at a deep and still place called hornes pool from a contemplative schoolmaster who had lived not far from it and was accustomed to walk thither and spend much of his leisure near the river the valley was here narrow and woody mr scott pointed out to us ruberslaw minto crags and every other remarkable object in or near the vale of teviot and we scarcely passed a house for which he had not some story seeing us look at one which stood high on the hill on the opposite side of the river he told us that a gentleman lived there who while he was in india had been struck with the fancy of making his fortune by a new speculation and so set about collecting the gods of the country with infinite pains and no little expense expecting that he might sell them for an enormous price accordingly on his return they were offered for sale but no purchasers came on the failure of this scheme a room was hired in london in which to exhibit them as a show but alas nobody would come to see and this curious assemblage of monsters is now probably quietly lodged in the vale of teviot the latter part of this gentlemans history is more affectinghe had an only daughter whom he had accompanied into spain two or three years ago for the recovery of her health and so for a time saved her from a consumption which now again threatened her and he was about to leave his pleasant residence and attend her once more on the same errand afraid of the coming winter we passed through a village whither leyden scotts intimate friend the author of scenes of infancy was used to walk over several miles of moorland country every day to school a poor barefooted boy he is now in india applying himself to the study of oriental literature and i doubt not it is his dearest thought that he may come and end his days upon the banks of teviot or some other of the lowland streamsfor he is like mr scott passionately attached to the district of the borders footnote the full title was scenes of infancy descriptive of teviotdale published in ed arrived at hawick to dinner the inn is a large old house with walls above a yard thick formerly a gentlemans house did not go out this evening friday september rdbefore breakfast walked with mr scott along a high road for about two miles up a bare hill hawick is a small town from the top of the hill we had an extensive view over the moors of liddisdale and saw the cheviot hills we wished we could have gone with mr scott into some of the remote dales of this country where in almost every house he can find a home and a hearty welcome but after breakfast we were obliged to part with him which we did with great regret he would gladly have gone with us to langholm eighteen miles further our way was through the vale of teviot near the banks of the river passed branxholm hall one of the mansions belonging to the duke of buccleuch which we looked at with particular interest for the sake of the lay of the last minstrel only a very small part of the original building remains it is a large strong house old but not ancient in its appearancestands very near the riverside the banks covered with plantations a little further on met the edinburgh coach with several passengers the only stagecoach that had passed us in scotland coleridge had come home by that conveyance only a few days before the quantity of arable land gradually diminishes and the plantations become fewer till at last the river flows open to the sun mostly through unfenced and untilled grounds a soft pastoral district both the hills and the valley being scattered over with sheep here and there was a single farmhouse or cluster of houses and near them a portion of land covered with ripe corn near the head of the vale of teviot where that stream is but a small rivulet we descended towards another valley by another small rivulet hereabouts mr scott had directed us to look about for some old stumps of trees said to be the place where johnny armstrong was hanged but we could not find them out the valley into which we were descending though for aught i know it is unnamed in song was to us more interesting than the teviot itself not a spot of tilled ground was there to break in upon its pastoral simplicity the same soft yellow green spread from the bed of the streamlet to the hilltops on each side and sheep were feeding everywhere it was more close and simple than the upper end of the vale of teviot the valley being much narrower and the hills equally high and not broken into parts but on each side a long range the grass as we had first seen near crawfordjohn had been mown in the different places of the open ground where it might chance to be best but there was no part of the surface that looked perfectly barren as in those tracts we saw a single stone house a long way before us which we conjectured to be as it proved moss paul the inn where we were to bait the scene with this single dwelling was melancholy and wild but not dreary though there was no tree nor shrub the small streamlet glittered the hills were populous with sheep but the gentle bending of the valley and the correspondent softness in the forms of the hills were of themselves enough to delight the eye at moss paul we fed our horseseveral travellers were drinking whisky we neither ate nor drank for we had with our usual foresight and frugality in travelling saved the cheesecakes and sandwiches which had been given us by our countrywoman at jedburgh the day before after moss paul we ascended considerably then went down other reaches of the valley much less interesting stony and barren the country afterwards not peculiar i should think for i scarcely remember it arrived at langholm at about five oclock the town as we approached from a hill looked very pretty the houses being roofed with blue slates and standing close to the river esk here a large river that scattered its waters wide over a stony channel the inn neat and comfortableexceedingly clean i could hardly believe we were still in scotland after tea walked out crossed a bridge and saw at a little distance up the valley langholm house a villa of the duke of buccleuch it stands upon a level between the river and a steep hill which is planted with wood walked a considerable way up the river but could not go close to it on account of the dukes plantations which are locked up when they ended the vale became less cultivated the view through the vale towards the hills very pleasing though bare and cold saturday september throse very early and travelled about nine miles to longtown before breakfast along the banks of the esk about half a mile from langholm crossed a bridge at this part of the vale which is narrow the steeps are covered with old oaks and every variety of trees our road for some time through the wood then came to a more open country exceedingly rich and populous the banks of the river frequently rocky and hung with wood many gentlemens houses there was the same rich variety while the river continued to flow through scottish grounds but not long after we had passed through the last turnpike gate in scotland and the first in englandbut a few yards asunderthe vale widens and its aspect was cold and even dreary though sir james grahams plantations are very extensive his house a large building stands in this open part of the vale longtown was before us and ere long we saw the wellremembered guidepost where the circuit of our six weeks travels had begun and now was ended we did not look along the white line of the road to solway moss without some melancholy emotion though we had the fair prospect of the cumberland mountains full in view with the certainty barring accidents of reaching our own dear home the next day breakfasted at the grahams arms the weather had been very fine from the time of our arrival at jedburgh and this was a very pleasant day the sun shone fair on carlisles walls when we first saw them from the top of the opposite hill stopped to look at the place on the sand near the bridge where hatfield had been executed put up at the same inn as before and were recognised by the woman who had waited on us everybody spoke of hatfield as an injured man after dinner went to a village six miles further where we slept sunday september th a beautiful autumnal day breakfasted at a publichouse by the roadside dined at threlkeld arrived at home between eight and nine oclock where we found mary in perfect health joanna hutchinson with her and little john asleep in the

wordsworth november th to th journal of a mountain ramble written by dorothy wordsworth footnote this title is given by the editor there is none in the original msed wednesday november thon a damp and gloomy morning we set forward william on foot and i upon the pony with williams greatcoat slung over the saddle crutch and a wallet containing our bundle of needments as we went along the mist gathered upon the valleys and it even rained all the way to the head of patterdale but there was never a drop upon my habit larger than the smallest pearls upon a ladys ring the trees of the larger island upon rydale lake were of the most gorgeous colours the whole island reflected in the water as i remember once in particular to have seen it with dear coleridge when either he or william observed that the rocky shore spotted and streaked with purplish brown heath and its image in the water together were like an immense caterpillar such as when we were children we used to call woolly boys from their hairy coats as the mist thickened our enjoyments increased and my hopes grew bolder and when we were at the top of kirkstone though we could not see fifty yards before us we were as happy travellers as ever paced side by side on a holiday ramble at such a time and in such a place every scattered stone the size of ones head becomes a companion there is a fragment of an old wall at the top of kirkstone which magnified yet obscured as it was by the mist was scarcely less interesting to us when we cast our eyes upon it than the view of a noble monument of ancient grandeur has beenyet this same pile of stones we had never before observed when we had descended considerably the fields of hartsop below brotherswater were first seen like a lake coloured by the reflection of yellow clouds i mistook them for the water but soon after we saw the lake itself gleaming faintly with a grey steely brightness then appeared the brown oaks and the birches of splendid colour and when we came still nearer to the valley the cottages under their tufts of trees and the old hall of hartsop with its long irregular front and elegant chimneys thursday november thincessant rain till eleven oclock when it became fair and william and i walked to blowick luff joined us by the way the wind was strong and drove the clouds forward along the side of the hill above our heads four or five goats were bounding among the rocks the sheep moved about more quietly or cowered in their shelteringplaces the two stormstiffened black yewtrees on the crag above luffs house were striking objects close under or seen through the flying mists when we stood upon the naked crag upon the common overlooking the woods and bushbesprinkled fields of blowick the lake clouds and mists were all in motion to the sound of sweeping windsthe church and cottages of patterdale scarcely visible from the brightness of the thin mist looking backwards towards the foot of the water the scene less visionary place fell steady and bold as a lion the whole lake driving down like a great river waves dancing round the small islands we walked to the house the owner was salving sheep in the barn an appearance of poverty and decay everywhere he asked us if we wanted to purchase the estate we could not but stop frequently both in going and returning to look at the exquisite beauty of the woods opposite the general colour of the trees was darkbrown rather that of ripe hazelnuts but towards the water there were yet beds of green and in some of the hollow places in the highest part of the woods the trees were of a yellow colour and through the glittering light they looked like masses of clouds as you see them gathered together in the west and tinged with the golden light of the sun after dinner we walked with mrs luff up the vale i had never had an idea of the extent and width of it in passing through along the road on the other side we walked along the path which leads from house to house two or three times it took us through some of those copses or groves that cover every little hillock in the middle of the lower part of the vale making an intricate and beautiful intermixture of lawn and woodland we left william to prolong his walk and when he came into the house he told us that he had pitched upon the spot where he should like to build a house better than in any other he had ever yet seen mrs luff went with him by moonlight to view it the vale looked as if it were filled with white light when the moon had climbed up to the middle of the sky but long before we could see her face a while all the eastern hills were in black shade those on the opposite side were almost as bright as snow mrs luffs large white dog lay in the moonshine upon the round knoll under the old yewtree a beautiful and romantic imagethe dark tree with its dark shadow and the elegant creature as fair as a spirit friday november thit rained till near ten oclock but a little after that time it being likely for a tolerably fine day we packed up and with luffs servant to help to row set forward in the boat as we proceeded the day grew finer clouds and sunny gleams on the mountains in a grand bay under place fell we saw three fishermen with a boat dragging a net and rowed up to them they had just brought the net ashore and hundreds of fish were leaping in their prison they were all of one kind what are called skellies after we had left them the fishermen continued their work a picturesque group under the lofty and bare crags the whole scene was very grand a raven croaking on the mountain above our heads landed at sanwick the man took the boat home and we pursued our journey towards the village along a beautiful summer path at first through a copse by the lakeside then through green fields the village and brook very pretty shut out from mountains and lake it reminded me of somersetshire passed by harry hebsons house i longed to go in for the sake of former times william went up one side of the vale and we the other and he joined us after having crossed the onearched bridge above the church a beautiful view of the church with its base ring of mossy wall and single yewtree at the last house in the vale we were kindly greeted by the master we were well prepared to face the mountain which we began to climb almost immediately martindale divides itself into two dales at the head in one of these that to the left there is no house to be seen nor any building but a cattleshed on the side of a hill which is sprinkled over with wood evidently the remains of a forest formerly a very extensive one at the bottom of the other valley is the house of which i have spoken and beyond the enclosures of this mans farm there are no other a few old trees remain relics of the forest a little stream passes in serpentine windings through the uncultivated valley where many cattle were feeding the cattle of this country are generally white or lightcoloured but those were mostly darkbrown or black which made the scene resemble many parts of scotland when we sat on the hillside though we were well contented with the quiet everyday sounds the lowing of cattle bleating of sheep and the very gentle murmuring of the valley stream yet we could not but think what a grand effect the sound of the buglehorn would have among these mountains it is still heard once a year at the chasea day of festivity for all the inhabitants of the district except the poor deer the most ancient of them all the ascent even to the top of the mountain is very easy when we had accomplished it we had some exceedingly fine mountain views some of the mountains being resplendent with sunshine others partly hidden by clouds ulswater was of a dazzling brightness bordered by black hills the plain beyond penrith smooth and bright or rather gleamy as the sea or seasands looked into boar dale above sanwickdeep and bare a stream winding down it after having walked a considerable way on the tops of the hills came in view of glenridding and the mountains above grisdale luff then took us aside before we had begun to descend to a small ruin which was formerly a chapel or place of worship where the inhabitants of martindale and patterdale were accustomed to meet on sundays there are now no traces by which you could discover that the building had been different from a common sheepfold the loose stones and the few which yet remain piled up are the same as those which lie about on the mountain but the shape of the building being oblong is not that of a common sheepfold and it stands east and west whether it was ever consecrated ground or not i know not but the place may be kept holy in the memory of some now living in patterdale for it was the means of preserving the life of a poor old man last summer who having gone up the mountain to gather peats had been overtaken by a storm and could not find his way down again he happened to be near the remains of the old chapel and in a corner of it he contrived by laying turf and ling and stones from one wall to the other to make a shelter from the wind and there he lay all night the woman who had sent him on his errand began to grow uneasy towards night and the neighbours went out to seek him at that time the old man had housed himself in his nest and he heard the voices of the men but could not make them hear the wind being so loud and he was afraid to leave the spot lest he should not be able to find it again so he remained there all night and they returned to their homes giving him up for lost but the next morning the same persons discovered him huddled up in the sheltered nook he was at first stupefied and unable to move but after he had eaten and drunk and recollected himself a little he walked down the mountain and did not afterwards seem to have suffered as we descend the vale of patterdale appears very simple and grand with its two heads deep dale and brotherswater or hartsop it is remarkable that two pairs of brothers should have been drowned in that lake there is a tradition at least that it took its name from two who were drowned there many years ago and it is a fact that two others did meet that melancholy fate about twenty years since footnote compare the account given of this incident in the excursion towards the close of book ii also in the fenwick note to the excursioned saturday november tha beautiful morning when we were at breakfast we heard suddenly the tidings of lord nelsons death and the victory of trafalgar went to the inn to make further inquiries returned by williams rock and grove and were so much pleased with the spot that william determined to buy it if possible therefore we prepared to set off to parkhouse that william might apply to thomas wilkinson to negotiate for him with the owner we went down that side of the lake opposite to stybarrow crag i dismounted and we sat some time under the same rock as before above blowick owing to the brightness of the sunshine the church and other buildings were even more concealed from us than by the mists the other day it had been a sharp frost in the night and the grass and trees were yet wet we observed the lemoncoloured leaves of the birches in the wood below as the wind turned them to the sun sparkle or rather flash like diamonds the day continued unclouded to the end monday november ththe morning being fine we resolved to go to lowther crossed the ford at yanworth found thomas wilkinson at work in one of his fields he cheerfully laid down the spade and walked by our side with william we left our horses at the mill below brougham and walked through the woods till we came to the quarry where the road endsthe very place which has been the boundary of some of the happiest of the walks of my youth the sun did not shine when we were there and it was midday therefore if it had shone the light could not have been the same yet so vividly did i call to mind those walks that when i was in the wood i almost seemed to see the same rich light of evening upon the trees which i had seen in those happy hours tuesday november tha very wet morning no hope of being able to return home william read in a book lent him by thomas wilkinson i read castle rackrent the day cleared at one oclock and after dinner at a little before three we set forward before we reached ullswater the sun shone and only a few scattered clouds remained on the hills except at the tops of the very highest the lake perfectly calm we had a delightful journey the trees in gowborough park were very beautiful the hawthorns leafless their round heads covered with rich red berries and adorned with arches of green brambles and eglantine hung with glossy hips many birches yet tricked out in full foliage of bright yellow oaks brown or leafless the smooth branches of the ashes bare most of the alders green as in spring at the end of gowborough park a large troop of deer were moving slowly or standing still among the fern i was grieved when our companions startled them with a whistle disturbing a beautiful image of grave simplicity and thoughtful enjoyment for i could have fancied that even they were partaking with me a sensation of the solemnity of the closing day i think i have more pleasure in looking at deer than any other animals perhaps chiefly from their living in a more natural state the sun had been set some time though we could only just perceive that the daylight was partly gone and the lake was more brilliant than before a delightful evening the seven stars close to the hilltops in patterdale all the stars seemed brighter than usual the steeps were reflected in brotherswater and above the lake appeared like enormous black perpendicular walls the torrents of kirkstone had been swollen by the rains and filled the mountain pass with their roaring which added greatly to the solemnity of our walk the stars in succession took their stations on the mountaintops behind us when we had climbed very high we saw one light in the vale at a great distance like a large star a solitary one in the gloomy region all the cheerfulness of the scene was in the sky above us footnote a

religion into the beholders from a distance looks stately on the plain when first seen from the gently descending road and appeared to me a much finer building than in former times and i felt as i had often done during my last abode in london that whatever change tending to melancholy twenty years might have produced they had called forth the capacity of enjoying the sight of ancient buildings to

architecture the old warder stood in waiting upon the hill to lead us forward after ascending above a hundred stone steps we were greeted by the slender tinkling of a bell a delicately wild sound in that place it is fixed at the top of a pillar on which is inscribed a poetical petition in behalf of the prisoners confined above in the castle calais tuesday july thlanded on the shores of france at

effect is striking from the size of the numerous pillars and arches though they are paltry in the finishing merely whitewashed and stuck over with bad pictures and tawdry images yet the whole view at the entrance was affecting old men and womenyoung women and girls kneeling at their silent prayers and some we espied in obscure recesses before a concealed crucifix image or altar one greyhaired man i can not forget whose countenance bore the impression of worldly cares subdued and peace in heavenly aspiration another figure i must not leave unnoticed a squalid ragged woman she sate alone upon some steps at the side of the entrance to the quire there she sate with a white dog beside her no one was near and the dog and she evidently belonged to each other probably her only friend for never was there a more wretchedly forlorn and miserablelooking human being she did not notice us but her rags and her sickly aspect drew a penny from me and the change in the womans skinny doleful face is not to be imagined it was brightened by a light and gracious smilethe effect was almost as of something supernaturalshe bowed her body waved her hand and with a politeness of gesture unknown in

continually tinkling there goes a woman to her prayers in a long black cloak and bright blue stockings here comes a nicelydressed old woman leaning on her staff surely it is a blessing to the aged in roman catholic countries to have the churches always open for them if it were only that it makes a variety in the course of a long day how soothing how natural to the aged thus to withdraw from the stir of household cares and occupations in which they can no longer take a part and i must say little as i have yet seen of this mode of worshipping god i never beheld more of the expression of piety and earnest feeling than in some of the very old people in these churches every avenue of the square of this town presents some picturesque continuation of buildings all is old and oldfashioned nothing to complain of but a want of dutch cleanliness yet it does not obtrude on the eye out of doors and the exterior is grave decent and quiet the priests in their gaudy attire with their young

was a beautiful nun in a grey garment with a long black scarf white forehead band belt and rosary intent upon her devotions she did not cast an eye towards us and we stood to look at her the faces of many of the women are handsome but the steady grace the chastened motions of their persons and the mild seriousness of their countenances are most remarkable from furnes to bruges we had travelled through a flat country yet with an endless variety produced by the various produce of a beautiful soil carefully cultivated we had been told that the country between ghent and bruges was much of the same kind only not so interesting therefore we were not sorry to interpose the variety of the packetboat to ghent and when all was ready took our places on the deck of the vessel the tinkling of a bell the signal for departure and we glided gently away with motion only perceptible by the eye looking at the retreating objects on the shore two nuns and a priest his prayerbook in his hand an english dandy a handsome ladylike flemish girl dressed in an elegant gauze mobcap with flowers and robe Ã  la franÃ§aise were the most noticeable people the groups under the awning would make a lively picture the priest in his cocked hat standing at his prayers the pretty maiden in her cap and flowers and there are the nuns my brother and the nuns are very merry they seem to have left their prayerbooks at home and one of them has a pamphlet in her hand that looks like a magazine low cottages pretty and clean close to the bank a woman scouring a copper vessel in white jacket red cap blue petticoat and clean sailcloth apron the flat country to be seen over the low banks of the canal spires and towers and sometimes a village may be descried among trees many little publichouses to tempt a landing near one i see a pleasant arbour with seats aloft for smoking the nuns are merry so is the priest in his spectacles the dandy recommends shoes in preference to boots as more convenient there is nobody that can clean either on the continent for my part i think they clean them as well as anything else except their vessels for cookery they can not get the dust out of a chair or rub a table william and i remained till the carriages were safely landed amid a confusion of tongues french german and english and inarticulate shoutings such as belong to all nations canals round the town rows of trees fortifications converted into pleasuregrounds we pass through old and picturesque streets with an intermixture of houses of a later date and showy shops an appearance of commerce and bustle which makes the contrast with bruges the more striking as the architecture of the ancient houses is of the same kind william and i with our english lady reached first the appointed inn though our friends had left the boat long before us ghentafter tea walked through the city the buildings streets squares all are picturesque the houses green blue pink yellow with richest ornaments still varying strange it is that so many and such stronglycontrasted colours should compose an undiscordant whole towers and spires overlook the lofty houses and nothing is wanting of venerable antiquity at ghent to give to the mind the same melancholy composure which can not but be felt in passing through the streets of brugesnothing but the impression that no change is going on except through the silent progress of time there the very dresses of the women might have been the same for hundreds of years here though the black cloak is prevalent we see a mixture of all kinds from the dress of the english or french belle to that of the poorest of our poor in a country town saturday july ththe architecture is a mixture of gothic and grecian three orders of pillars one above another the gothic part very rich multitudes of swallows were wheeling round the roof regardless of carts and hammers or whatever noise was heard below and the effect was indescribably interesting the restless motions and plaintive call of those little creatures seemed to impart a stillness to every other object and had the power to lead the imagination gently on to the period when that once superb but now decaying structure shall be lorded over and possessed by nature arrival at brusselslight and shade very solemn upon the drawbridge passing through a heavy gateway we entered the city and drove through street after street with a pleasure wholly new to us garlands of fresh boughs and flowers in festoons hung on each side and the great height of the houses especially in the narrow streets lighted as they were gave a beautiful effect to the exhibition some of the streets were very steep others long or winding and in the triangular openings at the junction of different streets there was generally some stately ornament for instance in one place a canopy with white drapery attached to the centre and suspended in four inverted arches by means of four pillars at the distance of six or seven yards from the centre sunday july thbrusselsafter breakfast proceeded through the park a very large open space with shady walks statues fountains pools arbours and seats and surrounded by palaces and fine housesto the cathedral which though immensely large was so filled with people that we could scarcely make our way so as by standing upon chairs for which we paid two sous each to have a view of the building over the multitudes of heads the priests at high mass could not be seen but the melody of human voices accompanied by the organ pierced through every recessthen came bursts of sound like thunder and at times the solemn rousing of the trumpet powerful as was the effect of the music the excessive heat and crowding after a short while overcame every other feeling and we were glad to go into the open air our laquais de place conducted us to the house of a shopkeeper where from a room in the attics we might view the procession it was close to one of the triangular openings with which most of the streets of brussels terminate to the right we looked down the street along which the procession was to come and a little to the left below us overlooked the triangles in the centre of which was a fountain ornamented with three marble statues and a pillar in the midst topped by a golden ballthe whole decorated with festoons of holly and large roses made of paper alternately red and yellow in like manner the garlands were composed in all the streets through which the procession was to pass but in some parts there were also young firtrees stuck in the pavement leaving a footway between them and the houses paintings were hung out by such as possessed them and ribands and flags the street where we were was lined with people assembled like ourselves in expectation all in their best attire peasants to be distinguished by their short jackets petticoats of scarlet or some other bright colour in contrast crosses or other ornament of gold or gilding the bourgeoises with black silk scarfs overhead and reaching almost to their feet ladies a little too much of the french or english little girls with or without caps and some in elegant white veils the windows of all the houses open and people seen at full length or through doorways sitting or standing in patient expectation it amused us to observe them and the arrangements of their houseswhich were even splendid compared with those of persons of like condition in our own countrywith an antique cast over all nor was it less amusing to note the groups or lines of people below us whether standing in the hot sunshine or the shade they appeared equally contented some approached the fountaina sacred spotto drink of the pure waters out of which rise the silent statues the spot is sacred for there before the priests arrived in the procession incense was kindled in the urns and a pause was made with the canopy of the host while they continued chanting the service but i am going too fast the procession was in its beginning military and its approach announced by sound of trumpets then came a troop of cavalry four abreast splendidly accoutred dressed in blue and gold and accompanied by a full band of music next i think the magistrates and constituted authorities but the order of the procession i do not recollect only that the military civil and religious authorities and symbols were pleasingly combined and the whole spectacle was beautiful long before the sound of the sacred service reached our ears the martial music had died away in the distance though there was no interruption in the line of the procession the contrast was very pleasing when the solemn chaunting came along the street with the stream of banners priests and choristers in their appropriate robes and not the least pleasing part of it was a great number of young girls two and two all dressed in white frocks it was a day made on purpose for this exhibition the sun seemed to be feasting on the gorgeous colours and glittering banners and there was no breeze to disturb garland or flower when all was passed away we returned to the cathedral which we found not so crowded as much to interrupt our view yet the whole effect of the interior was much injured by the decorations for the fÃªteespecially by stiff orangetrees in tubs placed between the pillars of the aisles though not equal to those of bruges or ghent it is a very fine gothic building massy pillars and numerous statues and windows of painted glassan ornament which we have been so accustomed to in our own cathedrals that we lamented the want of it at ghent and bruges monday july thbrusselsbrussels exhibits in its different quarters the stateliness of the ancient and the princely splendour of modern times mixed with an uncouth irregularity resembling that of the lofty tiers of houses at edinburgh but the general style of building in the old streets is by no means so striking as in those of ghent or bruges waterloowaterloo is a mean village straggling on each side of the broad highway children and poor people of all ages stood on the watch to conduct us to the church within the circle of its interior are found several mural monuments of our brave soldierslong lists of naked names inscribed on marble slabsnot less moving than laboured epitaphs displaying the sorrow of surviving friends here we took up the very man who was southeys guide lacoste whose name will make a figure in history he bowed to us with french ceremony and liveliness seeming proud withal to show himself as a sharer in the terrors of that time when buonapartes confusion and overthrow released him from unwilling service he had been tied upon a horse as buonapartes guide through the country previous to the battle and was compelled to stay by his side till the moment of flight monday july thbrusselsthe sky had been overshadowed by clouds during most of our journey and now a storm threatened us which helped our own melancholy thoughts to cast a gloom over the open country where few trees were to be seen except forests on the distant heights the ruins of the severely contested chateau of hougomont had been ridded away since the battle and the injuries done to the farmhouse repaired even these circumstances natural and trivial as they were suggested melancholy thoughts by furnishing grounds for a charge of ingratitude against the course of things that was thus hastily removing from the spot all vestiges of so momentous an event feeble barriers against this tendency are the few frail memorials erected in different parts of the field of battle and we could not but anticipate the time when through the flux and reflux of war to which this part of the continent has always been subject or through some turn of popular passion these also should fall and natures universal robe of green humanitys appointed shroud enwrap themand the very names of those whose valour they record be cast into shade if not obliterated even in their own country by the exploits of recent favourites in future ages tuesday july thnamurbefore breakfast we went to the church of the jesuits beautiful pillars of marble roof of pumicestone curiously wrought the colour chaste and sombre the churches of ghent and bruges are injured by being whitewashed that of brussels is of a pale grey or stonecolour which has a much better effect though nothing equal to the roof of the jesuits church at namur yet in one point ie the painted windows the cathedral of brussels surpasses all the churches we have yet seen several women passed us who had come thither to attend upon the labourers employed in repairing and enlarging the fortifications their dresses were neat and gay and in that place of which we had so often read in histories of battles and sieges their appearance while they struggled cheerfully with the blustering wind was wild and romantic the fondness for flowers appears in this country wherever you go nothing is more common than to see a man driving a cart with a rose in his mouth at the very top of our ascent i saw one at work with his spade a fullblown rose covering his lips which he must have brought up the hillor had some favourite lass there presented it to him wednesday july thliÃ©gemy first entrance into the marketplace brought a shock of cheerful sensation it was like the bursting into life of a flemish picture such profusion of fruit such outspreading of flowers and heaps of vegetables and such variety in the attire of the women a curious and abundant fountain surrounded with large stone basins served to wash and refresh the vegetables torrents of voices assailed us while we threaded our way among the fruit and fragrant flowers bouquets were held out to us by half a score of sunburnt arms at once the women laughedwe laughed took one bouquet and gave two sous our all left liÃ©ge about oclockwere recognised and greeted by many of the women at their stalls as we passed again through the marketplace ascended a very steep hill on the top of which stands the ruined convent of the chartreuse and there we left our carriages to look back upon the fine view of the city spreading from the ridge of the crescent hill opposite to us which is however somewhat unpleasingly scarified by new fortifications and over the central plain of the vale to the magnificent river which split into many channels flows at the foot of the eminence where we stood still as we proceed we are reminded of englandthe fields even the cottages and large farmhouses are englishlike country undulating and prospects extensive yet continually some pretty little spot detains the eye groups of cottages or single ones green to the very door footnote compare in tintern abbey ll these pastoral farms green to the very door ed thursday july thaixlachapellei went to the cathedral a curious building where are to be seen the chair of charlemagne on which the emperors were formerly crowned some marble pillars much older than his time and many pictures but i could not stay to examine any of these curiosities and gladly made my way alone back to the inn to rest there the marketplace is a fine old square but at aixlachapelle there is always a mighty preponderance of poverty and dulness except in a few of the showiest of the streets and even there a flashy meanness a slight patchery of things falling to pieces is everywhere visible road to cologneat the distance of ten miles we saw before us over an expanse of open country the towers of cologne even at this distance they appeared very tall and bulky and mary pointed out that one of them was a ruin which no other eyes could discover to the left was a range of distant hills and to the right in front of us another rangerather a clusterwhich we looked at with peculiar interest as guardians and companions of the famous river rhine whither we were tending and sick and weary though i was i felt as much of the glad eagerness of hope as when i first visited the wye and all the world was fresh and new having travelled over the intermediate not interesting country the massy ramparts of cologne guarded by grotesque turrets the bridges and heavy arched gateways the central towers and spires rising above the concealed mass of houses in the city excited something of gloomy yet romantic expectation friday july stcolognei busied myself repairing garments already tattered in the journey at the same time observing the traffic and business of the river here very wide and the banks low i was a prisoner but really the heat this morning being oppressive i felt not even a wish to stir abroad and could i believe have been amused more days than one by the lading and unlading of a ferryboat which came to and started from the shore close under my window steadily it floats on the lively yet smooth water a square platform not unlike a section cut out of a thronged marketplace and the busy crowd removed with it to the plain of water the square is enclosed by a white railing two slender pillars rise from the platform to which the ropes are attached forming between them an inverted arch elegant enough when the boat draws up to her mooringplace a bell hung aloft is rung as a signal for a fresh freight all walk from the shore without having an inch to rise or to descend carts with their horses wheel awayrustic yet not without parade of statelinessthe foreheads of the meanest being adorned with scarlet fringes in the neighbourhood of brussels and indeed all through the low countries we remarked the large size and good condition of the horses and their studied decorations but near brussels those decorations were the most splendid a scarlet net frequently halfcovered each of the six in procession the frock of the driver who paces beside the train is often handsomely embroidered and its rich colour prussian blue enlivens the scarlet ornaments of his steeds but i am straying from my ferryboat the first debarkation which we saw early in the morning was the most amusing peasants male and female sheep and calves the women hurrying away with their cargoes of fruit and vegetables as if eager to be beforehand with the market but i will transcribe verbatim from my journal written at midday the glittering rhine spread out before me in width that helped me to image forth an american lake it has gone out with a fresh load and returned every hour the comers have again disappeared as soon as landed and now the goers are gathering together two young ladies trip forward their dark hair basketed round the crown of the head green bags on their arms two gentlemen of their party next a lady with smooth black hair stretched upward from the forehead and a skullcap at the top like a small dish the gentry passengers seem to arrange themselves on one side the peasants on the otherhow much more picturesque the peasants there is a woman in a sober darkcoloured dress she wears no cap next one with red petticoat blue jacket and cap as white as snow next one with a red handkerchief over her head and a long brown cloak there a smart female of the bourgeoisedark shawl white cap blue dress two women now seated side by side make a pretty picture their attire is scarlet a pure white handkerchief falling from the head of each over the shoulders they keep watch beside a curiously constructed basket large enough to contain the marketing of a whole village a girl crosses the platform with a handsome brazen ewer hanging on her arm soldiersa dozen at leastare coming in they take the centre again two women in scarlet garb with a great fruit basket a white cap next the same with a green shawl there is a sunburnt daughter of toil her olive skin whitens her white headdress and she is decked in lively colours one beside her who i see counts herself of higher station is distinguished by a smart french mob i am brought round to the gentry side which is filled up as you may easily fancy with much less variety than the other a cart is in the centre its peasant driver not to be unnoticed with a polished tobaccopipe hung over his cleanly blue frock now they float away cologne friday july stbefore i left the interior of the cathedral i ought to have mentioned that the sidechapels contain some superb monuments there is also a curious picture marvellously rich in enamel and colouring of the three kings of cologne and of a small number of the eleven thousand virgins who were said after shipwreck to have landed at this city in the train of st ursula the huns who had possession of the city became enamoured of their beauty and the fair bevy to save themselves from persecution took the veil in commemoration of which event the convent of st ursula was founded and within the walls of that church an immense number of their skulls easily turned into eleven thousand are ranged side by side dressed in green satin caps we left these famous virgins though our own countrywomen unvisited and many other strange sights and what wonder we had but one day and i saw nothing within gate or door except the cathedralnot even rubenss famous picture of the crucifixion of st peter a grateful offering presented by him as an altarpiece for the church in which he was baptized and had served as a chorister among the outrages committed at cologne during the revolution be it noted that the cathedral in was used as a granary and that buonaparte seized on the picture bestowed on his parish church by rubens and sent it to paris the three kings shared the same fate the houses of cologne are very old overhanging and uncouth the streets narrow and gloomy in the cheerfulest of their corners or openings yet oftentimes pleasing windows and balconies make a pretty show of flowers and birds hang on the outside of houses in cages these sound like cheerful images of active leisure but with such feeling it is impossible to walk through these streets yet it is pleasing to note how quietly a dull life may be varied and how innocently though in looking at the plants which yearly put out their summer blossoms to adorn these decaying walls and windows i had something of the melancholy which i have felt on seeing a human being gaily dresseda female tricked out with ornaments while disease and death were on her countenance cologne saturday july ndupon a bright sunny morning driven by a civil old postilion we turned our backs upon the cathedral tower of cologne an everlasting monument of riches and grandeur and i fear of devotion passed away of sublime designs unaccomplishedremaining though not wholly developed sufficient to incite and guide the dullest imagination call up him who left halftold the story of cambuscan bold footnote see il penseroso ll ed feelingly has milton selected this story not from a

p ed bonnthe great area of the vale here is a plain covered with corn vines and fruittrees the impression is of richness profusion amplitude of space the hills are probably higher than some of our own which we call mountains but on the spot we named them hills such they appeared to our eyes but when objects are all upon a large scale there is no means of comparing them accurately with others of their kind which do not bear the same proportions to the objects with which they are surrounded those in the neighbourhood of bonn are of themselves sufficiently interesting in shape and variety of surface but what a dignity does the form of an ancient castle or tower confer upon a precipitous woody or craggy eminence well might this lordly river spare one or two of his castleswhich are too numerous for the most romantic fancy to hang its legends round each and all of themwell might he spare to our purer and more humble streams and lakes one solitary ruin for the delight of our poets of the english mountains to the right but let him keep this to himself it is too grand to be coveted by us is the large ruined castle of gottesberg farspreading on the summit of the hillvery light and elegant with one massy tower for some miles the traveller goes through the magnificent plain which from its great width appears almost circular though unseen the river rhine we never can forget that it is there when the vale becomes narrower one of the most interesting and beautiful of prospects opens on the view from a gentle rising in the road on an island stands a large grey conventsadly pensive among its garden walls and embowering wood the musket and cannon have spared that sanctuary and we were told that though the establishment is dissolved a few of the nuns still remain there attached to the spotor probably having neither friends or other home to repair to on the right bank of the river opposite to us is a bold precipice bearing on its summit a ruined fortress which looks down upon the convent and the warlike and religious edifices are connected together by a chivalrous story of slighted or luckless love which caused the withdrawing of a fair damsel to the island where she founded the monastery another bold ruin stands upon another eminence adjoining and all these monuments of former times combine with villages and churches and dells between the steeps green or cornclad and with the majestic river here spread out like a lake to compose a most affectingly beautiful scene whether viewed in prospect or in retrospect still we rolled along ah far too swiftly and often did i wish that i were a youthful traveller on footstill we rolled alongmeeting the flowing river smooth as glass yet so rapid that the stream of motion is always perceptible even from a great distance the riches of this region are not easily to be fanciedthe pretty pathsthe gardens among plots of vineyard and corncottages peeping from the shadevillages and spiresin neverending variety the trees however in the whole of the country through which we have hitherto passed are not to be compared with the trees of england except on the banks of the meuse on the rhine they are generally small in size much of the wood appears to be cut when young to spring again in the little town of remagan where we changed horses crowds of people of all ages gathered round us the beggars who were indefatigable in clamour might have been the only inhabitants of the place who had any work to do andernachdeparted at about five oclock andernach is an interesting place both at its entrance from cologne and its outlet towards coblentz there is a commanding desolation in the first approach the massy square tower of defence though bearded by green shrubs stands as it were untameable in its strength overlooking the halfruined gateway of the ramparts close to the other gate leading to coblentz are seen many picturesque fragments and masses and the ancient walls shelter and adorn fruitful gardens cradled in the otherwise now useless trenches the town itself appears so dullthe inhabitants so poor that it was almost surprising to observe walks for public use and pleasure with avenues and arbours on the level adjoining the ramparts the struggle between melancholy and cheerfulness fanciful improvements and rapid decay leisure and poverty was very interesting we had a fine evening and the ride though in comparison with the last of little interestthe vale of the rhine being here wide and level the hills lowered by distancewas far from being a dull one as long as i kept myself awake i was roused from sleep in crossing the bridge of the moselle near coblentz coblentz sunday july rdcathedralthe music at our entrance fixed us to our places the swell was solemn even aweful sinking into strains of delicious sweetness and though the worship was to us wholly unintelligible it was not possible to listen to it without visitings of devotional feeling marys attention was entirely absorbed till the service ceased and i think she never stirred from her seat after a little while i left her and drew towards the railing of the gallery to look round on the congregation among whom there appeared more of the oldfashioned gravity and of antique gentility than i have seen anywhere else and the varieties of costume were infinite the area of the cathedral upon which we looked down from the crowded gallery was filled with old middleaged and young persons of both sexes and at coblentz even the male dress especially that of boys and youths has a pleasing cast of antiquity reminding one of old picturesof assemblies in hallsor of banquets as represented by the flemish masters the figure of a young girl tightly laced up in bodice and petticoat with adornings of gold clasps and neckchain beside a youth with open throat and ornamented shirtcollar falling upon the shoulders of a coat of antique cut especially when there chanced to be near them some matron in her costly robe of seventy yearsthese together made an exhibition that even had i been a good catholic yet fresh from england might have interfered with my devotions but where all except the music was an unmeaning ceremony what wonder that i should be amused in looking round as at a show all that we witnessed of bustle or gaiety was near the river facing the fortress of ehrenbreitstein and upon the wide wooden bridge which we crossed in our way to the fortress fruitwomen were seated on the bridge and peasants gentry soldiers continually passing to and fro all but the soldiers paid toll the citadel stands upon a very lofty bare hill and the walk was fatiguing but i beguiled my weariness with the company of a peasant lass who took pains to understand my broken german and contrived to make me acquainted with no small part of her family history this bonny maidens complexion was as fresh as a rose though no kerchief screened it from the sunshine many a fierce breeze and many a burning sun must she have struggled with in her way from the citadel to the town and on looking at her i fancied there must be a stirring and invigorating power in the wind to counteract the cankering effect of the sun which is so noticeable in the french peasantry on their hot dry plains no sooner do you set foot in the neighbourhood of calais than you are struck with it and at the same time with the insensibility of young and old to discomfort from glaring light and heat whatever slender shade of willows may be at the door of a hut on the flats between calais and gravelines the female peasants at their sewing or other work choose it not but seat themselves full in the sunshine thence comes a habit of wrinkling the cheeks and forehead so that their faces are mostly ploughed with wrinkles before they are fifty years old in this country and all through the netherlands the complexions of the people are much fresher and fairer than in france though they also are much out of doors this may perhaps be in part attributed to the greater quantity of wood scattered over the country and to the shade of garden and orchard trees the view from the summit of the hill of ehrenbreitstein is magnificent beneath on a large flat angle formed by the junction of the rhine and the moselle stands the city its purpleslated roofs surrounded by many tall buildingstowers and spires and big palaces among trees the vale of the moselle is deep and green formed by vineclad steeps among which the eye from the heights where we stood espies many a pleasant village that of the rhine is more varied and splendidwith towns that from their size the irregularity of their buildings and the numerous towers and spires give dignity to the proud river itself and to the prodigally scattered hills downwards we looked through the plain along which we had travelled the evening before from the town of andernach which stands as coblentz does upon a low bank of the rhine and there is no eminence between the two towns to obstruct the view the course of the road which is widely parted from that of the river may be seen in a straight line for many miles we behold below us the junction of the two great rivers how steady and quiet is their meeting a little while each goes in his own distinct path side by side yet one stream and they slowly and by degrees unite each lost in the otherhappy type of a tranquil meeting and joining together in the journey of life coblentz as every one knows was for a long time the headquarters of the french noblesse and other emigrants during the revolution and it is surprising that in the exterior of manners and habits there should be so little to remind the passing traveller of the french in ghent and brussels it is impossible to forget that you are in towns not making a part of france yet in both those places the french have sown seeds which will never dietheir manners customs and decorations are everywhere struggling with the native stiffness of the flemish but in coblentz it is merely incidentally that the french courtier or gentleman is brought to mind and shops houses public buildings are all of the soil where they have been rearedso at least they appeared to us in our transient view st goar monday july th the town seen from the heights is very beautiful with purple roofs two tall spires and one tower on the opposite side of the river we peep into narrow valleys formed by the lofty hills on which stand two ruins called as we were told by our lively attendant the katzen and mausen towers ie the towers of the cat and the mouse they stare upon each other at safe distance though near neighbours and across the river the greater fortress of rheinfels defies them both a lovely dell runs behind one of the hills at its opening where it pours out its stream into the rhine we espied a onearched borrowdale bridge and behind the bridge a village almost buried between the abruptlyrising steeps i will transcribe the few words i wrote in my memorandumbook dated beside the rhine st goarhow shall i describe this soothing this elegant place the river flows on i see it flow yet it is like a lakethe bendings of the hills enclosing it at each end here i sit halfway from the centre of the curve at the turning of that semicircular curve stands our inn near it is the posthouse both rather handsome buildings the town softened white and purple the green hills rising abruptly above it behind me but i can not see it is the castle of rheinfels on the opposite banks of the river the vineclad steeps appear as if covered with fern it is a sweep of hills that from this point appear eventopped at the foot of one of the dells which we noticed from the castle eminence there is a purple roofed town with one spire and one church or convent tower and i see the borrowdale bridge beside the lowly hamlet in the cleft of the other dell a ferryboat has been approaching its landingplace with a crew of peasants they come now slowly up from the shore a picturesque train in grey attireno showy colours and at this moment i can fancy that even that circumstance gives a sweeter effect to the scene though i have never wished to expel the crimson garments or the blue from any landscape here let me observe that grey clothingthe pastoral garb of our mountainsdoes when it is found on the banks of the rhine only look well at a certain distance it seems not to be worn from choice but poverty and in this days journey we have met with crowds of people whose dress was accordant with the appearance close at hand of their crumbling houses and fortifications bingen tuesday july thmost delightful to the imagination was our journey of yesterday still tempting to hope and expectation yet wherever we passed through a village or small town the veil of romance was withdrawn and we were compelled to think of human distress and povertytheir causes how various in a country where nature has been so bountifuland even when removed from the immediate presence of painful objects there is one melancholy thought which will attend the traveller along the everwinding course of the rhinethe thought that of those buildings so lavishly scattered on the ridges of the heights or lurking in sheltering corners many have perished all are perishing and will entirely perish buildings that link together the past and the presenttimes of war and depredation of piracy of voyages by stealth and in fear of superstitious ceremonies of monastic life of quiet and of retreat from persecution yet some of the strongest of the fortresses may for aught i know endure as long as the rocks on which they have been reared deserted as they are and never more be tenanted by pirate lord or vassal the parish churches are in bad repair and many ruinous mayencei thought of some thriving friar of old times but last night in reading chaucers prologue to the canterbury tales mine host of the tabard recalled to my memory our merry master in the diningroom at mayence footnote this was when writing out her journal begun two months after her return to rydal mounted a seemly man our hoste was with alle to han bene a marshal in an halle a large

in which you are or the one that leads to it and there is little stirring of people two huge palaces are going to ruin one of these the episcopal palace of red stone is very handsome in its style of heavy architecture and there are many public buildings by the riverside the quay is a cheerful and busy place after driving a short way on the shore below those lofty buildings we crossed a bridge of boats and now had we proceeded in the same direction as before we should have had the rhine on our right hand but we turned back again ie downwards and still had it on our left for two miles more or less not close to us but always in view broad and majestic scattered over with vessels of various kinds large rafters piled with wood were by the shore or floating with the stream and a long row of mills for grinding corn i suppose made a curious appearance on the water we had a magnificent prospect downwards in the rheingaw stretching towards bingen a district famed for producing finer vines than any other country of the rhine the broad hills are enlivened by hamlets villas villages and churches after about two miles the road to wisbaden turns from the river to the right and with regret did we part from our majestic companion to meet no more till we should rejoin him for one short day among the rocks of schaffhausen we went to the cathedral a very large but not otherwise remarkable building in the interior the people assembled at prayers sate on benches as in our country churches and accompanied by the organ were chaunting and making the responses we ascend the tower it is enormously high and after an ascent of above five hundred steps we found a family living in as neatlyfurnished a set of apartments as need be seen in any street in frankfort a baby in the cradle smiled upon us and played with the kreutzers which we gave her the mother was alert and cheerfulnay she seemed to glory in her contentment and in the snugness of her abode i said to her but when the wind blows fiercely how terrible and she replied oh nein es thut nichts oh no it does no harm the view from the cathedral is very extensive the windings of the river maine vessels in their harbours or

stranger may wander the day through the building is of various dates it is not good in architecture as a whole though very fine in parts there is a noble round tower and the remains of the chapel and long ranges of lofty and massy wall often adorned with ivy the figure of a saint a lady or a warrior looking safely from their niches under the ivy bower the moats which must long ago have been drained retain their shape yet have now the wild luxuriance of sequestered dells fruit and forest trees flowers and grass are intermingled i now speak of the more ruinous and the most ancient part of the castle we walked upon a platform before the windows where a band of music used to be stationed as on the terrace at windsora fine place for festivals in time of peace and to keep watch in time of war from the platform where we stood the eye overlooking the city bridge and the deep vale to the point where the neckar is concealed from view by its winding to the left is carried across the plain to the dim stream of the rhine perceived under the distant hills the pleasuregrounds are the most delightful i ever beheld the happiest mixture of wildness which no art could overcome and formality often necessary to conduct you along the ledge of a precipicewhence you may look down upon the river enlivened by boats and on the rich vale or to the more distant scenes before mentioned one long terrace is supported on the side of the precipice by arches resembling those of a roman aqueduct and from that walk the view of the castle and the town beneath it is particularly striking i can not imagine a more delightful situation than heidelberg for a universitythe pleasures ceremonies and distractions of a court being removed parties of students were to be seen in all quarters of the groves and gardens i am sorry however to say that their appearance was not very scholarlike they wear whatever wild and coarse apparel pleases themtheir hair long and disorderly or rough as a waterdog throat bare or with a black collar and often no appearance of a shirt every one has his pipe and they all talk loud and boisterously never surely was any stream more inviting it flows in its deep bedstately yet often turbulent and what dells cleaving the green hills even close to the city looking down upon the purple roofs of heidelberg variously tinted the spectacle is curiousnarrow streets small squares and gardens many and flowery the main street long and also narrow is though the houses are built after no good style very pretty as seen from the heights with its two gateways and two towers the cathedral it has an irregular spire overtops all other edifices which indeed have no grace of architecture and the university is even mean in its exterior but from a small distance any city looks well that is not modern and where there is bulk and irregularity with harmony of colouring but we did not enter the cathedral having so much to see out of doors heidelberg friday july th the first reach of the river for a moment transported our imagination to the vale of the wye above tintern abbey a single cottage with a poplar spire was the central object as we went further villages appeared but mr p soon conducted us from the river up a steep hill and after a long ascent he took us aside to a coneshaped valley a pleasuredelli call it sofor it was terminated by a rural tavern and gardens seats and alcoves placed close beside beautiful springs of pure water spread out into pools and distributed by fountains a grey stone statue in its stillness is a graceful object amid the rushing of water our road along the side of the hill that still rose high above our heads led us through shady covert and open glade over hillock or through hollow at almost every turning convenient seats inviting us to rest or to linger in admiration of the changeful prospects where wild and cultivated grounds seemed equally the darlings of the fostering sun many of the hills are covered with forests which are cut down after little more than thirty years growth the ground is then ploughed and sown with buckwheat and afterwards with beechnuts the forests of firs numerous higher up but not so here are sown in like manner immense quantities of timber are floated down the river sometimes in our delightful walk we were led through tracts of vines all belonging to the grand duke they are as free as the forest thickets and flowery glades and separated from them by no distinguishable boundary whichever way the eye turned it settled upon some pleasant sight passed through the walled town of durlach about two miles from carlesrhue the palace deserted by the duke coffeehouses all full windows open billiards wine and smoking finery shabbiness and idleness large pleasure gardens beyond the barrierwalls and we enter an avenue of tall poplars continued all the way to carlesrhue after a little while nothing was to be seen but the poplar stems in shape of columns on each side the leafy part of the trees forming a long black wall above them so lofty that it appeared to reach the sky that pale blue roof of the gothic aisle still contracting in the distance and seemingly of interminable length such an avenue is truly a noble approach to the favoured residence of a grand duke badenbaden july th saturday met with oldfashioned civility in all quarters this little town is a curious compound of rural life german countrytownishness wateringplace excitements court stateliness ancient mouldering towers old houses and new and a life and cheerfulness over all a bright reflection from the evening sky powdered with golden dust that distant vapoury plain bounded by the chain of purple mountains we quitted this spectacle with regret when it faded in the late twilight struggling with the light of the moon road to homburgsunday july thwe were continually reminded of the vales of our own country in this lovely winding valley where seven times we crossed the clear stream over strong wooden bridges but whenever in our travels the streams and vales of england have been most called to mind there has been something that marks a difference here it is chiefly observable in the large brown wood houses and in the peoplethe shepherd and shepherdess gaiety of their dress with a sort of antiquated stiffness groups of children in rustic flowercrowned hats were in several places collected round the otherwise solitary swineherd the sound of the stream if there be any sound is a sweet unwearied and unwearying undersong to detain the pious passenger which he can not but at times connect with the silent object of his worship road to schaffhausena part of the way through the uncleared forest was pleasingly wild juniper bushes broom and other woodland plants among the moss and flowery turf before we had finished our last ascent the postilion told us what a glorious sight we might have seen in a few moments had we been here early in the morning or on a fine evening but as it was midday nothing was to be expected that glorious sight which should have been was no less than the glittering prospect of the mountains of switzerland we did burst upon an extensive view but the mountains were hidden and of the lake of constance we saw no more than a vapoury substance where it lay among apparently low hills this first sight of that country so dear to the imagination though then of no peculiar grandeur affected me with various emotions i remembered the shapeless wishes of my youthwishes without hopemy brothers wanderings thirty years ago and the tales brought to me the following christmas holidays at forncett and often repeated while we paced together on the gravel walk in the parsonage garden by moon or star light the towers of schaffhausen appear under the shelter of woody and vineclad hills but no greetings from the river rhine which is not visible from this approach yet flowing close to the town but at the entrance of the old city gates you can not but be roused and say to yourself here is something which i have not seen before yet i hardly know what the houses are grey irregular dull overhanging and clumsy streets narrow and crookedthe walls of houses often halfcovered with rudelypainted representations of the famous deeds of the defenders of this land of liberty in place of the splendour of faded aristocracy so often traceable in the german towns there is a character of ruggedness over all that we see never shall i forget the first view of the stream of the rhine from the bank and between the side openings of the bridgerapid in motion bright and green as liquid emeralds and wherever the water dashed against tree stone or pillar of the bridge the sparkling and the whiteness of the foam melting into and blended with the green can hardly be imagined by any one who has not seen the rhine or some other of the great rivers of the continent before they are sullied in their course the first visible indication of our approach to the cataracts was the sublime tossing of vapour above them at the termination of a curved reach of the river upon the woody hill above that tossing vapour and foam we saw the old chateau familiar to us in prints though there represented in connection with the falls themselves and now seen by us at the end of the rapid yet majestic sweep of the river where the everspringing tossing clouds are all that the eye beholds of the wonderful commotion but an awful sound ascends from the concealed abyss and it would almost seem like irreverent intrusion if a stranger at his first approach to this spot should not pause and listen before he pushes forward to seek the revelation of the mystery we were gloriously wetted and stunned and deafened by the waters of the rhine it is impossible even to remember therefore how should i enable any one to imagine the power of the dashing and of the sounds the breezes the dancing dizzy sensations and the exquisite beauty of the colours the whole stream falls like liquid emeraldsa solid mass of translucent green hue or in some parts the green appears through a thin covering of snowlike foam below in the ferment and hurlyburly drifting snow and masses resembling collected snow mixed with sparkling green billows we walked upon the platform as dizzy as if we had been on the deck of a ship in a storm mary returned with mrs monkhouse to schaffhausen and william recrossed in a boat with mr monkhouse and me near the extremity of the rivers first sweep after its fall where its bed as is usual at the foot of all cataracts is exceedingly widened and larger in proportion to the weight of waters the boat is trusted to the current and the passage though long is rapid at first when seated in that small unresisting vessel a sensation of helplessness and awe it was not fear overcame me but that was soon over from the centre of the stream the view of the cataract in its majesty of breadth is wonderfully sublime being landed we found commodious seats from which we could look round at leisure and we remained till the evening darkness revealed two intermitting columns of fire which ascended from a forge close to the cataract footnote his first visit to the alps with robert jones in ed footnote compare dorothy wordsworths letters written at forncett rectory in ed monday july sthornbergafter this over the wide country to villengen a walled town upon the treeless waste the way unvaried except by distant views of remnants of the forest and towns or villages shelterless and at long distances from each other they are very striking objects they stand upon the waste in disconnection with everything else and one is at a loss to conceive how any particular town came to be placed in this spot or that nature having framed no allurement of valley shelter among the undulations of the wide expanse each town stands upon its site as if it might have been wheeled thither there is no sympathy no bond of connection with surrounding fields not a fence to be seen no woods for shelter only the dreary black patches and lines of forest used probably for fuel and often far fetched in short it is an unnaturallooking region in comparison with the social intermixture of towns villages cottages fruittrees corn and meadow land which we had so often travelled through the feeling was something like what one has in looking at a dead yet gaudy picture painted by an untutored artist who first makes his country then claps upon it according to his fancy such buildings as he thinks will adorn it thursday august rdzurichat a little distance from zurich we remarked a very fine oak tree under its shade stood a little building like an oratory but as we were not among the roman catholics it puzzled us in front of the tree was an elevated platform resembling the mount at rydal to be ascended by steps the postilion told us the building was a chapel whither condemned criminals retired to pray and there had their hair cut off and that the platform was the place of execution august thlenzburg at six oclock we caught a glimpse of the castle walls glittering in sunshine a hopeful sign and we set forward through the fog the ruin stands at the brink of a more than perpendicular an overhanging rock on the top of a green hill which rises abruptly from the town the steepest parts are ascended by hundreds of stone steps worn by age often broken and halfburied in turf and flowers these steps brought us to a terrace bordered by neatlytrimmed vines and we found ourselves suddenly in broad sunshine under the castle walls elevated above an ocean of vapour which was bounded on one side by the clear line of the jura mountains and out of which rose at a distance what seemed an island crested by another castle we then ascended the loftiest of the towers and the spectacle all around was magnificent visionaryi was going to say endless but on one side was the substantial barrier of the jura by degrees the vapours settling or shifting other castles were seen on island eminences and the tops of bare or woody hills taking the same island form while trees resembling ships appeared and disappeared and rainbow lights scarcely more visionary than the mimic islands passed over or for a moment rested on the breaking mists on the other side the objects were more slowly developed we looked long before we could distinguish the fardistant alps but by degrees discovered them shining like silver among masses of clouds the intervening wide space was a sea of vapour but we stayed on the eminence till the sun had mastery of all beneath us after a silent process of change and interchangeof concealing and revealing i hope we were not ungrateful to the memory of past times when standing on the summit of helvellyn scaw fell fairfield or skiddaw we have felt as if the world itself could not present a more sublime spectacle herzogenboscheeat length we dropped asleep but were soon roused by a fitful sound of gathering winds heavy rain followed and vivid flashes of lightning with tremendous thunder it was very awful mary and i were sitting together alone in the open street a strange situation yet we had no personal fear before the storm began all the lights had been extinguished except one opposite to us and another at an inn behind where were turbulent noises of merriment with singing and haranguing in the style of our village politicians these ceased and after the storm lights appeared in different quarters pellmell rushed the fountain then came a watchman with his dismal recitative song or lay the church clock telling the hours and the quarters and house clocks with their silvery tone one scream we heard from a human voice but no person seemed to notice us except a man who came out upon the wooden gallery of his house right above our heads looked down this way and that and especially towards the voitures the beating of the rain and the rushing of that fountain were continuous and with the periodical and the irregular sounds among which the howling of a dog was not the least dismal completed the wildness of the awful scene and of our strange situation sheltered from wet yet in the midst of itand exposed to intermitting blasts though struggling with excessive heatwhile flashes of lightning at intervals displayed the distant mountains and the wide space between at other times a blank gloom bernethe fountains of berne are ornamented with statues of william tell and other heroes there is a beautiful order a solidity a gravity in this city which strikes at first sight and never loses its effect the houses are of one grey hue and built of stone they are large and sober but not heavy or barbarously elbowing each other on each side is a covered passage under the upper stories as at chester only wider much longer and with more massy supporters in all quarters we noticed the orderly decency of the passengers the handsome public buildings with appropriate decorations symbolical of a love of liberty of order and good government with an aristocratic stateliness yet free from show or parade the greentinted river flows belowwide full and impetuous i saw the snows of the alps burnished by the sun about half an hour before his setting after that they were left to their wintry marble coldness without a farewell gleam yet suddenly the city and the cathedral tower and trees were singled out for favour by the sun among his glittering clouds and gilded with the richest light a few minutes and that glory vanished i stayed till evening gloom was gathering over the city and over hill and dale while the snowy tops of the alps were still visible sunday august thupon a spacious level adjoining the cathedral are walks planted with trees among which we sauntered and were much pleased with the great variety of persons amusing themselves in the same way and how we wished that one at least of our party had the skill to sketch rapidly with the pencil and appropriate colours some of the groups or single figures passing before us or seated in sun or shade old ladies appeared on this summer parade dressed in flycaps such as were worn in england fifty years ago and broadflowered chintz or cotton gowns the bourgeoises in grave attire of black with tight white sleeves yet seldom without ornament of gold lacing or chain and earrings and on the head a pair of stiff transparent butterfly wings spread out from behind a quarter of a yard on each side which wings are to appearance as thin as gauze but being made of horsehair are very durable and the larger are even made of wire among these were seen peasants in shepherdess hats of straw decorated with flowers and coloured ribands pretty little girls in grandmothers attire and ladies Ã  la franÃ§aise we noticed several parties composed of persons dressed after these various modes that seemed to indicate very different habits and stations in societythe peasant and the lady the petty shopkeeper and the wealthy tradesmans wife side by side in friendly discourse but it is impossible by words to give a notion of the enlivening effect of these little combinations which are also interesting as evidences of a state of society worn out in england here you see formality and simplicity antiquated stateliness and decent finery brought together with a pervading spirit of comfortable equality in social pleasures monday august thi sate under an elm tree looking down the woody steep to the lake and across it to a rugged mountain no villages to be seen no houses the higher alps shut out i could have forgotten switzerland and fancied myself transported to one of the lonesome lakes of scotland i returned to my open station to watch the setting sun and remained long after the glowing hues had faded from those chosen summits that were touched by his beams while others were obscurely descried among clouds in their own dark or snowy mantle met with an inscription on a grey stone in a little opening of the wood and would have copied it for it was brief but could not see to read the letters and hurried on still choosing the track that seemed to lead most directly downwards and was indeed glad when i found myself again in the public road to the town late as it was and although twilight had almost given place to the darkness of a fine august night i was tempted aside into a broad flat meadow where i walked under a row of tall poplars by the riverside the castle church and town appeared before us in stately harmony all hues of red roofs and painting having faded away two groups of giant poplars rose up like grecian temples from the level between me and the mass of towers and houses in the smooth water the lingering brightness of evening was reflected from the sky and lights from the town were seen at different heights on the hill thun tuesday august ththe lake of thun is essentially a lake of the alps its immediate visible boundary third or fourthrate mountains but overtopping these are seen the snowy or dark summits of the jungfrau the eiger the stockhorn the blumlis alp and many more which i can not name while the kander and other raging streams send their voices across the wide waters the remains of a ruined castle are sometimes seen upon a woody or grassy steeppleasing remembrances of distant times but taking no primary place in the extensive landscape where the power of nature is magisterial and where the humble villages composed of numerous houses clustering together near the lake do not interfere with the impressions of solitude and grandeur many of those villages must be more than halfdeserted when the herdsmen follow their cattle to the mountains others of their numerous inhabitants find subsistence by fishing in the lake we floated cheerfully along the scene for ever changing on the eastern side to our left the shores are more populous than on the western one pretty village succeeded another each with its spire till we came to a hamlet all of brown wood houses except one large white dwelling and no church the villages are not as one may say in close neighbourhood but a substantial solitary house is sometimes seen between them the eminences on this side as we advance become very precipitous and along the ridge of one of them appears a wall of rocks with turrets resembling a mighty fortification the boatmen directed our ears to the sound of waterfalls in a cleft of the mountain but the sight of them we must leave to other voyagers the broad pyramidal mountain niesen rising directly from the lake on the western side towards the head is always a commanding object its form recalled to my remembrance some of the stony pyramids of glencoe but only its form the surface being covered with green pasturage sometimes in the course of the morning we had been reminded of our own country but transiently and never without a sense of characteristic difference many of the distinctions favourable to switzerland i have noticed and it seems as if i were ungrateful to our own pellucid lakes those darlings of the summer breezes but when floating on the lake of thun we did not forget them the greenish hue of its waters is much less pleasing than the cerulean or purple of the lakes of cumberland and westmoreland the reflections are less vivid shore and water do not so delicately blend together hence a coasting voyage can not be accompanied with an equal variety of minute objects and i might add many other little circumstances or incidents that enliven the banks of our lakes for instance in a summer forenoon the troops of cattle that are seen solacing themselves in the cool waters within the belt of a pebbly shore or if the season do not drive them thither how they beautify the pastures and rocky unenclosed grounds while on the lake of thun we did not see a single group of cattle of any kind i have not spoken of that other sky received into the bosom of our lakes on tranquil summer evenings for the time of day prevented our being reminded in the same degree of what we have so often beheld at such times but it is obvious that though the reflections from masses of brilliant clouds must often be very grand the clouds in their delicate hues and forms can not be seen in the same soft distinctness bedded in another sky in this pleasing valley we whirled away again as to the first sound of a frenchmans whip in the streets of calais as blithe as children when all at once looking through a narrow opening of green and craggy mountains the jungfrau the virgin burst upon our view dazzling in brightness which seemed rather heightened than diminished by a mantle of white clouds floating over the bosom of the mountain the effect was indescribable we had before seen the snows of the alps at a distance propped as i may say against the sky or blending with and often indistinguishable from it and now with the suddenness of a pantomimic change we beheld a great mountain of snow very near to us as it appeared and in combination with hills covered with flourishing trees in the pride of summer foliage our mirth was checked and awestruck yet delighted we stopped the car for some minutes soon after we discovered the town of unterseen which stands right under the hill and close to the river aar a most romantic spot the large ancient wooden houses of the marketplace joining each other yet placed in wondrous disregard of order and built with uncouth and grotesque variety of gallery and penthouse the roofs are mostly secured from the wind by large rough stones laid upon them at the end of the town we came to a bridge which we were to pass over and here almost as suddenly was the river aar presented to our view as the maidenmountain in her resplendent garb had been before hitherto the river had been concealed by or only partially seen through the trees but at unterseen it is imperious and will be heard seen and felt in a fit of rage it tumbles over a craggy channel spreading out and dividing into different streams crossed by the long ponderous wooden bridge that steady and rugged adds to the wild grandeur of the spectacle i recollect one woody eminence far below us about which we doubted whether the object on its summit was rock or castle and the point remained undecided until on our way to lauterbrunnen we saw the same above our heads on its perpendicular steep a craggy barrier fitted to war with the tempests of ten thousand years if summer days had been at our command we should have remained till sunset upon our chosen eminence but another on the opposite side of the vale named the hohlbuhl invited us and we determined to go thither yet what could be looked for more delightful than the sights which by stirring but a few yards from our elastic couch on the crags we might see all round us on one side the river aar streaming through the verdant vale on the other the pastoral walnuttree plain with its one chapel and innumerable huts bounded by varied steeps and leading the eye and still more the fancy into its recesses and to the snowy barrier of the jungfrau we descended on the side opposite to that by which we climbed the hill along an easy and delightful track cut in the forest among noble trees chiefly beeches winding round the hill we saw the bridge above the inn which we must cross to reach the foot of the other eminence we hurried along through fields woody lanes and beside cottages where children offered us nosegays gathered from their shady gardens every image every object in the vale was soothing or cheerful it seemed a paradise cradled in rugged mountains at many a cottage door we could have loitered till daylight was gone the way had appeared short at a distance but we soon found out our want of skill in measuring the vales of switzerland and long before we had reached the foot of the hill perceived that the sun was sinking and would be gone before our labour was ended the strong pushed forward and by patience i too at last gained the desired point a little too late for the brilliance had deserted all but the highest mountains they presented a spectacle of heavenly glory and long did we linger after the rosy lights had passed away from their summits and taken a station in the calm sky above them it was ten oclock when we reached the inn footnote after the sunshine has left the mountaintops the sky frequently becomes brighter and of the same hue as if the light from the hills had retreated thitherd w brienz wednesday august th there was something in the exterior of the people belonging to the inn at brienz that reminded one of the ferryhouses in the highlandsa sort of untamed familiarity with strangers and an expression of savage fearlessness in danger while we were waiting at the door a company of females came up returning from harvest labours in the vale of berne to their homes at the head of the lake they gathered round eyeing us steadily and presently a girl began to sing another joined a third a fourth and then a fifth their arms gracefully laid over each others shoulders large black or straw hats shaded their heads undecked with ribands and their attire was grey the air they sang was plaintive and wild without sweetness yet not harsh the group collected round that lonely house on the rivers edge would have made a pretty picture the shore of brienz as far as we saw it is much richer in intricate graces than the shores of the lake of thun its little retiring bays and shaggy rocks reminded me sometimes of loch ketterine our minstrel peasants passed us on the water no longer singing plaintive ditties such as inspired the little poem which i shall transcribe in the following page but with bursts of merriment they rowed lustily away the poet has however transported the minstrels in their gentle mood from the cottage door to the calm lake what know we of the blest above but that they sing and that they love yet if they ever did inspire a mortal hymn or shaped the choir now where those harvest damsels float homeward in their rugged boat while all the ruffling winds are fled each slumbering on some mountains head now surely hath that gracious aid been felt that influence displayd pupils of heaven in order stand the rustic maidens every hand upon a sisters shoulders laid to chant as angels do above the melodies of peace in love footnote see the poetical works vol vi p in memorials of a tour on the continent scene on the lake of brientzed interlachen thursday august thmany a streamlet crossed our way after tumbling down the hillssometimes as clear as the springs of our westmoreland mountains but the instant they touched the glacier river of the valley their pure spirit was lostannihilated by its angry waters i have seen a muddy and a transparent streamlet at a few yards distance hurrying down the same steep in one instance the two joined at the bottom travelled side by side in the same track remaining distinct though joined together as if each were jealous of its own character yielding to mild necessity they slowly blended ere both in turbulent disrespect were swallowed up by the master torrent the jungfrau till then hidden except a small portion of its summit burst upon our view covered with snow from its apparent base to its highest pike we had been ascending nearly four hours and all at once the wintery mountain appeared before us of majestic bulk though but a small part of that mass springing from the same foundation some of the pikes of which are seen far and wide from every quarter of the compass and we after all this climbing seemed not nearer to the top than when we had viewed what appeared to be the highest summits from below we were all on foot and at the moment when about to turn to our left and coast along the side of the hill which sloping down to the base of the snowy mountain forms a hollow between suddenly we heard a tremendous noiseloud like thunder and all stood still it was the most awful sound which had ever struck upon our ears for some minutes we did not utter a single wordand when the sound was dying away exclaimed it is an avalanche eagerly asking where and whence it had come the guide pointed to a very small and almost perpendicular rivulet as it appeared to us perfectly whiteand dashing down the mountainsthat said he is the avalanche we could not believe that such mighty tumult had proceeded from a little rill to our eyes it was nothing else though composed of falling masses of snow and probably ice and i suspect we were loth to leave the mystery explained however we were compelled to yield to our guides experience seeing a few minutes after the motion of the little white rill or torrent gradually settle till all was gone and perfect silence succeeded silence more awful even than the noise which had preceded it the hollow alongside of which our course lay might be in length half a league on our right was the jungfrau in stillness of deepest winter and the opposite hill the wengern was carpeted with green grass and flowers these heights were pastured by cattle and we began to hear the tinkling of their bells and shouts from boys at a distance but no other stirring till we reached a single hut near the end of the sloping hollow the only one visible hereabouts at the door of the hut our steeds were let loose to pasture and we entered two or three young men and boys displayed the stores of their cupboardone little piece of wheaten bread to help out the small supply which we had brought plenty of cheese and milk in abundance it was not better than a savage shelter and the youths looked as if they had had no valley culture simple goodwill however cheerful smiles and stores proffered without reserve made all delightful and had a shower and a wintry blast visited us from the jungfrau we should have rejoiced in the comfort of that shelter but the sun shone with peculiar brightness enriching the soft green ground and giving dazzling brilliancy to the snow we desired our attendants to bring their stores into the open air and seated ourselves on the turf beside the household spring so let me call it though but a child of summer at the foot of the icy mountain the warm sun shone upon us the air invigorated our spirits and we were as gay as larks that soar in a region far below ours on that happy afternoon again we heard the thunder of avalanches and saw them bursting out fresh foaming springs the sound is loud as thunder but more metallic and musical it also may be likened to the rattling of innumerable chariots passing over rocky places soon the vale lay before us with its two glaciers andas it might seemits thousand cabins sown upon the steeps the descent became so precipitous that all were obliged to walk deep we go into the broad cradlevalley every cottage we passed had its small garden and cherrytrees sprinkled with leaves bearing halfgrown halfripe fruit in plunging into this vale i was overcome with a sense of melancholy pervading the whole scenenot desolation or dreariness it is not the melancholy of the scotch highlands but connected with social life in loneliness not less than with the strife of all the seasons the sunshine had long deserted the valley and was quitting the summits of the mountains behind the village but red hues dark as the red of rubies settled in the clouds and lingered there after the mountains had lost all but their cold whiteness and the black hue of the crags the gloomy grandeur of this spectacle harmonised with the melancholy of the vale yet it was heavenly glory that hung over those cold mountains footnote from the wengern alpd w grindelwald friday august thscheideck to meiringento our right looking over the green cradle of the vale we saw the glacier with the stream issuing from beneath an arch of solid icethe small pyramids around it of a greyish colour mingled with vitriol green the bed of icy snow above looked sullied so that the glacier itself was not beautiful like what we had read of but the mass of mountains behind their black crags and shadows and the awful aspect of winter encroaching on the valleydomain combinations so new to us made ample amends for any disappointment we might feel the rain came on in heavy drops but did not drive us to the closer shelter of the house we heeded not the sprinkling which a gust of wind sometimes sent in upon us good fortune had hitherto favoured us and even if we had been detained at that house all night the inconvenience would have been trifling our spirits were uplifted and we felt as if it would be a privilege to be admitted to a near acquaintance with alpine storms this at least was my feeling till the threatenings were over and then by happy transition i gladly hailed the bursting light of the sun that flashed upon the crags seen by glimpses between the dispersing clouds the interior of the house was roomy and warm and though the floors were of the bare soil everything looked cleanly the wooden vessels were pretty ladles and spoons curiously carved and all neatly arranged on shelves three generations making a numerous family were there living together in the summer season with their cattle on the rough pastures round them no doubt the main support of the household but the gains from travellers must be considerable we were surprised at being asked if we chose coffee hardly should we have deserved our welcome shelter had we not preferred the peasants farecheese milk and cream with the addition of bread fetched from the vale and i must not omit a dish of fruitbilberrieshere very fine indeed most of our mountain plants except the branchy fern and the common daisy which we rarely saw grow in lavish beauty and many others unknown to us that enamel the turf like gems the monkshood of our gardens growing at a great height on the alps has a brighter hue than elsewhere it is seen in tufts that to my fancy presented fairy groves upon the green grass and in rocky places or under trees footnote all these alps are occupied by owners of land in the valleys who have a right in common according to the quantity of their land the cheeses like the rest of the produce are the property of all and the distribution takes place at the end of the seasond w the storm over we proceeded still in the forest which led us through different compartments of the vale each of itself a little valley of the loveliest greenness on all sides skirted with pinetrees and often sprinkled with huts the summer dwellings of the herdsmen sometimes seen through a lateral opening a meadow glade not much larger than a calfgarth would have its single dwelling but the memory of one particular spotthe perfect image of peace and pastoral seclusionremains with me as vividly as when apart from my companions i travelled over its soft carpet of turf that valleyreach might be in length a quarter of a mile or more and of proportionate width surrounded by hills covered with pines overtopped by craggy mountains it was an apparently level plain as smooth as velvet and our course through the centre on our right flowed the grey stream from the glaciers with chastened voice and motion and on the other were many cabins in an almost formal line separated from each other and elevated upon wooden pillars the grass growing round and under them there was not a sound except of the gushing stream no cattle to be seen nor any living creature our way continued through interchange of pastoral and forest ground crossed a bridge and then had the stream to our left in a rocky gulf overhung with trees chiefly beeches and elms sawingmills on the river very picturesque it is impossible to imagine a more beautiful descent than was before us to the vale of hasli the roaring stream was our companion sometimes we looked down upon it from the edge of a lofty precipice sometimes descended towards it and could trace its furious course for a considerable way the torrent bounded over rocks and still went foaming on no pausingplaces no gentle windings no pools under the innumerable smaller cataracts the substance and the grey hue still the same whether the stream rushed in one impetuous current down a regularly rough part of its steep channel or laboured among rocks in cloudshaped heavings or in boisterous fermentation we saw the cataract through an open window it is a

called pleasure it was astonishment and awean overwhelming sense of the powers of nature for the destruction of all things and of the helplessness of manof the weakness of his will if prompted to make a momentary effort against such a force what weight and speed of waters and what a tossing of grey mist though at a considerable distance from the fall when standing at the window a shower of misty rain blew upon us footnote the fall of the reichenbached meiringen saturday august thagain crossed the river then up a bare precipice and along a gallery hewn out of the rock downwards to the valley more bare and open a sprinkling of pines among which the peasants were making hay hamlets and single huts not far asunder no thought of dreariness crossed my mind yet a pensiveness was spread over the long valley where year by year the same simple employments go on in succession and where the tempests of winter are patiently endured and thoughtfully guarded against the chÃ¢let at handek is large four long apartments in one of which our mules rested several men were living there for the summer season but no women they served us with the same kindliness we had experienced on the wengern and scheidegg alps but with slowness and gravity these men were very tall and had a sedate deportment generally noticed i find by travellers in ober hasli where the race has for centuries been distinguished by peculiar customs manners and habits from the brink of a rock we looked down the falls and along the course of the torrent the spectacle was tremendous and from that point not less beautiful the position of the sun here favoured us and we beheld the arch of a bright rainbow steadily poised on the cloud of vapour below us that burst out of the terrific waters we looked down with awe upon the river throwing his giant body oer the steep rocks brink yet at first hardly without personal fear the noise was so great we could not help fancying it shook the very rock on which we stood that feeling passed away while i lay on my bed the terrible solitudes of the wetterhorn were revealed to me by fitsits black chasms and snowy dark grey summits all night and all day and for ever the vale of meiringen is sounding with torrents meiringen sunday august thrain over and the storm past away long before the sunshine had touched the top of any other mountain the snow upon the wetterhorn shone like silver and its grey adamantine towers appeared in a soft splendour all their own i looked in vain for the rosy tints of morning of which i had so often heard but they could not have been more beautiful than the silvery brightness lake of lungernat an upper window of one of a cluster of houses at the foot of the valley a middleaged man with a long beard was kneeling with a book in his hand he fixed his eyes upon us and while his devotions were still going on made me a bow i passed slowly and looked into that house with prying eyes it was so different from any other and so much handsomer the wooden ceiling of the room where the friar or monk such i suppose him to be knelt at his prayers was curiously inlaid and carved and the walls hung with pictures the picturesque accompaniments of the roman catholic religion the elegant white chapels on the hills the steady grave people going to church and the cheerfulness of the valley had put me into good humour with the religion itself but while we were passing through this very hamlet and close to the mansion of the godly man mr m having lost the cork of a little flask i asked the guide to buy or beg for us another at one of the cottages and he shook his head assuring me they would neither give nor sell anything to us protestants except in the regular way of trade they would do nothing for us out of goodwill i had been too happy in passing through the tranquil valley to be ready to trust my informer and having first obliged him to make the request i asked myself at two respectable houses and met with a refusal and no very gracious looks sarnen monday august ththe road to the monastery is marked by small pillars of grey stone not more than a quarter of a mile asunder at the top of each pillar is a square cupboard as i may call it or it more resembles the head of a clock where secure from the rain are placed paintings of the history of our saviour from his birth to his ascension some of the designs are very pretty taken no doubt from better pictures and they generally tell their tale intelligibly the pillars are in themselves pleasing objects in connection with the background of a crag or overhanging treea streamlet or a bridgeand how touchingly must their pictured language have spoken to the heart of many a weary devotee the ascent through the forest was interesting on every account it led us sometimes along the brink of precipices and always far above the boisterous river we frequently met or were overtaken by peasants mostly bearing heavy burthens we spoke to each other but here i could not understand three words of their language nor they of mine engelberg mount titlis tuesday august thwe breakfasted in view of the flashing silvertopped mount titlis and its grey crags a sight that roused williams youthful desires and in spite of weak eyes and the weight of fifty winters he could not repress a longing to ascend that mountain but my brother had had his own visions of glory and had he been twenty years younger sure i am that he would have trod the summit of the titlis soon after breakfast we were warned to expect the procession and saw it issuing from the church priests in their white robes choristers monks chanting the service banners uplifted and a fulldressed image of the virgin carried aloft the people were divided into several classes the men bareheaded and maidens taking precedency of the married women i suppose because it was the festival of the virgin the procession formed a beautiful stream upon the green level winding round the church and convent thirteen hundred people were assembled at engelberg and joined in this service the unmarried women wore straw hats ornamented with flowers white bodices and crimson petticoats the dresses of the elder people were curious what a display of neckchains and earrings of silver and brocaded stomachers some old men had coats after the mode of the time of the spectator with worked seams boys and even young men wore flowers in their straw hats we entered the convent but were only suffered to go up a number of staircases and through long whitewashed galleries hung with portraits of saints and prints of remarkable places in switzerland and particularly of the vale and convent of engelberg with plans and charts of the mountains etc there are now only eighteen monks and the abbot no longer exists his office i suppose became extinct with his temporal princedom i strolled to the chapel near the inn a pretty white edifice entered by a long flight of steps no priest but several young peasants in shepherdess attire of jackets and showy petticoats and flowery hats were paying their vows to the virgin a colony of swallows had built their nests within the cupola in the centre of the circular roof they were flying overhead and their voices seemed to me an harmonious accompaniment to the silent devotions of those rustics lucerne wednesday august thlucerne stands close to the shore at the foot of the lake of the four cantons the river reuss after its passage from the mountain of st gothard falls into that branch called the lake of uri and issues out of another branch at lucerne passing through the town the river has three long wooden bridges and another bridge feet in length called the cathedral bridge crosses a part of the lake and leads to the cathedral thither we repaired having first walked the streets and purchased a straw hat for francs at the shop of a pleasant talkative milliner on whose counter taking up a small pamphlet a german magazine we were surprised at opening upon our own name and still more surprised to find it in connection with my brothers poem on the duddon so recently published but i was going to lead you to the end of the long bridge under a dark roof of wood crossed and sustained by heavy beams on each of which on both sidesso that they face you both in going and returningsome portion of scripture history is represented beginning with adam and eve and ending with the resurrection and ascension of christ these pictures to the number of though to be sure woful things as works of artare by no means despicable daubs and while i looked at them myself it pleased me much more to see the peasants bringing their burthens to the city often stay their steps with eyes cast upwards the lake is seen through the openings of the bridge pleasant houses not crowded on its green banks it was dark when we reached the inn we took tea at one end of the unoccupied side of the table in the salleÃ manger while on the other side a large party were at supper before we had finished a bustle at the door drew our attention to a traveller rather an odd figure appeared in a greatcoat mary said he is like mr robinson he turned round while talking german with loud voice to the landlord and all at once we saw that it was mr robinson himself our joy can not be expressed if he had brought the half of old england along with him we could not have been more glad we started up with one consent and no doubt all operations at the suppertable were suspended but we had no eyes for that mr robinson introduced two young men his companions an american and a scotchmangenteel modest youths who the ceremony of introduction over slipped away to the suppertable wishing to leave us to ourselves we were indeed happyand mr robinson was not less so he seemed as if he had in one moment found two homes his english home and his home in germany though it were in the heart of switzerland lucerne friday august thmerrily we floated between the soft banks of the first reach of the lake keeping near the left shore plots of corn interspersed among trees and green slopes with pleasant houses not neighbouring one another as at zurich nor yet having a character of loneliness then we come to low shaggy rocks forming pretty little bays and a singular rock appears before us in the water the terminating point of the promontory that point passed the kusnach branch opening out on our left hand we are soon on the body of the lake from which the four smaller branches of lucerne winkel alpnach and kusnach may be said to proceed the lake is full and stately the mountains are magnificent the town of lucerne its red roofs softened even in the sunshine of this bright day by distance is an elegant termination of its own compartment backed by low hills rowing round the rocky point we lose sight of that quarter the long reach of kusnach is before us bordered by soft shores with thinlyscattered villages and but few detached cottages behind us the lake stretches out to mount pilatus dark rugged and loftythe sarnen and meiringen mountains beyond and the summits surrounding the hidden valley of engelberg in the opposite quarter footnote which

more than three or four houses and a church built on the same site masses of barren rubbish lie close to the houses where but a few years past nothing was seen but fruitful fields we dined at the inn and were waited on by the landlady whose headdress was truly surprising she wore from the back of the neck to the forehead a cap shaped like a onearched bridge with high parapets of stiff muslin the path of the bridge covered with artificial flowerswonderously unbecoming for she was a plain womannot youngand her hair i think powdered was drawn tight up from the forehead she served us with very small fish from the lake excellently cooked boiled milk eggs an omelet and dessert from the room where we dined we had a view of the lake of zong formerly separated from the small lake of lowertz only by fertile grounds such as we now beheld stretching down to its shores yes from a window in that house on its desolate site we beheld this lovely prospect and nothing of the desolation seewen august th sundaya small white church with a graceful tower mitretopped and surmounted by a slender spire was in prospect upon an eminence in the vale and thitherward the people led us passing through the small village of engelbole at the foot of that green eminence we ascended to the churchyard where was a numerous assemblage you must not forget it was sunday keeping festival it was like a fair to the eye but no squalls of trumpets or whistlesno battering of childrens drumsall the people quiet yet cheerfulcakes and fruit spread abundantly on the churchyard wall a beautiful prospect from that spotnew scenes to tempt us forward we descended by a long flight of steps into the vale and after about half a miles walking we arrived at brunnen espied wm and m upon a crag above the village and they directed us to the eagle inn where i instantly seated myself before a window with a long reach of the lake of uri before me the magnificent commencement to our regular approach to the st gothard pass of the alps my first feeling was of extreme delight in the excessive beauty of the scenei had expected something of a more awful impression from the lake of uri but nothing so beautiful footnote

golden cross upon one of the steeples shone forth at times as bright as a star in heaven against the black mountainwall while the transient touchings of the moonlight produced a most romantic effect upon the manycoloured paintings on the wall of the old tower i sate a long time at my window keeping watch and wishing for a companion that i might walk at length however when i was preparing to go to bed after ten oclock mr r tapped at my door to tell me that mr m was going out i hastily redressed myself and we two then sallied forth together a fierce hot wind drove through the streets whirling

separated it from the salon where at my return guests were at supper i heard every word they spoke as distinctly as if i had been of the party though without understanding more than that a careful father was travelling with his two boys to whom he talked incessantly but so kindly and pleasantly that i hardly wished to get rid of his voice we had broad flashes of lightning after i was in bed but no thunder this reminds me that we could have no fresh bread for breakfast in the morning the bakers having as we were told been prohibited since the destructive fire under a heavy penalty from heating their ovens except when the air is calm i think it must often be the lot of the good people of altorf to gnaw a hard crust for these mountains are fine brewingplaces for the winds and the vale

which behind is buried beneath overhanging woods we ascended to the upper rooms by a blind staircase that might have belonged to a turret of one of our ancient castles which conducted us into a gothic room where we found neither the ghost nor the armour of william tell but an artist at work with the pencil with two or three young men his pupils from altorf no better introduction to the favour of

spared by the fire which consumed an adjoining building happily spared if only for the sake of the rude paintings on its walls i studied them with infinite satisfaction especially the face of the innocent little boy with the apple on his head after dinner we walked up the valley to the reputed birthplace of tell it is a small village at the foot of a glen rich yet very wild a rude unroofed modern bridge crosses the boisterous river and beside the bridge is a fantastic millrace constructed in the same rustic styleuncramped by apprehensions of committing waste upon the woods at the top of a steep rising directly from the river stands a square tower of grey stone partly covered with ivy in itself rather a striking object from the bridge even if not pointed out for notice as being built on the site of the dwelling where william tell was born near it upon the same eminence stands the white church and a small chapel called by tells name where we again found rough paintings of his exploits mixed with symbols of the roman catholic faith our walk from altorf to this romantic spot had been stifling along a narrow road between old stone wallsnothing to be seen above them but the tops of fruit trees and the imprisoning hills no doubt when those walls were built the lands belonged to the churches and monasteries happy were we when we came to the glen and rushing river and still happier when having clomb the eminence we sate beside the churchyard where kindly breezes visited usthe warm breezes of italy we had here a volunteer guide a ragged child voluble with his story trimmed up for the stranger he could tell the history of the hero of uri and declare the import of each memorialwhile not neglecting the saints he proudly pointed out to our notice what indeed could not have escaped it a gigantic daubing of the figure of st christopher on the wall of the church steeple but our smart young maiden was to introduce us to the interior of the ivied tower so romantic in its situation above the roaring stream at the mouth of the glen which behind is buried beneath overhanging woods we ascended to the upper rooms by a blind staircase that might have belonged to a

road at times very steeprocky on both sides of the glen and fewer houses than before we had left the forest but smaller firtrees were thinly sprinkled on the hills looking northward the church tower on its eminence most elegant in the centre of the glen backed by the bare pyramid of meisen images by the wayside though not frequent i recollect a poor idiot hereabouts who with smiles and uncouth gestures placed himself under the virgin and child pleading so earnestly that there was no resisting him soon after when i was lingering behind upon a stone beside a little streamlet of clear water a procession of mules approached laden with winecasksforty at leastwhich i had long seen winding like a creeping serpent along the side of the bare hill before me and heard the stream of sound from their bells two neatlydressed italian women who headed the cavalcade spoke to me in their own sweet language and one of them had the kindness to turn back to bring me a glove which i had left on the stone where i had been sitting i can not forget her pretty romantic appearancea perfect contrast to that of the poor inhabitants of her own sex in this district no less than her soft speech she was rather tall and slender and wore a small straw hat tied with coloured riband different in shape from those worn in switzerland it was the first company of muleteers we had seen though afterwards we met many recrossed the reuss and ascending a very long and abrupt hill covered with impending and shattered crags had again that river on our left but the hill carried us out of sight of it i was alonethe first in the ascent a cluster of mountain masses till then unseen appeared suddenly before me blackruggedor covered with snow i was indeed awestruck and while i sate for some minutes thought within myself now indeed we are going among the terrors of the alps for the course of the reuss being hidden i imagined we should be led towards those mountains little expecting to discover traces of human habitations i had gone but a little way before i beheld stretching from the foot of the savage mountains an oblong valley thickly strewn over with rocks or more accurately speaking huge stones and among them huts of the same hue hardly to be distinguished except by their shape at the foot of the valley appeared a village beside a tall slender church towerevery object of the same hue except the foaming glacier stream and the grassy ground exquisitely green among the crags the hills that flanked the dismal valley told its historytheir precipitous sides were covered with crags mostly in detached masses that seemed ready to be hurled down by avalanches descending about half a mile we were at the village and turning into the churchyard to the left sate there overlooking the pass of the torrent beside it lay many huge fragments of rock fallen from above resembling one of still more enormous size called the devils stone which we had passed by on the righthand side of the road near the entrance of the village how lavishly does nature in these desolate places dispense beautiful gifts the craggy pass of the stream coming out of that valley of stones was decorated with a profusion of gorgeous bushes of the mountain ash with delicate flowers and with the richest mosses and even while looking upon the valley itself it was impossible amid all its images of desolation not to have a mild pleasure in noticing the harmonious beauty of its form and proportions two or three women came to us to beg and all the inhabitants seemed to be miserably poor no wonder for they are not merely summer tenants of the villageand who that could find another hold in the land would dwell there the year through near the church is a picturesque stone bridge at the further end spanned by the arch of a ruined gateway no gate is there now and its stone pillars are crested with flowers and grass we cross the bridge and winding back again come in sight of the reuss far below to our left and were in that part of the pass especially called by ebel the valley of schÃ¶llenen so well known for its dangers at the time of the dissolving of the snow when the muleteers muffle their bells and do not venture to speak a word lest they should stir some loose masses overhead by agitating the air here we passed two muleteers stretched at ease upon a plot of verdant turf under a gigantic crag their mules feeding beside them the road is now almost continuously very steepthe hills ruggedoften ruinousyet straggling pinetrees are seen even to their summits and goats fearlessly browsing upon the overhanging rocks the distance from ghestinen to the vale of urseren is nearly two leagues after we had been long ascending i perceived on the crags on the opposite side of the glen two human figures they were at about the same elevation as ourselves yet looked no bigger than a boy and girl of five years growth a proof that narrow as the glen appears to be its width is considerableand this shows how high and steep must be the mountains those people carried each a large burthen which we supposed to be of hay but where was hay to be procured on these precipices a little furtherand the mystery was solved when we discovered a solitary mower among slips of grass on the almost perpendicular side of the mountain the man and woman must have been bearing their load to the desolate valley such are the summer labours of its poor inhabitants in winter their sole employment out of their houses and cattlesheds must be the clearing away of snow which would otherwise keep the doors barred up but even at that season i believe seldom a week passes over their heads without tidings from the top of st gothard or the valley of altorf winter being the season when merchandise is constantly passing upon sledges between italy and switzerlandand ghestinen is one of the haltingplaces the most dangerous time of travelling is the spring for us there were no dangers the excellent paved road of granite masters all difficulties even up the steepest ascents and from safe bridges crossing the torrents we looked without trepidation into their gulfs or pondered over their hasty course to the reuss yet in the gorge of schoellenen it is not easy to forget the terrors which visit that houseless valley frequent memorials of deaths on the spot are discovered by the waysidesmall wooden crosses placed generally under the shelter of an overhanging stone they might easily be passed unnoticed and are so slightly put together that a child might break them to piecesyet they lie from year to year as safe as in a sanctuary footnote named gÃ¶schenen it is feet above the lake of waldstelles and above the level of the vierwaldstÃ¤dtersee d w footnote ramond gives this name to the whole valley from amsteg to the entrance of ursern ebel gives to it altogether the name of the hautereuss and says that it is called by the inhabitants the graccenthalgÃ¶schenend w thursday august rdhopitalmary and i were again the first to depart our little trager had left us and we proceeded with another engaged also for francs the distance to airola one league less turned aside into one of the little chapels at the outskirts of the town two italians were refreshing and repainting the saints and angels we traced something of the style of their country very different from what is seen in switzerland in the ornaments of the chapel next we were invited to view a collection of minerals and avowing ignorance in these matters passed on the ascent is at once very steep the sun shone full upon us but the air was clear and cool though perfectly calm straying from the paved road we walked on soft grass sprinkled with lowly flowers and interwoven with the groundloving thyme which hardly to be discovered by the eye in passing sent out gushes of aromatic odour the reuss rapidly descending in a rocky channel between green hills hillocks or knolls was on our left handnot close to the road our first restingplace was beside a little company of its small cataractsfoaming and sparklingsuch as we might have met with in the ghyll of a westmoreland mountainscantily adorned with bushes and liberally with bright flowerscattle wandering on the hills their bells made a soft jingling the ascent becomes less steep after ascending half a league or more having passed several painted oratories but neither cottage nor cattleshedwe came to a wide long hollow so exactly resembling the upper reaches of our vales especially easedale that we could have half believed ourselves there before the april sun had melted the snow on the mountaintops the clear river reuss flowing over a flat though stony bed in the centre m and i were still alone with our guide and here we met a french traveller of whom mr r told us he had afterwards inquired if he had seen two ladies to which he rudely answered that he had met two women a little above this reminded me of an unwilling inclination of the head when i had spoken to this frenchman in passing as i do to all whom i meet in lonely places he did not touch his hat no doubt an intentional incivility for on the continent that mark of respect towards strangers is so general as to be often troublesome our fellowtravellers overtook us before we had ascended from the westmoreland hollow which had appeared to them as to us with the face of an old friend no more bushes now to be seenand not a single house or hut since we left hopital the ascent at times very rapidhill bareand very rocky the reuss when seen at our right hand was taking an open course like a common mountain torrent having no continuous glen of its own savage pikes in all directionsbut altogether the mountain ascent from urseren not to be compared in awfulness and grandeur with the valley pass from amsteg i recollect no particular incidents by the way except that when far behind in discourse with a lame and therefore slowpaced foottraveller who intended to halt for the night at the hospital of st gothard he pointed out to me a patch of snow on the left side of the road at a distance and a great stone on the right which he told me was the spot where six travellers had been overwhelmed by an avalanche last februarythey and the huge stone buried beneath the snow i can not say how many feet deep i found our party examining the spot the hill from which the avalanche had fallen was neither precipitous nor to appearance very lofty nor was anything to be seen which could give the notion of peculiar hazard in that place and this gave us perhaps a more vivid impression of what must be the dangers of the alps at one season of the year than the most fearful crags and precipices a wooden cross placed under the great stone by the brother of one of the deceased an italian gentleman recorded the time and manner of his death we tasted the cold snow near this spot the first we had met with by the wayside no doubt a remnant of the avalanche that had buried those unfortunate travellers at the top of the ascent of st gothard a wide basina dreary valley of rocky groundlies before us footnote hospenthaled an oratory where no doubt thanksgivings have been often poured out for preservation from dangers encountered on a road which we had travelled so gaily stands beside a large pool of clear water that lies just below us and another pool or little lake the source of the reuss is discovered between an opening in the mountains to the right the prospect is savage and grand yet the grandeur chiefly arises from the consciousness of being on ground so elevated and so near to the sources of two great rivers taking their opposite courses to the german ocean and the mediterranean sea for the mountain summits which rise all roundsome covered with snowothers of bare granite being viewed from a base so lofty are not so commanding as when seen from below and the valley country is wholly hidden from viewunwilling to turn the mountain i sate down upon a rock above the little lake and thence saw a quarter of a mile distant the hospital or inn and beside it the ruins of a convent destroyed by the french a tinkling of bells suddenly warned me to look about and there was a troop of goats some of them close at hand among the crags and slips of turf nor were there wanting even here a few bright lowly flowers entering into my brothers youthful feelings of sadness and disappointment when he was told unexpectedly that the alps were crossedthe effort accomplishedi tardily descended towards the hospital i found mary sitting on the lowest of a long flight of steps she had lost her companions my brother and a young swiss who had joined us on the road we mounted the steps and from within their voices answered our call went along a dark stone banditti passage into a small chamber little less gloomy where we found them seated with food before them bread and cheese with sour red wineno milk hunger satisfied mary and i hastened to warm ourselves in the sunshine for the house was as cold as a dungeon we straightway greeted with joy the infant tessino which has its sources in the pools above the gentlemen joined us and we placed ourselves on a sunny bank looking towards italy and the swiss took out his flute and played and afterwards sang the ranz des vaches and other airs of his country we and especially our sociable friend r with his inexhaustible stock of kindness and his german tongue found him a pleasant companion he was from the university of heidelberg and bound for rome on a visit to a brother in the holidays and our mode of travelling for a short way being the same it was agreed we should go on together but before we reached airola he left us and we saw no more of him friday august thairola feet above the seai walked out but neglected to enter the church and missed a pleasure which w has often spoken of he found a congregation of rustics chanting the servicethe men and women alternatelyunaccompanied by a priest cascades of pure unsullied water tumble down the hills in every conceivable variety of form and motionand never i think distant from each other a quarter of a mile in the whole of our course from airola sometimes those cascades are seen to fall in one snowwhite line from the highest ridge of the steep or sometimes gleaming through the woods no traceable bed above them they seem to start out at once from beneath the trees as from their source leaping over the rocks one full cataract rose up like a geyser of iceland a silvery pillar that glittered as it seemed among lightlytossing snow without remembering that the tessino of monotonous and muddy line was seldom out of sight it is not possible to have even a faint notion of the pleasure with which we looked at those bright rejoicing rivulets the morning was sunny but we felt no oppression from heat walking leisurely and resting long especially at first when expecting w and r who at length overtook us bringing a comfort that would have cheered a dreary roadletters from england sunday august thlocarnowe had resolved to ascend st salvador before sunrise and a contrary wind having sprung up the boatmen wished to persuade us to stay all night at a town upon a low point of land pushed far into the lake which conceals from our view that portion of it where at the head of a large basin or bay stands the town of lugano they told us we might thence ascend the mountain with more ease than from lugano a wile to induce us to stay but we called upon them to push on having weathered this point and left it some way behind the place of our destination appears in viewlike locarno and luvino within the semicircle of a baya wide basin of waters spread before it and the reach of the lake towards porlezza winding away to our right that reach appeared to be of more grave and solemn character than any we had passed throughgrey steeps enclosing it on each side we now coasted beneath bare precipices at the foot of st salvadorshouted to the echoesand were answered by travellers from the road far above our heads thence tended towards the middle of the basin and the town of lugano appeared in front of us low green woody hills rising above it mild lightning fluttered like the northern lights over the steeps of st salvador yet without threatening clouds the wind had fallen and no apprehensions of a storm disturbed our pleasures it was oclock when we reached the inn where all things were on a large scalesplendid yet shabby the landlord quite a fine gentleman his brother gone to england as a witness on the queens trial we had soon an excellent supper in a small salon where her present majesty of england and count bergami had often feasted together mary had the honour of sleeping in the bed allotted to her majesty and i in that of which she herself had made choice not being satisfied with her first accommodations the boatman told us she was una bravissima principessa and spent much money the lightning continued but without thunder we strayed again to the waterside while supper was in preparation everybody seems to be living out of doors and long after i was in bed i heard people in the streets singing laughing talking and playing on the flute monday august thluganoroused from sleep at a quarter before oclock the moon brightly shining at a quarter past four set off on foot to ascend mount st salvador though so early people were stirring in the streets our walk was by the shore round the fine baysolemn yet cheerful in the morning twilight at the beginning of the ascent passed through gateways and sheds among picturesque old buildings with overhanging flat roofsvines hanging from the walls with the wildness of brambles or the untrained woodbine the ascent from the beginning is exceedingly steep and without intermission to the very summit vines spreading from tree to tree resting upon walls or clinging to wooden poles they creep up the steep sides of the hill no boundary line between them and the wild growth of the mountain with which at last they are blended till no trace of cultivation appears the road is narrow but a path to the shrine of st salvador has been made with great pains still trodden once in the year by crowds probably at this day chiefly of peasantry to keep the festival of that saint on the summit of the mount it winds along the declivities of the rocksand all the way the views are beautiful to begin with looking backward to the town of lugano surrounded by villas among treesa rich vale beyond the town an ample tract bright with cultivation and fertility scattered over with villages and spireswho could help pausing to look back on these enchanting scenes yet a still more interesting spectacle travels with us at our side but how far beneath us the lake winding at the base of the mountain into which we looked from craggy forest precipices apparently almost as steep as the walls of a castle and a thousand times higher we were bent on getting start of the rising sun therefore none of the party rested longer than was sufficient to recover breath i did so frequently for a few minutes it being my plan at all times to climb up with my best speed for the sake of those rests whereas mary i believe never once sate down this morning perseveringly mounting upward meanwhile many a beautiful flower was plucked among the mossy stones one in particular there was since found wherever we have been in italy i helped miss barker to plant that same flower in her garden brought from mr clarkes hothouse in spite of all our efforts the sun was beforehand with us we were two hours in ascending w and mr r who had pushed on before were one hour and forty minutes when we stood on the crown of that glorious mount we seemed to have attained a spot which commanded pleasures equal to all that sight could give on this terrestrial world we beheld the mountains of simplontwo brilliant shapes on a throne of cloudsmont blanc as the guide told us lifting his resplendent forehead above a vapoury seaand the monte rosa a bright pyramid how high up in the sky the vision did not burst upon us suddenly but was revealed by slow degrees while we felt so satisfied and delighted with what lay distinctly outspread around us that we had hardly begun to look for objects less defined in the fardistant horizon i can not describe the green hollows hills slopes and woody plainsthe towns villages and towersthe crowds of secondary mountains substantial in form and outline bounding the prospect in other quartersnor the bewitching loveliness of the lake of lugano lying at the base of mount salvador and thence stretching out its arms between the bold steeps my brother said he had never in his life seen so extensive a prospect at the expense only of two hours climbing but it must be remembered that the whole of the ascent is almost a precipice beyond the town of lugano the hills and wide vale are thickly sprinkled with towns and houses small lakes to us their names unknown were glittering among the woody steeps and beneath lay the broad neck of the peninsula of st salvadora tract of hill and valley woods and waters far in the distance on the other side the towers of milan might be descried the river po a ghostly serpentline rested on the brown plains of lombardy and there again we traced the tessino departed from his mountain solitudes where we had been his happy companions footnote cyclamend w footnote it was not mont blanc he was mistaken or wanted to deceive us to give pleasure but however we might have wished to believe that what he asserted was true we could not think it possibled w but i have yet only looked beyond the mount there is a house beside the chapel probably in former times inhabited by persons devoted to religious servicesor it might be only destined for the same use for which it serves at present a shelter for them who flock from the vallies to the yearly festival repairs are going on in the chapel which was struck with lightning a few years ago and all but the altar and its holy things with the image of the patron saint destroyed their preservation is an established miracle and the surrounding peasantry consider the memorials as sanctified anew by that visitation from heaven tuesday august thmenaggiowe took the opposite the eastern side of the lake intending to land and ascend to the celebrated source of the fiume latte river of milk following the curves of the shore came to a greywhite village and landed upon the rocky bank there is no road or pathway along this margin of the lake and every village has its own boats mounting by a flight of rugged steps we were at once under a line of houses fronting the water and after climbing up the steep walked below those houses the lake beneath us on our left all at once from that sunny spot we came upon a rugged bridge shady all roundcool breezes rising up from the rocky cleft where in twilight gloom so it appears to eyes saturated with light a copious streamthe fiume latteis hurrying with leap and bound to the great lake our object as i have said was the fountain of that torrent we mounted up the hill by rocky steeps and pathways in some places almost perpendicular the precipice all the way being built up by low walls hung with vines the earth thus supported is covered with melons pumpkins indian corn chestnuttrees figtrees and trees now scattering ripe plums the ascent was truly laborious on the lake we had never been oppressed by the heat here it was almost too much even for me but when we reached the desired spot where the torrent drops from its marble cavern as clear as crystal how delicious the coolness of the breeze the water issues silently from the cold cavern slides but a very little way over the rock then bounds in a short cataract and rushes rapidly to the lake the evergreen arbutus and the pricklyleaved alaturnus grow in profusion on the rocks bordering the fiume latte and there in remembrance of rydal mount where we had been accustomed to see one or two bushes of those plants growing in the garden we decked our bonnets mingling the glossy leaves of those evergreen shrubs with that beautiful lilac flower first seen in the ascent of st salvador an active youth was our guide and a useful one in helping us over the rocks a woman too had joined the train but mary and i showing her that she was neither useful nor welcome she began to employ her time in plucking the bunches of indian corn laying them in a heap we could have lingered a whole summers day over the cascades and limpid pools of the fiume latte saturday september stmilanour object this morning was to ascend to the roof where i remained alone not venturing to follow the rest of the party to the top of the giddy central spire which is ascended by a narrow staircase twisted round the outside even w was obliged to trust to a hand governed by a steadier head than his own i wandered about with space spread around me on the roof on which i trod for streets and even squares of no very diminutive town the floor on which i trod was all of polished marble intensely hot and as dazzling as snow and instead of moving figures i was surrounded by groups and stationary processions of silent statuessaints sages and angels it is impossible for me to describe the beautiful spectacle or to give a notion of the delight i felt therefore i will copy a sketch in verse composed from my brothers recollections of the view from the central spire sunday september ndmilana grand military mass was to be administered at eight oclock in the place darmes buonapartes field for reviewing his troops hitherward we set out at seven but arrived a little too late the ceremony was begun and it was some time before we could obtain a better situation than among the crowds pressed together in the glaring sunshine as close as they could come to the building where the temporary altar was placed the ground being level nothing was to be seen but heads of people and a few of the lines of soldiers and their glittering firearms but we could perceive that at one time they dropped down on their knees at length having got admittance into the building le palais des rois near which we stood almost stifled with heat we had a complete view from a balcony of all that remained to be performed of the ceremonies military and religious but of the latter that part was over in which the soldiers took any visible share though the service was still going on at the altar below us as was proclaimed by the sound of sacred music which upon minds unfamiliarised to such scenes had an irresistible power to solemnise a spectacle more distinguished by parade glitter and flashy colours than anything else the richly caparisoned prancing steeds of the officers their splendid dresses the numerous lines of soldiers standing upon the green grass though not of mountain hue it looked green in contrast with their habiliments and the immense numbers of men women and children gathered together upon a level spacewhere space was left for thousands and tens of thousands moreall these may easily be imaginedwith the full concert of the military band when the sacred music ceasedthe marching of the troops off the fieldaustrians hungarians and italiansand last of all the cavalry with the heartstirring blast of their trumpets before we left the field the crowd was gone the tinselled altar and other fineries taken downand we saw people busied in packing them up very much like a company of players with their paraphernalia went also to the convent of maria della grazia to view that most famous picture of the last supper by leonardo da vinci painted on the wall at one end of the refectory a very large hall hung along the sides with smaller pictures and at the other end that painting of the crucifixion of which we had seen a copy at lugano this refectory was used in the days of buonaparte as a military storehouse and the mark of a musketball fired in wantonness by a french soldier is to be seen in one part of the painting of leonardo da vinci fortunately the ball hit where the injury was as small as it could have been and it is only marvellous that this fine work was not wholly defaced during those times of military misrule and utter disregard of all sacred things little conversant in pictures i can not take upon me to describe this which impressed my feelings and imagination more than any picture i ever saw though some of the figures are so injured by damp that they are only just traceable the most important are however happily the least injured and that of our saviour has only suffered from a general fading in the colours yet alas the fading and vanishing must go on year after year till at length the whole group must pass away through the cloisters of the monastery which are shattered and defaced pictures are found in all parts and there are some curious monuments footnote it is perfectly notorious that this picture suffered more from the negligence of the monks than from the scorn of the french a hole was broken thro the lower part of the centre of the picture to admit hot dishes from the kitchen into the refectory h c r wednesday september thcadenabbiabent our course toward fuentesand after a wearisome walk through damp and breathless heat a full league or more over a perfect level we reached the foot of the eminence which from the lake had appeared to be at a small distance but it seemed to have retreated as we advanced we had left the high road and trudged over the swampy plain through which the road must have been made with great expense and labour as it is raised considerably all the way the picturesque ruins of the castle of fuentes are at the top of the eminencewild vines the bramble and the clematis cling to the bushes and beautiful flowers grow in the chinks of the rocks and on every bed of grass a tempting though rugged ascentyet with the towers in sight above our heads and twothirds of the labour accomplished mary and i wm having gone before to discover the nearest and least difficult way for us sate down determined not to go a step further we had a grand prospect and being exhausted by the damp heat were willing for once to leave our final object unattained however while seated on the ground two stout hardlaboured peasants chancing to come close to us on the path invited us forward and we could not resistthey led the waytwo rough creatures i said to mary when we were climbing up among the rocks and bushes in that wild and lonely place what you have no fear of trusting yourself to a pair of italian banditti i knew not their occupation but an accurate description of their persons would have fitted a novelwriter with readymade attendants for a tribe of robbersgoodnatured and kind however they were nay even polite in their rustic way as others tutored to city civility cultivated vines grew upon the top of the hill and they took pains to pluck for us the ripest grapes we now had a complete view up the great vale of the adda to which the road that we had left conducts the traveller below us on the other side lay a wide green marshy plain between the hill of fuentes and the shores of the lake which plain spreading upwards divides the lake the upper small reach being called chiavenna the path which my brother had travelled when bewildered in the night thirty years ago was traceable through some parts of the forest on the opposite sideand the very passage through which he had gone down to the shore of the lakethen most dismal with thunder lightning and rain i hardly can conceive a place of more solitary aspect than the lake of chiavenna and the whole of the prospect on that direction is characterised by melancholy sublimity we rejoiced after our toil at being favoured with a distinct view of those sublime heights not it is true steeped in celestial hues of sunny glory yet in communion with clouds floating or stationaryscatterings from heaven the ruin itself is very interesting both in the mass and in detailan inscription is lying on the ground which records that the castle was built by the count of fuentes in the year and the chapel about twenty years after by one of his descendants some of the gateways are yet standing with their marble pillars and a considerable part of the walls of the chapel a smooth green turf has taken the place of the pavement and we could see no trace of altar or sacred image but everywhere something to remind one of former grandeur and of destruction and tumult while there was in contrast with the imaginations so excited a melancholy pleasure in contemplating the wild quietness of the present day the vines near the ruin though ill tended grow willingly and rock turf and fragments of the stately pile are alike covered or adorned with a variety of flowers among which the rosecoloured pink was in great beauty in our descent we found a fair white cherub uninjured by the explosion which had driven it a great way down the hill it lay bedded like an infant in its cradle among low green bushesw said to us could we but carry this pretty image to our moss summerhouse at rydal mount yet it seemed as if it would have been a pity that any one should remove it from its couch in the wilderness which may be its own for hundreds of years thursday september thcadenabbiaafter a night of heavy rain a bright morning w m and i set off toward menaggio along the terrace bordering the water which led us to the bay at the foot of the rocky green hill of the church of our lady and there we came upon the track of the old road the very same which my brother had paced for there was no other nor the possibility of one that track continued from the foot of the mountain leads behind the town of cadenabbia cutting off the bending of the shore by which we had come to this point from the bare precipice we pass through shade and sunshine among spreading vines slips of green turf or gardens of melons gourds maize and figtrees among the rocks it was but for a little space yet enough to make our regret even more lively than before that it had not been in our power to coast one reach at least of the lake on foot we had been overtaken by a fine tall man who somewhat proudly addressed us in english after twenty years traffic in our country he had been settled near his native place on the banks of como having purchased an estate near cadenabbia with the large sum of two thousand pounds acquired by selling barometers lookingglasses etc he had been used to return to his wife every third year in the month of october he made preparations during the winter for fresh travels in the spring at the same time working with her on the small portion of land which they then possessed portsmouth and plymouth were the grand marts for his wares he amused us with recitals of adventures among the sailors who used to bully him with come you rogue you get your money easily enough spend it freely and he did not care if he got rid of a guinea or two for he was sure to have it back again after one of the frolicsand much more they would often clear away his whole stock of nicknacks this industrious trader used to travel on foot at the rate of from thirty to forty miles a day and his expenses from london to como were but three guineas though it cost him onethird of that sum to get to calais he said he liked england because the people were honest and told us some stories illustrative of english honesty and italian overreaching in bargains this amusing and i must say interesting companion turned from us by a sidepath before we reached menaggio saying he would meet us again as our road would lead us near his cottage on the heights and he should see us from the fields he had another dwelling on his estate beside cadenabbia where the land produced excellent wine the produce of his farm on the hills was chiefly hay which they were then gathering in sunday september thdomo dossolawe rose at oclock the morning clear and very cold mr m r and g intended to take the diligence w mary and i to walk for having been so much gratified with our journey over st gothard we had determined to cross the simplon also on foot m set forward first i followed a few minutes after defended from cold by my woollen cloak w was left to dispose of the luggage which except a small bundle carried by each we intended to send by the diligence shops already open bought some bread and made my way directly through the town at the end of it looked back upon its towers and large houses prettily situated as on a plain under steep hillssome of them separate mounts distinct in form i could not but regret that we might not linger half a day and ascend to the chapel of mount calvary still much resorted to for its peculiar sanctity the view from that commanding eminence would have enabled us to bear away more distinct remembrances than i at least have done of a town well deserving to be remembered for it must for ages back have been of importance as lying at the foot of this pass of the alps after a miles quick walking i grew a little uneasy at not having overtaken mary behind and before buonapartes broad unshaded road was stretched out in a right line however convenient such roads for conquest or traffic they are of all others the least pleasant to the foottraveller whose labours seem no nearer to their end till some natural impediment must be submitted to and the road pursues another course looking forward i could see nothing of mary and the way being sprinkled with passengers i was more perplexed thinking it probable that her figure before me or behind might be undiscoverable among them but my pace to warm myself in the nipping air had been so quick it seemed more likely that she had not advanced so far therefore i sate down and glad i was after some time to espy her blue gown among the scatterings of women in scarlet garments she had missed her way in the town and gone back in quest of me the fresh morning air helped us cheerfully over the long line of road and passengers whom we continually met amused us some were travellers from the alps but they were much more frequently peasants bent on sundays devotion and pleasure chiefly women awkward in appearance short of stature and deformed by their manner of fastening the full round petticoat lifted up almost to the shoulders it pleased me now to review our course from bavena where this our second ascent of the alps may be said to begin the princely reach of the lake then before us with its palaces and towns thence towards the mountains and the vale of tusa solitary churches on the steepsruinsembowered low stone cottagesvineyards and extensive lawnscattle with their bells and peasants tending them the romantic village of vergogne its ruined fortress overlooking the narrow dell and torrents bedinhabited houses as grey with age as the ruin itselfand upon the level below how delightful was it in our hour of rest and sauntering to quit the sunshine and walk under roofs of vines further on the vale more wide and openlarge meadows without trees haymakersstraggling travellers on the outstretched road villages under green mountainssnowy mountains gilded by the light of the setting sun now from domo dossola we were proceeding on the same unbending road up the same vale a scene of desolation and fertility vines by the wayside the grapes hardly ripening having ascended a long hill to crevola where there is a small publichouse at which we had thought of stopping to breakfast the road crosses a remarkably high and massy bridge over the chasm of val di vedro whence the river vedro takes its course down to the vale of tusa now below us on our right hand where towards the centre of the vale the village of crevola stands on an eminence whence the morning sound of bells was calling the people together we turned to the left up the shady side of val di vedro at first the road led us high above the bed of the torrent being now enclosed between the barriers of that deep dell we had left all traces of vineyards fruittrees and fields beeches climb up among the crags to the summit of the steeps the road descends traces of the ancient track visible near a bridge of one lofty arch no longer used by the traveller crossing the alps yet i went to the centre to look down on the torrent traces of the foundation of a former bridge remain in the chasm met a few peasants going to the vale below and sometimes a traveller again we climb the hill all craggy forest at a considerable height from the rivers bed an immense column of granite lies by the wayside as if its course had been stopped there by tidings of napoleons overthrow it was intended by him for his unfinished triumphal arch at milan and i wish it may remain prostrate on the mountain for ages to come his bitterest foe could scarcely contrive a more impressive record of disappointed vanity and ambition the sledge upon which it has been dragged from the quarry is rotted beneath it while the pillar remains as fresh and sparkling as if hewn but yesterday w who came after us said he had named it the weary stone in memory of that immense stone in the wilds of peru so called by the indians because after of them had dragged it over heights and hollows it tumbled down a precipice and rested immovable at the bottom where it must for ever remain ere long we come to the first passage through the rocks near the rivers bed and road and river for some time fill the bottom of the valley we miss the bright torrents that stream down the hills bordering the tessino but here is no want of variety we are in closer neighbourhood with the crags hence their shapes are continually changing and their appearance is the more commanding and wherever an old building is seen it is overspread with the hues of the natural crags and is in form of accordant irregularity the very road itself however boldly it may bestride the hills or pierce the rocks is yet the slave of nature its windings often being governed as imperiously as those of the vedra within the chasm of the glen suddenly the valley widens opening out to the right in a semicircle a sunny village with a white church appears before us rather i should say numerous hamlets and scattered houses here again were vines and grapes almost full grown though none ripening leaving the sunshine we again are enclosed between the steeps a small ruined convent on the right the painting on the outside nearly effaced by damp we come to the second passage or gallery through the rocks it is not long but very grand especially viewed in combination with the crags woods and river here tumbling in short cascades its channel strewn with enormous ruins w had joined us about a league before we reached this point and we sate long in admiration of the prospect up the valley seen beyond the arch of the gallery which is supported by a pillar left in the rock out of which the passage has been hewn a brown hamlet at the foot of the mountains terminates this reach of the valley which has again widened a little a steep glen to the left sends down a boisterous stream to the vedra we had walked three leagues and were told we were near the inn where we were to breakfast and having left the gallery yards behind saw more of the village called isella and a large square white building appeared which proved to be a military station and the posthouse near which was our inn leaving now the piedmontese dominions we make our last entrance into the country of the swiss deciduous trees gradually yield to pinetrees and larches and through these forests interspersed with awful crags we pass on still in cool shade accompanied by the turbulent river here is hardly a slip of pasturage to be seen still less a plot of tillage how different from the pass of the ticino all is rocks precipices and forests we pass several places of refuge as they are named the word refuge being inscribed upon their walls in large characters they are small square white unpicturesque buildings erected by buonaparte the old road is not unfrequently traceable for a short waymary once detected it by noticing an oratory above our heads that turned its back towards us now neglected and facing the deserted track sunday september thdomo dossolasoon after we perceive a large and very striking building terminating a narrow reach of the valley a square tower at the further end of the roof and towards us a lofty gable front steplike on each steeplysloping side in the style of some of our old roofs in the north of england the building is eight stories high and long and broad in proportion we perceived at once that it must be a spittal of the old times and w who had been lingering behind when he came up to us pronounced it to be the very same where he and his companion had passed an awful night unable to sleep from other causes their ears were stunned by a tremendous torrent then swollen by rainy weather that came thundering down a chasm of the mountain on the opposite side of the glen that torrent still keeping the same channel was now upon this sunny clear day a brisk rivulet that cheerfully bounded down to the vedro a lowly church stands within the shade of the huge spittal beside a single dwellinghouse small yet larger than the church we entered that modest place of worship and were charmed with its rustic splendours and humble neatness here were two very pretty wellexecuted pictures in the italian style so much superior to anything of the kind in the country churches of switzerland rested some while beside the church and cottage looking towards the spittal on the opposite side of the road the wildest of all harbours yet even stately in its form and seemingly fitted to war with the fiercest tempests i now regret not having the courage to pass the threshold alone i had a strong desire to see what was going on within doors for the sake of tales of thirty years gone by but could not persuade w to accompany me several foot or mule travellers were collected near the door i bought some poor peaches very refreshing at that time from a man who was carrying them and other things to the village of simplonthree sous the pound soon after leaving the spittal our path was between precipices still more gloomy and awful than before what must they have been in the time of rain and vapour when my brother was here beforeon the narrow track instead of our broad road that smooths every difficulty skeletons of tall pinetrees beneath us in the dell and above our headstheir stems and shattered branches as grey as the stream of the vedra or the crags strewn at their feet the scene was truly sublime when we came in view of the finest of the galleries we sate upon the summit of a huge precipice of stone to the left of the roadthe river raging below after having tumbled in a tremendous cataract down the crags in front of our station on entering the gallery we cross a clear torrent pent up by crags while pausing here a step or two before we entered a carriage full of gentlemen drove through they just looked aside at the torrent but stopped not i could not but congratulate myself on our being on foot for a hundred reasons the pleasantest mode of travelling in a mountainous country after we had gone through the last and least interesting though the longest but one of the galleries the vale now grassy among scattered rocks and widermore of a hollow bends to the left and we see on the hill in front of us a long doubling of the road necessary from the steepness of the hill to accomplish an easy ascent at the angle where at the foot of the hill this doubling begins m and i being before w sate and pondered a footpath leads directly upwards cutting off at least a mile and we perceived one of our young fellowtravellers climbing up it but could not summon the courage to follow him and took the circuit of buonapartes road the bed of the river far below to our left wide and broken up by torrents is crossed by a long wooden bridge from which a footpath almost perpendicular ascends to a hamlet at a great height upon the side of the steep a female crossing the bridge gave life and spirit to a scene characterised in comparison with other scenes more by wildness than grandeur and though presided over by a glacier mountain and craggy and snowy pikes seemingly at the head of the hollow vale less impressive and less interesting to the imagination than the narrow passes through which we had been travelling after some time the curve of the road carries us again backward on the mountainside from the valley of the tusa our eyes often turned towards the bridge and the upright path little thinking that it was the same we had so often heard of which misled my brother and robert jones in their way from switzerland to italy they were pushing right upwards when a peasant having questioned them as to their object told them they had no further ascent to makethe alps were crossed the ambition of youth was disappointed at these tidings and they remeasured their steps with sadness at the point where our fellowtravellers had rejoined the road w was waiting to show us the track on the green precipice it was impossible for me to say how much it had moved him when he discovered it was the very same which had tempted him in his youth the feelings of that time came back with the freshness of yesterday accompanied with a dim vision of thirty years of life between we traced the path together with our eyes till hidden among the cottages where they had first been warned of their mistake footnote in troutbeck valley especiallyd w hereabouts a few peasants were on the hills with cattle and goats in the narrow passage of the glen we had for several miles together seen no moving objects except chance travellers the streams the clouds and trees stirred sometimes by gentle breezes at this spot we watched a boy and girl with bare feet running as if for sport among the sharp stones fearless as young kids the round hat of the valais tied with a coloured riband looked shepherdesslike on the head of another a peasant girl roaming on craggy pastureground to whom i spoke and was agreeably surprised at being answered in german probably a barbarous dialect but we contrived to understand one another the valley of the vedro now left behind we ascend gradually indeed the whole ascent is gradual along the side of steeps covered with poor grassan undulating hollow to the rightno treesthe prospect in front terminated by snow mountains and dark pikes the air very cold when we reached the village of simplon there is no particular grandeur in the situation except through the accompanying feeling of removal from the world and the near neighbourhood of summits so lofty and of form and appearance only seen among the alps we were surprised to find a considerable village the houses which are of stone are large and strong built and gathered together as if for shelter the air nipping even at this season must be dreadfully cold in winter yet the inhabitants weather all seasons the inn was filled with guests of different nations and of various degrees from the muleteer and foottraveller to those who loll at ease whirling away as rapidly as their companion the torrent of the vedro our party of eleven made merry over as good a supper in this naked region five or six thousand feet above the level of the sea as we could have desired in the most fertile of the valleys with a dessert of fruit and cakes we were summoned out of doors to look at a living chamois kept in the stable more of a treat than the roasted flesh of one of its kind which we had tasted at lucerne walked with some of the gentlemen about half a mile after w and m were retired to rest the stars were appearing above the black pikes while the snow on others looked as bright as if a full moon were shining upon it our beds were comfortable i was not at all fatigued and had nothing to complain of but the cold which did not hinder me from falling asleep and sleeping soundly the distance from domo dossola six leagues monday september thsimplonrose at five oclock as cold as a frosty morning in december the eleven breakfasted together and were readyall but the lame oneto depart on foot to brieg in the haut valais seven leagues the distance from the village of simplon to the highest point of the pass is nearly two leagues we set forward together forming different companiesor sometimes solitarythe peculiar charm of pedestrian travelling especially when the party is largefresh society always readyand solitude to be taken at will in the latter part of the pass of st gothard on the swiss side the grandeur diminishesand it is the same on the italian side of the pass of simplon yet when after the gradual ascent from the village the last inhabited spot a turning of the road first presents to view in a clear atmosphere beneath a bright blue sky so we were favoured the ancient spittal with its ornamented tower standing at the further end of a wide oblong hollow surrounded by granite pikes snow pikesmasses of granitecool black motionless shadows and sparkling sunshine it is not possible for the dullest imagination to be unmoved when we found ourselves within that elevated enclosure the eye and the ear were satisfied with perfect stillness we might have supposed ourselves to be the only visible moving creatures but ere long espied some cows and troops of goats which at first we could not distinguish from the scattered rocks but by degrees tracked their motions and perceived them in great numbers creeping over the yellow grass that grows among crags on the declivities above the spittal and in the hollow below it and we then began to discover a few brown chÃ¢lets or cattlesheds in that quarter the spittal that dismal yet secure shelteringplace inhabited the winter through is approached by a side track from the present road being built as much out of the way of storms as it could have been carts and carriages of different kinds standing within and near the door of a shed close to the road called to mind the stir and traffic of the world in a place which might have been destined for perpetual solitudewhere the thunder of heaven the rattling of avalanches and the roaring of winds and torrents seemed to be the only turbulent sounds that had a right to take place of the calm and silence which surrounded us wednesday september thbaths of leukrose at oclock from my window looked towards the crags of the gemmi then covered with clouds twilight seemed scarcely to have left the valley the air was sharp and the smoking channel of hot water a comfortable sight in the cold gloom of the village but soon with promise of a fine day the vapours on the crescent of crags began to break and its yellow towers touched by the sunshine gleamed through the edges of the floating masses or appeared in full splendour for a moment and were again hidden after six oclock accompanied by a guide who was by trade a shoemaker and possessed a small stock of mountain cattle we set forward on our walk of eight leagues the turreted barrier facing us passed along a lane fenced by curiously crossed railsthence still gently ascending through rough ground scattered over with small pinetrees and stones fallen from the mountains no wilder object can be imagined than a shattered guidepost at the junction of one road with another which had been placed there because travellers intending to cross the gemmi had often been misled and some had perished taking the righthand road toward the snow mountain instead of that to the left even till we reached the base of that rocky rampart which we were to climb the track of ascent in front of us had been wholly invisible sometimes it led us slanting along the bare side of the cragssometimes it was scooped out of them and overroofed like an outside staircase of a castle or fortification sometimes we came to a level gallerythen to a twisting ascentor the path would take a double coursebackwards and forwardsthe dizzy height of the precipices above our heads more awful even than the gulfs beneath us sometimes we might have imagined ourselves looking from a parapet into the inner space of a gigantic castlea castle a thousand times larger than was ever built by human hands while above our heads the turrets appeared as majestic as if we had not climbed a step nearer to their summits a small plot or two of turf never to be cropped by goat or heifer on the ledge of a precipice a bunch of slender flowers hanging from a chinkand one luxuriant plot of the bright blue monkshood lodged like a little garden amid the stonework of an italian villawere the sole marks of vegetation that met our eyes in the ascent except a few distorted pinetrees on one of the summits which reminded us of watchmen on the lookout a weatherbeaten complex wooden frame something like a large sentrybox hanging on the side of one of the crags helped out this idea especially as we were told it had been placed there in troublesome times to give warning of approaching danger it was a very wild object that could not but be noticed and when noticed the question must followhow came it there and for what purpose we were preceded by some travellers on mules who often shouted as if for their own pleasure and the shouts were echoed through the circuit of the rocks their guide afterwards sang a hymn or pensive song there was an aÃ«rial sweetness in the wild notes which descended to our ears when we had attained the same height our guide sang the same air which made me think it might be a customary rite or practice in that part of the ascent the gemmi pass is in the direct road from berne to the baths of leuk invalids unable to walk are borne on litters by men and frequently have their eyes blinded that they may not look down and the most hardy travellers never venture to descend on their horses or mules those careful creatures make their way safely though it is often like descending a steep and rugged staircase and there is nothing to fear for foottravellers if their heads be not apt to turn giddy the path is seldom traceable either up or down further than along one of its zigzags and it will happen when you are within a yard or two of the line which is before you that you can not guess what turning it shall make the labour and ingenuity with which this road has been constructed are truly astonishing the canton of berne eighty years ago furnished gunpowder for blasting the rocks and labourers were supplied by the district of the valais the former track right up an apparently almost perpendicular precipice between overhanging crags must have been utterly impassable for travellers such as we if any such had travelled in those days yet it was even now used in winter the peasants ascend by it with pikes and snowshoes and on their return to the valley slide down an appalling thought when the precipice was before our eyes and i almost shudder at the remembrance of it a glacier mountain appears on our left the haunt of chamois as our guide told us he said they might often be seen on the brow of the gemmi barrier in the early morning we felt some pride in treading on the outskirts of the chamois playgroundand what a boast for us could we have espied one of those lightfooted creatures bounding over the crags but it is not for them who have been laggards in the vale till oclock to see such a sight the total absence of all sound of living creature was very striking silent moths in abundance flew about in the sunshine and the muddy lake weltered below us the only sound when we checked our voices to listen hence we continued to journey over rocky and barren ground till we suddenly looked down into a warm green nook into which we must descend twelve cattle were there enclosed by the crags as in a field of their own choosing we passed among them giving no disturbance and again came upon a tract as barren as before after about two leagues from the top of the gemmi crags the summer chalet our promised restingplace was seen facing us reared against the stony mountain and overlooking a desolate round hollow winding along the side of the hill that deep hollow beneath us to the right a long halfmile brought us to the platform before the door of the hut it was a scene of wild gaiety halfascore of youthful travellers military students from the college of thun were there regaling themselves mr robinson became sociable and we while the party stood round us talking with him had our repast spread upon the same table where they had finished theirs they departed and we saw them winding away towards the gemmi on the side of the precipice above the dreary hollowa long procession not less interesting than the group at our approach but every object connected with animated nature and human life especially is interesting on such a road as this we meet no one with a strangers heart i can not forget with what pleasure soon after leaving the hut we greeted two young matrons one with a child in her arms the other with hers a lusty babe ruddy with mountain air asleep in its wicker cradle on her back thus laden they were to descend the gemmi rocks and seemed to think it no hardship returning us cheerful looks while we noticed the happy burthens which they carried those peasant travellers out of sight we go on over the same rocky ground snowy pikes and craggy eminences still bounding the prospect but ere long we approach the neighbourhood of trees and overlooking a long smooth level covered with poor yellowish grass saw at a distance in the centre of the level a group of travellers of a different kinda party of gentry male and female on mules on meeting i spoke to the two ladies in english by way of trying their nation and was pleased at being answered in the same tongue the lawn here was prettily embayed like a lake among little eminences covered with dwarf trees aged or blighted thence onward to another open space where was an encampment of cattle sheds the large plain spotted with heaps of stones at irregular distances as we see lime or manure or haycocks in our cultivated fields those heaps had been gathered together by the industrious peasants to make room for a scanty herbage for their cattle the turf was very poor yet so lavishly overspread with closegrowing flowers it reminded us of a persian carpet the silver thistle as we then named it had a singularly beautiful effect a glistering star lying on the ground as if enwrought upon it an avalanche had covered the surface with stones many years ago and many more will it require for nature aided by the mountaineers industry to restore the soil to its former fertility on approaching the destined termination of our descent we were led among thickets of alpine shrubs a rich covering of berrybearing plants overspreading the ground we followed the ridge of this wildly beautiful tract and it brought us to the brink of a precipice on our right when we looked into the savage valley of gastronupwards toward its head and downwards to the point where the gastron joins the kandor their united streams thence continuing a tumultuous course to the lake of thun the head of the kandor thal was concealed from us to our left by the ridge of the hill on which we stood by going about a mile further along the ridge to the brow of its northern extremity we might have seen the junction of the two rivers but were fearful of being overtaken by darkness in descending the gemmi and were indeed satisfied with the prospect already gained the river gastron winds in tumult over a stony channel through the apparently level area of a grassless vale buried beneath stupendous mountainsnot a house or hut to be seen a roaring sound ascended to us on the eminence so high above the vale how awful the tumult when the river carries along with it the spring tide of melted snow we had long viewed in our journey a snowcovered pike in stateliness and height surpassing all the other eminences the whole mass of the mountain now appeared before us on the same side of the gastron vale on which we were it seemed very near to us and as if a part of its base rose from that vale we could hardly believe our guide when he told us that pike was one of the summits of the jungfrau took out maps and books and found it could be no other mountain i never before had a conception of the space covered by the bases of these enormous piles after lingering as long as time would allow we began to remeasure our steps thankful for the privilege of again feeling ourselves in the neighbourhood of the jungfrau and of looking upon those heights that border the lake of thun at the feet of which we had first entered among the inner windings of switzerland our journey back to the chalet was not less pleasant than in the earlier part of the day the guide hurrying on before us roused the large housedog to give us a welcoming bark which echoed round the mountains like the tunable voices of a full pack of houndsa heartstirring concert in that silent place where no waters were heard at that timeno tinkling of cattlebells indeed the barren soil offers small temptation for wandering cattle to linger there in a few weeks our rugged path would be closed up with snow the hut untenanted for the winter and not a living creature left to rouse the echoesechoes which our bard would not suffer to die with us friday september thmartignyoh that i could describenay that i could remember the sublime spectacle of the pinnacles and towers of mont blanc while we were travelling through the vale long deserted of the sunshine that still lingered on those summits a large body of moving clouds covered a portion of the side of the mountain the pinnacles and towers above them seemed as if they stood in the skyof no soft aÃ«rial substance but appearing even at that great distance as they really are huge masses of solid stone raised by almighty power and never but by the same power to be destroyed the village of chamouny is on the opposite the northwestern side of the vale in this part considerably widened having left the lanes and thickets we slanted across a broad unfenced level narrowing into a sort of village green with its maypole as in england but of giant stature a pine of the alps the collected village of chamouny and large white church appeared before us above the river on a gentle elevation of pasture ground sloping from woody steeps behind our walk beside the suburban cottages was altogether new and very interestinga busy scene of preparation for the night women driving home their goats and cowslabourers returning with their toolssledges an unusual sight in alpine valleys dragged by lusty men the old looking onyoung women knitting and ruddy children at playa race how different from the languishing youth of the hot plains of the valaiscattle bells continually tinklingno silence no stillness hereyet the bustle and the various sounds leading to thoughts of quiet rest and silence all the while the call to the cattle is heard from different quarters and the rapid arve roars through the vale among rocks and stones its mountain spoilsat one time split into divers branchesat another collected into one rough channel passing the turn of the ascent we come to another cross placed there to face the traveller ascending from the other side and from the brow of the eminence behold to our left the huge form of mont blancpikes towers needles and wide wastes of everlasting snow in dazzling brightness below is the river arve a greywhite line winding to the village of chamouny dimly seen in the distance our station though on a height so commanding was on the lowest point of the eminence and such as i have sketched but how imperfectly was the scene uplifted and outspread before us the higher parts of the mountain in our neighbourhood are sprinkled with brown chalets so they were thirty years ago as my brother well remembered and he pointed out to us the very quarter from which a boy greeted him and his companion with an alpine cry the stranger seen below the boy shouts from the echoing hills with savage joy footnote descriptive sketchesw w sunday september thchamounythere is no carriage road further than to argentiÃ¨rewhen having parted with our car and guide we were slowly pursuing our way to the footpath between the mountains which was to lead us to the valorsine and thence by the tÃ¨tenoire to trient we heard from the churchyard of argentiÃ¨re on the opposite side of the river a sound of voices chanting a hymn or prayer and turning round saw in the green enclosure a lengthening processionthe priest in his robes the host and banners uplifted and men following two and twoand last of all a great number of females in like order the head and body of each covered with a white garment the stream continued to flow on for a long time till all had paced slowly round the church the men gathering close together to leave unencumbered space for the women the chanting continuing while the voice of the arve joined in accordant solemnity the procession was grave and simple agreeing with the simple decorations of a village churchthe banners made no glittering showthe females composed a moving girdle round the church their figures from head to foot covered with one piece of white cloth resembled the small pyramids of the glacier which were before our eyes and it was impossible to look at one and the other without fancifully connecting them together imagine the moving figures like a stream of pyramidsthe white church the halfconcealed village and the glacier close behind among pinetreesa pure sun shining over all and remember that these objects were seen at the base of those enormous mountains and you may have some faint notion of the effect produced on us by that beautiful spectacle it was a farewell to the vale of chamouny that can scarcely be less vividly remembered twenty years hence than when that wondrous vale being just out of sight after ascending a little way between the mountains through a grassy hollow we came to a small hamlet under shade of trees in summer foliage a very narrow clear rivulet beside the cottages was hastening with its tribute to the arve this simple scene transported us instantly to our vallies of westmoreland a few quiet children were near the doors and we discovered a young woman in the darkest coolest nook of shade between two of the houses seated on the ground intent upon her prayerbook the rest of the inhabitants were gone to join in the devotions at argentiÃ¨re the top of the ascent not a long one being gained we had a second cheering companion in our downward way another westmoreland brook of larger size as clear as crystal open to the sun and bustling but not angry it coursed by our side through a tract of craggy pastoral ground i do not speak of the needles of montanvert behind nor of other pikes uprising before us such sights belong not to westmoreland and i could fancy that i then paid them little regard it being for the sake of westmoreland alone that i like to dwell on this short passage of our journey which brought us in view of one of the most interesting of the vallies of the alps we descended with our little stream and saw its brief life in a moment cut off when it reached the berard the river of black water which is seen falling not in black but grey cataracts within the cove of a mountain that well deserves the former epithet though a bed of snow and glacier ice is seen among its piky and jagged ridges below those bare summits pine forests and crags are piled together with lawns and cottages between we enter at the side of the valley crossing a wooden bridgethen turning our backs on the scene just described we bend our course downward with the river that is hurrying away fresh from its glacier fountains how different a fellowtraveller from that little rivulet we had just parted from which we had seenstill bright as silverdrop into the grey stream the descending vale before us beautifulthe high enclosing hills interspersed with woods green pasturage and cottages the delight we had in journeying through the valorsine is not to be imaginedsunshine and shade were alike cheering while the very numerousness of the brown wood cottages descried among trees or outspread on the steep lawns and the people enjoying their sabbath leisure out of doors seemed to make a quiet spot more quiet wednesday september thlausannewe met with some pleasant englishmen from whom we heard particulars concerning the melancholy fate of our young friend the american seen by us for the last time on the top of the righi the tidings of his death had been first communicated but a few hours before by mr mulloch we had the comfort of hearing that his friend had saved himself by swimming and had paid the last duties to the stranger so far from home and kindred who lies quietly in the churchyard of kÃ¼snacht on the shores of zurich saturday september thfontainbleauin the very heart of the alps i never saw a more wild and lonely spotyet curious in the extreme and even beautiful thousands of white bleached rocks mostly in appearance not much larger than sheep lay on the steep declivities of the dell among bushes and low trees heather bilberries and other forest plants the effect of loneliness and desert wildness was indescribably increased by the remembrance of the palace we had left not an hour before the spot on which we stood is said to have been frequented by henry the ivth when he wished to retire from his court and attendants a few steps more brought us in view of fresh ranges of the forest hills plains and distant lonely dells the sunset was brilliantlight clouds in the west and overhead a spotless blue dome as we wind along the top of the steep the views are still changingthe plain expands eastward and again appear the white buildings of fontainbleau with something of romantic brightness in the fading light for we had tarried till a star or two reminded us it was time to move away in descending we followed one of the long straight tracks that intersect the forest in all directions bewildered among those tracks we were set right by a party of woodcutters going home from their labour monday october thboulognewe walked to buonapartes pillar which on the day when he harangued his soldiers pointing to the shores of england whither he should lead them to conquest he decreed should be erected in commemoration of the legion of honour the pillar is seen far and wide unfinished as the intricate casing of a scaffolding loftier than itself shows at whatever distance it is seen it is said the bourbons intend to complete the work and give it a new name but i think it more probable that the scaffolding may be left to fall away and the pile of marble remain strewn round as it is with unfinished blocks an undisputed monument of the founders vanity and arrogance and so it may stand as long as the brick towers of caligula have done a remnant of which yet appears on the cliffs we walked on the ground which had been covered by the army that dreamt of conquering england and were shown the very spot where their leader made his boastful speech footnote then establishedd w on the day fixed for our departure from boulogne the weather being boisterous and wind contrary the packet could not sail and we trusted ourselves to a small vessel with only one effective sailor on board even mary was daunted by the breakers outside the harbour and i descended into the vessel as unwillingly as a criminal might go to execution and hid myself in bed presently our little ship moved and before ten minutes were gone she struck upon the sands i felt that something disastrous had happened but knew not what till poor mary appeared in the cabin having been thrown down from the top of the steps there was again a frightful beating and grating of the bottom of the vesselwater rushing in very fast a young man an italian who had risen from a bed beside mine as pale as ashes groaned in agony kneeling at his prayers my condition was not much better than his but i was more quiet never shall i forget the kindness of a little irish woman who though she herself as she afterwards said was much frightened assured me even cheerfully that there was no danger i can not say that her words as assurances of safety had much effect upon me but the example of her courage made me become more collected and i felt her human kindness even at the moment when i believed that we might be all going to the bottom of the sea together and the agonising thoughts of the distress at home were rushing

afterwards still more beautiful when these faded before a brilliant spectacle caused by a parcel of carpenters and sailors burning the tar from the hulk of a large vessel under repair upon the beach i

to rapture when during mass the full organ swelled and penetrated the remotest corners of that stately edificehere we were never weary of lingering but none of the churches did we leave unvisited that

chamber looked upon pleasurewalks which we at once determined must be the university garden naturally giving to this place the sort of accommodations found in our own seats of learning but no such luxury belongs to the students of leyden the ground with its plantations through which these walks are carried and upon which the sun now so cheerfully shone was formerly covered with buildings that were destroyed together with the inhabitants by an explosion which took place in a barge of gunpowder in then lying in the neighbouring canal there are no colleges or separate dwellings in leyden for the students they are lodged with different families in the town our guide had three at his house from england as he told us a wandering sheep lying at the threshold as we passed a goodlooking house in the street were told that this was a pensioner upon the public that it would lie there till it was fed and then would pass on to some other door this animal had been brought up the pet of a soldier once quartered at leyden and when he changed his situation his favourite was sent into the fields but preferring human society it could not be confined amongst its fellows but ever returned to the town and begging its daily food it passed from door to door of those houses which its old master had frequented obstinately keeping its station until an alms was bestowedbread vegetables soup nothing

containing pots of fragrant geranium and a beautiful flowering fern brought i suppose from the market where we saw the commodities offered for sale the groups of figures with their baskets and stalls of vegetables ranged along the shady avenues have often a striking effect the fanciful architecture towering above as seen from the end of one of the market streets especially if the view be terminated by a spire or a lofty tower the spires of amsterdam and different spires and shipping rise beyond the flat line of the water the same cold north wind is breathing in the sunshine now that we are not within the screen of the trees the plains are scattered with cattle and a broken line of dutch farmhouses which we have hitherto in vain looked for stretch at a fields distance from the

hauled through the town herrings in the hand on sticks and huge black fish dragged through the dust sick at the sight ferried across the harbour to the island castle very grand and very wild with cathedral tower and extensive ruins and tombstones of recent date several of shipwrecked men our guide showed us the place where as sir walter scott tells us captain edward christian was confined and another dungeon where the duchess of gloucester was shut up fifteen years and there died and used to appear in the shape of a black dog and a soldier who used to laugh at the story vowed he would speak to it and died raving mad the castle was built before artillery was used and the walls are so thin that it is surprising that it has stood so long the grassy floor of the hill delightful to rest on through a summers day to view the ships and sea and hear the dashing waves here seldom gentle for the entrance to this narrow harbour is very rocky fine caves towards the north but it being high water we could not go to them our way to kirk michael a delightful terrace sea to our left cultivated hills to the right and views backwards to peele charming the town stands under a very steep green

the cross the mother and infant jesus the manx arms and other devices near it the square foundation surrounded with steps of another cross on which is now placed a small sundial the whole lately barbarously whitewashed with church and roofa glaring contrast to the grey thatched cottages and green trees which partly embower the church numerous are the gravestones surrounding that neat and humble building a sanctuary taken from the waste where fern and heath grow round and overgrow the graves i sate on the hill while henry sought the holy well visited once a year by the manx men and women where they leave their offeringa pin or any other trifle walked leisurely back to ramsey fine views of the bay the orangecoloured buoy the lovely town the green steeps the town very pretty seen
