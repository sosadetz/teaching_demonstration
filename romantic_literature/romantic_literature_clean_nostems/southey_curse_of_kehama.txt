in the religion of the hindoos which of all false religions is the most monstrous in its fables and the most fatal in its effects there is one remarkable peculiarity prayers penances and sacrifices are supposed to possess an inherent and actual value in no degree depending upon the disposition or motive of the person who performs them they are drafts upon heaven for which the gods can not refuse payment the worst men bent upon the worst designs have in this manner obtained power which has made them formidable to the supreme deities themselves and rendered an avatar or incarnation of veeshnoo the preserver necessary this belief is the foundation of the following poem the story is original but in all its parts consistent with the superstition upon which it is built and however startling the fictions may appear they might almost be called credible when compared with the genuine tales of hindoo mythology no figures can be imagined more antipicturesque and less poetical than the mythological personages of the bramins this deformity was easily kept out of sighttheir hundred hands are but a clumsy personification of power their numerous heads only a gross image of divinity whose countenance as the bhagvatgeeta expresses it is turned on every side to the other obvious objection that the religion of hindostan is not generally known enough to supply fit machinery for an english poem i can only answer that if every allusion to it throughout the work is not sufficiently selfexplained to render the passage intelligible there is a want of skill in the poet even those readers who should be wholly unacquainted with the writings of our learned orientalists will find all the preliminary knowledge that can be needful in the brief explanation of mythological names

not tie my strains to our antique poets veins being born as free as these i will sing as i shall please george wither mythological names brama the creator veeshnoo the preserver seeva the destroyer these form the trimourtee or trinity as it has been called of the bramins the allegory is obvious but it has been made for the trimourtee not the trimourtee for the allegory and these deities are regarded by the people as three distinct and personal gods the two latter have at this day their hostile sects of worshippers that of seeva is the most numerous and in this poem seeva is represented as supreme among the gods this is the same god whose name is variously written seeb sieven and siva chiven by the french xiven by the portugueze and whom european writers sometimes denominate eswara

curse of kehama i the funeral midnight and yet no eye through all the imperial city closd in sleep behold her streets ablaze with light that seems to kindle the red sky her myriads swarming through the crowded ways master and slave old age and infancy all all abroad to gaze housetop and balcony clustered with women who throw back their veils with unimpeded and insatiate sight to view the funeral pomp which passes by as if the mournful rite were but to them a scene of joyance and delight vainly ye blessed twinklers of the night your feeble beams ye shed quenchd in the unnatural light which might outstare even the broad eye of day and thou from thy celestial way pourest o moon an ineffectual ray for lo ten thousand torches flame and flare upon the midnight air blotting the lights of heaven with one portentous glare behold the fragrant smoke in many a fold ascending floats along the fiery sky and hangeth visible on high a dark and waving canopy hark tis the funeral trumpets breath tis the dirge of death at once ten thousand drums begin with one long thunderpeal the ear assailing ten thousand voices then join in and with one deep and general din pour their wild wailing the song of praise is drownd amid that deafening sound you hear no more the trumpets tone you hear no more the mourners moan though the trumpets breath and the dirge of death mingle and swell the funeral yell but rising over all in one acclaim is heard the echoed and reechoed name from all that countless rout arvalan arvalan arvalan arvalan ten times ten thousand voices in one shout call arvalan the overpowering sound from house to house repeated rings about from tower to tower rolls round the deathprocession moves along their bald heads shining to the torches ray the bramins lead the way chaunting the funeral song and now at once they shout arvalan arvalan with quick rebound of sound all in accordant cry arvalan arvalan the universal multitude reply in vain ye thunder on his ear the name would ye awake the dead borne upright in his palankeen there arvalan is seen a glow is on his face a lively red tis but the crimson canopy which oer his cheek the reddening shade hath shed he moves he nods his head but the motion comes from the bearers tread as the body borne aloft in state sways with the impulse of its own dead weight close following his dead son kehama came nor joining in the ritual song nor calling the dear name with head deprest and funeral vest and arms enfolded on his breast silent and lost in thought he moves along king of the world his slaves unenvying now behold their wretched lord rejoiced they see the mighty rajahs misery for nature in his pride hath dealt the blow and taught the master of mankind to know even he himself is man and not exempt from woe o sight of grief the wives of arvalan young azla young nealliny are seen their widowrobes of white with gold and jewels bright each like an eastern queen woe woe around their palankeen as on a bridal day with symphony and dance and song their kindred and their friends come on the dance of sacrifice the funeral song and next the victim slaves in long array richly bedight to grace the fatal day move onward to their death the clarions stirring breath lifts their thin robes in every flowing fold and swells the woven gold that on the agitated air trembles and glitters to the torches glare a man and maid of aspect wan and wild then side by side by bowmen guarded came o wretched father o unhappy child them were all eyes of all the throng exploring is this the daring man who raised his fatal hand at arvalan is this the wretch condemned to feel kehamas dreadful wrath them were all hearts of all the throng deploring for not in that innumerable throng was one who lovd the dead for who could know what aggravated wrong provokd the desperate blow far far behind beyond all reach of sight in ordered files the torches flow along one everlengthening line of gliding light far far behind rolls on the undistinguishable clamour of horn and trump and tambour incessant at the roar of streams which down the wintry mountain pour and louder than the dread commotion of stormy billows on a rocky shore when the winds rage over the wares and ocean to the tempest raves and now toward the bank they go where winding on their way below deep and strong the waters flow here doth the funeral pile appear with myrrh and ambergris bestrewd and built of precious sandal wood they cease their music and their outcry here gently they rest the bier they wet the face of arvalan no sign of life the sprinkled drops excite they feel his breast no motion there they feel his lips no breath for not with feeble nor with erring hand the stern avenger dealt the blow of death then with a doubling peal and deeper blast the tambours and the trumpets sound on high and with a last and loudest cry they call on arvalan woe woe for azla takes her seat upon the funeral pile calmly she took her seat calmly the whole terrific pomp surveyd as on her lap the while the lifeless head of arvalan was laid woe woe nealliny the young nealliny they strip her ornaments away bracelet and anklet ring and chain and zone around her neck they leave the marriage knot alone that marriage band which when yon waning moon was young around her virgin neck with bridal joy was hung then with white flowers the coronal of death her jetty locks they crown o sight of misery yon can not hear her cries all other sound in that wild dissonance is drownd but in her face you see the supplication and the agony see in her swelling throat the desperate strength that with vain effort struggles yet for life her arms contracted now in fruitless strife now wildly at full length towards the crowd in vain for pity spread they force her on they bind her to the dead then all around retire circling the pile the ministring bramins stand each lifting in his hand a torch on fire alone the father of the dead advanced and lit the funeral pyre at once on every side the circling torches drop at once on every side the fragrant oil is pourd at once on every side the rapid flames rush up then hand in hand the victim band roll in the dance around the funeral pyre their garments flying folds float inward to the fire in drunken whirl they wheel around one drops another plunges in and still with overwhelming din the tambours and the trumpets sound and clap of hand and shouts and cries from all the multitude arise while round and round in giddy wheel intoxicate they roll and reel till one by one whirld in they fall and the devouring flames have swallowed all then all was still the drums and clarions ceasd the multitude were hushd in silent awe only the roaring of the flames was heard ii the curse alone towards the table of the dead kehama movd there on the altarstone honey and rice he spread there with collected voice and painful tone he calld upon his son lo arvalan appears only kehamas powerful eye beheld the thin etherial spirit hovering nigh only the rajahs ear receivd his feeble breath and is this all the mournful spirit said this all that thou canst give me after death this unavailing pomp these empty pageantries that mock the dead in bitterness the rajah heard and groand and smote his breast and oer his face cowld the white mourning vest arvalan art thou not powerful even like a god and must i through my years of wandering shivering and naked to the elements in wretchedness await the hour of yamens wrath i thought thou wouldst embody me anew undying as i am yea recreate me father is this all this all and thou almighty but in that wrongful and upbraiding tone kehama found relief for rising anger half supprest his grief reproach not me he cried had i not spellsecurd thee from disease fire sword all common accidents of man and thou fool fool to perish by a stake and by a peasants arm even now when from reluctant heaven forcing new gifts and mightier attributes so soon i should have quelld the deathgods power waste not thy wrath on me quoth arvalan it was my hour of folly fate prevaild nor boots it to reproach me that i fell i am in misery father other souls predoomd to indras heaven enjoy the dawn of bliss to them the tempered elements minister joy genial delight the sun sheds on their happy being and the stars effuse on them benignant influencies and thus oer earth and air they roam at will and when the number of their days is full go fearlessly before the awful throne but i all naked feeling and raw life what worse than this hath yamens hell in store if ever thou didst love me mercy father save me for thou canst save the elements know and obey thy voice kehama the elements shall torture thee no more even while i speak already dost then feel their power is gone fear not i can not call again the past fate hath made that its own but fate shall yield to me the future and thy doom be fixd by mine not yamens will meantime all power whereof thy feeble spirit can be made participant i give is there aught else to mitigate thy lot arvalan only the sight of vengeance give me that vengeance full worthy vengeance not the stroke of sodden punishment no agony that spends itself and leaves the wretch at rest but lasting long revenge kehama what boy is that cup sweet then take thy fill so as he spake a glow of dreadful pride inflamd his cheek with quick and angry stride he movd toward the pile and raisd his hand to hush the crowd and cried bring forth the murderer at the rajahs voice calmly and like a man whom fear had stunnd ladurlad came obedient to the call but kailyal started at the sound and gave a womanly shriek and back she drew and eagerly she rolld her eyes around as if to seek for aid albeit she knew no aid could there be found it chanced that near her on the riverbrink the sculpturd form of marriataly stood it was an idol roughly hewn of wood artless and poor and rude the goddess of the poor was she none else regarded her with piety but when that holy image kailyal viewd to that she sprung to that she clung on her own goddess with closeclasping arms for life the maiden hung they seizd the maid with unrelenting grasp they bruisd her tender limbs she nothing yielding to this only hope clings with the strength of frenzy and despair she screams not now she breathes not now she sends not up one vow she forms not in her soul one secret prayer all thought all feeling and all powers of life in the one effort centering wrathful they with tug and strain would force the maid away didst thou o marriataly see their strife in pity didst thou see the suffering maid or was thine anger kindled that rude hands assaild thy holy image for behold the holy image shakes irreverently bold they deem the maid relaxd her stubborn hold and now with force redoubled drag their prey and now the rooted idol to their sway bends yields and now it falls but then they scream for lo they feel the crumbling bank give way and all are plunged into the stream she hath escapd my will kehama cried she hath escapd but thou art here i have thee still the worser criminal and on ladurlad while he spake severe he fixd his dreadful frown the strong reflection of the pile lit his dark lineaments lit the protruded brow the gathered front the steady eye of wrath but while the fearful silence yet endurd ladurlad rousd his soul ere yet the voice of destiny which trembled on the rajahs lips was loosd eager he interposd as if despair had wakend him to hope mercy oh mercy only in defence only instinctively only to save my child i smote the prince king of the world be merciful crush me but torture not the manalmighty deignd him no reply still he stood silent in no human mood of mercy in no hesitating thought of right and justice at the length he raisd his brow yet unrelaxd his lips unclosd and utterd from the heart with the whole feeling of his soul enforced the gatherd vengeance came i charm thy life from the weapons of strife from stone and from wood from fire and from flood from the serpents tooth and the beasts of blood from sickness i charm thee and time shall not harm thee but earth which is mine its fruits shall deny thee and water shall hear me and know thee and fly thee and the winds shall not touch thee when they pass by thee and the dews shall not wet thee when they fall nigh thee and thou shalt seek death to release thee in vain thou shalt live in thy pain while kehama shall reign with a fire in thy heart and a fire in thy brain and sleep shall obey me and visit thee never and the curse shall be on thee for ever and ever there where the curse had stricken him there stood the miserable man there stood ladurlad with loosehanging arms and eyes of idiot wandering was it a dream alas he heard the river flow he heard the crumbling of the pile he heard the wind which showerd the thin white ashes round there motionless he stood as if he hopd it were a dream and feard to move lest he should prove the actual misery and still at times he met kehamas eye kehamas eye that fastend on him still iii the recovery the rajah turnd toward the pile again loud rose the song of death from all the crowd their din the instruments begin and once again join in with overwhelming sound ladurlad starts he looks around what hast thou here in view o wretched man in this disastrous scene the soldier train the bramins who renew their ministry around the funeral pyre the empty palankeens the dimlyfading fire where too is she whom most his heart held dear his bestbeloved kailyal where is she the solace and the joy of many a year of widowhood is she then gone and is he left allutterly alone to bear his blasting curse and none to succour or deplore him he staggers from the dreadful spot the throng give way in fear before him like one who carries pestilence about shuddering they shun him where he moves along and now he wanders on beyond the noisy rout he can not fly and leave his curse behind yet doth he seem to find a comfort in the change of circumstance adown the shore he strays unknowing where his wretched feet may rest but farthest from the fatal place is best by this in the orient sky appears the gleam of day lo what is yonder in the stream down the slow river floating slow in distance indistinct and dimly seen the childless one with idle eye followed its motion thoughtlessly idly he gazd unknowing why and half unconscious that he watchd its way belike it is a tree which some rude tempest in its sudden sway tore from the rock or from the hollow shore the undermining stream hath swept away but when anon outswelling by its side a womans robe he spied oh then ladurlad started as one who in his grave had heard an angels call yea marriataly then hast deignd to save yea goddess it is she to thy dear image clinging senselessly and thus in happy hour upborne amid the wave by that preserving power headlong in hope and in joy ladurlad dashd in the water the water knew kehamas spell the water shrunk before him blind to the miracle he rushes to his daughter and treads the riverdepths in transport wild and clasps and saves his child upon the farther side a level shore of sand was spread thither ladurlad bore his daughter holding still with senseless hand the saving goddess there upon the sand he laid the livid maid raisd up against his knees her drooping head bent to her lips her lips as pale as death if he might feel her breath his own the while in hope and dread suspended chafd her cold breast and ever and anon let his hand rest upon her heart extended soon did his touch perceive or fancy there the first faint motion of returning life he chafes her feet and lays them bare in the sun and now again upon her breast lays his hot hand and now her lips he prest for now the stronger throb of life he knew and her lips tremble too the breath comes palpably her quivering lids unclose feebly and feebly fell relapsing as it seemd to dead repose so in her fathers arms thus languidly while over her with earnest gaze he hung silent and motionless she lay and painfully and slowly writhd at fits at fits to short convulsive starts was stung till when the struggle and strong agony had left her quietly she lay reposd her eyes now resting on ladurlads face relapsing now and now again unclosd the look she fixd upon his face implies nor thought nor feeling senselessly she lies composd like one who sleeps with open eyes long he leant over her in silence and in fear kailyal at length he cried in such a tone as a poor mother ventures who draws near with silent footstep to her childs sick bed my father cried the maid and raisd her head awakening then to life and thought thou here for when his voice she heard the dreadful past recurrd which dimly like a dream of pain till now with troubled sense confusd her brain and hath he spard us then she cried half rising as she spake for hope and joy the sudden strength supplied in mercy hath he curbd his cruel will that still thou livest but as thus she said impatient of that look of hope her sire shook hastily his head oh he hath laid a curse upon my life a clinging curse quoth he hath sent a fire into my heart and brain a burning fire for ever there to be the winds of heaven must never breathe on me the rains and dews must never fall on me water must mock my thirst and shrink from me the common earth must yield no fruit to me sleep blessed sleep must never light on me and death who comes to all must fly from me and never never set ladurlad free this is a dream exclaimd the incredulous maid yet in her voice the while a fear exprest which in her larger eye was manifest this is a dream she rose and laid her hand upon her fathers brow to try the charm he could not bear the pressure there he shrunk he warded off her arm as though it were an enemys blow he smote his daughters arm aside her eye glanced down his mantle she espied and caught it up oh misery kailyal cried he bore me from the riverdepths and yet his garment is not wet iv the departure reclind beneath a cocoas feathery shade ladurlad lies and kailyal on his lap her head hath laid to hide her streaming eyes the boatman sailing on his easy way with envious eye beheld them where they lay for every herb and flower was fresh and fragrant with the early dew sweet sung the birds in that delicious hour and the cool gale of morning as it blew not yet subdued by days increasing power ruffling the surface of the silvery stream swept oer the moistend sand and raisd no shower telling their tale of love the boatman thought they lay at that lone hour and who so blest as they but now the sun in heaven is high the little songsters of the sky sit silent in the sultry hour they pant and palpitate with heat their bills are open languidly to catch the passing air they hear it not they feel it not it murmurs not it moves not the boatman as he looks to land admires what men so mad to linger there for yonder cocoas shade behind them falls a single spot upon the burning sand there all the morning was ladurlad laid silent and motionless like one at ease there motionless upon her fathers knees reclind the silent maid the man was still pondering with steady mind as if it were anothers curse his own portentous lot scanning it oer and oer in busy thought as though it were a last nights tale of woe before the cottage door by some old beldame sung while young and old assembled round listened as if by witchery bound in fearful pleasure to her wonderous tongue musing so long he lay that all things seem unreal to his sense even like a dream a monstrous dream of things which could not be that beating burning brow why it was now the height of noon and he was lying there in the broad sun all bare what if he felt no wind the air was still that was the general will of nature not his own peculiar doom yon rows of rice erect and silent stand the shadow of the cocoas lightest plume is steady on the sand is it indeed a dream he rose to try impatient to the waterside he went and down he bent and in the stream he plungd his hasty arm to break the visionary charm with fearful eye and fearful heart his daughter watchd the event she saw the start and shudder she heard the indrawn groan for the water knew kehamas charm the water shrunk before his arm his dry hand movd about unmoistend there as easily might that dry hand avail to stop the passing gale or grasp the impassive air he is almighty then exclaimd the wretched man in his despair air knows him water knows him sleep his dreadful word will keep even in the grave there is no rest for me cut off from that last hope the wretches joy and veeshnoo hath no power to save nor seeva to destroy oh wrong not them quoth kailyal wrong not the heavenly powers our hope is all in them they are not blind and lighter wrongs than ours and lighter crimes than his have drawn the incarnate down among mankind already have the immortals heard our cries and in the mercy of their righteousness beheld us in the hour of our distress she spake with streaming eyes where pious love and ardent feeling beam and turning to the image threw her grateful arms around it it was thou who savedst me from the stream my marriataly it was thou i had not else been here to share my fathers curse to suffer now and yet to thank thee thus here then the maiden cried dear father here raise our own goddess our divine preserver the mighty of the earth despise her rites she loves the poor who serve her set up her image here with heart and voice the guardian goddess bless for jealously would she resent neglect and thanklessness set up her image here and bless her for her aid with tongue and soul sincere so saying on her knees the maid began the pious toil soon their joint labour scoops the easy soil they raise the image up with reverent hand and round its rooted base they heap the sand o thou whom we adore o marriataly thee do i implore the virgin cried my goddess pardon thou the unwilling wrong that i no more with dance and song can do thy daily service as of yore the flowers which last i wreathd around thy brow are withering there and never now shall i at eve adore thee and swimming round with arms outspread poise the full pitcher on my head in dextrous dance before thee white underneath the reedy shed at rest my father sate the evening rites to view and blest thy name and blest his daughter too then heaving from her heart a heavy sigh o goddess from that happy home cried she the almighty man hath forced us and homeward with the thought unconsciously she turnd her dizzy eye but there on high with many a dome and pinnacle and spire the summits of the golden palaces blazd in the dark blue sky aloft like fire father away she cried away why linger we so nigh for not to him hath nature given the thousand eyes of deity always and every where with open sight to persecute our flight away away she said and took her fathers hand and like a child he followed where she led v the separation evening comes on arising from the stream homeward the tall flamingo wings his flight and where he sails athwart the setting beam his scarlet plumage glows with deeper light the watchman at the wishd approach of night gladly forsakes the field where he all day to scare the winged plunderers from their prey with shout and sling on yonder claybuilt height hath borne the sultry ray hark at the golden palaces the bramin strikes the hour for leagues and leagues around the brazen sound rolls through the stillness of departing day like thunder far away behold them wandering on their hopeless way unknowing where they stray yet sure whereer they stop to find no rest the evening gale is blowing it plays among the trees like plumes upon a warriors crest they see yon cocoas tossing to the breeze ladurlad views them with impatient mind impatiently he hears the gale of evening blowing the sound of waters flowing as if all sights and sounds combind to mock his irremediable woe for not for him the blessed waters flow for not for him the gales of evening blow a fire is in his heart and brain and nature hath no healing for his pain the moon is up still pale amid the lingering light a cloud ascending in the eastern sky sails slowly oer the vale and darkens round and closesin the night no hospitable house is nigh no travellers home the wanderers to invite forlorn and with long watching overworn the wretched father and the wretched child lie down amid the wild before them full in sight a white flag flapping to the winds of night marks where the tyger seizd his human prey far far away with natural dread shunning the perilous spot at other times abhorrent had they fled but now they heed it not nothing they care the boding deathflag now in vain for them may gleam and flutter there despair and agony in him prevent all other thought and kailyal hath no heart or sense for aught save her dear fathers strange and miserable lot there in the woodland shade upon the lap of that unhappy maid his head ladurlad laid and never word he spake nor heavd he one complaining sigh nor groand he with his misery but silently for her dear sake endurd the raging pain and now the moon was hid on high no stars were glimmering in the sky she could not see her fathers eye how red with burning agony perhaps he may be cooler now she hoped and longd to touch his brow with gentle hand yet did not dare to lay the painful pressure there now forward from the tree she bent and anxiously her head she leant and listened to his breath ladurlads breath was short and quick yet regular it came and like the slumber of the sick in pantings still the same oh if he sleeps her lips unclose intently listening to the sound that equal sound so like repose still quietly the sufferer lies bearing his torment now with resolute will he neither moves nor groans nor sighs doth satiate cruelty bestow this little respite to his woe she thought or are there gods who look below perchance thought kailyal willingly deceivd our marriataly hath his pain relievd and she hath bade the blessed sleep assuage his agony despite the rajahs rage that was a hope which filld her gushing eyes and made her heart in silent yearnings rise to bless the power divine in thankfulness and yielding to that joyful thought her mind backward the maid her aching head reclind against the tree and to her fathers breath in fear she hearkend still with earnest ear but soon forgetful fits the effort broke in starts of recollection then she woke till now benignant nature overcame the virgins weary and exhausted frame nor able more her painful watch to keep she closd her heavy lids and sunk to sleep vain was her hope he did not rest from pain the curse was burning in his brain alas the innocent maiden thought he slept but sleep the rajahs dread commandment kept sleep knew kehamas curse the dews of night fell round them now they never bathd ladurlads brow they knew kehamas curse the nightwind is abroad aloft it moves among the stirring trees he only heard the breeze no healing aid to him it brought it playd around his head and touchd him not it knew kehamas curse listening ladurlad lay in his despair if kailyal slept for wherefore should she share her fathers wretchedness which none could cure better alone to suffer he must bear the burthen of his curse but why endure the unavailing presence of her grief she too apart from him might find relief for dead the rajah deemd her and as thus already she his dread revenge had fled so might she still escape and live secure gently he lifts his head and kailyal does not feel gently he rises up she slumbers still gently he steals away with silent tread anon she started for she felt him gone she calld and through the stillness of the night his step was heard in flight mistrustful for a moment of the sound she listens till the step is heard no more but then she knows that he indeed is gone and with a thrilling shriek she rushes on the darkness and the wood impede her speed she lifts her voice again ladurlad and again alike in vain and with a louder cry straining its tone to hoarseness far away selfish in misery he heard the call and faster did he fly she leans against that tree whose jutting bough smote her so rudely her poor heart how audibly it panted with sudden stop and start her breath how short and painfully it came hark all is still around her and the night so utterly dark she opened her eyes and she closed them and the blackness and blank were the same twas like a dream of horror and she stood half doubting whether all indeed were true a tygers howl loud echoing through the wood rousd her the dreadful sound she knew and turnd instinctively to what she feared far off the tygers hungry howl was heard a nearer horror met the maidens view for right before her a dim form appeard a human form in that black night distinctly shaped by its own lurid light such light as the sickly moon is seen to shed through spellraisd fogs a bloody baleful red that spectre fixd his eyes upon her full the light which shone in their accursed orbs was like a light from hell and it grew deeper kindling with the view she could not turn her sight from that infernal gaze which like a spell bound her and held her rooted to the ground it palsied every power her limbs availd her not in that dread hour there was no moving thence thought memory sense were gone she heard not now the tygers nearer cry she thought not on her father now her cold heartsblood ran back her hand lay senseless on the bough it claspd her feet were motionless her fascinated eyes like the stone eyeballs of a statue fixd yet conscious of the sight that blasted them the wind is abroad it opens the clouds scattered before the gale they skurry through the sky and the darkness retiring rolls over the vale the stars in their beauty come forth on high and through the darkblue night the moon rides on triumphant broad and bright distinct and darkening in her light appears that spectre foul the moon beam gives his face and form to sight the shape of man the living form and face of arvalan his hands are spread to clasp her but at that sight of dread the maid awoke as if a lightningstroke had burst the spell of fear away she broke all franticly and fled there stood a temple near beside the way an open fane of pollear gentle god to whom the travellers for protection pray with elephantine head and eye severe here stood his image such as when he seizd and tore the rebel giant from the ground with mighty trunk wreathd round his impotent bulk and on his tusks on high impald upheld him between earth and sky thither the affrighted maiden sped her flight and she hath reachd the place of sanctuary and now within the temple in despite yea even before the altar in his sight hath arvalan with fleshly arm of might seizd her that instant the insulted god caught him aloft and from his sinuous grasp as if from some tort catapult let loose over the forest hurld him all abroad overcome with dread she tarried not to see what heavenly power had saved her in that hour breathless and faint she fled and now her foot struck on the knotted root of a broad manchineil and there the maid fell senselessly beneath the deadly shade vi casyapa shall this then be thy fate o lovely maid thus kailyal must thy sorrows then be ended her face upon the ground her arms at length extended there like a corpse behold her laid beneath the deadly shade what if the hungry tyger prowling by should snuff his banquet nigh alas death needs not now his ministry the baleful boughs hang oer her the poisondews descend what power will now restore her what god will be her friend bright and so beautiful was that fair night it might have calmd the gay amid their mirth and given the wretched a delight in tears one of the glendoveers the loveliest race of all of heavenly birth hovering with gentle motion oer the earth amid the moonlight air in sportive flight was floating round and round unknowing where his joyous way was tending he saw the maid where motionless she lay and stoopt his flight descending and raisd her from the ground her heavy eyelids are half closd her cheeks are pale and livid like the dead down hang her loose arms lifelessly down hangs her languid head with timely pity touchd for one so fair the gentle glendoveer prest her thus pale and senseless to his breast and springs aloft in air with sinewy wings and bears the maiden there where himakoot the holy mount on high from midearth rising in midheaven shines in its glory like the throne of even soaring with strenuous flight above he bears her to the blessed grove where in his ancient and august abodes there dwells old casyapa the sire of gods the father of the immortals sate where underneath the tree of life the fountains of the sacred river sprung the father of the immortals smild benignant on his son knowest thou he said my child ereenia knowest thou whom thou bringest here a mortal to the holy atmosphere ereenia i found her in the groves of earth beneath a poisontree thus lifeless as thou seest her in pity have i brought her to these bowers not erring father by that smile by that benignant eye casyapa what if the maid be sinful if her ways were ways of darkness and her death predoomd to that black hour of midnight when the moon hath turnd her face away unwilling to behold the unhappy end of guilt ereenia then what a lie my sire were written here in these fair characters and she had died sure proof of purer life and happier doom now in the moonlight in the eye of heaven if i had left so fair a flower to fade but thou all knowing as thou art why askest thou of me o father oldest holiest wisest best to whom all things are plain why askest thou of me casyapa knowest thou kehama ereenia the almighty man who knows not him and his tremendous power the tyrant of the earth the enemy of heaven casyapa fearest thou the rajah ereenia he is terrible casyapa yea he is terrible such power hath he that hope hath entered hell the asuras and the spirits of the damnd acclaim their hero yamen with the might of godhead scarce can quell the rebel race accurst half from their beds of torture they uprise and half uproot their chains is there not fear in heaven the souls that are in bliss suspend their joy the danger hath disturbd the calm of deity and brama fears and veeshnoo turns his face in doubt toward seevas throne ereenia i have seen indra tremble at his prayers and at his dreadful penances turn pale they claim and wrest from seeva power so vast that even seevas self the highest can not grant and be secure casyapa and darest thou ereenia brave the almighty tyrants power ereenia i brave him father i casyapa darest thou brave his vengeance for if not take her again to earth cast her before the tyger in his path or where the deathdewdropping tree may work kehamas will ereenia never casyapa then meet his wrath for he even he hath set upon this worm his wanton foot ereenia i knew her not how wretched and how fair when here i wafted her poor child of earth shall i forsake thee seeing thee so fair so wretched o my father let the maid dwell in the sacred grove casyapa that must not be for force and evil then would enter here ganges the holy stream which cleanseth sin would flow from hence polluted in its springs and they who gasp upon its banks in death feel no salvation piety and peace and wisdom these are mine but not the power which could protect her from the almighty man nor when the spirit of dead arvalan should persecute her here to glut his rage to heap upon her yet more agony and ripen more damnation for himself ereenia dead arvalan casyapa all power to him whereof the disembodied spirit in its state of weakness could be made participant kehama hath assignd until his days of wandering shall be numbered ereenia look she drinks the gale of healing from the blessed groves she stirs and lo her hand hath touchd the holy river in its source who would have shrunk if aught impure were nigh casyapa the maiden of a truth is pure from sin the waters of the holy spring about the hand of kailyal play they rise they sparkle and they sing leaping where languidly she lay as if with that rejoicing stir the holy spring would welcome her the tree of life which oer her spread benignant bowd its sacred head and dropt its dews of healing and her heartblood at every breath recovering from the strife of death drew in new strength and feeling behold her beautiful in her repose a lifebloom reddening now her darkbrown cheek and lo her eyes unclose dark as the depth of ganges spring profound when night hangs over it bright as the moons refulgent beam that quivers on its clear upsparkling stream soon she let fall her lids as one who from a blissful dream waking to thoughts of pain fain would return to sleep and dream again distrustful of the sight she moves not fearing to disturb the deep and full delight in wonder fixd opening again her eye she gazes silently thinking her mortal pilgrimage was past that she had reachd her heavenly home of rest and these were gods before her or spirits of the blest lo at ereenias voice a ship of heaven comes sailing down the skies where wouldst thou bear her cries the ancient sire of gods straight to the swerga to my bower of bliss the glendoveer replies to indras own abodes foe of her foe were it alone for this indra should guard her from his vengeance there but if the god forbear unwilling yet the perilous strife to try or shrinking from the dreadful rajahs might weak as i am o father even i stand forth in seevas sight trust thou in him whatever betide and stand forth fearlessly the sire of gods replied all that he wills is right and doubt not thou howeer our feeble scope of sight may fail us now his righteous will in all things must be done my blessing be upon thee o my son vii the swerga then in the ship of heaven ereenia laid the waking wondering maid the ship of heaven instinct with thought displayd its living sail and glides along the sky on either side in wavy tide the clouds of morn along its path divide the winds who swept in wild career on high before its presence check their charmed force the winds that loitering laggd along their course around the living bark enamourd play swell underneath the sail and sing before its way that bark in shape was like the furrowed shell wherein the seanymphs to their parentking on festal day their duteous offerings bring its hue go watch the last green light ere evening yields the western sky to night or fix upon the sun thy strenuous sight till thou hast reachd its orb of chrysolite the sail from end to end displayd bent like a rainbow oer the maid an angels head with visual eye through trackless space directs its chosen way nor aid of wing nor foot nor fin requires to voyage oer the obedient sky smooth as the swan when not a breeze at even disturbs the surface of the silver stream through air and sunshine sails the ship of heaven recumbent there the maiden glides along on her aerial way how swift she feels not though the swiftest wind had flaggd in flight behind motionless as a sleeping babe she lay and all serene in mind feeling no fear for that etherial air with such new life and joyance filld her heart fear could not enter there for sure she deemd her mortal part was oer and she was sailing to the heavenly shore and that angelic form who movd beside was some good spirit sent to be her guide daughter of earth therein thou deemst aright and never yet did form more beautiful in dreams of night descending from on high bless the religious virgins gifted sight nor like a vision of delight rise on the rapturd poets inward eye of human form divine was he the immortal youth of heaven who floated by even such as that divinest form shall be in those blest stages of our onward race when no infirmity low thought nor base desire nor wasting care deface the semblance of our heavenly sire the wings of eagle or of cherubim had seemd unworthy him angelic power and dignity and grace were in his glorious pennons from the neck down to the ankle reachd their swelling web richer than robes of tyrian die that deck imperial majesty their colour like the winters moonless sky when all the stars of midnights canopy shine forth or like the azure deep at noon reflecting back to heaven a brighter blue such was their tint when closd but when outspread the permeating light shed through their substance thin a varying hue now bright as when the rose beauteous as fragrant gives to scent and sight a like delight now like the juice that flows from douros generous vine or ruby when with deepest red it glows or as the morning clouds refulgent shine when at forthcoming of the lord of day the orient like a shrine kindles as it receives the rising ray and heralding his way proclaims the presence of the power divine thus glorious were the wings of that celestial spirit as he went disporting through his native element nor these alone the gorgeous beauties that they gave to view through the broad membrane branchd a pliant bone spreading like fibres from their parent stem its veins like interwoven silver shone or as the chaster hue of pearls that grace some sultans diadem now with slow stroke and strong behold him smite the buoyant air and now in gentler flight on motionless wing expanded shoot along through air and sunshine sails the ship of heaven far far beneath them lies the gross and heavy atmosphere of earth and with the swerga gales the maid of mortal birth at every breath a new delight inhales and now toward its port the ship of heaven swift as a falling meteor shapes its flight yet gently as the dews of night that gem and do not bend the harebells slenderest stem daughter of earth ereenia cried alight this is thy place of rest the swerga this lo here my bower of bliss he furld his azure wings which round him fold graceful as robes of grecian chief of old the happy kailyal knew not where to gaze her eyes around in joyful wonder roam now turnd upon the lovely glendoveer now on his heavenly home ereenia here maiden rest in peace and i will guard thee feeble as i am the almighty rajah shall not harm thee here while indra keeps his throne kailyal alas thou fearest him immortal as thou art thou fearest him i thought that death had savd me from his power not even the dead are safe ereenia long years of life and happiness o child of earth be thine from death i savd thee and from all thy foes will save thee while the swerga is secure kailyal not me alone o gentle deveta i have a father suffering upon earth a persecuted wretched poor good man for whose strange misery there is no human help and none but i dare comfort him beneath kehamas curse o gentle deveta protect him too ereenia come plead thyself to indra words like thine may win their purpose rouse his slumbering heart and make him yet put forth his arm to wield the thunder while the thunder is his own then to the garden of the deity ereenia led the maid in the mid garden towerd a giant tree rockrooted on a mountaintop it grew reard its unrivalld head on high and stretchd a thousand branches oer the sky drinking with all its leaves celestial dew lo where from thence as from a living well a thousand torrents flow for still in one perpetual shower like diamond drops etherial waters fell from every leaf of all its ample bower rolling adown the steep from that aerial height through the deep shade of aromatic trees halfseen the cataracts shoot their gleams of light and pour upon the breeze their thousand voices far away the roar in modulations of delightful sound halfheard and ever varying floats around below an ample lake expanded lies blue as the oerarching skies forth issuing from that lovely lake a thousand rivers water paradise full to the brink yet never overflowing they cool the amorous gales which ever blowing oer their melodious surface love to stray then winging back their way their vapours to the parent tree repay and ending thus where they began and feeding thus the source from whence they came the eternal rivers of the swerga ran for ever renovate yet still the same on that etherial lake whose waters lie blue and transpicuous like another sky the elements had reard their kings abode a strong controuling power their strife suspended and there their hostile essences they blended to form a palace worthy of the god built on the lake the waters were its floor and here its walls were water archd with fire and here were fire with water vaulted oer and spires and pinnacles of fire round watery cupolas aspire and domes of rainbow rest on fiery towers and roofs of flame are turreted around with cloud and shafts of cloud with flame are bound here too the elements for ever veer ranging around with endless interchanging pursued in love and so in love pursuing in endless revolutions here they roll for ever their mysterious work renewing the parts all shifting still unchanged the whole even we on earth at intervals descry gleams of the glory streaks of flowing light openings of heaven and streams that flash at night in fitful splendour through the northern sky impatient of delay ereenia caught the maid aloft and spread his wings abroad and bore her to the presence of the god there indra sate upon his throne reclind where devetas adore him the lute of nared warbling on the wind all tones of magic harmony combind to sooth his troubled mind while the darkeyed apsaras danced before him in vain the godmusician played in vain the darkeyed nymphs of heaven essayd to charm him with their beauties in the dance and when he saw the mortal maid appear led by the heroic glendoveer a deeper trouble filld his countenance what hast thou done ereenia said the god bringing a mortal here and while he spake his eye was on the maid the look he gave was solemn not severe no hope to kailyal it conveyd and yet it struck no fear there was a sad displeasure in his air but pity too was there ereenia hear me o indra on the lower earth i found this child of man by what mishap i know not lying in the lap of death aloft i bore her to our fathers grove not having other thought than when the gales of bliss had heald her upon earth again to leave its lovely daughter other thoughts arose when casyapa declard her fate for she is one who groans beneath the power of the dread rajah terrible alike to men and gods his son dead arvalan armd with a portion indra of thy power already wrested from thee persecutes the maid the helpless one the innocent what then behovd me but to waft her here to my own bower of bliss what other choice the spirit of foul arvalan not yet hath power to enter here here thou art yet supreme and yet the swerga is thine own indra no child of man ereenia in the bowers of bliss may sojourn till he hath put off his mortal part for on mortality time and infirmity and death attend close followers they and in their mournful train sorrow and pain and mutability did they find entrance here we should behold our joys like earthly summers pass away those joys perchance may pass a stronger hand may wrest my sceptre and unparadise the swerga but ereenia if we fall let it be fates own arm that casts us down we will not rashly hasten and provoke the blow nor bring ourselves the ruin on ereenia fear courts the blow fear brings the ruin on needs must the chariotwheels of destiny crush him who throws himself before their track patient and prostrate indra all may yet be well who knows but veeshnoo will descend and save once more incarnate ereenia look not there for help nor build on unsubstantial hope thy trust our father casyapa hath said he turns his doubtful eyes to seeva even as thou dost look to him for aid but thine own strength should for thine own salvation be put forth then might the higher powers approving see and bless the brave resolve oh that my arm could wield yon lightnings which play idly there in inoffensive radiance round thy head the swerga should not need a champion now nor earth implore deliverance still in vain indra thinkest thou i want the will rash son of heaven what if my arm be feeble as thine own against the dread kehama he went on conquering in irresistible career till his triumphant car had measurd oer the insufficient earth and all the kings of men received his yoke then had he won his will to ride upon their necks elate and crown his conquests with the sacrifice that should to men and gods proclaim him lord and sovereign master of the vassal world sole rajah the omnipotent below the steam of that portentous sacrifice arose to heaven then was the hour to strike then in the consummation of his pride his height of glory then the thunderbolt should have gone forth and hurld him from his throne down to the fiery floor of padalon to everlasting burnings agony eternal and remorse which knows no end that hour went by grown impious in success by prayer and penances he wrested now such power from fate that soon if seeva turn not his eyes on earth and no avatar save soon will he seize the swerga for his own roll on through padalon his chariot wheels tear up the adamantine bolts which lock the accurst asuras to its burning floor and force the drink of immortality from yamens charge vain were it now to strive my thunder can not pierce the sphere of power wherewith as with a girdle he is bound kailyal take me to earth o gentle deveta take me again to earth this is no place of hope for me my father still must bear his curse he shall not bear it all alone take me to earth that i may follow him i do not fear the almighty man the gods are feeble here but there are higher powers who will not turn their eyes from wrongs like ours take me to earth o gentle deveta saying thus she knelt and to his knees she clung and bowd her head in tears and silence praying rising anon around his neck she flung her arms and there with folded hands she hung and fixing on the guardian glendoveer her eyes more eloquent than angels tongue again she cried there is no comfort here i must be with my father in his pain take me to earth o deveta again indra with admiration heard the maid o child of earth he cried already in thy spirit thus divine whatever weal or woe betide be that high sense of duty still thy guide and all good powers will aid a soul like thine then turning to ereenia thus he said take her where ganges hath its second birth below our sphere and yet above the earth there may ladurlad rest beyond the power of the dread rajah till the fated hour viii the sacrifice dost thou tremble o indra o god of the sky why slumber those thunders of thine dost thou tremble on high wilt thou tamely the swerga resign art thou smitten o indra with dread or seest thou not seest thou not monarch divine how many a day to seevas shrine kehama his victim hath led nine and ninety days are fled nine and ninety steeds have bled one more the rite will be complete one victim more and this the dreadful day then will the impious rajah seize thy seat and wrest the thundersceptre from thy sway along the mead the hallowed steed yet bends at liberty his way at noon his consummating blood will flow o day of woe above below that blood confirms the almighty tyrants reign thou tremblest o indra o god of the sky thy thunder is vain thou tremblest on high for thy power but where is veeshnoo at this hour but where is seevas eye is the destroyer blind is the preserver careless for mankind along the mead the hallowed steed still wanders wheresoever he will oer hill or dale or plain no human hand hath trickd that mane from which he shakes the morning dew his mouth has never felt the rein his lips have never frothd the chain for pure of blemish and of stain his neck unbroke to mortal yoke like nature free the steed must be fit offering for the immortals he a year and day the steed must stray wherever chance may guide his way before he fall at seevas shrine the year and day have past away nor touch of man hath marrd the rite divine and now at noon the steed must bleed the perfect rite today must force the meed which fate reluctant shudders to bestow then must the swergagod yield to the tyrant of the world below then must the devetas obey the rajahs rod and groan beneath his hateful sway the sun rides high the hour is nigh the multitude who long lest aught should mar the rite in circle wide on every side have kept the steed in sight contract their circle now and drive him on drawn in long files before the templecourt the rajahs archers flank an ample space here moving onward still they drive him near then opening give him way to enter here behold him how he starts and flings his head on either side in glittering order spread the archers ranged in narrowing lines appear the multitude behind close up the rear with moonlike bend and silently await the awful end the rite that shall from indra wrest his power in front with farstretchd walls and many a tower turret and dome and pinnacle elate the huge pagoda seems to load the land and there before the gate the bramin band expectant stand the axe is ready for kehamas hand hark at the golden palaces the bramin strikes the time one two three four a thricetold chime and then again one two the bowl that in its vessel floats anew must fill and sink again then will the final stroke be due the sun rides high the noon is nigh and silently as if spellbound the multitude expect the sound lo how the steed with sudden start turns his quick head to every part long files of men on every side appear the sight might well his heart affright and yet the silence that is here inspires a stranger fear for not a murmur not a sound of breath or motion rises round no stir is heard in all that mighty crowd he neighs and from the templewall the voice reechoes loud loud and distinct as from a hill across a lonely vale when all is still within the temple on his golden throne reclind kehama lies watching with steady eyes the perfumd light that burning bright metes out the passing hours on either hand his eunuchs stand freshening with fans of peacockplumes the air which redolent of all rich gums and flowers seems overcharged with sweets to stagnate there lo the timetapers flame ascending slow creeps up its coil toward the fated line kehama rises and goes forth and from the altar ready where it lies he takes the axe of sacrifice that instant from the crowd with sudden shout a man sprang out to lay upon the steed his hand profane a thousand archers with unerring eye at once let fly and with their hurtling arrows fill the sky in vain they fall upon him fast as rain he bears a charmed life which may defy all weapons and the darts that whizz around as from an adamantine panoply repelld fall idly to the ground kehama claspd his hands in agony and saw him grasp the hallowed coursers mane spring up with sudden bound and with a frantic cry and madmans gesture gallop round and round they seize they drag him to the rajahs feet what doom will now be his what vengeance meet will he who knows no mercy now require the obsequious guards around with bloodhound eye look for the word in slowconsuming fire by piecemeal death to make the wretch expire or hoist his living carcase hookd on high to feed the fowls and insects of the sky or if aught worse inventive cruelty to that remorseless heart of royalty might prompt accursed instruments they stand to work the wicked will with wicked hand far other thoughts were in the multitude pity and human feelings held them still and stifled sighs and groans supprest were there and many a secret curse and inward prayer calld on the insulted gods to save mankind expecting some new crime in fear they stood some horror which would make the natural blood start with cold shudderings thrill the sinking heart whiten the lip and make the abhorrent eye roll back and close prest in for agony how then fared he for whom the mighty crowd suffered in spirit thus how then fared he a ghastly smile was on his lip his eye glared with a ghastly hope as he drew nigh and cried aloud yes rajah it is i and wilt thou kill me now the countenance of the almighty man fell when he knew ladurlad and his brow was clouded with despite as one ashamed that wretch again indignant he exclaimd and smote his forehead and stood silently awhile in wrath then with ferocious smile and eyes which seemd to darken his dark cheek let him go free he cried he hath his curse and vengeance upon him can wreak no worse but ye who did not seize him tremble ye he bade the archers pile their weapons there no manly courage filld the slavish band no sweetening vengeance rousd a brave despair he calld his horsemen then and gave command to hem the offenders in and hew them down ten thousand scymitars at once upreard flash up like waters sparkling to the sun a second time the fatal brands appeard lifted aloft they glitterd then no more their light was gone their splendour quenched in gore at noon the massacre begun and night closd in before the work of death was done ix the homescene the steam of slaughter from that place of blood spread oer the tainted sky vultures for whom the rajahs tyranny so oft had furnishd food from far and nigh sped to the lure aloft with joyful cry wheeling around they hoverd over head or on the temple perchd with greedy eye impatient watchd the dead far off the tygers in the inmost wood heard the deathshriek and snuffd the scent of blood they rose and through the covert went their way couchd at the forest edge and waited for their prey he who had sought for death went wandering on the hope which had inspird his heart was gone yet a wild joyance still inflamd his face a smile of vengeance a triumphant glow where goes he whither should ladurlad go unwittingly the wretchs footsteps trace their wonted path toward his dwellingplace and wandering on unknowing where he starts at finding he is there behold his lowly home by yonder broadboughd plane oershaded there marriatalys image stands and there the garland twind by kailyals hands around its brow hath faded the peacocks at their masters sight quick from the leafy thatch alight and hurry round and search the ground and veer their glancing necks from side to side expecting from his hand their daily dole which erst the maid supplied now all too long denied but as he gazd around how strange did all accustomd sights appear how differently did each familiar sound assail his altered ear here stood the marriage bower reard in that happy hour when he with festal joy and youthful pride had brought yedillian home his beauteous bride leaves not its own and many a borrowed flower had then bedeckd it withering ere the night but he who lookd from that auspicious day for years of long delight and would not see the marriagebower decay there planted and nurst up with daily care the sweetest herbs that scent the ambient air and traind them round to live and flourish there nor when dread yamens will had calld yedillian from his arms away ceasd he to tend the marriagebower but still sorrowing had drest it like a pious rite due to the monument of past delight he took his wonted seat before the door even as of yore when he was wont to view with placid eyes his daughter at her evening sacrifice here were the flowers which she so carefully did love to rear for marriatalys brow neglected now their heavy heads were drooping overblown all else appeared the same as heretofore all save himself alone how happy then and now a wretch for evermore the marketflag which hoisted high from far and nigh above yon cocoa grove is seen hangs motionless amid the sultry sky loud sounds the villagedrum a happy crowd is there ladurlad hears their distant voices but with their joy no more his heart rejoices and how their old companion now may fare little they know and less they care the torment he is doomd to hear was but to them the wonder of a day a burthen of sad thoughts soon put away they knew not that the wretched man was near and yet it seemd to his distempered ear as if they wrongd him with their merriment resentfully he turnd away his eyes yet turnd them but to find sights that enraged his mind with envious grief more wild and overpowering the tank which fed his fields was there and there the largeleavd lotus on the waters flowering there from the intolerable heat the buffaloes retreat only their nostrils raisd to meet the air amid the sheltering element they rest impatient of the sight he closd his eyes and bowd his burning head and in despair calling on indra thundergod he said thou owest to me alone this day thy throne be grateful and in mercy strike me dead despair had rousd him to that hopeless prayer yet thinking on the heavenly powers his mind drew comfort and he rose and gatherd flowers and twind a crown for marriatalys brow and taking then her withered garland down replaced it with the blooming coronal not for myself the unhappy father cried not for myself o mighty one i pray accursed as i am beyond thy aid but oh be gracious still to that dear maid who crownd thee with these garlands day by day and danced before thee aye at eventide in beauty and in pride o marriataly wheresoeer she stray forlorn and wretched still be thou her guide a loud and fiendish laugh replied scoffing his prayer aloft as from the air the sound of insult came he lookd and there the visage of dead arvalan came forth only his face amid the clear blue sky with longdrawn lips of insolent mockery and eyes whose lurid glare was like a sulphur fire mingling with darkness ere its flames expire ladurlad knew him well enraged to see the cause of all his misery he stoopd and lifted from the ground a stake whose fatal point was black with blood the same wherewith his hand had dealt the wound when arvalan in hour with evil fraught for violation seizd the shrieking maid thus armd in act again to strike he stood and twice with inefficient wrath essayd to smite the impassive shade the lips of scorn their mockerylaugh renewd and arvalan put forth a hand and caught the sunbeam and condensing there its light upon ladurlad turnd the burning stream vain cruelty the stake fell in white ashes from his hold but he endurd no added pain his agony was full and at the height the burning stream of radiance nothing harmd him a fire was in his heart and brain and from all other flame kehamas curse had charmd him anon the spirit wavd a second hand down rushd the obedient whirlwind from the sky scoopd up the sand like smoke and from on high shed the hot shower upon ladurlads head whereer he turns the accursed hand is there east west and north and south on every side the hand accursed waves in air to guide the dizzying storm ears nostrils eyes and mouth it fills and choaks and clogging every pore taught him new torments might be yet in store where shall he turn to fly behold his house in flames uprooted lies the marriagebower the goddess buried by the sandy shower blindly with staggering step he reels about and still the accursed hand pursued and still the lips of scorn their mockery laugh renewd what arvalan hast thou so soon forgot the grasp of pollear wilt thou still defy the righteous powers of heaven or knowst thou not that there are yet superior powers on high son of the wicked lo in rapid flight ereenia hastens from the etherial height bright is the sword celestial in his hand like lightning in its path athwart the sky he comes and drives with angelarm the blow oft have the asuras in the wars of heaven felt that keen sword by arm angelic driven and fled before it from the fields of light thrice through the vulnerable shade the glendoveer impels the griding blade the wicked shade flies howling from his foe so let that spirit foul fly and for impotence of anger howl writhing with pain and oer his wounds deplore worse punishment hath arvalan deservd and righteous fate hath heavier doom in store not now the glendoveer pursued his flight he bade the ship of heaven alight and gently there he laid the astonished father by the happy maid the maid now shedding tears of deep delight beholding all things with incredulous eyes still dizzy with the sandstorm there he lay while sailing up the skies the living bark through air and sunshine held its heavenly way x mount meru swift through the sky the vessel of the suras sails up the fields of ether like an angel rich is the freight o vessel that thou bearest beauty and virtue fatherly cares and filial veneration hearts which are provd and strengthend by affliction manly resentment fortitude and action womanly goodness all with which nature halloweth her daughters tenderness truth and purity and meekness piety patience faith and resignation love and devotement ship of the gods how richly art thou laden proud of the charge thou voyagest rejoicing clouds float around to honour thee and evening lingers in heaven a stream descends on meru mountain none hath seen its secret fountain it had its birth so sages say upon the memorable day when parvati presumed to lay in wanton play her hands too venturous goddess in her mirth on seevas eyes the light and life of earth thereat the heart of the universe stood still the elements ceasd their influences the hours stopt on the eternal round motion and breath time change and life and death in sudden trance opprest forgot their powers a moment and the dread eclipse was ended but at the thought of nature thus suspended the sweat on seevas forehead stood and ganges thence upon the world descended the holy river the redeeming flood none hath seen its secret fountain but on the top of meru mountain which rises oer the hills of earth in light and clouds it hath its mortal birth earth seems that pinnacle to rear sublime above this worldly sphere its cradle and its altar and its throne and there the newborn river lies outspread beneath its native skies as if it there would love to dwell alone and unapproachable soon flowing forward and resignd to the will of the creating mind it springs at once with sudden leap down from the immeasurable steep from rock to rock with shivering force rebounding the mighty cataract rushes heaven around likethunder with the incessant roar resounding and merus summit shaking with the sound wide spreads the snowy foam the sparkling spray dances aloft and ever there at morning the earliest sunbeams haste to wing their way with rainbow wreaths the holy flood adorning and duly the adoring moon at night sheds her white glory there and in the watery air suspends her halocrowns of silver light a mountainvalley in its blessed breast receives the stream which there delights to lie untroubled and at rest beneath the untainted sky there in a lovely lake it seems to sleep and thence through many a channel dark and deep their secret way the holy waters wind till rising underneath the root of the tree of life on himakoot majestic forth they flow to purify mankind toward this lake above the nether sphere the living bark with angel eye directs its course along the obedient sky kehama hath not yet dominion here and till the dreaded hour when indra by the rajah shall be driven dethrond from heaven here may ladurlad rest beyond his power the living bark alights the glendoveer then lays ladurlad by the blessed lake o happy sire and yet more happy daughter the etherial gales his agony aslake his daughters tears are on his cheek his hand is in the water the innocent man the man opprest oh joy hath found a place of rest beyond kehamas sway his curse extends not here his pains have past away o happy sire and happy daughter ye on the banks of that celestial water your resting place and sanctuary have found what hath not then their mortal taint defild the sacred solitary ground vain thought the holy valley smild receiving such a sire and child ganges who seemd asleep to lie beheld them with benignant eye and ripped round melodiously and rolld her little waves to meet and welcome their beloved feet the gales of swerga thither fled and heavenly odours there were shed about below and overhead and earth rejoicing in their tread hath built them up a blooming bower where every amaranthine flower its deathless blossom interweaves with bright and undecaying leaves three happy beings are there here the sire the maid the glendoveer a fourth approaches who is this that enters in the bower of bliss no form so fair might painter find among the daughters of mankind for death her beauties hath refind and unto her a form hath given framd of the elements of heaven pure dwellingplace for perfect mind she stood and gazd on sire and child her tongue not yet had power to speak the tears were streaming down her cheek and when those tears her sight beguild and still her faultering accents faild the spirit mute and motionless spread out her arms for the caress made still and silent with excess of love and painful happiness the maid that lovely form surveyd wistful she gazd and knew her not but nature to her heart conveyd a sudden thrill a startling thought a feeling many a year forgot now like a dream anew recurring as if again in every vein her mothers milk was stirring with straining neck and earnest eye she stretchd her hands imploringly as if she fain would have her nigh yet feard to meet the wishd embrace at once with love and awe opprest not so ladurlad he could trace though brightend with angelic grace his own yedillians earthly face he ran and held her to his breast oh joy above all joys of heaven by death alone to others given this moment hath to him restord the earlylost the longdeplord they sin who tell us love can die with life all other passions fly all others are but vanity in heaven ambition can not dwell nor avarice in the vaults of hell earthly these passions of the earth they perish where they have their birth but love is indestructible its holy flame for ever burneth from heaven it came to heaven returneth too oft on earth a troubled guest at times deceivd

you the undaunted cheerfulness that appeared in her countenance the resolution with which she marched washed herself spoke to the people the confidence with which she looked upon us viewed her little cabin made up of very dry milletstraw and small wood went into this cabin and sat down upon the pile and took her husbands head into her lap and a torch into her own hand and kindled the cabin whilst i know not how many brahmans were busy in kindling the fire round about to represent to you i say all this as it ought is not possible for me i can at present scarce believe it myself though it be but a few days since i saw it they strip her ornaments awayi p she went out again to the river and taking up some water in her hands muttered some prayers and offered it to the sun all her ornaments were then taken from her and her armlets were broken and chaplets of white flowers were put upon her neck and hands her hair was tucked up with five combs and her forehead was marked with clay in the same manner as that of her husbandstavorinus around her neck they leave the marriageknot alonei p when the time for consummating the marriage is come they light the fire homam with the wood of ravasiton the bramin blesses the former which being done the bridegroom takes three handfuls of rice and throws it on the brides head who does the same to him afterwards the brides father clothes her in a dress according to his condition and washes the bridegrooms feet the brides mother observing to pour out the water this being done the father puts his daughters hand in his own puts water into it some pieces of money and giving it to the bridegroom says at the same time i have no longer any thing to do with you and i give you up to the power of another the tali which is a ribbon with a golden head hanging at it is held ready and being shewn to the company some prayers and blessings are pronounced after which the bridegroom takes it and hangs it about the brides neck this knot is what particularly secures his possession of her for before he had had the tali on all the rest of the ceremonies might have been made to no purpose for it has sometimes happened that when the bridegroom was going to fix it on the brides father has discovered his not being satisfied with the bridegrooms gift when another offering more has carried off the bride with her fathers consent but when once the tali is put on the marriage is indissoluble and whenever the husband dies the tali is burnt along with him to shew that the marriage bands are broke besides these particular ceremonies the people have notice of the wedding by a pandal which is raised before the brides door some days before the whole concludes with an entertainment which the brides father gives to the common friends and during this festivity which continues five days alms are given to the poor and the fire homam is kept in the seventh day the newmarried couple set out for the bridegrooms house whither they frequently go by torchlight the bride and bridegroom are carried in a sedan pass through the chief streets of the city and are accompanied by their friends who are either on horseback or mounted on elephantsa roger they force her on they bind her to the deadi p tis true says bernier that i have seen some of them which at the sight of the pile and the fire appeared to have some apprehension and that perhaps would have gone back those demons the bramins that are there with their great sticks astonish them and hearten them up or even thrust them in as i have seen it done to a young woman that retreated five or six paces from the pile and to another that was much disturbed when she saw the fire take hold of her clothes these executioners thrusting her in with their long poles at lahor i saw a very handsome and a very young woman burnt i believe she was not above twelve years of age this poor unhappy creature appeased rather dead than alive when she came near the pile she shook and wept bitterly meanwhile three or four of these executioners the bramins together with an old hag that held her under the arm thrust her on and made her sit down upon the wood and lest she should run away they tied her legs and hands and so they burnt her alive i had enough to do to contain myself for indignationbernier pietro della valle conversed with a widow who was about to burn herself by her own choice she told him that generally speaking women were not forced to burn themselves but sometimes among people of rank when a young woman who was handsome was left a widow and in danger of marrying again which is never practised among them because of the confusion and disgrace which are inseparable from such a thing or of falling into other irregularities then indeed the relations of the husband if they are at all tenacious of the honour of the family compel her to burn herself whether she likes it or no merely to prevent the inconveniences which might take place dellon also whom i consider as one of the best travellers in the east expressly asserts that widows are burnt there de gré ou de force lon nen voit que trop qui aprés avoir desiré et demandé la mort avec un courage intrepide et aprés avoir obtenu et acheté la permission de se brûler ont tremblé à là veuë du bucher se sont repenties mais trop tard de leur imprudence et ont fait dinutiles efforts pour se retracter mais lorsque cela arrive bien loin que les bramenes soient touchés daucune pieté ils lient cruellement ces malheureuses et les brûlent par force sans avoir aucun egard à leurs plaintes ni à leurs cristom i p it would be easy to multiply authorities upon this point let it suffice to mention one important historical fact when the great alboquerque had established himself it goa he forbade these accursed sacrifices the women extolled him for it as their benefactor and deliverer commentarios de alb ii and no european in india was ever so popular or so revered by the natives yet if we are to believe the antimissionares none but fools fanatics and pretenders to humanity would wish to deprive the hindoo women of the right of burning themselves it may be useful says colonel mark wilks to examine the reasonableness of interfering with the most exceptionable of all their institutions it has been thought an abomination not to be tolerated that a widow should immolate herself on the funeral pile of her deceased husband but what judgement should we form of the hindoo who if any of our institutions admitted the parallel should forcibly pretend to stand between a christian and the hope of eternal salvation and shall we not hold him to be a driveller in politics and morals a fanatic in religion and a pretender in humanity who would forcibly wrest this hope from the hindoo widowhistorical sketches of the south of india vol i p such opinions and such language may safely be left to the indignation and pity which they can not fail to excite i shall only express my astonishment that any thing so monstrous and so miserably futile should have proceeded from a man of learning great good sense and general good feelings as colonel wilks evidently appears to be one drops another plunges ini p when bernier was passing from amadavad to agra there came news to him in a borough where the caravan rested under the shade staying for the cool of the evening to march on their journey that a woman was then upon the point of burning herself with the body of her husband i presently rose says he and ran to the place where it was to be done which was a great pit with a pile of wood raised in it whereon i saw laid a dead corpse and a woman which at a distance seemed to me pretty fair sitting near it on the same pile besides four or five bramins putting the fire to it from all sides five women of a middle age and well enough dressed holding one another by the hand and dancing about the pit and a great crowd of people men and women looking on the pile of wood was presently all on fire because store of oil and butter had been thrown upon it and i saw at the same time through the flames that the fire took hold of the clothes of the woman that were imbued with wellscented oils mingled with powder of sandal and saffron all this i saw but observed not that the woman was at all disturbed yea it was said that she had been heard to pronounce with great force these two words five two to signify according to the opinion of those that hold the souls transmigration that this was the fifth time she had burnt herself with the same husband and that there remained but two more for perfection as if she had at that time this remembrance or some prophetical spirit but here ended not this infernal tragedy i thought it was only by way of ceremony that these five women sung and danced about the pit but i was altogether surprised when i saw that the flame having taken hold of the clothes of one of them she cast herself with her head foremost into the pit and that after her another being overcome by the flame and the smoke did the like and my astonishment redoubled afterwards when i saw that the remaining three took one another again by the hand continued their dance without any apparent fear and that at length they precipitated themselves one after another into the fire as their companions had done i learnt that these had been five slaves who having seen their mistress extremely afflicted at the sickness of her husband and heard her promise him that she would not survive him but burn herself with him were so touched with compassion and tenderness towards this their mistress that they engaged themselves in a promise to follow her in her resolution and to burn themselves with herbernier this excellent traveller relates an extraordinary circumstance which occurred at one of these sacrifices a woman was engaged in some loveintrigues with a young mahommedan her neighbour who was a tailor and could play finely upon the tabor this woman in the hopes she had of marrying this young man poisoned her husband and presently came away to tell the tailor that it was time to be gone together as they had projected or else she should be obliged to burn herself the young man fearing lest he might be entangled in a mischievous business flatly refused her the woman not at all surprised at it went to her relations and advertised them of the sudden death of her husband and openly protested that she would not survive him but burn herself with him her kindred well satisfied with so generous a resolution and the great honour she did to the whole family presently had a pit made and filled with wood exposing the corpse upon it and kindling the fire all being prepared the woman goes to embrace and bid farewell to all her kindred that were there about the pit among whom was also the tailor who had been invited to play upon the tabor that day with many others of that sort of men according to the custom of the country this fury of a woman being also come to this young man made sign as if she would bid him farewell with the rest but instead of gently embracing him she taketh him with all her force about his collar pulls him to the pit and tumbleth him together with herself into the ditch where they both were soon dispatchedbernier the hindoos sometimes erect a chapel on the spot where one of these sacrifices has been performed both on account of the soul of the deceased and as a trophy of her virtue i remember to have seen one of these places where the spot on which the funeral pile had been erected was inclosed and covered with bamboos formed into a kind of bower planted with flowering creepers the inside was set round with flowers and at one end there was an imagecrawfurd some of the yogees who smear themselves with ashes use none but what they collect from funeral pileshuman ashes pietro della valle from a late investigation it appears that the number of women who sacrifice themselves within thirty miles round calcutta every year is on an average upwards of two hundred the pundits have already been called on to produce the sanction of their shasters for this custom the passages exhibited are vague and general in their meaning and differently interpreted by the same casts some sacred verses commend the practice but none command it and the pundits refer once more to custom they have however intimated that if government will pass a regulation amercing by fine every brahmin who attends a burning or every zemindar who permits him to attend it the practice can not possibly long continue for that the ceremony unsanctified by the presence of the priests will lose its dignity and consequence in the eyes of the people the civilized world may expect soon to hear of the abolition of this opprobrium of a christian administration

two applicable stanzas in his song of the soul like to a light fast lockd in lanthorn dark whereby by night our wary steps we guide in slabby streets and dirty channels mark some weaker rays through the black top do glide and flusher streams perhaps from horny side but when weve past the peril of the way arrived at home and laid that case aside the naked light how clearly doth it ray and spread

incarnation of veeshno this goddess says sonnerat commanded the elements but could not preserve that empire longer than her heart was pure one day while she was collecting water out of a tank and according to her custom was making a bowl of earth to carry it to the house she saw on the surface of the water some figures of grindovers glendoveers which were flying over her head struck with their beauty her heart admitted an impure thought and the earth of the bowl dissolved from that time she was obliged to make use of an ordinary vessel this discovered to chamadaguini that his wife had deviated from purity and in the excess of his rage he ordered his son to drag her to the place where criminals were executed and to behead her the order was executed but parassourama was so much afflicted for the loss of his mother that chamadaguini told him to take up the body and fasten the head upon it and repeat a prayer which he taught him for that purpose in her ear and then his mother would come to life again the son ran eagerly to perform what he was ordered but by a very singular blunder he joined the head of his mother to the body of a parichi who had been executed for her crimes a monstrous union which gave to this woman the virtues of a goddess and the vices of a criminal the goddess becoming impure by such a mixture was driven from her house and committed all kinds of cruelties the deverkels perceiving the destruction she made appeased her by giving her power to cure the smallpox and promising that she should be implored for that disorder mariatale is the great goddess of the pariasto honour her they have a custom of dancing with several pots of water on their heads placed one above the other these pots are adorned with the leaves of the margosies a tree consecrated to her it was my hour of follyii p among the qualities required for the proper execution of public business mention is made that a man must be able to keep in subjection his lust his anger his avarice his folly and his pride the folly there specified is not to be understood in the usual sense of the word in an european idiom as a negative quality or the mere want of sense but as a kind of obstinately stupid lethargy or perverse absence of mind in which the will is not altogether passive it seems to be a weakness peculiar to asia for we can not find a term by which to express the precise idea in the european languages it operates somewhat like the violent impulse of fear under which men will utter falsehoods totally incompatible with each other and utterly contrary to their own opinion knowledge and conviction and it may be added also their inclination and intention a very remarkable instance of this temporary frenzy happened lately in the supreme court of judicature at calcutta where a man not an idiot swore upon a trial that he was no kind of relation to his brother who was then in court and who had constantly supported him from his infancy and that he lived in a house by himself for which he paid the rent from his own pocket when it was proved that he was not worth a rupee and when the person in whose house he had always resided stood at the bar close to him another conjecture and that exceedingly acute and ingenious has been started upon this folly that it may mean the deception which a man permits to be imposed on his judgment by his passions as acts of rapacity and avarice are often committed by men who ascribe them to prudence and a just assertion of their own right malice and rancour pass for justice and brutality for spirit this opinion when thoroughly examined will very nearly tally with the former for all the passions as well as fear have an equal efficacy to disturb and distort the mind but to account for the folly here spoken of as being the offspring of the passions instead of drawing a parallel between it and the impulses of those passions we must suppose the impulses to act with infinitely more violence upon an asiatic mind than we can ever have seen exemplified in europe it is however something like the madness so inimitably delineated in the hero of cervantes sensible enough upon some occasions and at the same time completely wild and unconscious of itself upon others and that too originally produced by an effort of the will though in the end overpowering and superseding its functionshalhed the little songsters

pollearv p the first and greatest of the sons of sevee is pollear he presides over marriages the indians build no house without having first carried a pollear on the ground which they sprinkle with oil and throw flowers on it every day if they do not invoke it before they undertake any enterprise they believe that god will make them forget what they wanted to undertake and that their labour will be in vain he is represented with an elephants head and mounted on a rat but in the pagodas they place him on a pedestal with his legs almost crossed a rat is always put before the door of his chapel this rat was a giant called gudjamougachourin on whom the gods had bestowed immortality as well as great powers which he abused and did much harm to mankind pollear entreated by the sages and penitents to deliver them pulled out one of his tusks and threw it against gudjamougachourin the tooth entered the giants stomach and overthrew him who immediately changed himself into a rat as large as a mountain and came to attack pollear who sprung on his back telling him that hereafter he should ever be his carrier the indians in their adoration of this god cross their arms shut the fist and in this manner give themselves several blows on the temples then but always with the arms crossed they take hold of their ears and make three inclinations bending the knee after which with their hands joined they address their prayers to him and strike their forehead they have a great veneration for this deity whose image they place in all temples streets highways and in the country at the foot of some tree that all the world may have an opportunity of invoking him before they undertake any concern and that travellers may make their adorations and offerings to him before they pursue their journeysonnerat the glendoveersvi p this word is altered from the grindouvers of sonnerat who describes these celestial children of casyapa as famous for their beauty they have wings he adds and fly in the air with their wives i do not know whether they are the gandharvas of the english orientalists the wings with which they are attired in the poem are borrowed from the neglected story of peter wilkins a work of great genius whoever the author was his winged people are the most beautiful creatures of imagination that ever were devised i copy his minute description of the graundee as he calls itstothard has made some delightful drawings of it in the novelists magazine she first threw up two long branches or ribs of the whalebone as i called it before and indeed for several of its properties as toughness elasticity and pliableness nothing i have ever seen can so justly be compared to it which were jointed behind to the upperbone of the spine and which when not extended lie bent over the shoulders on each side of the neck forwards from whence by nearer and nearer approaches they just meet at the lower rim of the belly in a sort of point but when extended they stand their whole length above the shoulders not perpendicularly but spreading outwards with a web of the softest and most pliable and spungy membrane that can be imagined in the interstices between them reaching from their root or joint on the back up above the hinder part of the head and near half way their own length but when closed the membrane falls down in the middle upon the neck like an handkerchief there are also two other ribs rising as it were from the same root which when open run horizontally but not so long as the others these are filled up in the interstice between them and the upper ones with the same membrane and on the lower side of this is also a deep flap of the membrane so that the arms can be either above or below it in flight and are always above it when closed this last rib when shut flaps under the upper one and also falls down with it before to the waist but it is not joined to the ribs below along the whole spinebone runs a strong flat broad grisly cartilage to which are joined several other of these ribs all which open horizontally and are filled in the interstices with the above membrane and are jointed to the ribs of the person just where the plane of the back begins to turn towards the breast and belly and when shut wrap the body round to the joints on the contrary side folding neatly one side over the other at the lower spine are two more ribs extended horizontally when open jointed again to the hips and long enough to meet the joint on the contrary side cross the belly and from the hipjoint which is on the outermost edge of the hipbone runs a pliable cartilage quite down the outside of the thigh and leg to the ancle from which there branch out divers other ribs horizontally also when open but when closed they encompass the whole thigh and leg rolling inwards cross the back of the leg and thigh till they reach and just cover the cartilage the interstices of these are filled up with the same membrane from the two ribs which join to the lower spinebone there hangs down a sort of short apron very full of plaits from hipjoint to hipjoint and reaches below the buttocks half way or more to the hams this has also several small limber ribs in it just upon the lower spinejoint and above the apron as i call it there are two other long branches which when close extend upon the back from the point they join at below to the shoulders where each rib has a clasper which reaching over the shoulders just under the fold of the uppermost branch or ribs hold up the two ribs flat to the back like a v the interstices of which are filled up with the aforesaid membrane this last piece in flight falls down almost to the ancles where the two claspers lapping under each leg withinside hold it very fast and then also the short apron is drawn up by the strength of the ribs in it between the thighs forward and covers as far as the rim of the belly the whole arms are covered also from the shoulders to the wrist with the same delicate membrane fastened to ribs of proportionable dimensions and jointed to a cartilage on the outside in the same manner as on the legs it is very surprising to feel the difference of these ribs when open and when closed for closed they are as pliable as the finest whalebone or more so but when extended are as strong and stiff as a bone they are tapering from the roots and are broader or narrower as best suits the places they occupy and the stress they are put to up to their points which are almost as small as a hair the membrane between them is the most elastic thing i ever met with occupying no more space when the ribs are closed than just from rib to rib as flat and smooth as possible but when extended in some postures will dilate itself surprisingly it is the most amazing thing in the world to observe the large expansion of this graundee when open and when closed as it all is in a moment upon the partys descent to see it fit so close and compact to the body as no tailor can come up to it and then the several ribs lie so justly disposed in the several parts that instead of being as one would imagine a disadvantage to the shape they make the body and limbs look extremely elegant and by the different adjustment of their lines on the body and limbs the whole to my fancy somewhat resembles the dress of the old roman warriors in their buskins and to appearance seems much more noble than any fictitious garb i ever saw or can frame a notion of to myself mount himakootvi p dushmanta say matali what mountain is that which like an evening cloud pours exhilarating streams and forms a

once in danger even of annihilation in passing from the town of silgut to deonhully says colonel wilks i became accidentally informed of a sect peculiar as i since understand to the northeastern parts of mysoor the women of which universally undergo the amputation of the first joints of the third and fourth fingers of their right hands on my arrival at deonhully after ascertaining that the request would not give offence i desired to see some of these women and the same afternoon seven of them attended at my tent the sect is a subdivision of the murresoo wokul and belongs to the fourth great class of the hindoos viz the souder every woman of the sect previously to piercing the ears of her eldest daughter preparatory to her being betrothed in marriage must necessarily undergo this mutilation which is performed by the blacksmith of the village for a regulated fee by a surgical process sufficiently rude the finger to be amputated is placed on a block the blacksmith places a chisel over the articulation of the joint and chops it off at a single blow if the girl to be betrothed is motherless and the mother of the boy have not before been subject to the operation it is incumbent on her to perform the sacrifice after satisfying myself with regard to the facts of the case i enquired into the origin of so strange a practice and one of the women related with great fluency the following traditionary tale which has since been repeated to me with no material deviation by several others of the sect a rachas or giant named vrica and in after times busmaasoor or the giant of the ashes had by a course of austere devotion to mahadeo seeva obtained from him the promise of whatever boon he should ask the rachas accordingly demanded that every person on whose head he should place his right hand might instantly be reduced to ashes and mahadeo conferred the boon without suspicion of the purpose for which it was designed the rachas no sooner found himself possessed of this formidable power than he attempted to use it for the destruction of his benefactor mahadeo fled the rachas pursued and followed the fugitive so closely as to chace him into a duck grove where mahadeo changing his form and bulk concealed himself in the centre of a fruit then called tunda pundoo but since named linga tunda from the resemblance which its kernel thenceforward assumed to the ling the appropriate emblem of mahadeo the rachas having lost sight of mahadeo enquired of a husbandman who was working in the adjoining field whether he had seen the fugitive and what direction he had taken the husbandman who had attentively observed the whole transaction fearful of the future resentment of mahadeo and equally alarmed for the present vengeance of the giant answered aloud that he had seen no fugitive but pointed at the same time with the little finger of his right hand to the place of mahadeos concealment in this extremity vishnou descended in the form of a beautiful damsel to the rescue of mahadeo the rachas became instantly enamouredthe damsel was a pure brahmin and might not be approached by the unclean rachas by degrees she appeared to relent and as a previous condition to farther advances enjoined the performance of his ablutions in a neighbouring pool after these were finished she prescribed as a farther purification the performance of the sundiaa ceremony in which the right hand is successively applied to the breast to the crown of the head and to other parts of the body the rachas thinking only of love and forgetful of the powers of his right hand performed the sundia and was himself reduced to ashes mahadeo now issued from the linga tunda and after the proper acknowledgments for his deliverance proceeded to discuss the guilt of the treacherous husbandman and determined on the loss of the finger with which he had offended as the proper punishment of his crime the wife of the husbandman who had just arrived at the field with food for her husband hearing this dreadful sentence threw herself at the feet of mahadeo she represented the certain ruin of her family if her husband should be disabled for some months from performing the labours of the farm and besought the deity to accept two of her fingers instead of one from her husband mahadeo pleased with so sincere a proof of conjugal affection accepted the exchange and ordained that her female posterity in all future generations should sacrifice two fingers at his temple as a memorial of the transaction and of their exclusive devotion to the god of the ling the practice is accordingly confined to the supposed posterity of this single woman and is not common to the whole sect of murresoowokul i ascertained the actual number of families who observed this practice in three successive districts through which i afterwards passed and i conjecture that within the limits of misoor they may amount to about two thousand houses the hill of sectee in the talook of colar where the giant was destroyed is according to this tradition formed of the ashes of busmaasoor it is held in particular veneration by this sect as the chief seat of their appropriate sacrifice and the fact of its containing little or no moisture is held to be a miraculous proof that the ashes of the giant continue to absorb the most violent and continued rain this is a remarkable example of easy

selfmoving car of the gods into a ship capt wilford has given the history of its inventionand what is more curious has attempted to settle the geography of the story a most pious and venerable sage named rishicesa being very far advanced in years had resolved to visit before he died all the famed places of pilgrimage and having performed his resolution he bathed at last in the sacred water of the cali where he observed some fishes engaged in amorous play and restating on their numerous progeny which would sport like then in the stream he lamented the improbability of leaving any children but since he might possibly be a father even at his great age he went immediately to the king of that country hiranyaverna who had fifty daughters and demanded one of them in marriage so strange a demand gave the prince great uneasiness yet he was unwilling to incur the displeasure of a saint whose imprecations he dreaded he therefore invoked heri or vishnu to inspire him with a wise answer and told the hoar philosopher that he should marry any one of his daughters who of her own accord should fix on him as her bridegroom the sage rather disconcerted left the palace but calling to mind the two sons of aswini he hastened to their terrestrial abode and requested that they would bestow on him both youth and beauty they immediately conducted him to abhimatada which we suppose to be abydus in upper egypt and when he had bathed in the pool of rupayauvana he was restored to the flower of his age with the graces and charms of camadeva on his return to the palace he entered the secret apartments called antahpura where the fifty princesses were assembled and they were all so transported with the vision of more than human beauty that they fell into an ecstacy whence the place was afterwards named mohasthan or mohana and is possibly the same with mohannan they no sooner had recovered from their trance than each of them exclaimed that she would be his bride and their altercation having brought hiranyaverna into their apartment he terminated the contest by giving them all in marriage to rishicesa who became the father of a hundred sons and when he succeeded to the throne built the city of suchaverddhana framed vimânas or celestial selfmoving cars in which he visited the gods and made gardens abounding in delights which rivalled the bowers of indra but having granted the desire which he formed at matoyasangama or the place where the fish were assembled he resigned the kingdom to his eldest son hiranyavriddha and returned in his former shape to the banks of the cali

save that only towards the seaside there are some wells but they lie at such a distance from the city that the inhabitants can make no use thereof but the great preserver and sustainer of all remedies this inconvenience by a way so extraordinary that a man will be forced to sit down and acknowledge that he gives in this an undeniable demonstration of his goodness and infinite providence for in the midst of the island there is a tree which is the only one of its kind inasmuch as it hath no resemblance to those mentioned by us in this relation nor to any other known to us in europe the leaves of it are long and narrow and continue in a constant verdure winter and summer and its branches are covered with a cloud which is never dispelled but resolved into a moisture which causes to fall from

in the whole island one of them is called acof which in the language of the ancient inhabitants signifies river a name however which does not seem to have been given it on account of its yielding much water for in that respect it hardly deserves the same of a fountain more to the northward is another called hapio and in the middle of the island is a spring yielding a stream about the thickness of a mans finger this last was discovered in the year and is called the fountain of anton hernandez on account of the scarcity of water the sheep goats and swine here do not drink in the summer but are taught to dig up the roots of fern and chew them to quench their thirst the great cattle are watered at those fountains and at a place where water distils from the leaves of a tree many writers have made mention of this famous tree some in such a manner as to make it appear miraculous others again deny the existence of any such tree among whom is father feyjoo a modern spanish author in his theatro critico but he and those who agree with him in this matter are as much mistaken as they who would make it appear miraculous this is the only island of all the canaries which i have not been in but i have sailed with natives of hierro who when questioned about the existence of this tree answered in the affirmative the author of the history of the discovery and conquest has given us a particular account of it which i shall relate here at large the district in which this tree stands is called tigulahe near to which and in the cliff or steep rocky ascent that surrounds the whole island is a narrow gutter or gulley which commences at the sea and continues to the summit of the cliff where it joins or coincides with a valley which is terminated by the steep front of a rock on the top of this rock grows a tree called in the language of the ancient inhabitants garse ie sacred or holy tree which for many years has been preserved sound entire and fresh its leaves constantly distil such a quantity of water as is sufficient to furnish drink to every living creature in hierro nature having provided this remedy for the drought of the island it is situated about a league and a half from the sea nobody knows of what species it is only that it is called til it is distinct from other trees and stands by itself the circumference of the trunk is about twelve spans the diameter four and in height from the ground to the top of the highest branch forty spans the circumference of all the branches together is one hundred and twenty feet the branches are thick and extended the lowest commence about the height of an ell from the ground its fruit resembles the acorn and tastes something like the kernel of a pinenut but is softer and more aromatic the leaves of this tree resemble those of the laurel but are larger wider and more curved they come forth in a perpetual succession so that the tree always remains green near to it grows a thorn which fastens on many of its branches and interweaves with them and at a small distance from the garse are some beechtrees bresos and thorns on the north side of the trunk are two large tanks or cisterns of rough stone or rather one patera divided each half being twenty feet square and sixteen spans in depth one of these contains water for the drinking of the inhabitants and the other that which they use for their cattle washing and such like purposes every morning near this part of the island a cloud or mist arises from the sea which the south and easterly winds force against the forementioned steep cliff so that the cloud having no vent but by the gutter gradually ascends it and from thence advances slowly to the extremity of the valley where it is stopped and checked by the front of the rock which terminates the valley and then rests upon the thick leaves and widespreading branches of the tree from whence it distils in drops during the remainder of the day until it is at length exhausted in the same manner that we see water drip from the leaves of trees after a heavy shower of rain this distillation is not peculiar to the garse or til for the bresos which grow near it likewise drop water but their leaves being but few and narrow the quantity is so trifling that though the natives save some of it yet they make little or no account of any but what distils from the til which together with the water of some fountains and what is saved in the winter season is sufficient to serve them and their flocks this tree yields most water in those years when the levant or easterly winds have prevailed for a continuance for by these winds only the clouds or mists are drawn hither from the sea a person lives on the spot near which this tree grows who is appointed by the council to take care of it and its water and is allowed a house to live in with a certain salary he every day distributes to each family of the district seven pots or vessels full of water besides what he gives to the principal people of the island whether the tree which yields water at this present time be the same as that mentioned in the above description i can not pretend to determine but it is probable there has been a succession of them for pliny describing the fortunate islands says in the mountains of ombrion are trees resembling the plant ferula from which water may be procured by pressure what comes from the black kind is bitter but that which the white yields is sweet and palatableglass history of the canary islands cordeyro historia insulana lib ii c says that this tree resembles what in other places is called the til tilia the linden tree and he proceeds from these three letters to make it an emblem of the trinity the water he says was called the agua santa and the tree itself the santa

rozio muy delgado que confortava las cabezas there may be some exaggeration in the accounts of the fierro tree but that the story has some foundation i have no doubt the islanders of st thomas say that they have a sort of trees whose leaves continually are distilling water barbot in churckle it is certain that a dew falls in hot weather from the limea fact of which any person may easily convince himself the same property has been observed in other english trees as appears by the following extract from the monthly magazine in the beginning of august after a sunshine day the air became suddenly misty about six oclock i walked however by the road side from seven to eight and observed in many places that a shower of big drops of water was falling under the large trees although no rain fell elsewhere the road and path continued dusty and the fieldgates showed no signs of being wetted by the mist i have often noticed the like fact but have not met with a satisfactory explanation of this power in trees to condense mist i am not the only poet who has availed himself of the fierro tree it is thus introduced in the columbus of carraraa singular work containing amid many

very distinguished son of brahma named nared bears a strong resemblance to hermes or mercury he was a wise legislator great in arts and in arms an eloquent messenger of the gods either to one another or to favoured mortals and a musician of exquisite skill his invention of the vina or indian lute is thus described in the poem entitled magha nared sat watching from time to time his large vina which by the impulse of the breeze yielded notes that pierced successively the regions of his ear and proceeded by musical intervalsasiatic researches sir w jones the vina is an æolian harp the people of amboyna have a different kind of æolian instrument which is thus described in the first account of dentrecasteauxs voyage being on the seashore i heard some windinstruments the harmony of which though sometimes very correct was intermixed with discordant notes that were by no means unpleasing these sounds which were very musical and formed fine cadences seemed to come from such a distance that i for some time imagined the natives were having a concert beyond the roadstead near a myriameter from the spot where i stood my ear was greatly deceived respecting the distance for i was not an hundred meters from the instrument it was a bamboo at least twenty meters in height which had been fixed in a vertical situation by the seaside i remarked between each knot a slit about three centimeters long by a centimeter and a half wide these slits formed so many holes which when the wind introduced itself into them gave agreeable and diversified sounds as the knots of this long bamboo were very numerous care had been takes to make holes in different directions in order that on whatever side the wind blew it might always meet with some of them i can not convey a better idea of the sound of this instrument than by comparing them to those of the harmonicalabillardiere voyage in search of la perouse nareda the mythological offspring of saraswati patroness of music is famed for his talents

attended that ceremony for the consecrated horse was to be set at liberty for a certain time and followed at a distance by the owner or his champion who was usually one of his near kinsmen and if any person should attempt to stop it in its rambles a battle must inevitably ensue besides as the performer of a hundred aswamedhas became equal to the god of the firmament indra was perpetually on the watch and generally carried off the sacred animal by force or by fraudwilford asiat res mr halhed gives a very curious account of this remarkable sacrifice the ashummeedjugg does not merely consist in the performance of that ceremony which is open to the inspection of the world namely in bringing a horse and sacrificing him but ashummeed is to be taken in a mystic signification as implying that the sacrificer must look upon himself to be typified in that horse such as he shall be described because the religious duty of the ashummeedjugg comprehends all those other religious duties to the performance of which all the wise and holy direct all their actions and by which all the sincere professors of every different faith aim at perfection the mystic signification thereof is as follows the head of that unblemished horse is the symbol of the morning his eyes are the sun his breath the wind his wideopening mouth is the bishwaner or that innate warmth which invigorates all the world his body typifies one entire year his back paradise his belly the plains his hoof this earth his sides the four quarters of the heavens the bones thereof the intermediate spaces between the four quarters the rest of his limbs represent all distinct matter the places where those limbs meet or his joints imply the months and halves of the months which are called peche or fortnights his feet signify night and day and night and day are of four kinds the night and day of birhma the night and day of angels the night and day of the world of the spirits of deceased ancestors the night and day of mortals these four kinds are typified in his four feet the rest of his bones are the constellations of the fixed stars which are the twentyeight stages of the moons course called the lunar year his flesh is the clouds his food the sand his tendons the rivers his spleen and his liver the mountains the hair of his body the vegetables and his long hair the trees the fore part of his body typifies the first half of the day and the hinder part the latter half his yawning is the flash of the lightning and his turning himself is the thunder of the cloud his urine represents the rain and his mental reflection is his only speech the golden vessels which are prepared before the horse is let loose are the light of the day and the place where those vessels are kept is a type of the ocean of the east the silver vessels which are prepared after the horse is let loose are the light of the night and the place where those vessels are kept is a type of the ocean of the west these two sorts of vessels are always before and after the horse the arabian horse which on account of its swiftness is called hy is the performer of the journies of angels the tajee which is of the race of persian horses is the performer of the journies of the kundherps or good spirits the wazba which is of the race of the deformed tazee horses is the performer of the journies of the jins or demons and the ashoo which is of the race of turkish horses is the performer of the journies of mankind this one horse which performs these several services on account of his four different sorts of riders obtains the four different appellations the place where this horse remains is the great ocean which signifies the great spirit of permatma or the universal soul which proceeds also from that permatma and is comprehended in the same permatma the intent of this sacrifice is that a man should consider himself to be in the place of that horse and look upon all these articles as typified in himself and conceiving the atma or divine soul to be an ocean should let all thought of self be absorbed in that atmahalhed from darul shekuh compare this specimen of eastern sublimity with the description of the

many persons practised it formerly in sclavonia and the country of the triballes as we learn from ortelius who took the account from pliny who upon the report of isigones testifies that this species of enchantment was much in use among these people and many others whom he mentions as it is at present here especially among the arabians who inhabit the western coast of the persian gulph where this art is common the way in which they do it is only by the eyes and the mouth keeping the eyes fixed steadily upon the person whose heart they design to eat and pronouncing between their teeth i know not what diabolical words by virtue of which and by the operation of the devil the person how hale and strong soever falls immediately into an unknown and incurable disease which makes him appear phthysical consumes him little by little and at last destroys him and this takes place faster or slower as the heart is eaten as they say for these sorcerers can either eat the whole or a part only that is can consume it entirely and at once or bit by bit as they please the vulgar give it this name because they believe that the devil acting upon the imagination of the witch when she mutters her wicked words represents invisibly to her the heart and entrails of the patient taken out of his body and makes her devour them in which these wretches find so delightful a task that very often to satisfy their appetite without any impulse of resentment or enmity they will destroy innocent persons and even their nearest relatives as there is a report that our prisoner killed one of her own daughters in this manner this was confirmed to me by a similar story which i heard at ispahan from the mouth of p sebastian de jesus a portugueze augustinian a man to be believed and of singular virtue who was prior of their convent when i departed he assured me that on one of the places dependent upon portugal on the confines of arabia felix i know not whether it was at mascate or at ormuz an arab having been taken up for a similar crime and convicted of it for he confessed the fact the captain or governor of the place who was a portugueze that he might better understand the truth of these black and devilish actions of which there is no doubt in this country made the sorcerer be brought before him before he was led to his punishment and asked him if he could eat the inside of a cucumber without opening it as well as the heart of a man the sorcerer said yes and in order to prove it a cucumber was brought he looked at it never touching it steadily for some time with his usual enchantments and then told the captain he had eaten the whole inside and accordingly when it was opened nothing was found but the rind this is not impossible for the devil of whom they make use in these operations having in the order of nature greater power than all inferior creatures can with gods permission produce these effects and others more marvellous the same father told me that one of these sorcerers whether it was the same or not i do not know having been taken for a similar offence was asked if he could eat the heart of the portuguese captain and he replied no for the franks had a certain thing upon the breast which covered them like a cuirass and was so impenetrable that it was proof against all his charms this can be nothing else than the virtue of baptism the armour of the faith and the privilege of the sons of the church against which the gates of hell can not prevail to return however to my first subjectthis witch of combru made some difficulty at first to confess her guilt but seeing herself pressed with threats of death and being led in fact to the public square where i saw her with the sick young man she said that though she had not been the cause of his complaint perhaps she could cure it if they would let her remain alone with him in his house without interruption by which she tacitly confessed her witchcraft for it is held certain in these countries that these wicked women can remove the malady which they have caused if it be not come to the last extremity and of many remedies which they use to restore health to the sufferers there is one very extraordinary which is that the witch casts something out of her mouth like the grain of a pomegranate which is believed to be a part of the heart that she had eaten the patient picks it up immediately as part of his own intestines and greedily swallows it and by this means as if his heart was replaced in his body he recovers by degrees his health i dare not assure you of these things as certainly true not having myself seen them surpassing as they do the course of nature if they are as is said it can be only in appearance by the illusions of the devil and if the afflicted recover actually their health it is because the same devil ceases to torment them without dwelling longer upon these curious speculationsthe witch having given hopes that she would cure the patient the officers promised that she should receive no injury and they were both sent home but an archer was set over her as a guard that she might not escapepietro della valle the calisxi p the calis and pandaris are the protectresses of cities each city has its own they address prayers to these tutelary divinities and build temples to them offering to them blood in sacrifice and sometimes human victims these objects of worship are not immortal and they take their name from the city over which they preside or from the form in which they are represented they are commonly framed of a gigantic stature having several arms and the head surrounded with flames several fierce animals are also placed under their feetsonnerat sani the dreadful god who rides abroad upon the king of the ravensxi p mr moor has a curious remark upon this subject sani being among the astrologers of india as well as with their sapient brethren of europe a planet of malignant aspects the illomened raven may be deemed a fit vahan for such a dreaded being but this is not i think a sufficient reason for the conspicuous introduction of the raven into the mythological machinery of the hindu system so accurate so connected and so complete in all its parts although the investigations that it hath hitherto undergone have not fully developed or reached such points of perfection now let me ask the reason why both in england and in india the raven it so rare a bird it breeds every year like the crow and is much longer lived and while the latter bird abounds every where to a degree bordering on nuisance a pair of ravens for they are seldom seen singly or in trios are scarcely found duplicated in any place perhaps take england or india over two pair of ravens will not be found on an average in the extent of five hundred or a thousand acres i know not for i write where i have no access to books if our naturalists have sought the theory of this or whether it may have first occurred to me which it did while contemplating the character and attributes of sani that the raven destroys its young and if this notion be well founded and on no other can i account for the rareness of the annualbreeding longlived

sunny glade amid the wood and in the midst an aged banian grew it was a goodly sight to see that venerable tree for oer the lawn irregularly spread fifty straight columns propt its lofty head and many a long depending shoot seeking to strike its root straight like a plummet grew towards the ground some on the lower boughs which crost their way fixing their bearded fibres round and round with many a

smooth and fair to sight nor weeds nor briars deformd the natural floor and through the leafy cope which bowerd it oer came gleams of checquered light so like a temple did it seem that there a pious

silence joind and swelld the passing stream like burnishd steel glowing it lay beneath the eye of noon and when the breezes in their play ruffled the darkening surface then with gleam of sudden light around the lotus stem it rippled and the sacred flowers that crown the lakelet with their roseate beauty ride in gentlest waving rockd from side to side and as the wind upheaves their broad and buoyant weight the glossy leaves flap on the twinkling waters up and down they built them here a bower of jointed cane strong for the needful use and light and long was the slight framework reard with little pain lithe creepers then the wickersides supply and the tall junglegrass fit roofing gave beneath that genial sky and here did kailyal each returning day pour forth libations from the brook to

crouchd before the heavenly maid and offered to her touch his speckled side or with archd back erect and bending head and eyes halfclosd for pleasure would he stand courting the pressure of her gentle hand trampling his path through wood and brake and canes which crackling fall before his way and tasselgrass whose silvery feathers play oertopping the young trees on comes the elephant to slake his thirst at noon in yon pellucid springs lo from his trunk upturnd aloft he flings the grateful shower and now plucking the broadleavd bough of yonder plane with waving motion slow fanning the languid air he moves it to and fro but when that form of beauty meets his sight the trunk its undulating motion stops from his forgetful hold the planebranch drops reverent he kneels and lifts his rational eyes to her as if in prayer and when she pours her angel voice in song entranced he listens to the thrilling notes till his strong temples bathd with sudden dews their fragrance of delight and love diffuse lo as the voice melodious floats around the antelope draws near the tygress leaves her toothless cubs to hear the snake comes gliding from the secret brake himself in fascination forced along

pure desire as vestal maids whose piety is love feel in their extasies when rapt above their souls unto their heavenly spouse aspire why else so often doth that searching eye roam through the scope of sky why if she sees a distant speck on high starts there that quick suffusion to her cheek tis but the eagle in his heavenly height reluctant to believe she hears his cry and marks his wheeling flight

which round her rise have rousd her with affright and fear hath given to her dilated eyes a wilder light where shall those eyes be turnd she knows not where downward they dare not look for there is death and horror and despair nor can her patient looks to heaven repair for the huge idol over her in air spreads his seven hideous heads and wide extends their snaky necks on every side and all around behind before the bridal car is the raging rout with frantic shout and deafening roar tossing the torches flames about and the double double peals of the drum are there and the startling burst of the trumpets blare and the gong that seems with its thunders dread to stun the living and waken the dead the earstrings throb as if they were broke and the eyelids drop at the weight of its stroke fain would the maid have kept them fast but open they start at the crack of the blast where art thou son of heaven ereenia where in this dread hour of horror and despair thinking on him she strove her

voice of song and the sweet music of their girdlebells armlets and anklets that with chearful sounds symphonious tinkled as they wheeld around they sung a bridal measure a song of pleasure a hymn of joyaunce and of gratulation go chosen one they cried go happy bride for thee the god descends in expectation for thy dear sake he leaves his heaven o maid of matchless charms go happy one the bed

closd the templegate and left the wretched kailyal to her fate where art thou son of heaven ereenia where from the loathed bed she starts and in the air looks up as if she thought to find him there then in despair anguish and agony and hopeless prayer prostrate she laid herself upon the floor there trembling as she lay the bramin of the fane advanced and came to seize his prey but as the priest drew nigh a power invisible opposed his way starting he uttered wildly a deathcry and fell at that the maid all eagerly lifted in hope her head she thought her own deliverer had been near when lo with other life reanimate she saw the dead arise and in the fiendish joy within his eyes she knew the hateful spirit who lookd through their specular orbs clothd in the flesh of man she knew the accursed soul of arvalan but not in vain with the sudden shriek of fear she calls ereenia now the glendoveer is here upon the guilty sight he burst like lightning from a cloud and caught the accurst bore him

overwhelmd they lie beneath the waves not overthrown so well the mighty one had laid their deep foundations rightly said the accursed that no way for man was there but not like man am i up from the ground the maid exultant sprung and clappd her happy hands in attitude of thanks to heaven and flung her arms around her fathers neck and stood struggling awhile for utterance with excess of hope and pious thankfulness come come she cried o let us not delay he is in torments there away away long time they travelld on at dawn of day still setting forward with the earliest light nor ceasing from their way till darkness closd the night short refuge from the noontide heat reluctantly compelld the maiden took and ill her indefatigable feet could that brief tarriance brook hope kept her up and her intense desire supports that heart which neer at danger quails those feet which never tire that frame which never fails their talk was of the city of the days of old earths wonder once and of the fame of baly its great founder he whose name in ancient story and in poets praise liveth and flourisheth for endless glory because his might put down the wrong and aye upheld the right till for ambition as old sages tell the mighty monarch fell for he too having made the world his own then in his pride had driven the devetas from heaven and seizd triumphantly the swerga throne the incarnate came before the mighty one in dwarfish stature and in mien obscure the sacred cord he bore and askd for bramas sake a little boon three steps of balys ample reign no more poor was the boon requird and poor was he who beggd a little wretch it seemd to be but baly neer refusd a suppliants prayer a glance of pity in contemptuous mood he on the dwarf cast down and bade him take the boon and measure where he would lo son of giant birth i take my grant the incarnate power replies with his first step he measurd oer the earth the second spannd the skies three paces thou hast granted twice have i set my footstep veeshnoo cries where shall the third be planted then baly knew the god and at his feet in homage due he laid his humbled head mighty art thou o lord of earth and heaven mighty art thou he said be merciful and let me be forgiven he askd for mercy of the merciful and mercy for his virtues sake was shown for though he was cast down to padalon yet there by yamens throne doth baly sit in majesty and might to judge the dead and sentence them aright and forasmuch as he was still the friend of righteousness it is permitted him yearly from those drear regions to ascend and walk the earth that he may hear his name still hymnd and honourd by the grateful voice of humankind and in his fame rejoice such was the talk they held upon their way of him to whose old city they were bound and now upon their journey many a day had risen and closd and many a week gone round and many a realm and region had they past when now the ancient towers appeard at last their golden summits in the noonday light shone oer the darkgreen deep that rolld between for domes and pinnacles and spires were seen peering above the sea a mournful sight well might the sad beholder ween from thence what works of wonder the devouring wave had swallowed there when monuments so brave bore record of their old magnificence and on the sandy shore beside the verge of ocean here and there a rockhewn fane resisted in its strength the surf and surge that on their deep foundations beat in vain in solitude the ancient temples stood once resonant with instrument and song and solemn dance of festive multitude now as the weary ages pass along no voice they hear save of the ocean flood which roars for ever on the restless shores or visiting their solitary caves the lonely sound of winds that moan around accordant to the melancholy waves with reverence did the travellers see the works of ancient days and silently approach the shore now on the yellow sand where round their feet the rising surges part they stand ladurlads heart exulted in his wonderous destiny to heaven he raisd his hand in attitude of stern heroic pride oh what a power he cried thou dreadful rajah doth thy curse impart i thank thee now then turning to the maid thou seest how far and wide yon towers extend he said my search must needs be long meantime the flood will cast thee up thy food and in the chambers of the rock by night take thou thy safe abode no prowling beast to harm thee or affright can enter there but wrap thyself with care from the foul bird obscene that thirsts for blood for in such caverns doth the bat delight to have its haunts do thou with stone and shout ere thou liest down at evening scare them out and in this robe of mine involve thy feet duly commend us both to heaven in prayer be of good heart and let thy sleep be sweet so saying he put back his arm and gave the cloth which girt his loins and prest her hand with fervent love then down the sloping sand advanced into the sea the coming wave which knew kehamas curse before his way started and on he went as on dry land and still around his path the waters parted she stands upon the shore where seaweeds play lashing her polishd ankles and the spray which off her father like a rainbow fled falls on her like a shower there kailyal stands and sees the billows rise above his head she at the startling sight forgot the power the curse had given him and held forth her hands imploringly her voice was on the wind and the deaf ocean oer ladurlad closd soon she recalld his destiny to mind and shaking off that natural fear composd her soul with prayer to wait the event resignd alone upon the solitary strand the lovely one is left behold her go pacing with patient footsteps to and fro along the bending sand save her ye gods from evil powers and here from man she need not fear for never traveller comes near these awful ruins of the days of yore nor fishers bark nor venturous mariner approach the sacred shore all day she walkd the beach at night she sought the chamber of the rock with stone and shout assaild the bats obscene and scard them out then in her fathers robe involvd her feet and wrapt her mantle round to guard her head and laid her down the rock was kailyals bed her chamberlamps were in the starry sky the winds and waters were her lullaby be of good heart and let thy sleep be sweet ladurlad said alas that can not be to one whose days are days of misery how often did she stretch her hands to greet ereenia rescued in the dreams of night how oft amid the vision of delight fear in her heart all is not as it seems then from unsettled slumber start and hear the winds that moan above the waves below thou hast been calld o sleep the friend of woe but tis the happy who have calld thee so another day another night are gone a second passes and a third wanes on so long she paced the shore so often on the beach she took her stand that the wild seabirds knew her and no more fled when she past beside them on the strand bright shine the golden summits in the light of the noonsun and lovelier far by night their moonlight glories oer the sea they shed fair is the darkgreen deep by night and day unvexd with storms the peaceful billows play as when they closd upon ladurlads head the firmament above is bright and clear the seafowl lords of water air and land joyous alike upon the wing appear or when they ride the waves or walk the sand beauty and light and joy are everywhere there is no sadness and no sorrow here save what that single human breast contains but oh what hopes and fears and pains are there seven miserable days the expectant maid from earliest dawn till evening watchd the shore hope left her then and in her heart she said never shall i behold my father more xvi the ancient sepulchres when the broad ocean on ladurlads head had closd and archd him oer with steady tread he held his way adown the sloping shore the darkgreen waves with emerald hue imbue the beams of day and on the wrinkled sand below rolling their mazy network to and fro light shadows shift and play the hungry shark at scent of prey toward ladurlad darted beholding then that human form erect how like a god the depths he trod appalld the monster started and in his fear departed onward ladurlad went with heart elate and now hath reachd the ancient citys gate wondering he stood awhile to gaze upon the works of elder days the brazen portals open stood even as the fearful multitude had left them when they fled before the rising flood high overhead sublime the mighty gateways storied roof was spread dwarfing the puny piles of younger time with the deeds of days of yore that ample roof was sculpturd oer and many a godlike form there met his eye and many an emblem dark of mystery through these wide portals oft had baly rode triumphant from his proud abode when in his greatness he bestrode the aullay hugest of fourfooted kind the aullayhorse that in his force with elephantine trunk could bind and lift the elephant and on the wind whirl him away with sway and swing even like a pebble from the practisd sling those streets which never since the days of yore by human footstep had been visited those streets which never more a human foot shall tread ladurlad trod in sunlight and seagreen the thousand palaces were seen of that proud city whose superb abodes seemd reard by giants for the immortal gods how silent and how beautiful they stand like things of nature the eternal rocks themselves not firmer neither hath the sand drifted within their gates and choakd their doors nor slime defild their pavements and their floors did then the ocean wage his war for love and envy not in rage o thou fair city that he spares thee thus art thou varounins capital and court where all the seagods for delight resort a place too godlike to be held by us the poor degenerate children of the earth so thought ladurlad as he lookd around weening to hear the sound of mermaids shell and song of choral throng from some imperial hall wherein the immortal powers at festival their high carousals keep but all is silence dread silence profound and dead the everlasting stillness of the deep through many a solitary street and silent marketplace and lonely square armd with the mighty curse behold him fare and now his feet attain that royal fane where baly held of old his awful reign what once had been the garden spread around fair gardens once which wore perpetual green where all sweet flowers through all the year were found and all fair fruits were through all seasons seen a place of paradise where each device of emulous art with nature strove to vie and nature on her part calld forth new powers wherewith to vanquish art the swergagod himself with envious eye surveyd those peerless gardens in their prime nor ever did the lord of light who circles earth and heaven upon his way behold from eldest time a goodlier sight than were the groves which baly in his might made for his chosen place of solace and delight it was a garden still beyond all price even yet it was a place of paradise for where the mighty ocean could not spare there had he with his own creation sought to repair his work of devastation and here were coral bowers and grots of madrepores and banks of spunge as soft and fair to eye as eer was mossy bed whereon the wood nymphs lie with languid limbs in summers sultry hours here too were living flowers which like a bud compacted their purple cups contracted and now in open blossom spread stretchd like green anthers many a seeking head and arborets of jointed stone were there and plants of fibres fine as silkworms thread yea beautiful as mermaids golden hair upon the waves dispread others that like the broad banana growing raisd their long wrinkled leaves of purple hue like streamers wide outflowing and whatsoeer the depths of ocean hide from human eyes ladurlad there espied trees of the deep and shrubs and fruits and flowers as fair as ours wherewith the seanymphs love their locks to braid when to their fathers hall at festival repairing they in emulous array their charms display to grace the banquet and the solemn day the golden fountains had not ceasd to flow and where they mingled with the briny sea there was a sight of wonder and delight to see the fish like birds in air above ladurlad flying round those strange waters they repair their scarlet fins outspread and plying they float with gentle hovering there and now upon those little wings as if to dare forbidden things with wilful purpose bent swift as an arrow from a bow they dash across and to and fro in rapid glance like lightning go through that unwonted element almost in scenes so wonderous fair ladurlad had forgot the mighty cause which led him there his busy eye was every where his mind had lost all thought his heart surrendered to the joys of sight was happy as a boys but soon the awakening thought recurs of him who in the sepulchres hopeless of human aid in chains is laid and her who on the solitary shore by night and day her weary watch will keep till she shall see them issuing from the deep now hath ladurlad reachd the court of the great palace of the king its floor was of the marble rock and there before the imperial door a mighty image on the steps was seen of stature huge of countenance serene a crown and sceptre at his feet were laid one hand a scroll displayd the other pointed there that all might see my name is death it said in mercy have the gods appointed me two brazen gates beneath him night and day stood open and within them you behold descending steps which in the living stone were hewn a spacious way down to the chambers of the kings of old trembling with hope the adventurous man descended the seagreen light of day not far along the vault extended but where the slant reflection ended another light was seen of red and fiery hue that with the water blended and gave the secrets of the tombs to view deep in the marble rock the hall of death was hollowed out a chamber wide lowroofd and long on either side each in his own alcove and on his throne the kings of old were seated in his hand each held the sceptre of command from whence across that scene of endless night a carbuncle diffused its everlasting light so well had the embalmers done their part with spice and precious unguents to imbue the perfect corpse that each had still the hue of living man and every limb was still supple and firm and full as when of yore its motion answered to the moving will the robes of royalty which once they wore long since had mouldered off and left them bare naked upon their thrones behold them there statues of actual flesh a fearful sight their large and rayless eyes dimly reflecting to that gemborn light glazd fixd and meaningless yet open wide their ghastly balls belied the mockery of life in all beside but if amid these chambers drear death were a sight of shuddering and of fear life was a thing of stranger horror here for at the farther end in yon alcove where baly should have lain had he obeyd mans common lot behold ereenia laid strong fetters link him to the rock his eye now rolls and widens as with effort vain he strives to break the chain now seems to brood upon his misery before him couchd there lay one of the mighty monsters of the deep whom lorrinite encountering on the way there stationd his perpetual guard to keep in the sport of wanton power she charmd him there as if to mock the glendoveers despair upward his form was human save that here the skin was coverd oer with scale on scale compact a panoply of natural mail his mouth from ear to ear weapond with triple teeth extended wide and tusks on either side a double snake below he rolld his supple lengths behind in many a sinuous fold with red and kindling eye the beast beholds a living man draw nigh and rising on his folds in hungry joy awaits the expected feast his mouth halfopen and his teeth unsheathd then on he sprung and in his scaly arms seizd him and fastend on his neck to suck with greedy lips the warm lifeblood and sure but for the mighty power of magic charms as easily as in the blithesome hour of spring a child doth crop the meadow flower piecemeal those claws had rent their victim and those armed jaws snapt him in twain naked ladurlad stood yet fearless and unharmd in this dread strife so well kehamas curse had charmd his fated life he too for anger rising at the sight of him he sought in such strange thrall confind with desperate courage fird ladurlads mind he too unto the fight himself addrest and grappling breast to breast with foot firmplanted stands and seizd the monsters throat with both his hands vainly with throttling grasp he prest the impenetrable scales and lo the guard rose up and round his foe with gliding motion wreathd his lengthening coils then tightend all their folds with stress and strain nought would the raging tygers strength avail if once involvd within those mighty toils the armd rhinoceros so claspd in vain had trusted to his hide of rugged mail his bones all broken and the breath of life crushd from the lungs in that unequal strife again and yet again he sought to break the impassive limbs but when the monster found his utmost power was vain a moment he relaxd in every round then knit his coils again with closer strain and bearing forward forced him to the ground ereenia groand in anguish at the sight of this dread fight once more the glendoveer essayd to break his bonds and fear for that brave spirit who had sought him here stung him to wilder strugglings from the rock he raisd himself half up with might and main pluckd at the adamantine chain and now with long and unrelaxing strain in obstinate effort of indignant strength labourd and strove in vain till his immortal sinews faild at length and yielding with an inward groan to fate despairingly he let himself again fall prostrate on his prisonbed of stone body and chain alike with lifeless weight struggling they lay in mortal fray all day while day was in our upper sphere for light of day and natural darkness never entered here all night with unabated might they waged the unremitting fight a second day a second night with furious will they wrestled still the third came on the fourth is gone another comes another goes and yet no respite no repose but day and night and night and day involvd in mortal strife they lay six days and nights have past away and still they wage with mutual rage the unremitting fray with mutual rage their war they wage but not with mutual will for when the seventh morning came the monsters worn and wearied frame in this strange contest fails and weaker weaker every hour he yields beneath strong natures power for now the curse prevails sometimes the beast sprung up to bear his foe aloft and trusting there to shake him from his hold relaxd the rings that wreathd him round but on his throat ladurlad hung and weighd him to the ground and if they sink or if they float alike with stubborn clasp he clung tenacious of his grasp for well he knew with what a power exempt from natures laws the curse had armd him for this hour and in the monsters gasping jaws and in his hollow eye well could ladurlad now descry the certain signs of victory and now the guard no more can keep his painful watch his eyes opprest are fainting for their natural sleep his living flesh and blood must rest the beast must sleep or die then he full faint and languidly unwreathes his rings and strives to fly and still retreating slowly trails his stiff and heavy length of scales but that unweariable foe with will relentless follows still no breathing time no pause of fight he gives but presses on his flight along the vaulted chambers and the ascent up to the emeraldtinted light of day he harasses his way till lifeless underneath his grasp the huge seamonster lay that obstinate work is done ladurlad cried one labour yet remains and thoughtfully he eyed ereenias ponderous chains and with vain effort halfdespairing tried the rivets deep indriven instinctively as if in search of aid he lookd around oh then how gladly in the near alcove fallen on the ground its lifeless lord beside the crescent scymitar he spied whose cloudy blade with potent spells imbued had lain so many an age unhurt in solitude joyfully springing there he seizd the weapon and with eager stroke hewd at the chain the force was dealt in vain for not as if through yielding air past the descending scymitar its deadend way the heavy water broke yet it bit deep again with both his hands he wields the blade and dealt a surer blow the baser metal yields to that fine edge and lo the glendoveer rises and snaps the halfseverd links and stands freed from his broken bands xvii baly this is the appointed night the night of joy and consecrated mirth when from his judgementseat in padalon by yamens throne baly goes forth that he may walk the earth unseen and hear his name still hymnd and honourd by the grateful voice of humankind and in his fame rejoice therefore from door to door and street to street with willing feet shaking their firebrands the glad children run baly great baly they acclaim whereer they run they bear the mighty name whereer they meet baly great baly still their choral tongues repeat therefore at every door the votive flame through pendant lanthorns sheds its painted light and rockets hissing upward through the sky fall like a shower of stars from heavens black canopy therefore on yonder mountains templed height the brazen cauldron blazes through the night huge as a ship that travels the main sea is that capacious brass its wick as tall as is the mast of some great admiral ten thousand votaries bring camphor and ghee to feed the sacred flame and while through regions round the nations see its fiery pillar curling high in heaven baly great baly they exclaim for ever hallowed be his blessed name honour and praise to him for ever more be given why art not thou among the festive throng baly o mighty one to hear thy fame still as of yore with pageantry and song the glowing streets along they celebrate thy name baly great baly still the grateful habitants of earth acclaim baly great baly still the ringing walls and echoing towers proclaim from yonder mountain the portentous flame still blazes to the nations as before all things appear to human eyes the same as perfect as of yore to human eyes but how unlike to thine thine which were wont to see the company divine that with their presence came to honour thee for all the blessed ones of mortal birth who have been clothd with immortality from the eight corners of the earth from the seven worlds assembling all wont to attend thy solemn festival then did thine eyes behold the wide air peopled with that glorious train now mayst thou seek the blessed ones in vain for earth and air are now beneath the rajahs reign therefore the mighty one hath walkd the earth in sorrow and in solitude tonight the sound of human mirth to him is no delight he turns away from that ungrateful sight hallowed not now by visitants divine and there he bends his melancholy way where in yon fullorbd moons refulgent light the golden towers of his old city shine above the silver sea the mighty chief there bent his way in grief as if sad thoughts indulged would work their own relief there he beholds upon the sand a lovely maiden in the moonlight stand the landbreeze lifts her locks of jet the waves around her polishd ancles play her bosom with the salt seaspray is wet her arms are crost unconsciously to fold that bosom from the cold while statuelike she seems her watch to keep gazing intently on the restless deep seven miserable days had kailyal there from earliest dawn till evening watchd the deep six nights within the chamber of the rock had laid her down and found in prayer that comfort which she sought in vain from sleep but when the seventh night came never should she behold her father more the wretched maiden said in her despair yet would not quit the shore nor turn her eyes one moment from the sea never before had kailyal watchd it so impatiently never so eagerly had hopd before as now when she believd and said all hope was oer beholding her how beautiful she stood in that wild solitude baly from his invisibility had issued then to know her cause of woe but that in the air beside her he espied two powers of evil for her hurt allied foul arvalan and dreadful lorrinite the mighty one they could not see and marking with what demonlike delight they kept their innocent prey in sight he waits expecting what the end may be she starts for lo where floating many a rood a monster hugest of the ocean brood weltering and lifeless drifts toward the shore backward she starts in fear before the flood and when the waves retreat they leave their hideous burthen at her feet she ventures to approach with timid tread she starts and half draws back in fear then stops and stretches on her head to see if that huge beast indeed be dead now growing bold the maid advances near even to the margin of the oceanflood rightly she reads her fathers victory and lifts her joyous hands exultingly to heaven in gratitude then spreading them toward the sea while pious tears bedim her streaming eyes come come my father come to me ereenia come she cries lo from the opening deep they rise and to ladurlads arms the happy kailyal flies she turnd from him to meet with beating heart the glendoveers embrace now turn to me for mine thou art foul arvalan exdaimd his loathsome face came forth and from the air in fleshly form he burst always in horror and despair had kailyal seen that form and face accurst but yet so sharp a pang had neer shot with a thrill like death through all her frame as now when on her hour of joy the spectre came vain is resistance now the fiendish laugh of lorrinite is heard and at her dreadful word the asuras once again appear and seize ladurlad and the glendoveer hold your accursed hands a voice exclaimd whose dread commands were feard through all the vaults of padalon and there among them in the midnight air the presence of the mighty baly shone he making manifest his mightiness put forth on every side an hundred arms and seizd the sorceress maugre all her charms her and her fiendish ministers he caught with force as uncontroulable as fate and that unhappy soul to whom the almighty rajahs power availeth not living to avert nor dead to mitigate his righteous doom help help kehama father help he cried but baly tarried not to abide that mightier power with irresistible feet he stampt and cleft the earth it opened wide and gave him way to his own judgementseat down like a plummet to the world below he sunk and bore his prey to righteous punishment and endless woe xviii kehamas descent the earth by balys feet divided closd oer his way as to the judgementseat he plunged and bore his prey scarce had the shock subsided when darting from the swergas heavenly heights kehama like a thunderbolt alights in wrath he came a bickering flame flashd from his eyes which made the moonlight dim and passion forcing way from every limb like furnacesmoke with terrors wrapt him round furious he smote the ground earth trembled underneath the dreadful stroke again in sunder riven he hurld in rage his whirling weapon down but lo the fiery sheckra to his feet returnd as if by equal force redriven and from the abyss the voice of baly came not yet o rajah hast thou won the realms of padalon earth and the swerga are thine own but till kehama shall subdue the throne of hell in torments yamen holds his son fool that he is in torments let him lie kehama wrathful at his son replied but what am i that thou shouldst brave me kindling in his pride the dreadful rajah cried ho yamen hear me god of padalon prepare thy throne and let the amreeta cup be ready for my lips when i anon triumphantly shall take my seat thereon and plant upon thy neck my royal feet in voice like thunder thus the rajah cried impending oer the abyss with menacing hand put forth as in the action of command and eyes that darted their red anger down then drawing back he let the earth subside and as his wrath relaxd surveyd thoughtful and silently the mortal maid her eye the while was on the farthest sky where up the etherial height ereenia rose and past away from sight never had she so joyfully beheld the coming of the glendoveer dear as he was and he deservd to be as now she saw him rise and disappear come now what will within her heart said she for thou art safe and what have i to fear meantime the almighty rajah late in power and majesty and wrath arrayd had laid his terrors by and gazd upon the maid pride could not quit his eye nor that remorseless nature from his front depart yet whoso had beheld him then had felt some admiration mixd with dread and might have said that sure he seemd to be the king of men less than the greatest that he could not be who carried in his port such might and majesty in fear no longer for the glendoveer now toward the rajah kailyal turnd her eyes as if to ask what doom awaited her but then surprise even as with fascination held them there so strange a thing it seemd to see the change of purport in that allcommanding brow that thoughtfully was bent upon her now wondering she gazd the while her fathers eye was fixd upon kehama haughtily it spake defiance to him high disdain stern patience unsubduable by pain and pride triumphant over agony ladurlad said the rajah thou and i alike have done the work of destiny unknowing each to what the impulse tended but now that over earth and heaven my reign is stablishd and the ways of fate are plain before me here our enmity is ended i take away thy curse as thus he said the fire which in ladurlads heart and brain was burning fled and left him free from pain so rapidly his torments were departed that at the sudden ease he started as with a shock and to his head his hands upfled as if he felt through every failing limb the power and sense of life forsaking him then turning to the maid the rajah cried o virgin above all of mortal birth favourd alike in beauty and in worth and in the glories of thy destiny now let thy happy heart exult with pride for fate hath chosen thee to be kehamas bride to be the queen of heaven and earth and of whatever worlds beside infinity may hide for i can see the writing which at thy nativity allknowing nature wrought upon thy brain in branching veins which to the gifted eye map out the mazes of futurity there is it written maid that thou and i alone of human kind a deathless pair are doomd to share the amreetadrink divine of immortality come maiden mine highfated one ascend the subject sky and by kehamas side sit on the swerga throne his equal bride oh never never father kailyal cried it is not as he saith it can not be i i his bride nature is never false he wrongeth her my heart belies such lines of destiny there is no other true interpreter at that reply kehamas darkening brow bewrayd the anger which he yet supprest counsel thy daughter tell her thou art now free from thy curse he said and bid her bow in thankfulness to fates benign behest bid her her stubborn will restrain for destiny at last must be obeyd and tell her while obedience is delayd thy curse will burn again she needeth not my counsel he replied and idly rajah dost thou reason thus of destiny for though all other things were subject to the starry influencings and bowd submissive to thy tyranny the virtuous heart and resolute will are free thus in their wisdom did the gods decree when they created man let come what will this is our rock of strength in every ill sorrow oppression pain and agony the spirit of the good is unsubdued and suffer as they may they triumph still obstinate fools exclaimd the mighty one fate and my pleasure must be done and ye resist in vain take your fit guerdon till we meet again so saying his vindictive hand he flung towards them filld with curses then on high aloft he sprung and vanishd through the sky xix mount calasay the rajah scattering curses as he rose soard to the swerga and resumd his throne not for his own redoubled agony which now through heart and brain with renovated pain rushd to its seat ladurlad breathes that groan that groan is for his child he groand to see the lovely one defild with leprosy which as the enemy vindictive fled oer all her frame with quick contagion spread she wondering at events so passing strange and filld with hope and fear and joy to see the tyrant disappear and glad expectance of her glendoveer perceivd not in herself the hideous change his burning pain she thought had forced the groan her father breathd his agonies alone were present to her mind she claspt his knees wept for his curse and did not feel her own nor when she saw her plague did her good heart true to itself even for a moment fail ha rajah with disdainful smile she cries mighty and wise and wicked as thou art still thy blind vengeance acts a friendly part shall i not thank thee for this scurf and scale of dire deformity whose loathsomeness surer than panoply of strongest mail arms me against all foes oh better so better such foul disgrace than that this innocent face should tempt thy wooing that i need not dread nor ever impious foe will offer outrage now nor farther woe will beauty draw on my unhappy head safe through the unholy world may kailyal go her face in virtuous pride was lifted to the skies as him and his poor vengeance she defied but earthward when she ceasd she turnd her eyes as if she sought to hide the tear which in her own despite would rise did then the thought of her own glendoveer call forth that natural tear was it a womans fear a thought of earthly love which troubled her like yon thin cloud amid the moonlight sky that flits before the wind and leaves no trace behind the womanly pang past over kailyals mind this is a loathsome sight to human eye halfshrinking at herself the maiden thought will it be so to him oh surely not the immortal powers who see through the poor wrappings of mortality behold the soul the beautiful soul within exempt from age and wasting malady and undeformd while pure and free from sin this is a loathsome sight to human eye but not to eyes divine ereenia son of heaven oh not to thine the wrongful thought of fear the womanly pain had past away her heart was calm again she raisd her head expecting now to see the glendoveer appear where hath he fled quoth she that he should tarry now oh had she known whither the adventurous son of heaven was flown strong as her spirit was it had not borne the awful thought nor dard to hope for his return for he in search of seevas throne was gone to tell his tale of wrong in search of seevas own abode the daring one began his heavenly road o wild emprize above the farthest skies he hopd to rise him who is thrond beyond the reach of thought the alone the inaccessible he sought o wild emprize for when in days of yore for proud preeminence of power brama and veeshnoo wild with rage contended and seeva in his might their dread contention ended before their sight in form a fiery column did he tower whose head above the highest height extended whose base below the deepest depth descended downward its depth to sound veeshnoo a thousand years explord the fathomless profound and yet no base he found upward to reach its head ten myriad years the aspiring brama soard and still as up he fled above him still the immeasurable spread the rivals ownd their lord and trembled and adord how shall the glendoveer attain what brama and what veeshnoo sought in vain neer did such thought of lofty daring enter celestial spirits mind o wild adventure that throne to find for he must leave behind this world that in the centre within its saltsea girdle lies confind yea the seven earths that each with its own ocean ring clasping ring compose the mighty round what power of motion in less than endless years shall bear him there along the limitless extent to the utmost bound of the remotest spheres what strength of wing suffice to pierce the golden firmament that closes all within yet he hath past the measureless extent and pierced the golden firmament for faith hath given him power and space and time vanish before that energy sublime nor doth eternal night and outer darkness check his resolute flight by strong desire through all he makes his way till seevas seat appears behold mount calasay behold the silver mountain round about seven ladders stand so high the aching eye seeking their tops in vain amid the sky might deem they led from earth to highest heaven ages would pass away and worlds with age decay ere one whose patient feet from ring to ring must win their upward way could reach the summit of mount calasay but that strong power that nervd his wing that allsurmounting will intensity of faith and holiest love sustaind ereenia still and he hath gaind the plain the sanctuary above lo there the silver bell that selfsustaind hangs buoyant in the air lo the broad table there too bright for mortal sight from whose four sides the bordering gems unite their harmonizing rays in one mid fount of manycolourd light the stream of splendour flashing as it flows plays round and feeds the stem of yon celestial rose where is the sage whose wisdom can declare the hidden things of that mysterious flower that flower which serves all mysteries to bear the sacred triangle is there holding the emblem which no tongue may tell is this the heaven of heavens where seevas self doth dwell here first the glendoveer felt his wing flag and pausd upon his flight was it that fear came over him when here he saw the imagind throne appear not so for his immortal sight endurd the tables light distinctly he beheld all things around and doubt and wonder rose within his mind that this was all he found howbeit he lifted up his voice and spake there is oppression in the world below earth groans beneath the yoke yea in her woe she asks if the avengers eye is blind awake o lord awake too long thy vengeance sleepeth holy one put thou thy terrors on for mercys sake and strike the blow in justice to mankind so as he prayd intenser faith he felt his spirit seemd to melt with ardent yearnings of increasing love upward he turnd his eyes as if there should be something yet above let me not seeva seek in vain he cries thou art not here for how should these contain thee thou art not here for how should i sustain thee but thou whereer thou art canst hear the voice of prayer canst hear the humble heart thy dwelling who can tell or who o lord hath seen thy secret throne but thou art not alone not unapproachable o allcontaining mind thou who art every where whom all who seek shall find hear me o seeva hear the suppliants prayer so saying up he sprung and struck the bell which selfsuspended hung before the mystic rose from side to side the silver tongue melodious swung and far and wide soulthrilling tones of heavenly music rung abashd confounded it left the glendoveer yea all astounded in overpowering fear and deep dismay for when that bell had sounded the rose with all the mysteries it surrounded the bell the table and mount calasay the holy hill itself with all thereon even as a morning dream before the day dissolves away they faded and were gone where shall he rest his wing where turn for flight for all around is light primal essential allpervading light heart can not think nor tongue declare nor eyes of angel bear that glory unimaginably bright the sun himself had seemd a speck of darkness there amid that light of light down fell the glendoveer down through all regions to our mundane sphere he fell but in his ear a voice which from within him came was heard the indubitable word of him to whom all secret things are known go ye who suffer go to yamens throne he hath the remedy for every woe he setteth right whateer is wrong below xx the embarkation down from the heaven of heavens ereenia fell precipitate yet imperceptible his fall nor had he cause nor thought of fear and when he came within this mundane sphere and felt that earth was near the glendoveer his azure wings expanded and sloping down the sky toward the spot from whence he sprung on high there on the shore he landed kailyal advanced to meet him not moving now as she was wont to greet him joy in her eye and in her eager pace with a calm smile of melancholy pride she met him now and turning half aside her warning hand repelld the dear embrace strange things ereenia have befallen us here the virgin said the almighty man hath read the lines which traced by nature on my brain there to the gifted eye make all my fortunes plain mapping the mazes of futurity he sued for peace for it is written there that i with him the amreeta cup must share wherefore he bade me come and by his side sit on the swergathrone his equal bride i need not tell thee what reply was given my heart the sure interpreter of heaven his impious words belied thou seest his poor revenge so having said one look she glanced upon her leprous stain indignantly and shook her head in calm disdain o maid of soul divine o more than ever dear and more than ever mine replied the glendoveer he hath not read be sure the mystic ways of fate almighty as he is that maze hath mockd his fallible sight said he the amreetacup so far aright the evil one may see for fate displays her hidden things in part and part conceals baffling the wicked eye alike with what she hides and what reveals when with unholy purpose it would pry into the secrets of futurity so may it be permitted him to see dimly the inscrutable decree for to the world below where yamen guards the amreeta we must go thus seeva hath exprest his will even he the holiest hath ordaind it there he saith all wrongs shall be redrest by yamen by the righteous power of death forthwith the father and the fated maid and that heroic spirit who for them such flight had late essayd the will of heaven obeyd they went their way along the road that leads to yamens dread abode many a day hath past away since they began their arduous way their way of toil and pain and now their weary feet attain the earths remotest bound where outer ocean girds it round but not like other oceans this rather it seemd a drear abyss upon whose brink they stood oh scene of fear the travellers hear the raging of the flood they hear how fearfully it roars but clouds of darker shade than night for ever hovering round those shores hide all things from their sight the sun upon that darkness pours his unavailing light nor ever moon nor stars display through the thick shade one guiding ray to shew the perils of the way there in a creek a vessel lay just on the confines of the day it rode at anchor in its bay these venturous pilgrims to convey across that outer sea strange vessel sure it seemd to be and all unfit for such wild sea for through its yawning side the wave was oozing in the mast was frail and old and torn its only sail how shall that crazy vessel brave the billows that in wild commotion for ever roar and rave how hope to cross the dreadful ocean oer which eternal shadows dwell whose secrets none return to tell well might the travellers fear to enter but summond once on that adventure for them was no retreat nor boots it with reluctant feet to linger on the strand aboard aboard an awful voice that left no choice sent forth its stern command aboard aboard the travellers hear that voice in fear and breathe to heaven an inward prayer and take their seats in silence there selfhoisted then behold the sail expands itself before the gale hands which they can not see let slip the cable of that fated ship the land breeze sends her on her way and lo they leave the living light of day xxi the worlds end swift as an arrow in its flight the ship shot through the incumbent night and they have left behind the raging billows and the roaring wind the storm the darkness and all mortal fears and lo another light to guide their way appears the light of other spheres that instant from ladurlads heart and brain the curse was gone he feels again fresh as in youths fair morning and the maid hath lost her leprous stain the dreadful man hath no dominion here starting she cried o happy happy hour we are beyond his power then raising to the glendoveer with heavenly beauty bright her angel face turnd not reluctant now and met his dear embrace swift glides the ship with gentle motion across that calm and quiet ocean that glassy sea which seemd to be the mirror of tranquillity their pleasant passage soon was oer the ship hath reachd its destind shore a level belt of ice which bound as with an adamantine mound the waters of the sleeping ocean round strange forms were on the strand of earthborn spirits slain before their time who wandering over sea and sky and land had so fulfilld their term and now were met upon this icy belt a motley band waiting their summons at the appointed hour when each before the judgementseat must stand and hear his doom from balys righteous power foul with habitual crimes a hideous crew were there the race of rapine and of blood now having overpast the mortal flood their own deformity they knew and knew the meed that to their deeds was due therefore in fear and agony they stood expecting when the evil messenger among them should appear but with their fear a hope was mingled now oer the dark shade of guilt a deeper hue it threw and gave a fiercer character to the wild eye and lip and sinful brow they hopd that soon kehama would subdue the inexorable god and seize his throne reduce the infernal world to his command and with his irresistible right hand redeem them from the vaults of padalon apart from these a milder company the victims of offences not their own lookd when the appointed messenger should come gathered together some and some alone brooding in silence on their future doom widows whom to their husbands funeral fire force or strong error led to share the pyre as to their everlasting marriagebed and babes by sin unstaind whom erring parents vowd to ganges and the holy stream profand with that strange sacrifice rite unordaind by law by sacred nature unallowd others more hapless in their destiny scarce having first inhaled this vital breath whose cradles from some tree unnatural hands suspended then left till gentle death coming like sleep their feeble moanings ended or for his prey the ravenous kite descended or marching like an army from their caves the pismires blackend oer then bleachd and bare left their unhardend bones to fall asunder there innocent souls thus set so early free from sin and sorrow and mortality their spotless spirits allcreating love receivd into its universal breast yon blue serene above was their domain clouds pillowed them to rest the elements on them like nurses tended and with their growth etherial substance blended less pure than these is that strange indian bird who never dips in earthly streams her bill but when the sound of coming showers is heard looks up and from the clouds receives her fill less pure the footless fowl of heaven that never rest upon earth but on the wing for ever hovering oer flowers their fragrant food inhale drink the descending dew upon its way and sleep aloft while floating on the gale and thus these innocents in yonder sky grow and are strengthend while the allotted years perform their course then hitherward they fly being free from mortal taint so free from fears a joyous band expecting soon to soar to indras happy spheres and mingle with the blessed company of heavenly spirits there for evermore a gulph profound surrounded this icy belt the opposite side with highest rocks was bounded but where their heads they hide or where their base is founded none could espy above all reach of sight they rose the second earth was on their height their feet were fixd in everlasting night so deep the gulph no eye could plum its dark profundity yet all its depth must try for this the road to padalon and yamens dread abode and from below continually ministrant demons rose and caught the souls whose hour was come then with their burthen fraught plunged down and bore them to receive their doom then might be seen who went in hope and who trembled to meet the meed of many a foul misdeed as wild they threw their arms retorted from the demons grasp and lookd around all eagerly to seek for help where help was none and strove for aid to clasp the nearest shade yea with imploring looks and horrent shriek even from one demon to another bending with hands extending their mercy they essayd still from the verge they strain and from the dreadful gulph avert their eyes in vain down plunge the demons and their cries feebly as down they sink from that profound arise what heart of living man could undisturbd bear sight so sad as this what wonder there if kailyals lip were blanchd with inmost dread the chill which from that icy belt struck through her was less keen than what she felt with her heartsblood through every limb dispread close to the glendoveer she clung and clasping round his neck her trembling hands she closd her eyes and there in silence hung then to ladurlad said the glendoveer these demons whom thou seest the ministers of yamen wonder to behold us here but for the dead they come and not for us therefore albeit they gaze upon thee thus have thou no fear a little while thou must be left alone till i have borne thy daughter down and placed her safely by the throne of him who keeps the gate of padalon then taking kailyal in his arms he said be of good heart beloved it is i who bear thee saying this his wings he spread sprung upward in the sky and poisd his flight then plunged into the gulph and sought the world of night xxii the gate of padalon the strong foundations of this inmost earth rest upon padalon that icy mound which girt the mortal ocean round reachd the profound ice in the regions of the upper air crystal midway and adamant below whose strength sufficed to bear the weight of all this upper world of ours and with its rampart closd the realm of woe eight gates hath padalon eight heavenly powers have them in charge each alway at his post lest from their penal caves the accursed host maugre the might of baly and the god should break and carry ruin all abroad those gates stand ever open night and day and souls of mortal men for ever throng the way some from the dolorous den children of sin and wrath return no more they fit companions of the spirits accurst are doomd like them in baths of fire immerst or weltering upon beds of molten ore or stretchd upon the brazen floor are fastend down with adamantine chains while on their substance inconsumable leeches of fire for ever hang and pull and worms of fire for ever gnaw their food that still renewd freshens for ever their perpetual pains others there were whom balys voice condemned by long and painful penance to atone their fleshly deeds them from the judgementthrone dread azyoruca where she sat involvd in darkness as a tent receivd and dealt to each the measure of his punishment till in the central springs of fire the will impure is purged away and the freed soul thus fitted to receive its second birth embodied once again revisits earth but they whom balys righteous voice absolvd and yamen viewing with benignant eye dismissd to seek their heritage on high how joyfully they leave this gloomy bourne the dread sojourn of guilt and twinborn punishment and woe and wild remorse here linkd with worse despair they to the eastern gate rejoicing go the ship of heaven awaits their coming there and on they sail greeting the blessed light through realms of upper air bound for the swerga once but now no more their voyage rests upon that happy shore since indra by the dreadful rajahs might compelld hath taken flight on to the second world their way they wend and there in trembling hope await the doubtful end for still in them doth hope predominate faiths precious privilege when higher powers give way to fear in these portentous hours behold the wardens eight each silent at his gate expectant stands they turn their anxious eyes within and listening to the dizzy din of mutinous uproar each in all his hands holds all his weapons ready for the fight for hark what clamorous cries upon kehama for deliverance call come rajah they exclaim too long we groan in torments come deliverer yonder throne awaits thee now kehama rajah now earthly almighty wherefore tarriest thou such were the sounds that rung in wild uproar oer all the echoing vaults of padalon and as the asuras from the brazen floor struggling against their fetters strove to rise their clashing chains were heard and shrieks and cries with curses mixd against the fiends who urge fierce on their rebel limbs the avenging scourge these were the sounds which at the southern gate assaild ereenias ear alighting here he laid before neroodis feet the maid who pale and cold with fear hung on his neck wellnigh a lifeless weight who and what art thou cried the guardian power sight thus unwonted wondering to behold o son of light who comest here at this portentous hour when yamens throne trembles and all our might can scarce keep down the rebel race from seizing padalon who and what art thou and what wild despair or wilder hope from realms of upper air tempts thee to bear this mortal maid to our forlorn abodes fitter for her i ween the swerga bowers and sweet society of heavenly powers than this a doleful scene even in securest hours and whither would ye go alas can human or celestial ear unmaddend hear the shrieks and yellings of infernal woe can living flesh and blood endure the passage of the fiery flood lord of the gate replied the glendoveer we come obedient to the will of fate and haply doomd to bring hope and salvation to the infernal king for seeva sends us here even he to whom futurity is known the holiest bade us go to yamens throne thou seest my precious charge under thy care secure from harm i leave her while i ascend to bear her father down beneath the shelter of thine arm receive her then quoth he to the maid be of good cheer my kailyal dearest dear in faith subdue thy dread anon i shall be here so having said aloft with vigorous bound the glendoveer sprung in celestial might and soaring up in spiral circles wound his indefatigable flight but as he thus departed the maid who at neroodis feet was lying like one entranced or dying recovering strength from sudden terror started and gazing after him with straining sight and straining arms she stood as if in attitude to win him back from flight yea she had shapd his name for utterance to recall and bid him stay nor leave her thus alone but virtuous shame represt the unbidden sounds upon their way and calling faith to aid even in this fearful hour the pious maid collected courage till she seemd to be calm and in hope such power had piety before the giant keeper of the gate she crost her patient arms and at his feet prepard to meet the awful will of fate with equal mind she took her seat resignd even the stern trouble of neroodis brow relaxd as he beheld the valiant maid hope long unfelt till now rose in his heart reviving and a smile dawnd in his brightening countenance the while he gazd on her with wonder and delight the blessing of the powers of padalon virgin be on thee cried the admiring god and blessed be the hour that gave thee birth daughter of earth for thou to this forlorn abode hast brought hope who too long hath been a stranger here and surely for no lamentable lot nature who erreth not to thee that heart of fortitude hath given those eyes of purity that face of love if thou beest not the inheritrix of heaven there is no truth above thus as neroodi spake his brow severe shone with an inward joy for sure he thought when seeva sent so fair a creature here in this momentous hour ere long the worlds deliverance would be wrought and padalon escape the rajahs power with pious mind the maid in humble guise inclind received his blessing silently and raisd her grateful eyes a moment then again abasd them at his presence hark on high the sound of coming wings her anxious ears have caught the distant sound ereenia brings his burthen down upstarting from her seat how joyfully she rears her eager head and scarce upon the ground ladurlads giddy feet their footing found when with her trembling arms she claspt him round no word of greeting nor other sign of joy at that strange meeting expectant of their fate silent and hand in hand before the infernal gate the father and his heavenly daughter stand then to neroodi said the glendoveer no heavenborn spirit eer hath visited this region drear and dread but i the first who tread your world accurst lord of the gate to whom these realms are known direct our fated way to yamens throne bring forth my chariot carmala quoth then the keeper of the way it was the car wherein on yamens festal day when all the powers of hell attend their king yearly to yamenpur did he repair to pay his homage there poisd on a single wheel it movd along instinct with motion by what wonderous skill compact no human tongue could tell nor human wit devise but on that wheel moving or still as if an inward life sustaind its weight supported stood the car of miracle then carmala brought forth two mantles white as the swans breast and bright as mountain snow when from the wintry sky the sun laterising shines upon the height and rolling vapours fill the vale below not without pain the unaccustomd sight that brightness could sustain for neither mortal stain nor parts corruptible remain nor aught that time could touch or force destroy in that pure web whereof the robes were wrought so long had it in tenfold fires been tried and blanchd and to that brightness purified appareld thus alone children of earth neroodi cried in safety may ye pass to yamens throne thus only can your living flesh and blood endure the passage of the fiery flood of other frame o son of heaven art thou yet hast thou now to go through regions which thy heavenly mould will try glories unutterably bright i know and beams intense of empyrean light thine eye divine can bear but fires of woe the sight of torments and the cry of absolute despair might not these things dismay thee on thy flight and thy strong pennons flag and fail thee there trust not thy wings celestial though thou art nor thy good heart which horror might assail and pity quail pity in these abodes of no avail but take thy seat this mortal pair beside and carmala the infernal car will guide go and may happy end your way betide so as he spake the selfmovd car rolld on and lo they pass the gate of padalon xxiii padalon whoeer hath lovd with venturous step to tread the chambers dread of some deep cave and seen his tapers beam lost in the arch of darkness overhead and markd its gleam playing afar upon the sunless stream where from their secret bed and course unknown and inaccessible the silent waters well whoeer hath trod such caves of endless night he knows when measuring back the gloomy way with what delight refreshd his eye perceives the shadow of the light of day through the far portal slanting where it falls dimly reflected on the watry walls how heavenly seems the sky and how with quickend feet he hastens up eager again to greet the living world and blessed sunshine there and drink as from a cup of joy with thirsty lips the open air far other light than that of day there shone upon the travellers entering padalon they too in darkness entered on their way but far before the car a glow as of a fiery furnace light filld all before them twas a light which made darkness itself appear a thing of comfort and the sight dismayd shrunk inward from the molten atmosphere their way was through the adamantine rock which girt the world of woe on either side its massive walls arose and overhead archd the long passage onward as they ride with stronger glare the light around them spread and lo the regions dread the world of woe before them opening wide there rolls the fiery flood girding the realms of padalon around a sea of flame it seemd to be sea without bound for neither mortal nor immortal sight could pierce across through that intensest light a single rib of steel keen as the edge of keenest scymitar spannd this wide gulph of fire the infernal car rolld to the gulph and on its single wheel selfbalanced rose upon that edge of steel redquivering float the vapours overhead the fiery gulph beneath them spread tosses its billowing blaze with rush and roar steady and swift the selfmovd chariot went winning the long ascent then downward rolling gains the farther shore but oh what sounds and sights of woe what sights and sounds of fear assail the mortal travellers here their way was on a causey straight and wide where penal vaults on either side were seen ranged like the cells wherein those wonderous winged alchemists infold their stores of liquid gold thick walls of adamant divide the dungeons and from yonder circling flood offstreams of fire through secret channels glide and wind among them and in each provide an everlasting food of righteous torments for the accursed brood these were the rebel race who in their might confiding impiously would fain have driven the deities supreme from highest heaven but by the suras in celestial fight opposd and put to flight here in their penal dens the accursed crew not for its crime but for its failure rue their wild ambition yet again they long the contest to renew and wield their arms again in happier hour and with united power following kehamas triumph to press on from world to world and heaven to heaven and sphere to sphere till hemakoot shall be their own and meru mount and indras swergabowers and bramas region where the heavenly hours weave the vast circle of his agelong day even over veeshnoos empyreal seat they trust the rajah shall extend their sway and that the sevenheaded snake whereon the strong preserver sets his conquering feet will rise and shake him headlong from his throne when in their irresistible array amid the milky sea they force their way even higher yet their frantic thoughts aspire yea on their beds of torment as they lie the highest holiest seeva they defy and tell him they shall have anon their day when they will storm his realm and seize mount calasay such impious hopes torment their raging hearts impious and impotent and now with unendurable desire and lust of vengeance that like inward fire doth aggravate their punishment they rave upon kehama him the accursed rout acclaim with furious cries and maddening shout they call on him to save kehama they exclaim thundering the dreadful echo rolls about and hells whole vault repeats kehamas name over these dens of punishment the host of padalon maintain eternal guard keeping upon the walls their vigilant ward at every angle stood a watchtower the decurion demons post where raisd on high he viewd with sleepless eye his trust that all was well and over these such was the perfect discipline of hell captains of fifties and of hundreds held authority each in his loftier tower and chiefs of legions over them had power and thus all hell with towers was girt around aloft the brazen turrets shone in the red light of padalon and on the walls between dark moving the infernal guards were seen gigantic demons pacing to and fro who ever and anon spreading their crimson pennons plunged below faster to rivet down the asuras chains and with the snaky scourge and fiercer pains repress their rage rebellious loud around in mingled sound the echoing lash the clash of chains the ponderous hammers iron stroke with execrations groans and shrieks and cries combind in one wild dissonance arise and through the din there broke like thunder heard through all the warring winds the dreadful name kehama still they rave hasten and save now now deliverer now kehama now earthly almighty wherefore tarriest thou oh if that name abhorrd thus utterd could well nigh dismay the powers of hell and daunt their lord how fearfully to kailyals ear it came she as the car rolld on its rapid way bent down her head and closd her eyes for dread and deafening with strong effort from within her ears against the din coverd and prest them close with both her hands sure if the mortal maiden had not fed on heavenly food and long been strengthened with heavenly converse for such end vouchsafd her human heart had faild and she had died beneath the horrors of this awful hour but heaven supplied a power beyond her earthly nature to the measure of need infusing strength and fate whose secret and unerring pleasure appointed all decreed an ample meed and recompence at length highfated maid the righteous hour is nigh the allembracing eye of retribution still beholdeth thee bear onward to the end o maid courageously on rolld the car and lo afar upon its height the towers of yamenpur rise on the astonishd sight behold the infernal city yamens seat of empire in the midst of padalon where the eight causeys meet there on a rock of adamant it stood resplendent far and wide itself of solid diamond edified and all around it rolld the fiery flood eight bridges archd the stream huge piles of brass magnificent such structures as beseem the seat and capital of such great god worthy of yamens own august abode a brazen tower and gateway at each end of each was raisd where giant wardens stood stationd in arms the passage to defend that never foe might cross the fiery flood oh what a gorgeous sight it was to see the diamond city blazing on its height with more than midsun splendour by the light of its own fiery river its towers and domes and pinnacles and spires turrets and battlements that flash and quiver through the red restless atmosphere for ever and hovering over head the smoke and vapours of all padalon fit firmament for such a world were spread with surge and swell and everlasting motion heaving and opening like tumultuous ocean nor were there wanting there such glories as beseemd such region well for though with our blue heaven and genial air the firmament of hell might not compare as little might our earthly tempests vie with the dread storms of that infernal sky whose clouds of all metallic elements sublimd were full for when its thunder broke not all the united worlds artillery in one discharge could equal that loud stroke and though the diamond towers and battlements stood firm upon their adamantine rock yet while it vollied round the vault of hell earths solid arch was shaken with the shock and cities in one mighty ruin fell through the red sky terrific meteors scour huge stones come hailing down or sulphurshower floating amid the lurid air like snow kindles in its descent and with blue firedrops rains on all below at times the whole supernal element igniting burst in one vast sheet of flame and roard as with the sound of rushing winds above below around anon the flame was spent and overhead a heavy cloud of moving darkness spread straight to the brazen bridge and gate the selfmovd chariot bears its mortal load at sight of carmala on either side the giant guards divide and give the chariot way up yonder winding road it rolls along swift as the bittern soars on spiral wing and lo the palace of the infernal king two forms inseparable in unity hath yamen even as with hope or fear the soul regardeth him doth he appear for hope and fear at that dread hour from ominous conscience spring and err not in their bodings therefore some they who polluted with offences come behold him as the king of terrors black of aspect red of eye reflecting back upon the sinful mind heightend with vengeance and with wrath divine its own inborn deformity but to the righteous spirit how benign his awful countenance where tempering justice with parental love goodness and heavenly grace and sweetest mercy shine yet is he still himself the same one form one face one will and these his twofold aspects are but one and change is none in him for change in yamen could not be the immutable is he he sate upon a marble sepulchre massive and huge where at the monarchs feet the righteous baly had his judgementseat a golden throne before them vacant stood three human forms sustaind its ponderous weight with lifted hands outspread and shoulders bowd bending beneath their load a fourth was wanting they were of the hue of coals of fire yet were they flesh and blood and living breath they drew and their red eyeballs rolld with ghastly stare as thus for their misdeeds they stood tormented there on steps of gold those fiery statues stood who bore the golden throne a cloud behind immoveable was spread not all the light of all the flames and fires of padalon could pierce its depth of night there azyoruca veild her awful form in those eternal shadows there she sate and as the trembling souls who crowd around the judgementseat received the doom of fate her giant arms extending from the cloud drew them within the darkness moving out to grasp and bear away the innumerous rout for ever and for ever thus were seen the thousand mighty arms of that dread queen here issuing from the car the glendoveer did homage to the god then raisd his head suppliants we come he said i need not tell thee by what wrongs opprest for nought can pass on earth to thee unknown sufferers from tyranny we seek for rest and seeva bade us go to yamens throne here he hath said all wrongs shall be redrest yamen replied even now the hour draws near when fate its hidden ways will manifest not for light purpose would the wisest send his suppliants here when we in doubt and fear the awful issue of the hour attend wait ye in patience and in faith the end xxiv the amreeta so spake the king of padalon when lo the voice of lamentation ceasd in hell and sudden silence all around them fell silence more wild and terrible than all the infernal dissonance before through that portentous stillness far away unwonted sounds were heard advancing on and deepening on their way for now the inexorable hour was come and in the fullness of his power now that the dreadful rites had all been done kehama from the swerga hastened down to seize upon the throne of padalon he came in all his might and majesty with all his terrors clad and all his pride and by the attribute of deity which he had won from heaven selfmultiplied the dreadful one appeard on every side in the same indivisible point of time at the eight gates he stood at once and beat the wardengods of hell beneath his feet then in his brazen cars of triumph straight at the same moment drove through every gate by aullays hugest of created kind fiercest and fleeter than the viewless wind his cars were drawn ten yokes of ten abreast what less sufficed for such almighty weight eight bridges from the fiery flood arose growing before his way and on he goes and drives the thundering chariotwheels along at once oer all the roads of padalon silent and motionless remain the asuras on their bed of pain waiting with breathless hope the great event all hell was hushd in dread such awe that omnipresent coming spread nor had its voice been heard though all its rout innumerable had lifted up one shout nor if the infernal firmament had in one unimaginable burst spent its collected thunders had the sound been audible such louder terrors went before his forms substantial round about the presence scattered lightnings far and wide that quenchd on every side with their intensest blaze the feebler fire of padalon even as the stars go out when with prodigious light some blazing meteor fills the astonishd night the diamond city shakes the adamantine rock is loosend with the shock from its foundation movd it heaves and quakes the brazen portals crumbling fall to dust prone fall the giant guards beneath the aullays crushd on on through yamenpur their thundering feet speed from all points to yamens judgementseat and lo where multiplied behind before him and on every side wielding all weapons in his countless hands around the lord of hell kehama stands then too the lord of hell put forth his might thick darkness blacker than the blackest night rose from their wrath and veild the unutterable fight the power of fate and sacrifice prevaild and soon the strife was done then did the mangod reassume his unity absorbing into one the consubstantiate shapes and as the gloom opened fallen yamen on the ground was seen his neck beneath the conquering rajahs feet who on the marble tomb had his triumphal seat silent the manalmighty sate a smile gleamd on his dreadful lips the while dallying with power he pausd from following up his conquest as a man in social hour sips of the grateful cup again and yet again with curious taste searching its subtle flavour ere he drink even so kehama now forbore his haste having within his reach whateer he sought on his own haughty power he seemd to muse pampering his arrogant heart with silent thought before him stood the golden throne in sight right opposite he could not chuse but see nor seeing chuse but wonder who are ye who bear the golden throne tormented there he cried for whom doth destiny prepare the imperial seat and why are ye but three first statue i of the children of mankind was first me miserable who adding store to store heapt up superfluous wealth and now accurst for ever i the frantic crime deplore second statue i oer my brethren of mankind the first usurping power set up a throne sublime a king and conqueror therefore thus accurst for ever i in vain repent the crime third statue i on the children of mankind the first in gods most holy name imposd a tale of impious falsehood therefore thus accurst for ever i in vain the crime bewail even as thou here beholdest us here we have stood tormented thus such countless ages that they seem to be long as eternity and still we are but three a fourth will come to share our pain at yonder vacant corner bear his portion of the burthen and compleat the golden throne for yamens judgementseat thus hath it been appointed he must be equal in guilt to us the guilty three kehama come too long we wait for thee thereat with one accord the three took up the word like choral song come rajah mangod earths almighty lord kehama come we wait for thee too long a short and sudden laugh of wondering pride burst from him in his triumph to reply scornful he deignd not but with alterd eye wherein some doubtful meaning seemd to lie he turnd to kailyal maiden thus he cried i need not bid thee see how vain it is to strive with fates decree when hither thou hast fled to fly from me and lo even here thou findst me at thy side mine thou must be being doomd with me to share the amreetacup of immortality yea by myself i swear it hath been thus appointed joyfully join then thy hand and heart and will with mine nor at such glorious destiny repine nor in thy folly more provoke my wrath divine she answerd i have said it must not be almighty as thou art thou hast put all things underneath thy feet but still the resolute heart and virtuous will are free never oh never never can there be communion rajah between thee and me once more quoth he i urge and once alone thou seest yon golden throne where i anon shall set thee by my side take thou thy seat thereon kehamas willing bride and i will place the kingdoms of the world beneath thy fathers feet appointing him the king of mortal men else underneath that throne the fourth supporter he shall stand and groan prayers will be vain to move my mercy then again the virgin answerd i have said ladurlad caught her in his proud embrace while on his neck she hid in agony her face bring forth the amreetacup kehama cried to yamen rising sternly in his pride it is within the marble sepulchre the vanquishd lord of padalon replied bid it be opened give thy treasure up exclaimd the manalmighty to the tomb and at his voice and look the massy fabric shook and opened wide a huge anatomy was seen reclind within its marble womb give me the cup again kehama cried no other charm was needed than that voice of stern command from his repose the ghastly form arose put forth his bony and gigantic arm and gave the amreeta to the rajahs hand take drink with accents dread the spectre said for thee and kailyal hath it been assignd ye only of the children of mankind then was the manalmightys heart elate this is the consummation he exclaimd thus have i triumphed over death and fate now seeva look to thine abode henceforth on equal footing we engage alike immortal now and we will wage our warfare god to god joy filld his impious soul and to his lips he raisd the fatal bowl thus long the glendoveer had stood watching the wonders of the eventful hour amazd but undismayd for in his heart faith overcoming fear maintaind its power nor had that faith abated when the god of padalon was beaten down in fight for then he lookd to see the heavenly might of seeva break upon them but when now he saw the amreeta in kehamas hand an impulse which denied all selfcommand in that extremity stung him and he resolved to seize the cup and dare the rajahs force in seevas sight forward he sprung to tempt the unequal fray when lo the anatomy with warning arm withstood his desperate way and from the golden throne the fiery three again in one accord renewd their song kehama come we wait for thee too long o fool of drunken hope and frantic vice madman to seek for power beyond thy scope of knowledge and to deem less than omniscience could suffice to wield omnipotence o fool to dream that immortality could be the meed of evil yea thou hast it now victim of thine own wicked hearts device thou hast thine object now and now must pay the price he did not know the awful mystery of that divinest cup that as the lips which touch it even such its quality good or malignant madman and he thinks the blessed prize is won and joyfully he drinks then seeva opened on the accursed one his eye of anger upon him alone the wrathbeam fell he shudders but too late the deed is done the dreadful liquor works the will of fate immortal he would be immortal he remains but through his veins torture at once and immortality a stream of poison doth the amreeta run infinite everlasting agony and while within the burning anguish flows his outward body glows like molten ore beneath the avenging eye doomd thus to live and burn eternally the fiery three beholding him set up a fiendish cry a song of jubilee come brother come they sung too long we in our torments have expected thee come brother come henceforth we bear no more the unequal weight come brother we are four vain his almightiness for mightier pain subdued all power pain ruled supreme alone and yielding to the bony hand the unemptied cup he movd toward the throne and at the vacant corner took his stand behold the golden throne at length compleat and yamen silently ascends the judgementseat for two alone of all mankind to me the amreetacup was given then said the anatomy the man hath drank the womans turn is next come kailyal come receive thy doom and do the will of heaven wonder and fear and awe at once perplext the mortal maidens heart but over all hope rose triumphant with a trembling hand obedient to his call she took the fated cup and lifting up her eyes where holy tears began to swell is it not your command ye heavenly powers as on her knees she fell the pious virgin cried ye know my innocent will my heart sincere ye govern all things still and wherefore should i fear she said and drank the eye of mercy beamd upon the maid a cloud of fragrance steamd like incensesmoke as all her mortal frame dissolved beneath the potent agency of that mysterious draught such quality from her pure touch the fated cup partook like one entranced she knelt feeling her body melt till all but what was heavenly past away yet still she felt her spirit strong within her the same heart with the same loves and all her heavenly part unchanged and ripend to such perfect state in this miraculous birth as here on earth dimly our holiest hopes anticipate mine mine with rapturous joy ereenia cried immortal now and yet not more divine mine mine for ever mine the immortal maid replied for ever ever thine then yamen said o thou to whom by fate alone of all mankind this lot is given daughter of earth but now the child of heaven go with thy heavenly mate partaker now of his immortal bliss go to the swerga bowers and there recall the hours of endless happiness but that sweet angel for she still retaind her human loves and human piety as if reluctant at the gods commands lingerd with anxious eye upon her father fixd and spread her hands toward him wistfully go yamen cried nor cast that look behind upon ladurlad at this parting hour for thou shalt find him in thy mothers bower the car as carmala his word obeyd movd on and bore away the maid while from the golden throne the lord of death with love benignant on ladurlad smild and gently on his head his blessing laid as sweetly as a child whom neither thought disturbs nor care encumbers tird with long play at close of summer day lies down and slumbers even thus as sweet a boon of sleep partaking by yamen blest ladurlad sunk to rest blessed that sleep more blessed was the waking for on that night a heavenly morning broke the light of heaven was round him when he woke and in the swerga in yedillians bower all whom he lovd he met to part no more the end notes the banian treexiii p the burghut or banian often measures from twentyfour to thirty feet in girth it is distinguished from every other tree hitherto known by the very peculiar circumstance of throwing out roots from all its branches these being pendant and perfectly lax in time reach the ground which they penetrate and ultimately become substantial props to the very massy horizontal boughs which but for such a support must either be stopt in their growth or give way from their own weight many of these quondam roots changing their outward appearance from a brown rough rind to a regular bark not unlike that of the beech increase to a great diameter they may be often seen from four to five feet in

different the first is the eray which is formed by throwing a mound or bank across a valley or hollow ground so that the rain water collects in the upper part of the valley and is let out on the lower part by sluices for the purposes of cultivation the other kind is the culam which is formed by digging out the earth and is destined for supplying the inhabitants with water for domestic purposes the culams are very frequently lined on all the four sides with cut stone and are the most elegant works of the nativesbuchanan where there are no springs or rivers to furnish them with water as it is in the northern parts where there are but two or three springs they supply this defect by saving of rain water which they do by casting up great banks in convenient places to stop and contain the rains that fall and so save it till they have occasion to let it out into the fields they are made rounding like a c or halfmoon every town has one of these ponds which if they can get but filled with water they count their corn is as good as in the barn it was no small work to the ancient inhabitants to make all these banks of which there is a great number being some two some three fathoms in height and in length some above a mile some less not all of a size they are now grown over with great trees and so seem natural hills when they would use the water they cut a gap in one end of the bank and so draw the water by little and little as they have occasion for the watering their corn these ponds in dry weather dry up quite if they should dig these ponds deep it would not be so convenient for them it would indeed contain the water well but would not so well nor in such plenty empty out itself into their grounds in these ponds are alligators which when the water is dried up depart into the woods and down to the rivers and in the time of rains come up again into the ponds they are but small nor do use to catch people nevertheless they stand in some fear of them the corn they sow in these parts is of that sort that is soonest ripe fearing lest their waters should fail as the water dries out of these ponds they make use of them for fields treading the mud with buffaloes and then sowing rice thereon and frequently casting up water with scoops on itknox p the lotusxiii p the lotus abounds in the numerous lakes and ponds of the province of garah and we had the pleasure of comparing several varieties single and full white and tinged with deep or with faint tints of red to a near view the simple elegance of the white lotus gains no accession of beauty from the multiplication of its petals

every art to delude and to delight and to the fascination of external beauty their artful betrayers added the attractions arising from mental accomplishments thus was an invariable rule of the hindoos that women have no concern with literature dispensed with upon this infamous occasion the moment these hapless victims reached maturity they fell victims to the lust of the brahmins they were early taught to practise the most alluring blandishments to roll the expressive eye of wanton pleasure and to invite to criminal indulgence by stealing upon the beholder the tender look of voluptuous languishing they were instructed to mould their elegant and airy forms into the most enticing attitudes and the most lascivious gestures while the rapid and graceful motion of their feet adorned with golden bells and glittering with jewels kept unison with the exquisite melody of their voices every pagoda has a band of these young syrens whose business on great festivals is to dance in public before the idol to sing hymns in his honour and in private to enrich the treasury of that pagoda with the wages of prostitution these women are not however regarded in a dishonourable light they are considered as wedded to the idol and they partake of the veneration paid to him they are forbidden even to desert the pagoda where they are educated and are never permitted to marry but the offspring

him for three paces of land to build a hut baly ridiculed the apparent imbecility of the dwarf in telling him that he ought not to limit his demand to a bequest so trifling that his generosity could bestow a much larger donation of land vamen answered that being of so small a stature what he asked was more than sufficient the prince immediately granted his request and to ratify his donation poured water into his right hand which was no sooner done than the dwarf grew so prodigiously that his body filled the universe he measured the earth with one pace and the heavens with another and then summoned baly to give him his word for the third the prince then recognised vichenou adored him and presented his head to him but the god satisfied with his submission sent him to govern the

ruins of malâbalipûr the city of the great baly a rock or rather hill of stone is that which first engrosses the attention on approaching the place for as it rises abruptly out of a level plain of great extent consists chiefly of one single stone and is situated very near to the seabeach it is such a kind of object as an inquisitive traveller would naturally turn aside to examine its shape is also singular and romantic and from a distant view has an appearance like some antique and lofty edifice on coming near to the foot of the rock from the north works of imagery and sculpture crowd so thick upon the eye as might seem to favour the idea of a petrified town like those that have been fabled in different parts of the world by too credulous travellers proceeding on by the foot of the hill on the side facing the sea there is a pagoda rising out of the ground of one solid stone about sixteen or eighteen feet high which seems to have been cut upon the spot out of a detached rock that has been found of a proper size for that purpose the top is arched and the style of architecture according to which it is formed different from any now used in those parts a little further on there appears upon a huge surface of stone that juts out a little from the side of the hill a numerous group of human figures in bassrelief considerably larger than life representing the most remarkable persons whose actions are celebrated in the nahâbharit each of them in an attitude or with weapons or other insignia expressive of his character or of some one of his most famous exploits all these figures are doubtless much less distinct than they were at first for upon comparing these and the rest of the sculptures that are exposed to the seaair with others at the same place whose situation has afforded them protection from that element the difference is striking the former being every where much defaced while the others are fresh as recently finished an excavation in another part of the east side of the great rock appears to have been made on the same plan and for the same purpose that chowltries are usually built in that country that is to say for the accommodation of travellers the rock is hollowed out to the size of a spacious room and two or three rows of pillars are left as a seeming support to the mountainous mass of stone which forms the roof the ascent of the hill on the north is from its natural shape gradual and easy at first and is in other parts rendered more so by very excellent steps cut out in several places where the communication would be difficult or impracticable without them a winding stair of this sort leads to a kind of temple cut out of the solid rock with some figures of idols in high relief upon the walls very well finished from this temple there are flights of steps that seem to have led to some edifice formerly standing upon the hill nor does it seem absurd to suppose that this may have been a palace to which this temple may have appertained for besides the small detached range of stairs that are here and there cut in the rock and seem as if they had once led to different parts of one great building there appear in many places small water channels cut also in the rock as if for drains to an house and the whole top of the hill is strewed with small round pieces of brick which may be supposed from their appearance to have been worn down to their present form during the lapse of many ages on a plain surface of the rock which may once have served as the floor of some apartment there is a platform of stone about or feet long by or wide in a situation rather elevated with two or three steps leading up to it perfectly resembling a couch or bed and a lion very well executed at the upper end of it by way of pillow the whole of one piece being part of the hill itself this the bramins inhabitants of the place call the bed of dhermarâjah or judishter the eldest of the five brothers whose exploits are the leading subject in the mahabhârit and at a considerable distance from this at such a distance indeed as the apartments of the women might be supposed to be from that of the men is a bath excavated also from the rock with steps in the inside which the bramins call the bath of dropedy the wife of judishter and his brothers how much credit is due to this tradition and whether this stone couch may not have been anciently used as a kind of throne rather than a bed is matter for future enquiry a circumstance however which may seem to favour this idea is that a throne in the shanscrit and other hindoo languages is called singhâsen which is compounded of sing a lion and ásen a seat but though these works may be deemed stupendous they are surpassed by others that are to be seen at the distance of about a mile or mile and half to the south of the hill they consist of two pagodas of about feet long by feet wide and about as many in height cut out of the solid rock and each consisting originally of one single stone their form is different from the style of architecture according to which idol temples are now built in that country these sculptures approach nearer to the gothic taste being surmounted by arched roofs or domes not semicircular but composed of two segments of circles meeting in a point at top near these also stand an elephant full as big as life and a lion much larger than the natural size both hewn also out of one stone the great rock is about or yards from the sea but close to the sea are the remains of a pagoda built of brick and dedicated to sîb the greatest part of which has evidently been swallowed up by that element for the door of the innermost apartment in which the idol is placed and before which there are always two or three spacious courts surrounded with walls is now washed by the waves and the pillar used to discover the meridian at the time of founding the pagoda is seen standing at some distance in the sea in the neighbourhood of this building there are some detached rocks washed also by the waves on which there appear sculptures though now much worn and defaced and the natives of the place declared to the writer of this account that the more aged people among them remembered to have seen the tops of several pagodas far out in the sea which being covered with copper probably gilt were particularly visible at sunrise as their shining surface used then to reflect the suns rays but that now that effect was no longer produced as the copper had since become incrusted with mould and verdigreasechambers asiatic researches thou hast been

contempt of his pigmy form dashed him with his spray as he passed along on which the sage greatly incensed at the designed affront scooped up some of the water in the hollow of his hand and drank it off he again and again repeated the draught nor desisted till he had drained the bed of the ocean of the entire volume of its waters alarmed at this effect of his holy indignation and dreading an universal drought the devatas made intercession with agastya to relent from his anger and again restore an element so necessary to the existence of nature both animate and inanimate agastya pacified

p there is a bird that falls down out of the air dead and is found sometimes in the molucco islands that has no feet at all the bigness of her body and bill as likewise the form of them is much the same as a swallows but the spreading out of her wings and tail has no less compass than an eagles she lives and breeds in the air comes not near the earth but for her burial for the largeness and lightness of her wings and tail sustain her without lassitude and the laying of her eggs and breeding of her young is upon the back of the male which is made hollow as also the breast of the female for the more easy incubation also two strings like two shoemakers ends come from the hinder parts of the male wherewith it is conceived that he is fastened closer to the female while she hatches her eggs on the hollow of his back the dew of heaven is appointed her for food her region being too far removed from the approach of flies and such like insects this is the entire story and philosophy of this miraculous bird in cardan who professes himself to have seen it no less than thrice and to have described it accordingly the contrivances whereof if the matter were certainly true are as evident arguments of a divine providence as that copperring with the greek inscription upon it was an undeniable monument of the artifice and finger of man but that the reproach of overmuch credulity may not lie upon cardan alone scaliger who lay at catch with him to take him tripping wherever he could cavils not with any thing in the whole narration but the bigness of wings and the littleness of the body which he undertakes to correct from one of his own which was sent him by orvesanus from java nay he confirms what his antagonist has wrote partly by history and partly by reason affirming that himself in his own garden found two little birds with membranaceous wings utterly devoid of legs their form was near to that of a bats nor is he deterred from the belief of the perpetual flying of the manucodiata by the gaping of the feathers of her wings which seem thereby less fit to sustain her body but further makes the narration probable by what he has observed in kites hovering in the air as he saith for a whole hour together without flapping of her wings or changing place and he has found also how she may sleep in the air from the example of fishes which he has seen sleeping in the water without sinking themselves to the bottom and without changing place but lying stock still pinnulis tantum nescia quid motiuncule meditantes only wagging a little their fins as heedlessly and unconcernedly as horses while they are asleep wag their ears to displace the flies that sit upon them wherever scaliger admitting that the menucodiata is perpetually on the wing in the air he must of necessity admit also that manner of incubation that cardan describes else how could their generations continue franciscus hernandeo affirms the same with cardan expressly in every thing as also eusebius nierembergius who is so taken with the story of this bird that he could not abstain from celebrating her miraculous properties in a short but elegant copy of verses and does after though confidently opposed assert the main matter again in prose such are the sufferages of cardan scaliger hernandeo nierembergius but aldrovandus rejects that fable of her feeding on the dew of heaven and of her incubiture on the back of the male with much scorn and indignation and as for the former his reasons are no ways contemptible he alledging that dew is a body not perfectly enough mixed or heterogenial enough for food nor the hard bill of the bird made for such easie uses as sipping this soft moisture to which i know not what cardan and the rest would answer unless this that they mean by dew the more unctuous moisture of the air which as it may not be alike every where so these birds may be fitted with a natural sagacity to find it out where it is that there is dew in this sense day and night as well as in the morning and in all seasons of the year and therefore a constant supply of moisture and spirits to their perpetual flying which they more copiously imbibe by reason of their exercise that the thicker parts of this moisture stick and convert into flesh and that the lightness of their feathers is so great that their pains in sustaining themselves are not overmuch that what is homogeneal and simple to our sight is fit enough to be the rudiments of generation all animals being generated of a kind of clear crystalline liquor and that therefore it may be also of nutrition that orpine and seahouseleek are nourished and grow being hung in the air and that dockweed has its root no deeper than near the upper parts of the water and lastly that the bills of these birds are for their better flying by cutting the way and for better ornament for the rectifying also and composing of their feathers while they swim in the air with as much ease as swans do in river to his great impatiency against their manner of incubation they would happily return this answer that the way is not ridiculous but it may be rather necessary from what aldrovandus himself not only acknowledges but contends for namely that they have no feet at all for hence it is manifest that they can not light upon the ground nor any where rest on their bellies and be able to get on wing again because they can not creep out of holes of rocks as swifts and such like shortfooted birds can they having no feet at all to creep with besides as aristotle well argues concerning the long legs of certain waterfowl that they were made so long because they were to wade in the water and catch fish adding that excellent aphorism τὰ γαρ ὄργανα πρὸς τὸ ἔργον ἡ φύσις ποιεῖ ἀλλ᾽ ὐ τὸ ἔργον πρὸς τὰ ὄργανα so may we rationally conclude will they say that as the long legs of these waterfowl imply a design of their haunting the water so want of legs in these manucodiatas argue they are never to come down to the earth because they can neither stand there nor get off again and if they never come on the earth or any other restingplace where can their eggs be laid or hatched but on the back of the male besides that cardan pleases himself with that antiphonie in nature that as the ostrich being a bird yet never flies in the air and never rests upon the earth and as for aldrovandus his presumption from the five several manucodiatas that he had seen and in which he could observe no such figuration of parts as implied a fitness for such a manner of incubation cardan will answer myself has seen three and scaliger one who both agree against you however you see that both cardan aldrovandus and the rest do jointly agree in allowing the manucodiata no feet as also in furnishing her with two strings hanging at the hinder parts of her body which aldrovandus will have to be in the female as well as in the male though cardans experience reacheth not so far but pighafetta and clusius will easily end this grand controversy betwixt cardan and aldrovandus if it be true which they report and if they speak of the same kind of birds of paradise for they both affirm that they have feet a palm long and that with all confidence imaginable but nierembergius on the contrary affirms that one that was an eye witness and that had taken up one of these birds newly dead told him that it had no feet at all johnston also gives his suffrage with nierembergius in this though with aldrovandus he rejects the manner of their incubation but unless they can raise themselves from the ground by the stiffness of some of the feathers of their wings or rather by virtue of those nervous strings which they may have a power to stiffen when they are alive by transfusing spirits into them and making them serve as well instead of legs to raise them from the ground as to hang upon the boughs of trees by a slight thing being able to raise or hold up their lightfeathered bodies in the air as a small twig will us in the water i should rather incline to the testimony of pighafetta and clusius than to the judgment of the rest and believe those mariners that told him that the legs are pulled off by them that take them and extenterate them and dry them in the sun for either their private use or sale which conclusion would the best solve the credit of aristotle who long since has so peremptorily pronounced ὄτι πτηνὸν μόνον ὐδὲν ἐσιν ὥσπερ νευσικὸν μόνον ἐσιν ὶχθὸς that there is not any bird that only flies as the fish only swims but thus our bird of paradise is quite flown and vanished into a figment or fable but if any one will condole the loss of so convincing an argument for a providence that fits one thing to another i must take the freedom to tell him that unless he be a greater admirer of novelty than a searcher into the indissoluble consequences of things i shall supply his meditation with what of this nature is as strongly conclusive and remind that it will be his own reproach if he can not spy as clear an inference from an ordinary truth as from either an uncertainty or a fiction and in this regard the bringing this doubtful narration into play may not justly seem to no purpose it carrying so serious and castigatory a piece of pleasantry with it the manucodiatas living on the dew is no part of the convictiveness of a providence in this story but the being excellently well provided of wings and feathers tanta levitatis supellectile exornata as nierembergius speaks being so well furnished with all advantages for lightness that it seems harder for her to sink down as he conceits than to be borne up in the air that a bird thus fitted for that region should have no legs to stand on the earth this would be a considerable indication of a discriminating providence that on purpose avoids all uselessness and superfluities the other remarkable and it is a notorious one is the cavity on the back of the male and in the breast of the female for incubation and the third and last the use of those strings as cardan supposes for the better keeping them together in incubiture if these considerations of this strange story strike so strongly upon thee as to convince thee of a providence think it humour and not judgment if what i put in lieu of them and is but ordinary have not the same force with thee for is not the fishs wanting feet as we observed before she being sufficiently supplied with fins in so thick an element as the water as great an argument for a providence as so light a birds wanting feet in that thinner element of the air the extream lightness of her furniture being appropriated to the thinness of that element and is not the same providence seen and that as conspicuously in allotting but very short legs to those birds that are called apodeo both in plinie and aristotle upon whom she has bestowed such large and strong wings and a power of flying so long and swift as in giving no legs at all to the manucodiata who has still a greater power of wing and lightness of body and as for the cavities on the back of the male and in the breast of the female is that design of nature any more certain and plain than in the genital parts of the male and female in all kinds of animals what greater argument of counsel and purpose of fitting one thing for another can there be than that and if we should make a more inward search into the contrivances of these parts in an ordinary hen and consider how or by what force an egg of so great a growth and bigness is transmitted from the ovarium through the infundibulum into the processus of the uterus the membranes being go thin and the passage so very small to see to the principle of that motion can not be thought less than divine and if you would compare the protuberant paps of teats in the females of beasts with that cavity in the breast of the shemanucodiata whether of them think you is the plainer pledge of a knowing and a designing providence and lastly for the strings that are conceived to hold together the male and female in their incubiture what a toy is it if compared with those invisible links and ties that engage ordinary birds to sit upon their eggs they having no visible allurement to such a tedious servicehenry mores antidote against atheism book ch and bramas region where the heavenly hours weave the vast circle of his agelong

famous penitent morrugandumagarexi by name had during a long series of years served the gods with uncommon and most exemplary piety this very virtuous man having no children was extremely desirous of having one and therefore daily besought the god xiven or seeva to grant him one at length the god heard his desire but before he indulged it him he asked him whether he would have several children who should be longlived and wicked or one virtuous and prudent who should die in his sixteenth year the penitent chose the latter his wife conceived and was happily delivered of the promised son whom they named marcandem the boy like his father zealously devoted himself to the worship of xiven but as soon as he had attained his sixteenth year the officers of yhamen god of death were sent on the earth to remove him from thence young marcandem being informed on what errand they were come told them with a resolute air that he was resolved not to die and that they might go back if they pleased they returned to their master and told him the whole affair yhamen immediately mounted his great buffle and set out being come he told the youth that he acted very rashly in refusing to leave the world and it was unjust in him for xiven had promised him a life only of sixteen years and the term was expired but this reason did not satisfy marcandem who persisted in his resolution not to die and fearing lest the god of death should attempt to take him away by force he ran to his oratory and taking the lingam clasped it to his breast mean time yhamen came down from his buffle threw a rope about the youths neck and held him fast therewith as also the lingam which marcandem grasped with all his strength and was going to drag them both into hell when xiven issued out of the lingam drove back the king of the dead and gave him so furious a blow that he killed him on the spot the god of death being thus slain mankind multiplied so that the earth was no longer able to contain them the gods represented this to xiven and he at their entreaty restored yhamen to life and to all the power he had before enjoyed yhamen immediately dispatched a herald to all parts of the world to summon all the old men the herald got drunk before he set out and without staying till the fumes of the wine were dispelled mounted an elephant and rode up and down the world pursuant to his commission and instead of publishing this order he declared that it was the will and pleasure of yamen that from this day forward all the leaves fruits and flowers whether ripe or green should fall to the ground this

history of this liquor which was produced by churning the sea with a mountain there is a fair and stately mountain and its name is meroo a most exalted mass of glory reflecting the sunny rays from the splendid surface of its gilded horns it is clothed in gold and is the respected haunt of dews and gandharvas it is inconceivable and not to be encompassed by sinful man and it is guarded by dreadful serpents many celestial medicinal plants adorn its sides and it stands piercing the heaven with its aspiring summit a mighty hill inaccessible even by the human mind it is adorned with trees and pleasant streams and resoundeth with the delightful songs of various birds the soors and all the glorious hosts of heaven having ascended to the summit of this lofty mountain sparkling with precious gems and for eternal ages raised were sitting in solemn synod meditating the discovery of the amreeta the water of immortality the dew narayan being also there spoke unto brahma whilst the soors were thus consulting together and said let the ocean as a pot of milk be churned by the united labour of the soors and asoors and when the mighty waters have been stirred up the amreeta shall be found let them collect together every medicinal herb and every precious thing and let them stir the ocean and they shall discover the amreeta there is also another mighty mountain whose name is mandar and its rocky summits are like towering clouds it is clothed in a net of the entangled tendrils of the twining creeper and resoundeth with the harmony of various birds innumerable savage beasts infest its borders and it is the respected haunt of kennars dews and apsars it standeth eleven thousand yojan above the earth and eleven thousand more below its surface as the united bands of dews were unable to remove this mountain they went before veeshnoo who was sitting with brahma and addressed them in these words exert o masters your most superior wisdom to remove the mountain mandar and employ your utmost power for our good veeshnoo and brahma having said it shall be according to your wish he with the lotus eye directed the king of serpents to appear and ananta arose and was instructed in that work by brahma and commanded by narayan to perform it then ananta by his power took up that king of mountains together with all its forests and every inhabitant thereof and the soors accompanied him into the presence of the ocean whom they addressed saying we will stir up thy waters to obtain the amreeta and the lord of the waters replied let me also have a share seeing i am to bear the violent agitation that will be caused by the whirling of the mountain then the soors and asoors spoke unto koornaraj the king of the tortoises upon the strand of the ocean and said my lord is able to be the supporter of this mountain the tortoise replied be it so and it was placed upon his back so the mountain being set upon the back of the tortoise eendra began to whirl it about as it were a machine the mountain mandar served as a churn and the serpent vasoakee for the rope and thus in former days did the dews and asoors and the danoos begin to stir up the waters of the ocean for the discovery of the amreeta the mighty asoors were employed on the side of the serpents head whilst all the soors assembled about his tail ananta that sovereign dew stood near narayan they now pull forth the serpents head repeatedly and as often let it go whilst there issued from his mouth thus violently drawing to and fro by the soors and asoors a continual stream of fire and smoke and wind which ascending in thick clouds replete with lightning it began to rain down upon the heavenly bands who were already fatigued with their labour whilst a shower of flowers was shaken from the top of the mountain covering the heads of all both soors and asoors in the mean time the roaring of the ocean whilst violently agitated with the whirling of the mountain mandar by the soors and asoors was like the bellowing of a mighty cloud thousands of the various productions of the waters were torn to pieces by the mountain and confounded with the briny flood and every specific being of the deep and all the inhabitants of the great abyss which is below the earth were annihilated whilst from the violent agitation of the mountain the forest trees were dashed against each other and precipitated from its utmost height with all the birds thereon from whose violent confrication a raging fire was produced involving the whole mountain with smoke and flame as with a darkblue cloud and the lightnings vivid flash the lion and the retreating elephant are overtaken by the devouring flames and every vital being and every specific thing are consumed in the general conflagration the raging flames thus spreading destruction on all sides were at length quenched by a shower of cloudborne water poured down by the immortal eendra and now a heterogeneous stream of the concocted juices of various trees and plants ran down into the briny flood it was from this milklike stream of juices produced from those trees and plants and a mixture of melted gold that the soors obtained their immortality the waters of the ocean now being assimilated with those juices were converted into milk and from that milk a kind of butter was presently produced when the heavenly bands went again into the presence of brahma the granter of boons and addressed him saying except narayan every other soor and asoor is fatigued with his labour and still the amreeta doth not appear wherefore the churning of the ocean is at a stand then brahma said unto narayan endue them with recruited strength for thou art their support and narayan answered and said i will give fresh vigour to such as cooperate in the work let mandar be whirled about and the bed of the ocean be kept steady when they heard the words of narayan they all returned again to the work and began to stir about with great force that butter of the ocean when there presently arose from out the troubled deep first the moon with a pleasing countenance shining with ten thousand beams of gentle light next followed sree the goddess of fortune whose seat is the white lily of the waters then sooradevee the goddess of wine and the white horse called oochisrava and after these there was produced from the unctuous mass the jewel kowstoobh that glorious sparkling gem worn by narayan on his breast also pareejat the tree of plenty and soorabhee the cow that granted every hearts desire the moon sooradevee the goddess of sree and the horse as swift as thought instantly marched away towards the dews keeping in the path of the sun then the dew dhanwantaree in human shape came forth holding in his hand a white vessel filled with the immortal juice amreeta when the asoors beheld these wondrous things appear they raised their tumultuous voices for the amreeta and each of them clamorously exclaimed this of right is mine in the mean time travat a mighty elephant arose now kept by the god of thunder and as they continued to churn the ocean more than enough that deadly poison issued from its bed burning like a raging fire whose dreadful fumes in a moment spread throughout the world confounding the three regions of the universe with the mortal stench until seev at the word of brahma swallowed the fatal drug to save mankind which remaining in the throat of that sovereign dew of magic form from that time he hath been called neelkant because his throat was stained blue when the asoors beheld this miraculous deed they became desperate and the amreeta and the goddess sree became the source of endless hatred then narayan assumed the character and person of moheenee maya the power of enchantment in a female form of wonderful beauty and stood before the asoors whose minds being fascinated by her presence and deprived of reason they seized the amreeta and gave it unto her the asoors now clothe themselves in costly armour and seizing their various weapons rush on together to attack the soors in the mean time narayan in the female form having obtained the amreeta from the hands of their leader the hosts of soors during the tumult and confusion of the asoors drank of the living water and it so fell out that whilst the soors were quenching their thirst for immortality rahoo an asoor assumed the form of a soor and began to drink also and the water had but reached his throat when the sun and moon in friendship to the soors discovered the deceit and instantly narayan cut off his head as he was drinking with his splendid weapon chakra and the gigantic head of the asoor emblem of a mountains summit being thus separated from his body by the chakras edge bounded into the heavens with a dreadful cry whilst his ponderous trunk fell cleaving the ground asunder and shaking the whole earth unto its foundation with all its islands rocks and forests and from that time the head of rahoo resolved an eternal enmity and continueth even unto this day at times to seize upon the sun and moon now narayan having quitted the female figure he had assumed began to disturb the asoors with sundry celestial weapons and from that instant a dreadful battle was commenced on the oceans briny strand between the asoors and the soors innumerable sharp and missile weapons were hurled and thousands of piercing darts and battleaxes fell on all sides the asoors vomit blood from the wounds of the chakra and fall upon the ground pierced by the sword the spear and spiked club heads glittering with polished gold divided by the pattees blade drop incessantly and mangled bodies wallowing in their gore lay like fragments of mighty rocks sparkling with gems and precious ores millions of sighs and groans arise on every side and the sun is overcast with blood as they clash their arms and wound each other with their dreadful instruments of destruction now the battle is fought with the ironspiked club and as they close with clenched fist and the din of war ascendeth to the heavens they cry pursue strike fell to the ground so that a horrid and tumultuous noise is heard on all sides in the midst of this dreadful hurry and confusion of the fight nar and narayan entered the field together narayan beholding a celestial bow in the hand of nar it reminded him of his chakra the destroyer of the asoors the faithful weapon by name soodarsan ready at the minds call flew down from heaven with direct and refulgent speed beautiful yet terrible to behold and being arrived glowing like the sacrificial flame and spreading terror around narayan with his right arm formed like the elephantine trunk hurled forth the ponderous orb the speedy messenger and glorious ruin of hostile towns who raging like the final alldestroying fire shot bounding with desolating force killing thousands of the asoors in his rapid flight burning and involving like the lambent flame and cutting down all that would oppose him anon he climbeth the heavens and now again darteth into the field like a peesach to feast in blood now the dauntless asoors strive with repeated strength to crush the soors with rocks and mountains which hurled in vast numbers into the heavens appeared like scattered clouds and fell with all the trees thereon in millions of fearexciting torrents striking violently against each other with a mighty noise and in their fall the earth with all its fields and forests is driven from its foundation they thunder furiously at each other as they roll along the field and spend their strength in mutual conflict now nar seeing the soors overwhelmed with fear filled up the path to heaven with showers of goldenheaded arrows and split the mountain summits with his unerring shafts and the asoors finding themselves again sore pressed by the soors precipitately flee some rush headlong into the briny waters of the ocean and others hide themselves within the bowels of the earth the rage of the glorious chakra soodarsan which for a while burnt like the oilfed fire now grew cool and he retired into the heavens from whence he came and the soors having obtained the victory the mountain mandar was carried back to its former station with great respect whilst the waters also retired filling the firmament and the heavens with their dreadful roarings the soors guarded the amreeta with great care and rejoiced exceedingly because of their success and eendra with all his immortal bands gave the water of life into narayan to keep it for their usemahabharat amrita or immortal is according to sir william jones the name which the mythologists of tibet apply to a celestial tree bearing ambrosial fruit and adjoining to four vast rocks from which as many sacred rivers derive their several streams end of volume
