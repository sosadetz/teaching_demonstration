boughs seemd holy things as records of their vows but change came oer the scene a hurrying tread broke on the whispery shades imelda knew the footstep of her brothers wrath and fled up where the cedars make yon avenue dim with green twilight pausing there she caught– was it the clash of swords–a swift dark thought struck down her lips rich crimson as it passd and from her eye the sunny sparkle took one moment with its fearfulness and shook her slight frame fiercely as a stormy blast might rock the rose once more and yet once more she stilld her heart to listen–all was oer sweet summer winds alone were heard to sigh bearing the nightingales deep spirit by page that night imeldas voice was in the song lovely it floated thro the festive throng peopling her fathers halls that fatal night her eye lookd starry in its dazzling light and her cheek glowd with beautys flushing dyes like a rich cloud of eve in southern skies a burning ruby cloud there were whose gaze followd her form beneath the clear lamps blaze and marvelld at its radiance but a few beheld the brightness of that feverish hue with something of dim fear and in that glance found strange and sudden tokens of unrest startling to meet amidst the mazy dance where thought if present an unbidden guest comes not unmaskd howeer this were the time sped as it speeds with joy and grief and crime alike and when the banquets hall was left unto its garlands of their bloom bereft when trembling stars lookd silvery in their wane and heavy flowers yet slumberd once again page there stole a footstep fleet and light and lone thro the dim cedar shade the step of one that started at a leaf of one that fled of one that panted with some secret dread– what did imelda there she sought the scene where love so late with youth and hope had been bodings were on her soul–a shuddering thrill ran thro each vein when first the naiads rill met her with melody–sweet sounds and low we hear them yet–they live along its flow– her voice is music lost the fountainside she gaind–the wave flashd forth–twas darkly dyed evn as from warriorhearts and on its edge amidst the fern and flowers and mosstufts deep there lay as lulld by stream and rustling sedge a youth a graceful youth oh dost thou sleep azzo she cried my azzo is this rest –but then her low tones falterd–on thy breast page is the stain–yes tis blood–and that cold cheek– that moveless lip–thou dost not slumber–speak speak azzo my belovd–no sound–no breath– what hath come thus between our spirits–death death–i but dream–i dream–and there she stood a faint frail trembler gazing first on blood with her fair arm around yon cypress thrown her form sustaind by that dark stem alone and fading fast like spellstruck maid of old into white waves dissolving clear and cold when from the grass her dimmd eye caught a gleam– twas where a sword lay shiverd by the stream– her brothers sword–she knew it and she knew twas with a venomd point that weapon slew wo for young love but love is strong there came strength upon womans fragile heart and frame page there came swift courage on the dewy ground she knelt with all her dark hair floating round like a long silken stole she knelt and pressd her lips of glowing life to azzos breast drawing the poison forth a strange sad sight pale death and fearless love and solemn night– so the moon saw them last the morn came singing thro the green forests of the appenines with all her joyous birds their free flight winging and steps and voices out amongst the vines what found that dayspring here two fair forms laid like sculptured sleepers from the myrtle shade casting a gleam of beauty oer the wave still mournful sweet were such things for the grave could it be so indeed that radiant girl deckd as for bridal hours–long braids of pearl page amidst her shadowy locks were faintly shining as tears might shine with melancholy light and there was gold her slender waist entwining and her pale graceful arms–how sadly bright and fiery gems upon her breast were lying and round her marble brow red roses dying– but she died first–the violets hue had spread oer her sweet eyelids with repose oppressd she had bowd heavily her gentle head and on the youths hushd bosom sunk to rest so slept they well–the poisons work was done love with true heart had striven–but death had won page edith a tale of the woods du heilige rufe dein kind zurück ich habe genossen das irdische glück ich habe gelebt und geliebet wallenstein the woods–oh solemn are the boundless woods of the great western world when day declines and louder sounds the roll of distant floods more deep the rustling of the ancient pines when dimness gathers on the stilly air and mystery seems oer every leaf to brood awful it is for human heart to bear the might and burden of the solitude page yet in that hour midst those green wastes there sate one young and fair–and oh how desolate but undismayd while sank the crimson light and the high cedars darkend with the night alone she sate tho many lay around they pale and silent on the bloody ground were severd from her need and from her wo far as death severs life oer that wild spot combat had ragd and brought the valiant low and left them with the history of their lot unto the forest oaks a fearful scene for her whose home of other days had been midst the fair halls of england but the love which filld her soul was strong to cast out fear and by its might upborne all else above she shrank not–markd not that the dead were near page of him alone she thought whose languid head faintly upon her wedded bosom fell memory of aught but him on earth was fled while heavily she felt his lifeblood well fast oer her garments forth and vainly bound with her torn robe and hair the streaming wound yet hoped still hoped–oh from such hope how long affection wooes the whispers that deceive evn when the pressure of dismay grows strong and we that weep watch tremble neer believe the blow indeed can fall so bowd she there over the dying while unconscious prayer filld all her soul now pourd the moonlight down veining the pinestems thro the foliage brown and fireflies kindling up the leafy place cast fitful radiance oer the warriors face whereby she caught its changes to her eye the eye that faded lookd through gathering haze whence love oermastering mortal agony lifted a long deep melancholy gaze page when voice was not that fond sad meaning passd– she knew the fulness of her wo at last one shriek the forests heard–and mute she lay and cold yet clasping still the precious clay to her scarceheaving breast o love and death ye have sad meetings on this changeful earth many and sad but airs of heavenly breath shall melt the links which bind you for your birth is far apart now light of richer hue than the moon sheds came flushing mist and dew the pines grew red with morning fresh winds playd brightcolourd birds with splendour crossd the shade flitting on flowerlike wings glad murmurs broke from reed and spray and leaf the living strings of earths eolian lyre whose music woke into young life and joy all happy things and she too woke from that long dreamless trance the widowd edith fearfully her glance page fell as in doubt on faces dark and strange and dusky forms a sudden sense of change flashd oer her spirit evn ere memory swept the tide of anguish back with thoughts that slept yet half instinctively she rose and spread her arms as twere for something lost or fled then faintly sank again the forestbough with all its whispers wavd not oer her now– where was she midst the people of the wild by the red hunters fire an aged chief whose home lookd sad–for therein playd no child– had borne her in the stillness of her grief to that lone cabin of the woods and there won by a form so desolately fair or touchd with thoughts from some past sorrow sprung oer her low couch an indian matron hung while in grave silence yet with earnest eye the ancient warrior of the waste stood by page bending in watchfulness his proud grey head and leaning on his bow and life returnd life but with all its memories of the dead to ediths heart and well the sufferer learnd her task of meek endurance well she wore the chastend grief that humbly can adore midst blinding tears but unto that old pair evn as a breath of springs awakening air her presence was or as a sweet wild tune bringing back tender thoughts which all too soon depart with childhood sadly they had seen a daughter to the land of spirits go and ever from that time her fading mien and voice like winds of summer soft and low had haunted their dim years but ediths face now lookd in holy sweetness from her place and they again seemd parents oh the joy the rich deep blessedness–tho earths alloy page fear that still bodes be there–of pouring forth the hearts whole power of love its wealth and worth of strong affection in one healthful flow on something all its own–that kindly glow which to shut inward is consuming pain gives the glad soul its flowering time again when like the sunshine freed–and gentle cares th adopted edith meekly gave for theirs who lovd her thus her spirit dwelt the while with the departed and her patient smile spoke of farewells to earth–yet still she prayd evn oer her soldiers lowly grave for aid one purpose to fulfil to leave one trace brightly recording that her dwellingplace had been among the wilds for well she knew the secret whisper of her bosom true which warnd her hence page and now by many a word linkd unto moments when the heart was stirrd by the sweet mournfulness of many a hymn sung when the woods at eve grew hushd and dim by the persuasion of her fervent eye all eloquent with childlike piety by the still beauty of her life she strove to win for heaven and heavenborn truth the love pourd out on her so freely–nor in vain was that softbreathing influence to enchain the soul in gentle bonds by slow degrees light followd on as when a summer breeze parts the deep masses of the forest shade and lets the sunbeam through–her voice was made evn such a breeze and she a lowly guide by faith and sorrow raisd and purified so to the cross her indian fosterers led until their prayers were one when morning spread oer the blue lake and when the sunsets glow touchd into golden bronze the cypressbough page and when the quiet of the sabbath time sank on her heart tho no melodious chime wakend the wilderness their prayers were one –now might she pass in hope her work was done and she was passing from the woods away the broken flower of england might not stay amidst those alien shades her eye was bright evn yet with something of a starry light but her form wasted and her fair young cheek wore oft and patiently a fatal streak a rose whose root was death the parting sigh of autumn thro the forests had gone by and the rich maple oer her wanderings lone its crimson leaves in many a shower had strown

we think it sad to part with life when all the earth looks glad page in her young lovely things when voices break into sweet sounds and leaves and blossoms wake is it not brighter then in that far clime where graves are not nor blights of changeful time if here such glory dwell with passing blooms such golden sunshine rest around the tombs so thought the dying one twas early day and sounds and odours with the breezes play whispering of springtime thro the cabindoor unto her couch lifes farewell sweetness bore then with a look where all her hope awoke my father–to the greyhaird chief she spoke– knowst thou that i depart–i know i know he answerd mournfully that thou must go to thy belovd my daughter–sorrow not for me kind mother with meek smiles once more she murmurd in low tones one happy lot awaits us friends upon the better shore for we have prayd together in one trust and lifted our frail spirits from the dust to god who gave them lay me by mine own under the cedarshade where he is gone thither i go there will my sisters be and the dead parents lisping at whose knee my childhoods prayer was learnd–the saviours prayer which now ye know–and i shall meet you there father and gentle mother–ye have bound the bruised reed and mercy shall be found by mercys children–from the matrons eye droppd tears her sole and passionate reply but edith felt them not for now a sleep

be where farewell sounds are oer thou in the eyes thou lovst shalt see no fear of parting more the mossy grave thy tears have wet and the winds wild moanings by thou with thy kindred shalt forget

vaults of the banian stood like torchlit aisles midst the solemn wood page and the plantain glitterd with leaves of gold as a tree midst the geniigardens old and the cypress lifted a blazing spire and the stems of the cocoas were shafts of fire many a white pagodas gleam slept lovely round upon lake and stream broken alone by the lotusflowers as they caught the glow of the suns last hours like rosy wine in their cups and shed its glory forth on their crystal bed many a graceful hindoo maid with the watervase from the palmy shade came gliding light as the deserts roe down marble steps to the tanks below and a cool sweet plashing was ever heard as the molten glass of the wave was stirrd and a murmur thrilling the scented air told where the bramin bowd in prayer page there wandered a noble moslem boy through the scene of beauty in breathless joy he gazed where the stately city rose like a pageant of clouds in its red repose he turnd where birds thro the gorgeous gloom of the woods went glancing on starry plume he trackd the brink of the shining lake by the tall canes featherd in tuft and brake till the path he chose in its mazes wound to the very heart of the holy ground and there lay the water as if enshrind in a rocky urn from the sun and wind bearing the hues of the grove on high far down thro its dark still purity the flood beyond to the fiery west spread out like a

brahma born page this was the doom for a moslem found with a foot profane on their holy ground this was for sullying the pure waves free unto them alone–twas their gods decree a change came oer his wandering look– the mother shriekd not then nor shook breathless she knelt in her sons young blood rending her mantle to staunch its flood but it rushd like a river which none may stay bearing a flower to the deep away that which our love to the earth would chain fearfully striving with heaven in vain that which fades from us while yet we hold claspd to our bosoms its mortal mould was fleeting before her afar and fast one moment–the soul from the face had passd are there no words for that common wo –ask of the thousands its depths that know page the boy had breathed in his dreaming rest like a lowvoiced dove on her gentle breast he had stood when she sorrowd beside her knee painfully stilling his quick hearts glee he had kissd from her cheek the widows tears with the loving lip of his infant years he had smiled oer her path like a bright springday– now in his blood on the earth he lay murderd–alas and we love so well in a world where anguish like this can dwell she bowd down mutely oer her dead– they that stood round her watchd in dread they watchd–she knew not they were by– her soul sat veild in its agony on the silent lip she pressd no kiss too stern was the grasp of her pangs for this she shed no tear as her face bent low oer the shining hair of the lifeless brow page she lookd but into the halfshut eye with a gaze that found there no reply and shrieking mantled her head from sight and fell struck down by her sorrows might and what deep change what work of power was wrought on her secret soul that hour how rose the lonely one–she rose like a prophetess from dark repose and proudly flung from her face the veil and shook the hair from her forehead pale and midst her wondering handmaids stood with the sudden glance of a dauntless mood ay lifting up to the midnight sky a brow in its regal passion high with a close and rigid grasp she pressd the bloodstaind robe to her heaving breast and said–not yet–not yet i weep not yet my spirit shall sink or sleep page not till yon city in ruins rent be piled for its victims monument –cover his dust bear it on before it shall visit those templegates once more and away in the train of the dead she turnd the

the indian city borne a peal of the cymbal and tambour afar– war tis the gathering of moslem war the bramin lookd from the leaguerd towers– he saw the wild archer amidst his bowers and the lake that flashd through the plantain shade as the light of the lances along it playd page and the canes that shook as if winds were high when the fiery steed of the waste swept by and the camp as it lay like a billowy sea wide round the sheltering banian tree there stood one tent from the rest apart– that was the place of a wounded heart –oh deep is a wounded heart and strong a voice that cries against mighty wrong and full of death as a hot winds blight doth the ire of a crushd affection light maimuna from realm to realm had passd and her tale had rung like a trumpets blast there had been words

and a vow was recorded that doomd its fall page back with the dust of her son she came when her voice had kindled that lightning flame she came in the might of a queenly foe banner and javelin and bended bow but a deeper power on her forehead sate– there sought the warrior his star of fate her eyes wild flash through the tented line was haild as a spirit and a sign and the faintest tone from her lip was caught as a sybils breath of prophetic thought vain bitter glory–the gift of grief that lights up vengeance to find relief transient and faithless–it can not fill so the deep void of the heart nor still the yearning left by a broken tie that haunted fever of which we die sickening she turnd from her sad renown as a king in death might reject his crown page slowly the strength of the walls gave way– she witherd faster from day to day all the proud sounds of that bannerd plain to stay the flight of her soul were vain like an eagle caged it had striven and worn the frail dust neer for such conflicts born till the bars were rent and the hour was come for its fearful rushing thro darkness home the bright sun set in his pomp and pride as on that eve when the fair boy died she gazed from her couch and a softness fell oer her weary heart with the days farewell she spoke and her voice in its dying tone had an echo of feelings that long seemd flown she murmurd a low sweet cradle song strange midst the din of a warrior throng a song of the time when her boys young cheek had glowd on her breast in its slumber meek page but something which breathed from that mournful strain sent a fitful gust oer her soul again and starting as if from a dream she cried– give him proud burial at my side there by yon lake where the palmboughs wave when the temples are fallen make

upon the greensward fell as chieftains passd and solemnly the swell of the deep requiem oer the gleaming river borne with the gale and with the leaves low shiver floated and died proud mourners there yet pale wore mans mute anguish sternly–but of one oh who shall speak what words his brow unveil a father following to the grave his son that is no grief to picture sad and slow thro the woodshadows moved the knightly train with youths fair form upon the bier laid low fair even when found amidst the bloody slain stretchd by its broken lance they reached the lone baronial chapel where the forest gloom fell heaviest for the massy boughs had grown into thick archways as to vault the tomb stately they trod the hollow ringing aisle a strange deep echo shuddered thro the pile till crested heads at last in silence bent round the de coucis antique monument page when dust to dust was given–and aymer slept beneath the drooping banners of his line whose broiderd folds the syrian wind had swept proudly and oft oer fields of palestine so the sad rite was closd the sculptor gave trophies ere long to deck that lordly grave and the pale image of a youth arrayed as warriors are for fight but calmly laid in slumber on his shield–then all was done all still around the dead–his name was heard perchance when winecups flowd and hearts were stirrd by some old song or tale of battle won told round the hearth but in his fathers breast manhoods high passions woke again and pressd on to their mark and in his friends clear eye there dwelt no shadow of a dream gone by and with the brethren of his fields the feast was gay as when the voice whose sounds had ceasd page mingled with theirs–evn thus lifes rushing tide bears back affection from the graves dark side alas to think of this–the hearts void place filld up so soon–so like a summercloud all that we lovd to pass and leave no trace– he lay forgotten in his early shroud forgotten–not of all–the sunny smile glancing in play oer that proud lip erewhile and the dark locks whose breezy waving threw a gladness round wheneer their shade withdrew from the bright brow and all the sweetness lying within that eagleeyes jet radiance deep and all the music with that young voice dying whose joyous echoes made the quick heart leap as at a hunters bugle–these things lived still in one breast whose silent love survived the pomps of

brilliance glowing in the rich light like molten rubies flowing thro storied windows down the violet there might speak of love–a secret love and lowly and the rose image all things fleet and fair and the faint passionflower the sad and holy tell of diviner hopes but whose light hand as for an altar wove the radiant band whose gentle nurture brought from hidden dells that gemlike wealth of blossoms and sweet bells to blush through every season–blight and chill might touch the changing woods but duly still for years those gorgeous coronals renewed and brightly clasping marble spear and helm even

revelry awaking one moment holds them still in breathless dread page the wild fierce lustre grows–then bursts a cry– fire thro the hall and round it gathering–fly and forth they rush–as chased by sword and spear– to the green coverts of the gardenbowers a gorgeous masque of pageantry and fear startling the birds and trampling down the flowers while from the dome behind red sparkles driven pierce the dark stillness of the midnight heaven and where is she pauline–the hurrying throng have swept her onward as a stormy blast might sweep some faint oerwearied bird along– till now the threshold of that death is past and free she stands beneath the starry skies calling her child–but no sweet voice replies page bertha where art thou–speak oh speak my own alas unconscious of her pangs

thro a host combined– mighty is anguish with affection twined and what bold step may follow midst the roar of the red billows oer their prey that rise none–courage there stood still–and never more did those fair forms emerge on human eyes page was one brief meeting theirs one wild farewell and died they heart to heart–oh who can tell freshly and cloudlessly the morning broke on that sad palace midst its pleasureshades its painted roofs had sunk–yet black with smoke and lonely stood its marble colonnades but yestereve their shafts with wreaths were bound– now lay the scene one shrivelld scroll around and bore the ruins no recording trace of all that womans heart had dared and done yes there were gems to mark its mortal place that forth from dust and ashes dimly shone those had the mother on her gentle breast worn round her childs fair image there at rest page and they were all–the tender and the true left this alone her sacrifice to prove hallowing the spot where mirth once

royaltys array but she that with the dark hair watchd by the cold slumberers side on her wan cheek no beauty dwelt and in her garb no pride only her full impassiond eyes as oer that clay she bent a wildness and a tenderness in strange resplendence blent and as the swift thoughts crossd her soul like shadows of a cloud amidst the silent room of death the dreamer spoke aloud page she spoke to him who could not hear and cried thou yet wilt wake and learn my watchings and my tears belovd one for thy sake they told me this was death but well i knew it could not be fairest and stateliest of the

i have but a womans heart wherewith thy heart to seek but when thou wakst my prince my lord and hearst how i have kept a lonely vigil by thy side and oer thee prayd and wept page how in one long deep dream of thee my nights and days have past surely that humble patient love must win back love at last and thou wilt smile–my own my own shall be the sunny smile which brightly fell and joyously on all but me erewhile no more in vain affections thirst my weary soul shall pine– oh years of hope deferrd were paid by one fond glance of thine thoult meet me with that radiant look when thou comst from the chase for me for me in festal halls it shall kindle oer thy face page thoult reck no more tho beautys gift mine aspect may not bless in thy kind eyes this deep deep love shall give me loveliness but wake my heart within me burns yet once more to rejoice in the sound to which it ever leapd the music of thy voice awake i sit in solitude that thy first look and tone and the gladness of thine

islandblood and his pressd lips lookd marble–fiercely bright and high around him blazd the fires of night page rocking beneath the cedars to and fro as the wind passd and with a fitful glow lighting the victims face–but who could tell of what within his secret heart befel known but to heaven that hour–perchance a thought of his far home then so intensely wrought that its full image picturd to his eye on the dark ground of mortal agony rose clear as day–and he might see the band of his young sisters wandring hand in hand where the laburnums droopd or haply binding the jasmine up the doors low

so it ever smiled–perchance the prayer learnd at her knee came back on his despair page the blessing from her voice the very tone of her goodnight might breathe from boyhood gone– he started and lookd up–thick cypress boughs full of strange sound wavd oer him darkly red in the broad stormy firelight–savage brows with tall plumes crested and wild hues oerspread girt him like feverish phantoms and pale stars lookd thro the branches as thro dungeon bars shedding no hope–he knew he felt his doom– oh what a tale to shadow with its gloom that happy hall in england–idle fear would the winds tell it–who might dream or hear the secret of the forests–to the stake they bound him and that proud young soldier strove his fathers spirit in his breast to wake trusting to die in silence he the love of

dancing step in wood and glade and as her cheek flushd thro its olive hue as her black tresses to the nightwind flew something oermasterd them from that young mien– something of heaven in silence felt and seen and seeming to their childlike faith a token that the great spirit by her voice had spoken they loosd the bonds that held their captives breath from his pale lips they took the cup of death they quenchd the brand beneath the cypress tree away they cried young stranger thou art free page costanza —art thou then desolate of friends of hopes forsaken–come to me i am thine own–have trusted

–give me but something whereunto i may bind my heart something to love to rest upon to clasp affections tendrils round wouldst thou wear the gift of immortal bloom wouldst thou smile in scorn at the shadowy tomb drink of this cup it is richly fraught with balm from the gardens of genii brought drink and the spoiler shall pass thee by when the young all scatterd like roseleaves lie and would not the youth of my soul be gone if the lovd had left me one by one take back the cup that may never bless the gift that would make me brotherless how should i live with no kindred eye to reflect mine immortality page wouldst thou have empire by sign or spell over the mighty in air that dwell wouldst thou call the spirits of shore and steep to fetch thee jewels from oceans deep wave but this rod and a viewless band slaves to thy will shall around thee stand and would not fear at my coming then hush every voice in the homes of men would not bright eyes in my presence quail young cheeks with a nameless thrill turn pale no gift be mine that aside would turn the human love for whose founts i yearn wouldst thou then read thro the hearts of those upon whose faith thou hast sought repose wear this rich gem it is charmd to show when a change comes over affections glow look on its flushing or fading hue and learn if the trusted be false or true page keep keep the gem that i still may trust tho my hearts wealth be but pourd on dust let not a doubt in my soul have place to dim the light of a lovd ones face leave to the earth its warm sunny smile– that glory would pass could i look on guile say then what boon of my power shall be favourd of spirits pourd forth on thee thou scornest the treasures of wave and mine thou wilt not drink of the cup divine thou art fain with a mortals lot to rest– answer me how may i grace it best oh give me no sway oer the powers unseen but a human heart where my own may lean a friend one tender and faithful friend whose thoughts free current with mine may blend and leaving not either on earth alone bid the bright calm close of our lives be one page a parting song oh mes amis rappelez vous quelquefois mes vers mon ame y est empreinte–corinne when will ye think of me my friends when will ye think of me– when the last red light the farewell of day from the rock and the river is passing away when the air with a deepning hush is fraught and the heart grows burdend with tender thought– then let it be page when will ye think of me kind friends when will ye think of me– when the rose of the rich midsummer time is filld with the hues of its glorious prime when ye gather its bloom as in bright hours fled from the walks where my footsteps no more may tread then let it be when will ye think of me sweet friends when will ye think of me– when the sudden tears oerflow your eye at the sound of some olden melody when ye hear the voice of a mountain stream when ye feel the charm of a poets dream then let it be page thus let my memory be with you friends thus ever think of me kindly and gently but as of one for whom tis well to be fled and gone as of a bird from a chain unbound as of a wanderer whose home is found– so let it be the end
