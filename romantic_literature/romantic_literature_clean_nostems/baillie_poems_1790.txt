poems c poems wherein it is attempted to describe certain views of nature and of rustic manners and also to point out in some instances the different influence which the same circumstances produce on different characters london printed for j johnson saint pauls churchyard mdccxc a winter day the cock warm roosting midst his featherd dames now lifts his beak and snuffs the morning air stretches his neck and claps his heavy wings gives three hoarse crows and glad his talk is done low chuckling turns himself upon the roost then nestles down again amongst his mates the labring hind who on his bed of straw beneath his homemade coverings coarse but warm lockd in the kindly arms of her who spun them dreams of the gain that next years crop should bring or at some fair disposing of his wool or by some lucky and unlookdfor bargain fills his skin purse with heaps of tempting gold now wakes from sleep at the unwelcome call and finds himself but just the same poor man as when he went to rest he hears the blast against his window beat and wishes to himself he were a lord that he might lie abed he rubs his eyes and stretches out his arms heigh ho heigh ho he drawls with gaping mouth then most unwillingly creeps out of bed and without lookingglass puts on his clothes with rueful face he blows the smotherd fire and lights his candle at the redning coal first sees that all be right amongst his cattle then hies him to the barn with heavy tread printing his footsteps on the new falln snow from out the heap of corn he pulls his sheaves dislodging the poor redbreast from his shelter where all the livelong night he slept secure but now afrighted with uncertain flight he flutters round the walls to seek some hole at which he may escape out to the frost and now the flail high whirling oer his head descends with force upon the jumping sheave whilst every rugged wall and neighboring cot reechoes back the noise of his strokes the famly cares call next upon the wife to quit her mean but comfortable bed and first she stirs the fire and blows the flame then from her heap of sticks for winter stord an armful brings loud crackling as they burn thick fly the red sparks upward to the roof while slowly mounts the smoke in wreathy clouds on goes the seething pot with morning cheer for which some little wishful hearts await who peeping from the bedclothes spy well pleasd the cheery light that blazes on the wall and bawl for leave to rise their busy mother knows not where to turn her morning work comes now so thick upon her one she must help to tye his little coat unpin his cap and seck anothers shoe when all is oer out to the door they run with new combd sleeky hair and glistning cheeks each with some little project in his head one on the ice must try his new sold shoes to view his wellset trap another hies in hopes to find some poor unwary bird no worthless prize entangled in his snare whilst one less active with round rosy face spreads out his purple fingers to the fire and peeps most wishfully into the pot but let us leave the warm and cheerful house to view the bleak and dreary scene without and mark the dawning of a winter day for now the morning vapour red and grumly rests heavy on the hills and oer the heavns wide spreading forth in lighter gradual fliades just faintly colours the pale muddy sky then slowly from behind the southern hills inlargd and ruddy looks the rising sun shooting his beams askance the hoary waste which gild the brow of evry swelling height and deepen every valley with a shade the crusted window of each scatterd cot the icicles that fringe the thatched roof the new swept slide upon the frozen pool all lightly glance new kindled with his rays and een the rugged face of scowling winter looks somewhat gay but for a little while he lifts his glory oer the brightning earth then hides his head behind a misty cloud the birds now quit their holes and lurking sheds most mute and melancholy where thro night all nestling close to keep each other warm in downy sleep they had forgot their hardships but not to chant and carol in the air or lightly swing upon some waving bough and merrily return each others notes no silently they hop from bush to bush yet find no seeds to stop their craving want then bend their flight to the low smoking cot chirp on the roof or at the window peck to tell their wants to those who lodge within the poor lank hare flies homeward to his den but little burthend with his nightly meal of witherd greens grubbd from the farmers garden a poor and scanty portion snatchd in fear and fearful creatures forcd abroad by want are now to evry enemy a prey the husbandman lays bye his heavy flail and to the house returns where on him wait his smoking breakfast and impatient children who spoon in hand and longing to begin towards the door cast many a weary look to see their dad come in then round they sit a chearful company all eagerly begin and with heapd spoons besmear from ear to ear their rosy cheeks the faithful dog stands by his matters side wagging his tail and looking in his face while humble puss pays court to all around and purs and rubs them with her furry sides nor goes this little flattery unrewarded but the laborious sit not long at table the grateful father lifts his eyes to heavn to bless his god whose ever bounteous hand him and his little ones doth daily feed then rises satisfied to work again the chearful rousing noise of industry is heard with varied sounds thro all the village the humming wheel the thrifty housewifes tongue who scolds to keep her maidens at their work rough grating cards and voice of squaling children issue from every house but harkthe sportsman from the neighbring hedge his thunder sendsloud bark each village cur up from her wheel each curious maiden starts and hastens to the door whilst matrons chide yet run to look themselves in spite of thrift and all the little town is in a stir strutting before the cock leads forth his train and chuckling near the barn among the straw reminds the farmer of his mornings service his grateful master throws a libral handful they flock about it whilst the hungry sparrows perchd on the roof look down with envious eye then aiming well amidst the feeders light and seize upon the feast with greedy bill till angry partlets peck them off the field but at a distance on the leafless tree all woe be gone the lonely blackbird sits the cold north wind ruffles his glossy feathers full oft he looks but dare not make approach then turns his yellow bill to peck his side and claps his wings close to his sharpend breast the wandring fowler from behind the hedge fastens his eye upon him points his gun and firing wantonly as at a mark een lays him low in that same cheerful spot which oft hath cchod with his evnings song the day now at its height the pentup kine are driven from their flails to take the air how stupidly they stare and feel how strange they open wide their smoking mouths to low but scarcely can their feeble sound be heard then turn and lick themselves and step by step move dull and heavy to their flails again in scatterd groups the little idle boys with purple fingers moulding in the snow their icy ammunition pant for war and drawing up in opposite array send forth a mighty fliower of well aimd balls whilst little heros try their growing flrength and burn to beat the enmy off the field or on the well worn ice in eager throngs aiming their race shoot rapidly along trip up each others heels and on the surface with knotted shoes draw many a chalky line untird of play they never cease their sport till the faint sun has almost run his course and threatning clouds slow rising from the north spread grumly darkness oer the face of heavn then by degrees they scatter to their homes with many a broken head and bloody nose to claim their mothers pity who most skilful cures all their troubles with a bit of bread the night comes on a pace chill blows the blast and drives the snow in wreaths now evry creature looks around for shelter and whether man or beast all move alike towards their several homes and happy they who have a house to screen them from the cold lo oer the frost a revrend form advances his hair white as the snow on which he treads his forehead markd with many a careworn furrow whose feeble body bending oer a staff still shew that once it was the seat of strength tho now it shakes like some old ruind towr clothd indeed but not disgracd with rags he still maintains that decent dignity which well becomes those who have servd their country with tottring steps he to the cottage moves the wife within who hears his hollow cough and pattring of iris stick upon the threshold sends out her little boy to see whos there the child looks up to view the strangers face and seeing it enlightend with a smile holds out his little hand to lead him in rousd from her work the mother turns her head and sees them not illpleasd the stranger whines not with a piteous tale but only asks a little to relieve a poor old soldiers wants the gentle matron brings the ready chair and bids him sit to rest his wearied limbs and warm himself before her blazing fire the children full of curiosity flock round and with their fingers in their mouths stand staring at him whilst the stranger pleasd takes up the youngest boy upon his knee proud of its seat it wags its little feet and prates and laughs and plays with his white locks but soon the soldiers face lays off its smiles his thoughtful mind is turnd on other days when his own boys were wont to play around him who now lie distant from their native land in honourable but untimely graves he feels how helpless and forlorn he is and bitter tears gush from his dimworn eyes his toilsome daily labour at an end in comes the wearied master of the house and marks with satisfaction his old guest with all his children round his honest heart is filld with manly kindness he bids him stay and share their homely meal and take with them his quarters for the night the weary wanderer thankfully accepts and seated with the cheerful family around the plain but hospitable board forgets the many hardships he has passd when all are satisfied about the fire they draw their seats and form a cheerful ring the thrifty housewife turns her spinning wheel the husband useful even in his rest a little basket weaves of willow twigs to bear her eggs to town on market days and work but serves tenliven conversation some idle neighbours now come straggling in draw round their chairs and widen out the circle without a glass the tale and jest go round and every one in his own native way does what he can to cheer the merry group each tells some little story of himself that constant subject upon which mankind whether in court or country love to dwell how at a fair he savd a simple clown from being tricked in buying of a cow or laid a bet upon his horses head against his neighbours bought for twice his price which faild not to repay his better skill or on a harvest day bound in an hour more sheaves of corn than any of his fellows tho neer so keen could do in twice the time but chief the landlord at his own fireside doth claim the right of being listend to nor dares a little bawling tongue be heard tho but in play to break upon his story the children sit and listen with the rest and should the youngest raise its little voice the careful mother ever on the watch and always pleasd with what her husband says gives it a gentle tap upon the fingers or stops its ill timd prattle with a kiss the soldier next but not unaskd begins and tells in better speech what he has seen making his simple audience to shrink with tales of war and blood they gaze upon him and almost weep to see the man so poor so bent and feeble helpless and forlorn that oft has stood undaunted in the battle whilst thundring cannons shook the quaking earth and showering bullets hissd around his head with little care they pass away the night till time draws on when they should go to bed then all break up and each retires to rest with peaceful mind nor torn with vexing cares nor dancing with the unequal beat of pleasure but long accustomd to observe the weather the labourer can not lay him down in peace till he has lookd to mark what bodes the night he turns the heavy door thrusts out his head sees wreathes of snow heapd up on evry side and black and grimily all above his head save when a red gleam shoots along the waste to make the gloomy night more terrible loud blows the northern blast he hears it hollow grumbling from afar then gathring strength roll on with doubld might and break in dreadful bellowings oer his head like pithless saplings bend the vexed trees and their wide branches crack he shuts the door and thankful for the roof that covers him hies him to bed a summer day the darkblue clouds of night in dusky lines drawn wide and streaky oer the purer sky wear faint the morning purple on their skirts the stars that full and bright shone in the west but dimly twinkle to the stedfast eye and seen and vanishing and seen again like dying tapers smothring in their sockets appear at last shut from the face of heavn whilst every lesser flame which shone by night the flashy meteor from the opning cloud that shoots full oft across the dusky sky or wandring fire which looks across the marsh beaming like candle in a lonely cot to cheer the hopes of the benighted travller till swifter than the very change of thought it shifts from place to place escapes his glance and makes him wondring rub his doubtful eyes or humble glowworm or the silver moth which cast a feeble glimmring oer the green all die away for now the sun slow moving in his grandeur above the eastern mountains lifts his head the webs of dew spread oer the hoary lawn the smooth clear bosom of the settled pool the polishd ploughshare on the distant field catch fire from him and dart their new got beams upon die dazzled eye the newwakd birds upon the branches hop peck their loft down and bristle out their feathers then stretch their throats and tune their morning song whilst stately crows high swinging oer their heads upon the topmost boughs in lordly pride mix their hoarse croaking with the linnets note till gatherd closer in a sable band they take their flight to leek their daily food the village labourer with careful mind as soon as doth the morning light appear opens his eyes with the first darting ray that pierces thro the window of his cot and quits his easy bed then oer the field with lengthend swinging strides betakes his way bearing his spade and hoe across his moulder seen from afar clear glancing in the sun and with good will begins his daily work the sturdy sunburnt boy drives forth the cattle and vain of power bawls to the lagging kine who fain would stay to crop the tender shoots of the green tempting hedges as they pass or beats the glistning bushes with his club to please his fancy with a shower of dew and frighten the poor birds who lurk within at evry open door thro all the village half naked children half awake are seen scratching their heads and blinking to the light till roused by degrees they run about or rolling in the sun amongst the sand build many a little house with heedful art the housewife tends within her morning care and stooping midst her tubs of curdled milk with busy patience draws the clear green whey from the pressd sides of the pure snowy curd whilst her brown dimpled maid with tuckdup sleeve and swelling arm assists her in her toil pots smoke pails rattle and the warm confusion still thickens on them till within its mould with careful hands they press the wellwrought curd so goes the morning till the powrful sun high in the heavns sends forth his strengthend beams and all the freshness of the morn is fled the sweating travller throws his burden down and leans his weary shoulder gainst a tree the idle horse upon the grassy field rolls on his back nor heeds the tempting clover the swain leaves off his labour and returns slow to his house with heavy sober steps where on the board his ready breakfast placd invites the eye and his right cheerful wife doth kindly serve him with unfeignd good will no sparkling dewdrops hang upon the grass forth steps the mower with his glittring scythe in snowy shirt and doublet all unbracd white moves he oer the ridge with sideling bend and lays the waving grass in many a heap in evry field in evry swampy mead the cheerful voice of industry is heard the haycock rises and the frequent rake sweeps on the yellow hay in heavy wreaths leaving the smooth green meadow bare behind the old and young the weak and strong are there and as they can help on the cheerful work the father jeers his awkward halfgrown lad who trails his tawdry armful oer the field nor does he fear the jeering to repay the village oracle and simple maid jest in their turns and raise the ready laugh for there authority hard favourd frowns not all are companions in the genral glee and cheerful complaisance still thro their roughness with placid look enlightens every face some more advanced raise the towring rick whilst on its top doth stand the parish toast in loose attire and swelling ruddy cheek with taunts and harmless mockry she receives the tossdup heaps from the brown gaping youth who flaring at her takes his aim awry whilst half the load comes tumbling on himself loud is her laugh her voice is heard afar each mower busied in the distant field the carter trudging on his distant way the shrill found know cad up their hats in air and roar across the fields to catch her notice she waves her arm and shakes her head at them and then renews her work with double spirit thus do they jest and laugh away their toil till the bright sun full in his middle course shoots down his fiercest beams which none may brave the stoutest arm hangs listless by its side and the broad shoulderd youth begins to fail but to the weary lo there comes relief a troop of welcome children oer the lawn with slow and wary steps their burthens bring some bear upon their heads large baskets heapd with piles of barley bread and gusty cheese and some full pots of milk and cooling whey beneath the branches of a spreading tree or by the shadwy side of the tall rick they spread their homely fare and seated round taste all the pleasure that a feast can give a drowzy indolence now hangs on all and evry creature seeks some place of rest screend from the violence of the oppressive heat no scatterd flocks are seen upon the lawn nor chirping birds among the bushes heard within the narrow shadow of the cot the sleepy dog lies stretched on his side nor heeds the heavyfooted passenger at noise of feet but half his eyelid lifts then gives a feeble growl and sleeps again whilst puss less nice een in the scorching window on tother side sits winking to the sun no sound is heard but humming of the bee for she alone retires not from her labour nor leaves a meadow flower unsought for gain heavy and slow so pass the midday hours till gently bending on the ridges top the heavy seeded grass begins to wave and the high branches of the slender poplar shiver aloft in air their rustling leaves cool breaths the rising breeze and with it wakes the worn out spirit from its state of stupor the lazy boy springs from his mossy bed to chace the gaudy tempting butterfly who spreading on the grass its mealy wings oft lights within his reach een at his seer yet still eludes his grasp and oer his head light hovring round or mounted high in air temps his young eye and wearies out his limbs the drouzy dog who feels the kindly breeze that passing oer him lifts his shaggy ear begins to stretch him on his legs halfraisd till fully wakd with bristling cockdup tail he makes the village echo to his bark but let us not forget the busy maid who by the side of the clear pebly stream spreads out her snowy linens to the sun and sheds with libral hand the chrystal showr oer many a favrite piece of fair attire revolving in her mind her gay appearance in all this dress at some approaching fair the dimpling halfcheckd smile and muttring lip betray the secret workings of her fancy and flattering thoughts of the complacent mind there little vagrant bands of truant boys amongst the bushes try their harmless tricks whilst some a sporting in the shallow stream toss up the lashing water round their heads or strive with wily art to catch the trout or twixt their fingers grasp the slippry eel the shepherdboy sits singing on the bank to pass away the weary lonely hours weaving with art his little crown of rushes a guiltless easy crown that brings no care which having made he places on his head and leaps and skips about and bawls full loud to some companion lonely as himself far in the distant field or else delighted to hear the echod sound of his own voice returning answer from the neighboring rock holds no unpleasing converse with himself now weary labourers perceive wellpleasd the shadows lengthen and th oppressive day with all its toil fast wearing to an end the sun far in the west with sidelong beam plays on the yellow head of the round haycock and fields are checkerd with fantastic shapes or tree or shrub or gate or rugged stone all lengthend out in antic disproportion upon the darkend grass they finish out their long and toilsome talk then gathering up their rakes and scatterd coats with the less cumbrous fragments of their feast return right gladly to their peaceful homes the village lone and silent thro the day receiving from the fields its merry bands sends forth its evning sound confusd but cheerful whilst dogs and children eager housewives tongues and true love ditties in no plaintive strain by shrill voicd maid at open window sung the lowing of the homereturning kine the herds low droning trump and tinkling bell tied to the collar of his favrite sheep make no contemptible variety to ears not over nice with careless lounging gait the sauntring youth upon his sweethearts open window leans and as she turns about her buzzing wheel diverts her with his jokes and harmless taunts close by the cottage door with placid mien the old man sits upon his seat of turf his staff with crooked head laid by his side which oft the younger race in wanton sport gambolling round him slyly steal away and straddling oer it shew their horsemanship by raising round the clouds of summer sand while still he smiles yet chides them for the trick his silver locks upon his shoulders spread and not ungraceful is his stoop of age no stranger passes him without regard and evry neighbour stops to wish him well and ask him his opinion of the weather they fret not at the length of his discourse but listen with respect to his remarks upon the various seasons he remembers for well he knows the many divers signs which do fortell high winds or rain or drought or ought that may affect the rising crop the silken clad who courtly breeding boast their own discourse still sweetest to their ears may grumble at the old mans lengthened story but here it is not so from evry chimney mounts the curling smoke muddy and gray of the new evning fire on evry window smokes the famly supper set out to cool by the attentive housewife while cheerful groups at every door convend bawl cross the narrow lane the parish news and oft the bursting laugh disturbs the air but see who comes to set them all agag the wearyfooted pedlar with his pack how stiff he bends beneath his bulky load coverd with dust slipshod and out at elbows his greasy hat sits backward on his head his thin straight hair divided on his brow hangs lank on either side his glistning cheeks and woebegone yet vacant is his face his box he opens and displays his ware full many a varied row of precious stones cast forth their dazzling lustre to the light to the desiring maidens wishful eye the ruby necklace shews its tempting blaze the china buttons stampd with love device attract the notice of the gaping youth whilst streaming garters fastend to a pole aloft in air their gaudy stripes display and from afar the distant stragglers lure the children leave their play and round him flock een sober aged granddame quits her seat where by the door she twines her lengthend threads her spindle stops and lays her distaff by then joins with step sedate the curious throng she praises much the fashions of her youth and scorns each gaudy nonsense of the day yet not illpleasd the glossy ribband views uprolld and changing hues with evry fold new measurd out to deck her daughters head now red but languid the last weakly beams of the departing sun across the lawn deep gild the top of the long sweepy ridge and shed a scatterd brightness bright but cheerless between the opnings of the rifted hills which like the farewell looks of some dear friend that speaks him kind yet sadden as they smile but only serve to deepen the low vale and make the shadows of the night more gloomy the varied noises of the cheerful village by slow degrees now faintly die away and more distinct each feeble sound is heard that gently steals ad own the rivers bed or thro the wood comes with the ruffling breeze the white mist rises from the swampy glens and from the dappled flatting of the heavns looks out the evning star the lover skulking in the neighbring copse whose halfseen form shewn thro the thickend air large and majestic makes the trayller start and spreads the story of the haunted grove curses the owl whose loud illomend scream with ceaseless spite robes from his watchful ear the well known footsteps of his darling maid and fretful chaces from his face the nightfly who buzzing round his head doth often skim with fluttring wing across his glowing cheek for all but him in deep and balmy sleep forget the toils of the oppressive day shut is the door of evry scatterd cot and silence dwells within night scenes of other times a poem in three parts part i the wild winds bellow oer my head and spent eves fading light where shall i find some friendly shed to screen me from the night ah round me lies a desert vast no habitation near and dark and pathless is the waste and fills the mind with fear thou distant tree whose lonely top has bent to many a storm no more canst thou deceive my hope and take my lovers form for oer thy head the dark cloud rolls black as thy blasted pride how deep the angry tempest growls along the mountains side securely rests the mountain deer within his hollow den his slumber undisturbd by fear far from the haunts of men beneath the fern the moorcock sleeps and twisted adders lie back to his rock the nightbird creeps nor gives his wonted cry for angry spirits of the night ride in the troubled air and to their dens in wild affright the beasts of prey repair but oh my love where dost thou rest what shelter covers thee o may this cold and wintry blast but only beat on me some friendly dwelling mayst thou find where undisturbd with care thou shalt not feel the chilly wind that ruffles margrets hair ah no for thou didst give thy word to meet me on the way nor friendly roof nor coastly board will tempt a lovers stay o raise thy voice if thou art near its weakest sound were bliss what other sound my heart can cheer in such a gloom as this but from the hills with stunning sound the dashing torrents fall loud is the raging tempest round and mocks a lovers call ha see across the dreary waste a gentle form appears it is my love my cares are past how vain were all my fears the form approachd but sad and slow nor with a lovers tread and from his cheek the youthful glow and greeting smile was fled dim sadness hung upon his brow fixd was his beamless eye his face was like the moonlight bow upon a wintry sky and fixd and ghastly to the sight his strengthend features rose and bended was his graceful height and bloody were his clothes o margret calm thy troubled breast thy sorrow now is vain thy edward from his peaceful rest shall neer return again a treachrous friend has brought me low and fixd my early doom and laid my corpse with feigned woe beneath a vaulted tomb to take thee to my home i sware and here we were to meet wilt thou a narrow coffin share and part my windingsheet but late the lord of many lands and now a grave is all my blood is warm upon his hands who revels in my hall yet think thy fathers hoary hair is waterd with his tears he has but thee to sooth his care and prop his load of years remember edward when hes gone he only livd for thee and when thourt pensive and alone o margret call on me yet deep beneath the mouldring clod i rest my wounded head and terrible that call and loud which shall awake the dead no edward i will follow thee and share thy hapless doom companions shall our spirits be tho distant is thy tomb o never to my fathers tower will i return again a bleeding heart has little power to ease anothers pain upon the wing my spirit flies i feel my course is run nor shall these dim and weary eyes behold tomorrows sun like early dew or hoary frost spent with the beaming day so shrunk the pale and watry ghost and dimly wore away no longer margret felt the storm she bowd her lovely head and with her lovers fleeting form her gentle spirit fled part ii loud roars the wind that shakes this wall it is no common blast deep hollow sounds pass thro my hall o would the night were past methinks the dæmons of the air upon the turrets growl while down the empty winding stair their deepning murmurs roll the glimmring fire cheers not the gloom how blue its weakly ray and like a taper in a tomb but spreads the more dismay athwart its melancholy light the lengthend shadow falls my grandsires to my troubled sight lowr on me from these walls methinks yon angry warriors head doth in its casement frown and darts a look as if it said where hast thou laid my son but will these fancies never cease o would the night were run my troubled soul can find no peace but with the morning sun vain hope the guilty never rest dismay is always near there is a midnight in the breast no morn shall ever cheer the weary hind is now at rest tho lowly is his head how sweetly lies the guiltless breast upon the hardest bed the beggar in his wretched haunt may now a monarch be forget his woe forget his want for all can sleep but me ive dard whateer the boldest can then why this childish dread i never feard a living man and shall i fear the dead no whistling storms may shake my tower and passing spirits scream their shadowy arms are void of power and but a gloomy dream but lo a form advancing slow across my dusky hall art thou a friend art thou a foe o answer to my call still nearer to the glimmring light the towring figure strode till full and horrid to the sight the murtherd edward stood his hand a broken dagger swayd like times dark threatning dart and pointed to the rugged blade that quiverd in his heart the blood still trickled from his head and clotted was his hair that on his manly shoulders spread his mangled breast was bare his face was like the muddy sky before the coming snow and dark and dreadful was his eye and cloudy was his brow pale conrad shrunk but graspd his sword fear thrilld in evry vein his quivring lip halfspoke its word he pausd and shrunk again pale bloody spectre at this hour why dost thou haunt the night has the deep gloomy vault no power to keep thee from my sight why dost thou glare why dost thou wave that fatal cursed knife the deed is done and from the grave who can recall to life why rolls thine eye beneath thy brow dark as the midnight storm what dost thou want o let me know but hide thy dreadful form id give the lifes blood from my heart to wash my crime away if thourt a spirit o depart nor haunt a wretch of clay say dost thou with the blessed dwell return and blessed be or comst thou from the lowest hell i am more curst than thee the form advancd with solemn step as though it meant to speak and thrice it movd its muttring lip but silence did not break then sternly stalkd with heavy pace which shook the trembling wall and frowning turnd its angry face and vanishd from the hall with fixed eyes pale conrad stood that from their sockets swell back on his heart ran the cold blood he shudderd as he fell night fled and thro the window gan the early light to play but on a more unhappy man neer shone the dawning day the gladsome sun all nature cheers but can not charm his cares still dwells his mind with gloomy fears and murtherd edward glares part iii no rest nor comfort can i find i watch the midnight hour i sit and listen to the wind which beats upon my tower methinks low voices from the ground break mournful on mine ear and thro these empty chambers sound so dismal and so drear the ghost of some departed friend doth in my sorrows share or is it but the rushing wind that mocketh my despair sad thro the hall the pale lamp gleams upon my fathers arms my soul is filld with gloomy dreams i fear unknown alarms oh i have known this lonely place with evry blessing stord and many a friend with cheerful face sit smiling at my board whilst round the fire in early bloom my harmless children playd who now within the narrow tomb are with their mother laid and now low bends my wretched head and those i lovd are gone my friends my family all are fled and i am left alone oft as the cheerless fire declines in it i sadly trace as lone i sit the half formd lines of many a much lovd face but chief o margret to my mind thy lovely features rise i strive to think thee less unkind and wipe my streaming eyes for only thee i had to vaunt thou wert thy mothers pride she left thee like a shooting plant to screen my widowd side but thou hast left me weak forlorn and chilld with ages frost to count my weary days and mourn the comforts i have lost unkindly fair why didst thou go o had i known the truth tho edwards father was my foe i would have blessd the youth o could i see that face again whose smile calmd evry strife and hear that voice which soothd my pain and made me wish for life thy harp hangs silent by the wall my nights are sad and long and thou art in a distant hall where strangers raise the song ha some delusion of the mind my senses doth confound it was the harp and not the wind that did so sweetly sound old arno rose all wan as death with broken steps of care and oft he checkd his quickheavd breath and turnd his eager ear when like a full but distant choir the swelling sound returnd and with the soft and trembling wire the sighing echoes mournd then softly whisperd oer the song which margret lovd to play like some sweet dirge and sad and long it faintly died away his dimworn eyes to heavn he cast where all his griefs were known and smote upon his troubled breast and heavd a heavy groan i know it is my daughters hand but tis no hand of clay and here a lonely wretch i stand all childless bent and grey and art thou low my lovely child and hast thou met thy doom and has thy flattring morning smild to lead but to the tomb o let me see thee ere we part for souls like thine are blest o let me fold thee to my heart if aught of form thou hast this passing mist enrobes thy charms alas to nought tis shrunk and hollow strike my empty arms against my aged trunk thourt fled like the low evning breath that sighs upon the hill o stay tho in thy weeds of death thou art my daughter still loud wakd the sound then fainter grew and long and sadly mournd and softly sighd a long adieu and never more returnd old arno stretchd him on the ground thick as the gloom of night deaths misty shadows gatherd round and swam before his sight he heavd a deep and deadly groan which rent his labring breast and long before the morning shone his spirit was at rest a reverie beside a spreading elm from whose high boughs like knotted tufts the crows light dwelling shows where screend from northern blasts and winter proof snug stands the parsons barn with thatched roof at chaffstrewd door where in the morning ray the gilded mots in mazy circles play and sleepy comrade in the sun is laid more grateful to the cur than neighbring shade in snowy shirt unbracd brown robin stood and leant upon his flail in thoughtful mood his full round cheek where deeper flushes glow the dewy drops which glisten on his brow his dark cropt pate that erst at church or fair so smooth and silky shewd his mornings care which all uncouth in matted locks combind now ends erect defies the ruffling wind his neckband loose and hosen rumpled low a careful lad nor slack at labour shew nor scraping chickens chirping mongst the straw nor croaking rook oerhead nor chattring daw loudbreathing cow amongst the rampy weeds nor grunting sow that in the furrow feeds nor sudden breeze that shakes the quaking leaves and lightly rustles thro the scatterd sheaves nor floating straw that skims athwart his nose the deeply musing youth may discompose for nelly fair and blythest village maid whose tuneful voice beneath the hedgerow shade at early milking oer the meadows born eer cheerd the ploughmans toil at rising morn the neatest maid that eer in linen gown bore cream and butter to the market town the tightest lass that with untutord air eer footed alehouse floor at wake or fair since easter last had robins heart possest and many a time disturbd his nightly rest full oft returning from the loosend plough he slackd his pace and knit his thoughtful brow and oft ere half his threshers talk was oer would muse with arms across at cooling door his mind thus bent with downcast eyes he stood and leant upon his flail in thoughtful mood his soul oer many a soft remembrance ran and muttring to himself the youth began ah happy is the man whose early lot hath made him master of a furnishd cot who trains the vine that round his window grows and after setting sun his garden hoes whose wattled pales his own enclosure shield who toils not daily in anothers field whereer he goes to church or market town with more respect he and his dog are known a brisker face he wears at wake or fair nor views with longing eyes the pedlars ware but buys at will or ribands gloves or beads and willing maidens to the alehouse leads and oh secure from toils which cumber life he makes the maid he loves an easy wife ah nelly canst thou with contented mind become the helpmate of a labring hind and share his lot whateer the chances be who hath no dowr but love to fix on thee yes gayest maid may meekest matron prove and things of little note may token love when from the church thou camst at eventide and i and redhaird susan by thy side i pulld the blossoms from the bending tree and some to susan gave and some to thee thine were the best and well thy smiling eye the diffrence markd and guessd the reason why when on a holyday we rambling strayd and passd old hodges cottage in the glade neat was the garden dressd sweet humd the bee i wishd both cot and nelly made for me and well methought thy very eyes reveald the selfsame wish within thy breast conceald when artful once i sought my love to tell and spoke to thee of one who lovd thee well you saw the cheat and jeering homeward hied yet secret pleasure in thy looks i spied ay gayest maid may meekest matron prove and smaller signs than these have tokend love now at a distance on the neighbring plain with creaking wheels slow comes the heavy wain high on its towring load a maid appears and nellys voice sounds shrill in robins ears quick from his hand he throws the cumbrous flail and leaps with lightsome limbs th enclosing pale oer field and fence he scours and furrow wide with wakend comrade barking by his side whilst tracks of trodden grain and sidelong hay and broken hedgeflowrs sweet mark his impetuous way a disappointment on village green whose smooth and well worn sod crosspathd with every gossips foot is trod by cottage door where playful children run and cats and curs sit basking in the sun where oer the earthen seat the thorn is bent crossarmd and back to wall poor william leant his bonnet broad drawn oer his gatherd brow his hanging lip and lengthend visage shew a mind but ill at ease with motions strange his listless limbs their wayward postures change whilst many a crooked line and curious maze with clouted shoon he on the sand pourtrays the halfchewd straw fell slowly from his mouth and to himself low muttring spoke the youth how simple is the lad and reft of skill who thinks with love to fix a womans will who evry sunday morn to please her sight knots up his neckcloth gay and hosen white who for her pleasure keeps his pockets bare and half his wages spends on pedlars ware when every niggard clown or dotard old who hides in secret nooks his oft told gold whose field or orchard tempts with all her pride at little cost may win her for his bride whilst all the meed her silly lover gains is but the neighbours jeering for his pains on sunday last when susans bands were read and i astonishd sat with hanging head cold grew my shrinking limbs and loose my knee whilst every neighbours eye was fixd on me ah sue when last we workd at hodges hay and still at me you jeerd in wanton play when last at fair well pleasd by showmans stand you took the newbought fairing from my hand when at old hobbs you sung that song so gay sweet william still the burthen of the lay i little thought alas the lots were cast that thou shoudst be anothers bride at last and had when last we tripd it on the green and laughd at stiffbackd rob small thought i ween ere yet another scanty month was flown to see thee wedded to the hateful clown ay lucky swain more gold thy pockets line but did these shapely limbs resemble thine id stay at home and tend the household geer nor on the green with other lads appear ay lucky swain no store thy cottage lacks and round thy barn thick stands the shelterd stacks but did such features hard my visage grace id never budge the bonnet from my face yet let it be it shall not break my ease he best deserves who doth the maiden please such silly cause no more shall give me pain nor ever maiden cross my rest again such grizzly suitors with their taste agree and the black fiend may take them all for me now thro the village rise confused sounds hoarse lads and children shrill and yelping hounds straight evry matron at the door is seen and pausing hedgers on their mattocks lean at every narrow lane and alley mouth loud laughing lasses stand and joking youth a near approaching band in colours gay with minstrels blythe before to cheer the way from clouds of curling dust which onward fly in rural splendour break upon the eye as in their way they hold so gayly on caps beads and buttons glancing in the sun each village wag with eye of roguish cast some maiden jogs and vents the ready jest whilst village toasts the passing belles deride and sober matrons marvel at their pride but william head erect with settled brow in sullen silence viewd the passing shew and oft he scratchd his pate with manful grace and scornd to pull the bonnet oer his face but did with steady look unmoved wait till hindmost man had turnd the churchyard gate then turnd him to his cot with visage flat where honest tray upon the threshold sat up jumpd the kindly beast his hand to lick and for his pains receivd an angry kick loud shuts the flapping door with thundring din the echoes round their circling course begin from cot to cot in wide progressive swell deep groans the churchyard wall and neighbring dell and tray responsive joins with long and piteous yell a lamentation where ancient broken wall encloses round from tread of lawless feet the hallowd ground and somber yews their dewy branches wave oer many a motey stone and mounded grave where parish church confusdly to the sight with deeper darkness prints the shades of night and mouldring tombs uncouthly gape around and rails and fallen stones bestrew the ground in loosend garb derangd with scatterd hair his bosom open to the nightly air lone oer a new heapd grave poor basil bent and to himself began his simple plaint alas how cold thy home how low thou art who wert the pride and mistress of my heart the fallen leaves light rustling oer thee pass and oer thee waves the rank and dewy grass the new laid sods in decent order tell how narrow now the space where thou must dwell now rough and wintry winds may on thee beat and drizzly drifting snow and summers heat each passing season rub for woe is me or storm or sunshine is the same to thee ah mary lovely was thy slender form and sweet thy cheerful brow that knew no storm thy steps were graceful on the villagegreen as tho thou hadst some courtly lady been at church or market still the gayest lass each younker slackd his speed to see thee pass at early milking tuneful was thy lay and sweet thy homeward song at close of day but sweeter far and evry youths desire thy cheerful converse by the evning fire alas no more thoult foot the grassy sward no song of thine shall ever more be heard yet now they trip it lightly on the green as blythe and gay as thou hadst never been the careless younker whittles lightsome by and other maidens catch his roving eye around the evning fire with little care the neighbours sit and scarcely miss thee there and when the night advancing darkens round they to their rest retire and slumber sound but basil can not rest his days are sad and long his nights upon the weary bed yet still in broken dreams thy form appears and still my bosom proves a lovers fears i guide thy footsteps thro the tangled wood i catch thee sinking in the boistrous flood i shield thy bosom from the threatend stroke i clasp thee falling from the headlong rock but ere we reach the dark and dreadful deep high heaves my troubled breast i wake and weep at evry wailing of the midnight wind thy lowly dwelling comes into my mind when rain beats on my roof wild storms abroad i think upon thy bare and beaten sod i hate the comfort of a shelterd home and hie me forth oer fenceless fields to roam i leave the paths of men for dreary waste and bare my forehead to the howling blast o mary loss of thee hath fixd my doom this world around me is a weary gloom dull heavy musings down my spirits weigh i can not sleep by night nor work by day or wealth or pleasure slowest minds inspire but cheerless is their toil who nought desire let happier friends divide my farmers dock cut down my grain and sheer my little flock for now my only care on earth shall be here evry sunday morn to visit thee and in the holy church with heart sincere and humble mind our worthy curate hear he best can tell when earthly cares are past the surest way to meet with thee at last ill thus a while a weary life abide till wasting time hath laid me by thy side for now on earth there is no place for me nor peace nor slumber till i rest with thee loud from the lofty spire with piercing knell solemn and awful tolld the parish bell a later hour than rusties deem it meet that churchyard ground be trode by mortal feet the wailing lover startled at the sound and raisd his head and cast his eyes around the gloomy pile in strengthend horrour lowerd large and majestic evry object towerd dim thro the gloom they shewd their forms unknown and tall and ghastly rose each whitend stone aloft the waking screechowl gan to sing and past him skimd the bat with flapping wing the fears of nature woke within his breast he left the hallowed spot of marys rest and sped his way the churchyard wall to gain then checkd his coward heart and turnd again the shadows round a deeper horrour wear a deeper silence hangs upon his ear a stiller rest is oer the settled scene his fluttring heart recoils and shrinks again with hasty steps he measures back the ground and leaps with summond force the churchyard bound then home with knocking limbs and quickend breath his footstep urges from the place of death an address to the muses ye tuneful sifters of the lyre who dreams and fantasies inspire who over poesy preside and on a lofty hill abide above the ken of mortal fight fain would i sing of you could i address ye right thus known your powr of old was sung and temples with your praises rung and when the song of battle rose or kindling wine or lovers woes the poets spirit inly burnd and still to you his upcast eyes were turnd the youth all wrappd in vision bright beheld your robes of flowing white and knew your forms benignly grand an awful but a lovely band and felt your inspiration strong and warmly pourd his rapid lay along the aged bard all heavnward glowd and haild you daughters of a god tho to his dimmer eyes were seen nor graceful form nor heavnly mien full well he felt that ye were near and heard you in the blast that shook his hoary hair ye lightend up the valleys bloom and deeper spread the forests gloom the lofty hill sublimer flood and grander rose the mighty flood for then religion lent her aid and oer the mind of man your sacred empire spread tho rolling ages now are past and altars low and temples wade tho rites and oracles are oer and gods and heros rule no more your fading honours still remain and still your votries call a long and motley train they seek you not on hill and plain nor court you in the sacred sane nor meet you in the midday dream upon the bank of hallowed stream yet still for inspiration sue and still each lifts his fervent prayer to you he knows ye not in woodland gloom but wooes ye in the shelfed room and seeks you in the dusty nook and meets you in the letterd book full well he knows you by your names and still with poets faith your presence claims the youthful poet pen in hand all by the side of blotted stand in revrie deep which none may break sits rubbing of his beardless cheek and well his inspiration knows een by the dewy drops that trickle oer his nose the tuneful sage of riper fame perceives you not in heated frame but at conclusion of his verse which still his muttring lips rehearse oft waves his hand in grateful pride and owns the heavnly powr that did his fancy guide o lovely sisters is it true that they are all inspird by you and while they write with magic charmd and high enthusiasm warmd we may not question heavnly lays for well i wot they give you all the praise o lovely sisters well it shews how wide and far your bounty flows then why from me withhold your beams unvisited of heavnly dreams wheneer i aim at heights sublime still downward am i calld to seek some stubborn rhyme no hasty lightning breaks the gloom nor flashing thoughts unsought for come nor fancies wake in time of need i labour much with little speed and when my studied task is done too well alas i mark it for my own yet should you never smile on me and rugged still my verses be unpleasing to the tuneful train who only prize a slowing strain and still the learned scorn my lays ill lift my heart to you and sing your praise your varied ministry to trace your honourd names and godlike race and lofty bowrs where fountains flow theyll better sing who better know i praise ye not with grecian lyre nor will i hail ye daughters of a heathen fire ye are the spirits who preside in earth and air and ocean wide in hissing flood and crackling fire in horror dread and tumult dire in stilly calm and stormy wind and rule the answring changes in the human mind high on the tempestbeaten hill your misty shapes ye shift at will the wild fantastic clouds ye form your voice is in the midnight storm whilst in the dark and lonely hour oft starts the boldest heart and owns your secret powr from you when growling storms are past and lightning ceases on the wade and when the scene of blood is oer and groans of death are heard no more still holds the mind each parted form like after echoing of the oerpassed storm when closing glooms oerspread the day and what we love has passd away ye kindly bid each pleasing scene within the bosom still remain like moons who doth their watches run with the reflected brightness of the parted sun the shining day and nightly shade the cheerful plain and gloomy glade the homeward flocks and shepherds play the busy hamlets closing day full many a breast with pleasures swell who neer shall have the gift of words to tell oft when the moon looks from on high and black around the shadows lie and bright the sparkling waters gleam and rushes rustle by the stream shrill sounds and fairy forms are known by simple nighted swains who wander late alone ye kindle up the inward glow ye strengthen evry outward show ye overleap the strongest bar and join what nature sunders far and visit oft in fancies wild the bread of learned sage and simple child from him who wears a monarchs crown to the unletterd artless clown all in some strange and lonely hour have felt unsought your secret powr and lovd your roving fancies well you add but to the bard the art to tell ye mighty spirits of the song to whom the poets prayrs belong my lowly bosom to inspire and kindle with your sacred fire your wild obscuring heights to brave is boon alas too great for me to crave but o such sense of matter bring as they who feel and never sing wear on their hearts it will avail with simple words to tell my tale and still contented will i be tho greater inspirations never fall to me a melancholy lovers farewell to his mistress my phillis all my hopes are oer and i shall see thy face no more since evry secret wish is vain i will not stay to give thee pain then do not hang thy lowring brow but let me bless thee ere i go nor o despise my last adieu ive lovd thee long and lovd thee true the prospects of my youth are crost my health is flown my vigour lost my soothing friends augment my pain and cheerless is my native plain dark oer my spirit hangs the gloom and thy disdain has fixd my doom but light gales ruffle oer the sea which soon shall bear me far from thee and wherefoeer our course is cast i know will bear me to my rest full deep beneath the briny wave where rest the venturous and brave a place may be decreed for me and should no tempest raise the sea far hence upon a foreign land whose sons perhaps with friendly hand the strangers lowly tomb may raise a broken heart will end my days but heavens blessing on thee rest and may no troubles vex thy breast perhaps when pensive and alone youll think of me when i am gone and gentle tears of pity shed when i am in my narrow bed yet softly let thy

wishes be tho cruel thou hast been to me and dost thou then thine arm extend and may i take thy lovely hand and do thine eyes thus gently look as tho some kindly wish they spoke my gentle phillis tho severe i do not grudge the ills i bear but still my greatest grief will be to think my love has troubled thee o do not scorn this swelling grief the laden bosom seeks relief nor yet this infant weakness blame for thou hast made me what i am but hark the sailors call away no longer may i lingring stay may peace within thy mansion dwell o gentle phillis fare thee well a cheerful tempered lovers farewell to his mistress the light winds on the streamers play that soon shall bear me far away my comrades give the parting cheer and i alone have lingerd here now phill my love since it will

side well pleasd thy gamesome taunts to bide nor lovers gambols lightly try to make me graceful in thine eye nor sing the merry roundelay to cheer thee at the close of day yet neertheless tho we must part ill bear thee still upon my heart and oft ill fill the ruddy glass to toast my lovely scornful lass far hence upon a foreign shore still will i keep an open door and still my little fortune share with all who ever breathd my native air and who thy beauteous face hath seen or ever near thy dwelling been shall push about the flowing bowl and be the matter of the whole and evry woman for thy sake though proud and cruel as theyre weak shall in my walls protection find thou fairest of a fickle kind o dearly dearly have i paid thou little haughty cruel maid to give that inward peace to thee which thou hast taen away from me soft hast thou slept with bosom light whilst i have watchd the weary night and now i cross the surgy deep that thou mayst still untroubled sleep but in thine eyes what do i see that looks as tho they pitied me i thank thee phill yet be not sad i leave no blame upon thy head i would more gracd with pleasing make i had been better for thy sake but yet perhaps when i shall

to his mistress farewell thou haughty cruel fair upon thy brow no longer wear that sombre look of cold disdain thou neer shalt see my face again now evry silly wish is oer and fears and doubtings are no more all cruel as thou art to me long has my heart been fixd on thee on thee ive musd the livelong day and thought the weary night away ive tracd thy footsteps oer the green and shard thy rambles oft unseen ive lingerd near thee night and day when thou hast thought me far away ive watchd the turning of thy face and fondly markd thy moving grace and wept thy rising smiles to see ive been a fool for love of thee yet do not think i stay the while thy weakly pity to beguile let forced favour fruitless prove the pity curst that brings not love no woman eer shall give me pain or ever break my rest again nor aught that comes of woman kind have powr again to move my mind far on a foreign shore ill seek some lonely island bare and bleak ill seek some wild and rugged cell and with untamed creatures dwell to hear their cries is now my choice far more than mans deceitful voice to listen to the howling wind than luring tongue of womankind they look not beautiful and good but ronghsome seem as they are rude o phillis thou hast wreckd a heart which proudly bears but feels the smart adieu adieu shouldst thou eer prove the pang of illrequited love thoult know what i have borne for thee and then thou wilt remember me a poet or soundhearted lovers farewell to his mistress fair nymph who dost my fate controul and reignst the mistress of my soul where thou all bright in beauties ray hast held a long tyrannick sway they who the hardest rule maintain in their commands do still refrain from what impossible must prove but thou hast bade me cease to love nor would some gentle mercy give and only bid me cease to live ah when the magnets powr is oer the compass then will point no more and when no verdure cloaths the spring the tuneful birds forget to sing but thou all sweet and heavnly fair hast bade thy swain from love forbear in pity let thine own fair hand a deathswound to this bosom send this tender heart of purest faith may then resign thee with its breath and in the sunbeam of thine eye a proud and willing victim die but since thou wilt not have it so far from thy presence will i go far from my hearts dear bliss ill stray since i no longer can obey in foreign climes ill distant roam no more to hail my native home to foreign swains ill pour my woe in foreign plains my tears shall flow by murmring stream and shady grove shall other echoes tell my love and richer flowrs of vivid hue upon my tomb shall other maidens strew adieu dear phillis shouldft thou eer some soft and plaintive story hear of hapless youth who died for love or all forlorn did banishd rove o think of me nor then deny the gentle tribute of a sigh it may be objected that all these lovers are equally sad though one is a cheerful the other a melancholy lover it is true they are all equally sad for they are all equally in love and in despair when it is impossible for them to be otherwise but if i have pictured their farewell complaints in such a way as to give you an idea that one lover is naturally of a melancholy one of a cheerful and one of a proud temper i have done all that is intended the stormbeat maid somewhat after the style of our old english ballads all shrouded in the winter snow the maiden held her way nor chilly winds that roughly blow nor dark night could her stay oer hill and dale through bush and briar she on her journey kept save often when she gan to tire she stopd awhile and wept wild creatures left their caverns drear to raise their nightly yell but little doth the bosom fear where inward troubles dwell no watchlight from the distant spire to cheer the gloom so deep nor twinkling star nor cottage fire did thro the darkness peep yet heedless still she held her way nor feard the crag nor dell like ghost that thro the gloom to stray wakes with the midnight bell now night thro her dark watches ran which lock the peaceful mind and thro the neighbring hamlets gan to wake the yawning hind yet bark of dog nor village cock that spoke the morning near nor graylight trembling on the rock her nighted mind could cheer the whirling flail and clacking mill wake with the early day and careless children loud and shrill with newmade snowballs play and as she passd each cottage door they did their gambols cease and old men shook their locks so hoar and wishd her spirit peace for sometimes slow and sometimes fast she held her wavring pace like early springs inconstant blast that ruffles evenings face at length with weary feet she came where in a sheltring wood whose master bore no humble name a stately castle stood the open gate and smoking fires which cloud the air so thin and shrill bell tinkling from the spires bespoke a feast within with busy looks and hasty tread the servants cross the hall and many a page in buskins red await the masters call fair streaming bows of bridal white on evry shoulder playd and clean in lily kerchief dight tripd every houshold maid she askd for neither lord nor dame nor who the mansion ownd but straight into the hall she came and sat her on the ground the busy crew all crouded nigh and round the stranger stard but still she rolld her wandring eye nor for their questions card what dost thou want thou stormbeat maid that thou these portals past ill suiteth here thy looks dismayd thou art no bidden guest o chide not said a gentle page and wipd his tearwet cheek who would not shun the winters rage the wind is cold and bleak her robe is stiff with drizly snow and rent her mantle grey none ever bade the wretched go upon his weddingday then to his lord he hied him straight where round on silken seat sat many a courteous dame and knight and made obeisance meet there is a stranger in your hall who wears no common mien hard were the heart as flinty wall that would not take her in a fairer dame in hall or bower mine eyes did neer behold tho shelterd in no fathers tower and turnd out to the cold her face is like an early morn dimmd with the nightly dew her skin is like the sheeted torn her eyes are watry blue and tall and slender is her form like willow oer the brook but on her brow there broods a storm and restless is her look and well her troubled motions shew the tempest in her mind like the unshelterd sapling bough vexd with the wintry wind her head droops on her ungirt breast and scatterd is her hair yet lady bracd in courtly vest was never half so fair reverse and cold the turning blood the bridegrooms cheek forsook he shook and staggerd as he stood and falterd as he spoke so soft and fair i know a maid there is but only she a wretched man her love betrayed and wretched let him be deep frowning turnd the brides dark eye for bridal morn unmeet with trembling steps her lord did hie the stranger fair to greet tho loose in scatterd weeds arrayd and ruffled with the storm like lambkin from its fellows strayd he knew her graceful form but when he spyd her sunken eye and features sharp and wan he heavd a deep and heavy sigh and down the big tears ran why droops thy head thou lovely maid upon thy hand of snow is it because thy love betrayd that thou art brought so low quick from her eye the keen glance came who questiond her to see and oft she mutterd oer his name and wist not it was he full hard against his writhing brows his clenched hands he prest full high his labring bosom rose and rent its silken vest o cursed be the golden price that did my baseness prove and cursed be my friends advice that wild me from thy love and cursed be the womans art that lurd me to her snare and cursed be the faithless heart that left thee to despair yet now ill hold thee to my side tho worthless i have been nor friends nor wealth nor dizend bride shall ever stand between when thou art weary and depressd ill lull thee to thy sleep and when dark fancies vex thy breast ill sit by thee and weep ill tend thee like a restless child whereer thy rovings be nor gesture keen nor eyeball wild shall turn my love from thee night shall not hang cold oer thy head and i securely lie nor drizly clouds upon thee shed and i in covert dry ill share the cold blast on the heath ill share thy wants and pain nor friend nor foe nor life nor death shall ever make us twain thunder spirit of strength to whom in wrath tis given to mar the earth and shake the vasty heaven behold the gloomy robes that spreading hide thy secret majesty lo slow and wide thy heavy skirts sail in the middle air thy sultry shroud is oer the noonday glare th advancing clouds sublimely rolld on high deep in their pitchy volumes clothe the sky like hosts of gathring foes arrayd in death dread hangs their gloom upon the earth beneath it is thy hour the awful deep is still and laid to rest the wind of evry hill wild creatures of the forest homeward scour and in their dens with fear unwonted cowr pride in the lordly palace is forgot and in the lowly shelter of the cot the poor man sits with all his famly round in awful expectation of thy sound lone on his way the travller stands aghast the fearful looks of man to heavn are cast when lo thy lightning gleams on high as swiftly turns his startled eye and swiftly as thy shooting blaze each half performed motion stays deep awe all human strife and labour stills and thy dread voice alone the earth and heaven fills bright bursts the lightning from the clouds dark womb as quickly swallowd in the closing gloom the distant streamy flashes spread askance in paler sheetings skirt the wide expanse dread flaming from aloft the catract dire oft meets in middle space the nether fire fierce red and ragged shivring in the air athwart middarkness shoots the lengthend glare wild glancing round the feebler lightning plays the rifted centre pours the genral blaze and from the warring clouds in fury drivena red writhing falls the keen embodied bolt of heaven footnote a in poetry we have only to do with appearances and the zigzag lightning commonly thought to be the thunderbolt is certainly firm and embodied compared to the ordinary lightning which takes no distinct shape at all from the dark bowels of the burthend cloud dread swells the rolling peal full deepning loud wide rattling claps the heavens scatterd oer in gathered strength lift the tremendous roar with weaning force it rumbles over head then growling wears away to silence dread now waking from afar in doubled might slow rolling onward to the middle height like crash of mighty mountains downward hurld like the upbreaking of a wrecking world in dreadful majesty th explosion grand bursts wide and awful oer the trembling land the lofty mountains echo back the roar deep from afar rebounds earths rocky shore all else existing in the senses bound is lost in the immensity of sound wide jarring sounds by turns in strength convene and deep and terrible the solemn pause between aloft upon the mountains side the kindled forest blazes wide huge fragments of the rugged deep are tumbled to the lashing deep firm rooted in the cloven rock loud crashing falls the stubborn oak the lightning keen in wasteful ire fierce darting on the lofty spire wide rends in twain the irnknit stone and stately towrs are lowly thrown wild flames oerscour the wide campaign and plough askance the hissing main nor strength of man may brave the storm nor shelter skreen the shrinking form nor castle wall its fury stay nor masy gate may bar its way it visits those of low estate it shakes the dwellings of the great it looks athwart the secret tomb and glares upon the prisons gloom while dungeons deep in unknown light flash hidious on the wretches fight and lowly groans the downward cell where deadly silence wont to dwell now upcast eyes to heavn adore and knees that never bowd before in stupid wonder flares the child the maiden turns her glances wild and lifts to hear the coming roar the aged shake their locks so hoar and stoutest hearts begin to fail and many a manly cheek is pale till nearer closing peals astound and crashing ruin mingles round then numbing fear awhile upbinds the pausing action of their minds till wakd to dreadful sense they lift their eyes and round the stricken corse shrill shrieks of horror rise now thinly spreads the falling hall a motly winter oer the vale the hailstones bounding as they fall on hardy rock or stormbeat wall the loud beginning peal its fury checks now full now fainter with irreglar breaks then weak in force unites the scatterd found and rolls its lengthend grumblings to the distant bound a thick and muddy whiteness clothes the sky in paler flashes gleams the lightning by and thro the rent cloud silverd with his ray the sun looks down on all this wild affray as high enthrond above all mortal ken a greater powr beholds the strife of men yet oer the distant hills the darkness scowls and deep and long the parting tempest growls wind powr uncontrollable who holdst thy sway in the unbounded air whose trackless way is in the firmament unknown of fight who bendst the sheeted heavens in thy might and liftst the ocean from its lowest bed to join in middle space the conflict dread who oer the peopled earth in ruin scours and buffets the firm rock that proudly lowrs thy signs are in the heavns the upper clouds draw shapeless oer the sky their misty shrowds whilst darker fragments rove in lower bands and mournful purple cloaths the distant lands in gatherd tribes upon the hanging peak the seafowl scream illomend creatures shriek unwonted sounds groan on the distant wave and murmurs deep break from the downward cave unlookdfor gusts the quiet forests shake and speak thy comingawful powr awake like burst of mighty waters wakes the blast in wide and boundless sweep thro regions vast the floods of air in loosend fury drive and meeting currents strong and fiercely strive first wildly raving on the mountains brow tis heard afar till oer the plains below with even rushing force it bears along and gradual swelling louder full and strong breaks wide in scatterd bellowing thro the air now is it hushd to calm now rousd to war whilst in the pauses of the nearer blast the farther gusts howl from the distant waste now rushing furious by with loosend sweep now rolling grandly on solemn and deep its bursting strength the full embodied sound in wide and shallow brawlings scatters round then wild in eddies shrill with rage distraught and force exhausted whistles into naught with growing might arising in its room from far like waves of ocean onward come succeeding gusts and spend their wasteful ire then slow in grumbled mutterings retire and solemn stillness overawes the land save where the tempest growls along the distant strand but great in doubled strength afar and wide returning battle wakes on evry side and rolling on with full and threatning sound in wildly mingled fury closes round with bellowings loud and hollow deepning swell reiterated hiss and whistlings shrill fierce wars the varied storm with fury tore till all is overwhelmd in one tremendous roar the vexed forest tossing wide uprooted strews its fairest pride the lofty pine in twain is broke and crushing falls the knotted oak the huge rock trembles in its might the proud towr tumbles from its height uncoverd stands the social home high rocks aloft the city dome whilst bursting bar and flapping gate and crashing roof and clattring grate and hurling wall and falling spire mingle in jarring din and ruin dire wild ruin scours the works of men their motly fragments strew the plain een in the deserts pathless waste uncouth destruction marks the blast and hollow caves whose secret pride grotesque and grand was never eyd by mortal man abide its drift of many a goodly pillar reft fierce whirling mounts the desert sand and threats aloft the peopld land the great expanded ocean heaving wide rolls to the farthest bound its lashing tide whilst in the middle deep afar are seen all stately from the sunken gulfs between the towring waves which bend with hoary brow then dash impetuous to the deep below with broader sweepy base in gatherd might majestic swelling to stupendous height the mountain billow lifts its awful head and curving breaks aloft with roarings dread sublimer still the mighty waters rise and mingle in the strife of nether skies all wildness and uproar above beneath a world immense of danger dread and death in dumb despair the sailor stands the frantic merchant wrings his hands adventrous hope clings to the yard and sinking wretches shriek unheard whilst on the land the matron ill at rest thinks of the distant main and heaves her heavy breast the peasants leave their ruind home and oer the fields distracted roam insensible the numbed infant sleeps and helpless bending age weak and unshelterd weeps low shrinking fear in place of state skulks in the dwellings of the great the rich man marks with careful eye each wasteful gust that whistles by and ill men feard with fancied screams sit listning to the creaking beams at break of evry rising squall on stormbeat roof or ancient wall full many a glance of fearful eye is upward cast till from on high from cracking joist and gaping rent and falling fragments warning sent loud wakes around the wild affray tis all confusion and dismay now powerful but inconstant in its course the tempest varies with uncertain force like doleful wailings on the lonely waste solemn and dreary sounds the weaning blast exhausted gusts recoiling growl away and wakd anew return with feebler sway save where between the ridgy mountains pent the fierce imprisond current strives for vent with hollow howl and lamentation deep then rushes oer the plain with partial sweep a parting gust oerscours the weary land and lowly growls along the distant strand light thro the wood the shivring branches play and on the ocean far it slowly dies away an address to the night a fearful mind uncertain awful as the gloom of death the nights grim shadows cover all beneath shapeless and black is evry object round and lost in thicker gloom the distant bound each swelling height is clad with dimmer shades and deeper darkness marks the hollow glades the moon in heavy clouds her glory veils and slow along their passing darkness sails while lesser clouds in parted fragments roam and red stars glimmer thro the rivers gloom nor cheerful voice is heard from mans abode nor sounding footsteps on the neighbring road nor glimmring fire the distant cottage tells on all around a fearful stillness dwells the mingled noise of industry is laid and silence deepens with the nightly shade though still the haunts of men and shut their light thou art not silent dark mysterious night the cries of savage creatures wildly break upon thy quiet birds illomend shriek commotions strange disturb the rustling trees and heavy plaints come on the passing breeze far on the lonely waste and distant way unwonted sounds are heard unknown of day with shrilly screams the haunted cavern rings and heavy treading of unearthly things sounds loud and hollow thro the ruind dome yea voices issue from the secret tomb but lo a sudden flow of bursting light what wild surrounding scenes break on the sight huge rugged rocks uncouthly lowr on high whilst on the plain their lengthend shadows lie the wooded banks in streamy brightness glow and waving darkness skirts the flood below the roving shadow hastens oer the stream and like a ghosts pale shrowd the waters glean black fleeting shapes across the valley stray gigantic forms towr on the distant way the sudden winds in wheeling eddies change tis all confusd unnatural and strange now all again in horrid gloom is lost wild wakes the breeze like sound of distant host bright shoots along the swift returning light succeeding shadows close the startled sight some restless spirit holds the nightly sway long is the wild and doubtful is my way inconstant night whateer thy changes be it suits not man to be alone with thee o for the sheltring roof of lowest kind secure to rest with others of my hind an address to the night a discontented mind how thick the clouds of night are rangd oer head confounding darkness oer the earth is spread the clouded moon her cheering countnance hides and feeble stars between the ragged sides of broken clouds with unavailing ray look thro to mock the travller on his way tree bush and rugged rock and hollow dell in deeper shades their forms confusdly tell to cheat the weary wandrers doubtful eye whilst chilly passing winds come ruffling by and tangled briars perplex the darkend pass and slimy reptiles glimmer on the grass and stinging nightflies spend their cursed spite unhospitable are thy shades o night now hard suspicion bars the creaking door and safe within the selfish worldlings snore and wealthy fools are warm in downy bed and houseless beggars shelter in the shed and nestling coveys cowr beneath the brake while prowling mischief only is awake each hole and den fends forth its cursed brood and savage bloody creatures range the wood the thievish vagrant plies his thriftless trade beneath the friendly shelter of the shade whilst boldest risk the lawless robber braves the day for fools was made and night for knaves o welcome kindly moon thy light display and guide a weary travller on his way hill wood and valley brighten in her beam and wavy silver glitters on the stream the distant pathway shews distinct and clear from far inviting but perplexd when near for blackning shadows add deceitful length and lesser objects gain unwonted strength each step misguiding to the eye unknown the shining gutter from the glistning stone while crossing shadows checker oer the ground the more perplexing for the brightness round deceitful are thy smiles untoward night thy gloom is better than misguiding light then welcome is yon cloud that onward fails and all this glary shew in darkness veils but see how soon the fleeting shade is past and streamy brightness moots across the waste now fly the shadows borne upon the wind succeeding brightness travels fast behind and now it lowrs again inconstant night confound thy freaks be either dark or light yet let them come whateer thy changes be i was a fool to put my trust in thee an address to the night a sorrowful mind how lone and dreary hangs the sombre night oer wood and valley stream and craggy height while nearer objects bush and waving bough their dark uncertain forms but dimly show like those with which disturbed fancies teem and shape the scenry of a gloomy dream the moon is coverd with her sable shrowd and oer the heavus rove many a dusky cloud thro ragged rents the paly sky is seen and feebly glance the twinkling stars between whilst earth below is wrapt in stilly gloom all sad and silent as the closed tomb no bleating flock is heard upon the vale nor lowing kine upon the open dale nor voice of hunter on the lonely heath nor sound of travller on the distant path shut is the fenced door of mans abode and ruffling breezes only are abroad how mournful is thy voice o nightly gale across the wood or down the narrow vale and sad tho secret and unknown they be the sighs of woeful hearts that wake with thee for now no friends the haunts of sorrow seek tears hang unchidden on the mourners cheek no sidelook vexes from the curious eye nor calm reproving reasoner is by the kindly cumbrous visitor is gone and laden spirits love to sigh alone o night wild sings the wind deep lowrs the shade thy robe is gloomy and thy voice is sad but weary souls confind in earthly cell are deep in kindred gloom and love thee well but now the veiling darkness passes by the moon unclouded holds the middle sky a soft and mellow light is oer the wood and silvry pureness sparkles on the flood white towr the clifts from many a craggy breach the brown heath shews afar its dreary stretch while fairer as the brightend object swells fast by its side the darker shadow dwells the lofty mountains form the deeper glade and keener light but marks the blacker made then welcome yonder clouds that swiftly sail and oer yon glary opning draw the veil but ah too swiftly flies the friendly shade returning brightness travels up the glade and all is light again o fickle night no traveller is here to bless thy light i seek nor home nor shed i have no way why send thy beams to one who can not stray or wood or desert is the same to me o lowr again and let me rest with thee an address to the night a joyful mind the warping gloom of night is gatherd round and varied darkness marks the uneven ground a dimmer shade is on the mountains brow and deeper lowrs the lengthend vale below while nearer objects all enlarged and dark their strange and shapeless forms uncouthly mark which thro muddy night are dimly shown like old companions in a garb unknown the heavy sheeted clouds are spread on high and streaky darkness bounds the farther sky and swift along the lighter vagrants sweep whilst clear stars thro their riven edges peep soft thro each ragged breach and streamy rent and open gaps in dusky circle pent the upper heaven looks serenely bright in dappled gold and snowy fleeces dight and on the middle current lightly glides the lesser cloud with silver wreathy sides in sudden gusts awakes the nightly breeze across the wood and rustles thro the trees or whistles on the plain with eddying sweep or issues from the glen in wailings deep which die away upon the open vale whilst in the pauses of the ruffling gale the buzzing nightfly rises from the ground and wings his flight in many a mazy round and lonely owls begin their nightly strain so hateful to the ear of nighted swain thou dost the weary travller mislead thy voice is roughsome and uncooth thy weed o gloomy night for black thy shadows be and fools have raisd a bad report on thee yet art thou free and friendly to the gay and light hearts prize thee equal to the day now tiresome plodding folks are gone to rest and soothing slumber locks the careful breast and telltale friends and wise advisers snore and softly slipshod youths unbar the door now footsteps echo far and watchdogs bark worms glow and cats eyes glitter in the dark the vagrant lover crosses moor and hill and near the lowly cottage whistles shrill or bolder grown beneath the friendly shade taps at the window of his favrite maid who from above his simple tale receives whilst stupid matrons start and think of thieves now daily fools unbar the narrow soul all wise and genrous oer the nightly bowl the haunted wood receives its motley host by travller shund tho neither fag nor ghost and there the crackling bonfire blazes red while merry vagrants feast beneath the shed from sleepless beds unquiet spirits rise and cunning wags put on their borrowd guise whilst silly maidens mutter oer their boon and crop their fairy weeds beneath the moon and harmless plotters slyly take the road and trick and playful mischief is abroad but lo the moon looks forth in splendour bright fair and unclouded from her middle height the passing cloud unveils her kindly ray and slowly sails its weary length away while broken fragments from its fleecy side in dusky bands before it swiftly glide their misty texture changing with the wind a strange and scatterd group of motley kind as ever earth or fruitful ocean fed or ever youthful poets fancy bred his surgy length the wreathing serpent trails and by his side the rugged camel sails the winged griffith follows close behind and spreads his dusky pinions to the wind athwart the sky in scatterd bands they range from shape to shape transformd in endless change then piece meal torn in ragged portions stray or thinly spreading slowly melt away a softer brightness covers all below hill dale and wood in mellowd colours glow high towrs the whitend rock in added strength the brown heath shews afar its dreary length the winding river glitters on the vale and gilded trees wave in the passing gale upon the ground each blackning shadow lies and hasty darkness oer the valley flies wide sheeting shadows travel oer the plain and swiftly close upon the varied scene return o lovely moon and look from high all stately riding in thy motled sky yet o thy beams in hasty visits come as swiftly followd by the fleeting gloom o night thy smiles are short and short thy shade thou art a freakish friend and all unstayd yet from thy varied changes who are free full many an honest friend resembles thee then let my doubtful footsteps darkling stray thy next fair beam will set me on my way een take thy freedom whether rough or kind i came not forth to quarrel with the wind to fear o thou before whose haggard eyes a thousand images arise whose forms of horror none may see but with a soul disturbd by thee wilt thon for ever haunt mankind and glare upon the darkend mind wheneer thou enterest a breast thou robbst it of its joy and rest and terrible and strange to tell on what that mind delights to dwell the ruffians knife with reeking blade the stranger murderd in his bed the howling wind the raging deep the sailors cries the sinking ship the awful thunder breaking round the yauning gulf the rocking ground the precipice whose lowring brow oerhangs the horrid deep below and tempts the wretch worn out with strife of worldly cares to end his life but when thou raisest to the fight unearthly forms that walk the night the chilly blood with magic art runs backward on the stoutest heart lo in his post the soldier standssee spectator no the deadly weapon in his hands in front of death he rushes on renown with life is cheaply won whilst all his soul with ardour burns and to the thickest danger turns but see the man alone unbent a churchyard near and twilight spent returning late to his abode upon an unfrequented road no choice is left his feet must tread the awful dwelling of the dead in foul mist doth the pale moon wade no twinkling star breaks thro the shade thick rows of trees increase the gloom and awful silence of the tomb swift to his thoughts unbidden throng full many a tale forgotten long of ghosts who at the dead of night walk round their graves all wrapt in white and oer the churchyard dark and drear becken the traveller to draw near and restless sprites who from the ground just as the midnight clock doth sound rise slowly to a dreadful height then vanish quickly from the fight and wretches who returning home by chance have stumbled near some tomb athwart a coffin or a bone and three times heard a hollow groan with fearful steps he takes his way and shrinks and wishes it were day he starts and quakes at his own tread but dare not turn about his head some sound he hears on evry side and thro the trees strange phantoms glide his heart beats thick against his breast and hardly stays within its chest wild and unsettled are his eyes his quickend hairs begin to rise ghastly and strong his features grow the cold dew trickles from his brow whilst grinning beat his clattring teeth and loosend knock his joints beneath as to the charnel he draws nigh the whitend tombstone strikes his eye he starts he stops his eyeballs glare and settle in a deathlike stare deep hollow sounds ring in his ear such sounds as dying wretches hear when the grim dreaded tyrant calls a horrid sound he groans and falls thou dost our fairest hope destroy thou art a gloom oer evry joy unheeded let my dwelling be o fear but far removd from thee a story of other times somewhat in imitation of the poems of ossian lathmor but why dost thou stop on the way and hold me thus hard in thy grasp it was but the voice of the winds from the deep narrow glens of glanarven allen the heath is unruffled around and the oak oer thy head is at rest calm swells the moon on the lake and nothing is heard in the reeds sad was the sound o my father but it was not the voice of the wind lathmor what dark towring rock do i see midst the grey spreading mist of the hills this is not the vale of clanarven my son we have errd from the way allen it is not a dark towring rock midst the grey settled mist of the hills tis a dark towr of strength which thou seest and the ocean spreads dimly behind it lathmor then here will we stop for the night for the towr of arthula is near proceed not my son on the way for it was not the voice of the wind the ghost of the valliant is forth and it mourns round the place of its woe the trayller oft hears it at midnight and turns him aside from its haunt the sharp moon is spent in her course and the way of the desert is doubtful this oak with his wide leavy branches will shelter our heads from the night and ill tell thee a story of old since the towr of arthula is near from the walls of his strength came lochallen with his broad chested sons of the hills he was strong as a bull of the forest and keen as a bird of the rock his friends of the chace were around him the sons of the heroes of mora they were clad in the strength of their youth and the sound of their arms rung afar for uthal had led his dark host from the blue misty isle of his power and oerspread like a cloud of the desert the land of the whiteheaded lorma of lorma who sat in the hall and lamented the sons of his youth for orvina remained alone to support the frail steps of his age he sent to the king of ithona he remembered the love of his father and lochallen soon joind him on loarn with the high minded chieftains of mora loud was the sound of the battle and many the slain of the field red was the sword of lochallen it was red with the blood of the brave for his eye sought the combat of heroes and the mighty withstood not his arm he ragd like a flame on the heath and the enemy fled from his face but short was the triumph of lorma the hour of his fading was near whilst a bard raisd the song of the battle his dim eyes were closed in death he fell like a ruined towr like a fragment of times that are past like a rock whose foundation is worn with the lashes of many a wave four grey head warriors of lorma remaind from the days of his youth they mournd oer the fall of their lord and they bore him to his dark narrow house his memorial was raisd on the hill and the lovely orvina wept over it she bent her fair form oer the heap and her sorrow was silent and gentle it flowd like the pure twinkling dream beneath the green shade of the fern the hunters oft bless it at noon tho the strangers perceive not its course the wind of the hill raisd her locks and lochallen beheld her in grief the soul of the hero was knit to the teareyed daughter of lorma she was graceful and tall as the willow that bends oer the deep shady stream her eye like a sunbeam on water that gleams thro the dark skirting reeds her hair like the light wreathing cloud that floats on the brow of the hill when the beam of the morning is there and it scatters its skirts to the wind lovely and soft were her smiles like a glimpse from the white riven cloud when the sun hastens over the lake and a summer showr ruffles its bosom her voice was the sweet sound of midnight that visits the ear of the bard when he darts from the place of his slumber and calls on some far distant friend she was fair mongst the maids of her time and she softend the wrath of the mighty their eyes lightend up in her presence they dropt their dark spears as she spoke lochallen was firm in his strength and unmovd in the battle of heroes like a rockfenced isle of the ocean that shews its dark head thro the storm his brow was like a cliff on the shore that forewarneth the hunters of ithona for there gleams the first ray of morning and there broods the mist ere the storm it shone and it darkend by turns as the strength of his passions arose he was terrible as a gathering storm when his soul learnt the wrongs of the feeble his eye was the lightning of shields he was swift as a blast in its course when the warriours returnd from the field and the sons of the mighty assembled he was graceful as the light towring cloud that rises from the blue bounded main gentle and fair was his form in the towrs of the hilly ithona his voice cheerd the soul of the sad he would sport with a child in the hall matchless in the days of their love were lochallen and the daughter of lorma but their beauty has ceasd on arthula and the place of their rest is unknown the family of lorma has faild and strangers rejoice in his hall but voices of sorrow are heard when the stillness of midnight is there the stranger is wakd with the sound and enquires of the race that is gone but wherefore thus doleful and sad do ye wander alone on arthula why look ye thus lonely and sad ye children of the dark narrow house your names shall be known in the song when the fame of the mighty is low allen from what cloud of the hills do they look for i see not their forms o my father lathmor why dost thou tremble my son thou hast fought in the battle of shields they lookd from no cloud of the hills but the soul of thy father beheld them lochallen returnd from the field to the seabeaten tower of arthula five days he abode in the hall and they passd like a glimpse of the sun when the clouds of the tempest are rent and the green island smiles midst the storm on the sixth a cloud hung on his brow and his eye shund the looks of his friends he spoke to the maid of his soul and the trouble of his bosom was great pleasant is the hall of my love but the storm gathers round us orvina i must go to the island of uthal and scatter his gathering force but like a cleft oak of the forest ill quickly return to my love when the hard wedge is drawn from its side it returns to itself again the daughter of lorma was silent she turnd her fair face from his sight go to the war son of mora and the strength of thy fathers go with thee i will sit on the high rocky shore and look oer the wide foaming sea i will watch evry blue rising cloud till i see thy dark vessels return he gatherd his warriours around him they darkend the brown rugged shore the rocks echod wide to their cries and loud was the dashing of oars orvina stood high on a rock that hung oer the deep lashing main big swelld the tear in her eye and high heavd the sighs of her bosom as she saw the white billows encreasing between his dark ship and the shore her fixed eye followd its course oer many a far distant wave till its broad sails and high towring mast but appeard like a speck on the waters yet still she beheld in her fancy the form of her love on its side and she stretched her white arms to the ocean and wavd her loose girdle on high soon reachd the sons of ithona the blue misty isle of their foe like the pent up dogs of the hunter when let loose from their prison of night who snuff up the air of the morning and rejoice at the voice of the chace they leapt from the sides of their vessels and spread oer the wide sounding shore thick on the brown heathy plain were spread the dark thousands of uthal the warriours of lochallen were few but their fathers were known in the song like a small rapid stream of the hills when it falls on the broad settled lake and troubles its dark muddy bosom and dashes its waters aloft so rushd the keen sons of ithona on the thick gatherd host of the foe red gleamd the arms of the brave thro the brown rising dust of the field fierce glard the eyes of lochallen he fought the dark face of his enemy he found the grim king of the isle but the strength of his chieftains was round him come forth in thy might said lochallen come forth to the combat of kings great is the might of thy warriours but where is the strength of thine arms youth of ithona said uthal thy fathers were mighty in battle return to thy brown woody hills till the hair is grown dark on thy cheek then come from the towrs of thy safety a foe less unworthy of uthal but thou lovest a weakly enemy foe of the white haired chief thou lovest a foe that is weak said the red swelling pride of lochallen seest thou this sword of my youth it is red with the blood of thy heroes come forth in the strength of thine years and hand its dark blade in thy hall he lifted a spear in his wrath oer the head of his high worded foe but the strength of his chieftains was there and it rung on their broad spreading shields he turned himself scornful away to look for some nobler enemy he met thee fair son of hidallo as chaffing he strode in his wrath but thou never didst turn from the valiant youth of the far distant land fierce fought the heroes and wonderd each chief at the might of his foe they found themselves matched in strength and they fought in the pride of their souls bloody and long was the fight but the arm of lochallen prevaild ah why did you combat ye heroes ah why did ye meet in the field your souls had been brothers of love had ye met in the dwellings of peace he was like to thyself son of mora where his voice cheerd the heart of the stranger in the far distant hall of his father who never shall hear it again he was like to thyself whom thou slewest and he fell in his youth like thee the maid of thy bosom is lovely thou fair fallen son of the stranger she sits on her high hanging bower and looks to the way of thy promise she combs down her long yellow hair and prepares a fine robe for thy coming she starts at the voice of the breeze and runs to the door of her bowr but thou art a dim misty form on the clouds of far distant hills fierce was the rage of the battle and terrible the clanging of arms loud were the shouts of the mighty like the wide scatterd thunder of lora when its voice is returnd from the rocks and it strengthens in its broad spreading course heavy were the groans of the dying the voice of the fallen was sad like the deep prisond winds of the cavern when the roar of the tempest is laid the sons of ithona were terrible the enemy fled from before them like the dark gatherd fowls of the ocean that flock to the shore ere a storm they fled from the might of their foes and the darkness of night closd around them cold rose the wind of the desert and blew oer the dark bloody field sad was its voice on the heath where it lifted the locks of the dead hollow roard the sea at a distance the ghosts of the slain shriekd aloud pale shady forms stalkd around and their airy swords gleamd thro the night for the spirits of warriours departed came born on the deep rushing blast there haild they their new fallen sons and the sound of their meeting was terrible at a distance was gatherd ithona round many a bright flaming oak till morning rose red oer the main like a new bloody field of battle lochallen assembled his heroes they rangd oer the land of their enemy but they found not the king in the field and the walls of his strength were deserted then spoke the friend of his bosom the dark haired chief of trevallen why seek you the king in his towrs he is fled to the caves of his fear let us fly said the chief of ithona let us fly to the daughter of lorma let us fight with man in the field but pull not a deer from his den two days they buried their dead and raisd their memorial on high on the third day they loosend their vessels and left the blue isle of their fame the darkness of night was around when the bay of arthula receivd them thick beat the joy of his bosom as he drew near the place of his love but the strength of his limbs was unloosd as he trode on the dark sounding shore thou didst promise o maid of my soul thou didst promise to watch for thy love but no kindly messenger waits to hail my return from the war the towr of arthula is dark and i hear not the sound of its hall the watch dog howls to the night nor heeds the approach of our feet he seized a bright flaming brand and he hastend his steps to the towr wide stood the black lowring gate and deep was the silence within hollow and loud rung his steps as he trode thro the dark empty hall he flew to the bowr of his love it was still as the chamber of death his eyes searchd wildly around him he calld on the name of his love but his own voice returned alone from the deepsounding walls of the towr he leant with his back to the wall and crossd his arms over his breast heavy sunk his head on his shoulder the blue flame burnt double before him a voice like the evening breeze when it steals down the bed of the river came softly and sad to his ear and he raised his drooping head the form of his love stood before him yet it was not the form of his love for fixed and dim was her eye and the beams of her beauty were fled she was pale as the white frozen lake when it gleams to the light of the moon her garments were heavy and drenchd and the streams trickled fast from her hair she was like a snowcrusted tree in winter when it drops to the midday sun o seek not for me son of moro in the light cheerful dwellings of men for low is my bed in the deep and cold is the place of my rest the sea monster sports by my side and the watersnake twines round my neck but do not forget me lochallen o think on the days of our love i sat on the high rocky shore mine eyes lookd afar oer the ocean i saw two dark ships on the waves and quick beat the joy of my breast one vessel drew near to the shore and six warriours leapt from its side i hastend to meet thee my love but mine ear met the stern voice of uthal i thought that my hero was slain and i felt me alone in my weakness i felt me deserted and lonely i flew to the steep hanging rock i threw my robe over my head and i hid me in the dark closing deep yet o do not leave me lochallen to waste in my watery bed but raise me a tomb on the hill where the daughter of lorma should lie the voice of her sorrow did cease and her form passed quickly away it passd like the pale shivring light that is lost in the dark closing cloud but lo the first light of the morning is red on the skirts of the heavens let us go on my journey my son for the length of the heath is before us allen it is not the light of the morn which thou seest on the skirts of the heavens it is but a clear shivring brightness that changes its hue to the night i have seen it like a bloodyspread robe when it hung oer the waves of the north sad was the fate of his love but how fell the king of ithona i have heard of the strength of his arm did he fall in the battle of heroes lathmor he fell in the strength of his youth but he fell not in battle my son he knew not the sword of a foe yet he died not the death of the peaceful they carried them both to the hill but the place of their rest is unknown allen but feeble and spent is thy voice thou grey haired bard of the hill lathmor long is this song of the night and i feel not the strength of my youth allen then let us go on our way let us go by the way of the heath for it is the fair light of the morning which thou seest on the far bounding waves slowly it grows in its beauty and promises good to the traveller red are the small broken clouds that hang on the skirts of the heavens deep glows the clear open sky with the light of the yet hidden sun save where the dark narrow cloud hath stretched its vast length oer the heavens and the clear ruddy brightness behind it looks fair thro its blue streaming lines a bloom like the far distant heath is dark on the wide roving clouds the broad wavy breast of the ocean is grand in the beauty of morning thick rests the white settled mist on the deep rugged clifts of the shore and the grey rocks look dimly between like the high distant isles in a calm but grim lowr the walks of arthula the light of the morn is behind them lathmor dark lowrs the towr of arthula the time of its glory is past the valiant have ceasd from its hall and the son of the stranger is there the works of the mighty remain but they are the vapour of morning a mother to her waking infant now

when sudden wakes the bitter shriek and redder swells thy little cheek when rattled keys thy woe beguile and thro the wet eye gleams the smile still for thy weakly self is spent thy little silly plaint but when thy friends are in distress thoult laugh and chuckle neer the less nor een with sympathy be smitten tho all are sad but thee and kitten yet little varlet that thou art thou twitchest at the heart thy rosy cheek so soft and warm thy pinky hand and dimpled arm thy silken locks that scantly peep with goldtipd ends where circle deep around thy neck in harmless grace so soft and
