the two tower be the second part of the lord of the ring chapter the departur of boromir aragorn sped on up the hill everi now and again he bent to the ground hobbit go light and their footprint are not easi even for a ranger to read but not far from the top a spring cross the path and in the wet earth he saw what he wa seek i read the sign aright he said to himself frodo ran to the hilltop i wonder what he saw there but he return by the same way and went down the hill again aragorn hesit he desir to go to the high seat himself hope to see there someth that would guid him in hi perplex but time wa press suddenli he leap forward and ran to the summit across the great flagston and up the step then sit in the high seat he look out but the sun seem darken and the world dim and remot he turn from the north back again to north and saw noth save the distant hill unless it were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagl high in the air descend slowli in wide circl down toward the earth even as he gaze hi quick ear caught sound in the woodland below on the west side of the river he stiffen there were cri and among them to hi horror he could distinguish the harsh voic of orc then suddenli with a deepthroat call a great horn blew and the blast of it smote the hill and echo in the hollow rise in a mighti shout abov the roar of the fall the horn of boromir he cri he is in need he sprang down the step and away leap down the path ala an ill fate is on me thi day and all that i do goe amiss where is sam as he ran the cri came louder but fainter now and desper the horn wa blow fierc and shrill rose the yell of the orc and suddenli the horncal ceas aragorn race down the last slope but befor he could reach the hill foot the sound die away and as he turn to the left and ran toward them they retreat until at last he could hear them no more draw hi bright sword and cri elendil elendil he crash through the tree a mile mayb from parth galen in a littl glade not far from the lake he found boromir he wa sit with hi back to a great tree as if he wa rest but aragorn saw that he wa pierc with mani blackfeath arrow hi sword wa still in hi hand but it wa broken near the hilt hi horn cloven in two wa at hi side mani orc lay slain pile all about him and at hi feet aragorn knelt besid him boromir open hi eye and strove to speak at last slow word came i tri to take the ring from frodo he said i am sorri i have paid hi glanc stray to hi fallen enemi twenti at least lay there they have gone the halfl the orc have taken them i think they are not dead orc bound them he paus and hi eye close wearili after a moment he spoke again farewel aragorn go to mina tirith and save my peopl i have fail no said aragorn take hi hand and kiss hi brow you have conquer few have gain such a victori be at peac mina tirith shall not fall boromir smile which way did they go wa frodo there said aragorn but boromir did not speak again ala said aragorn thu pass the heir of denethor lord of the tower of guard thi is a bitter end now the compani is all in ruin it is i that have fail vain wa gandalf trust in me what shall i do now boromir ha laid it on me to go to mina tirith and my heart desir it but where are the ring and the bearer how shall i find them and save the quest from disast he knelt for a while bent with weep still clasp boromir hand so it wa that legola and gimli found him they came from the western slope of the hill silent creep through the tree as if they were hunt gimli had hi axe in hand and legola hi long knife all hi arrow were spent when they came into the glade they halt in amaz and then they stood a moment with head bow in grief for it seem to them plain what had happen ala said legola come to aragorn side we have hunt and slain mani orc in the wood but we should have been of more use here we came when we heard the hornbut too late it seem i fear you have taken deadli hurt boromir is dead said aragorn i am unscath for i wa not here with him he fell defend the hobbit while i wa away upon the hill the hobbit cri gimli where are they then where is frodo i do not know answer aragorn wearili befor he die boromir told me that the orc had bound them he did not think that they were dead i sent him to follow merri and pippin but i did not ask him if frodo or sam were with him not until it wa too late all that i have done today ha gone amiss what is to be done now first we must tend the fallen said legola we can not leav him lie like carrion among these foul orc but we must be swift said gimli he would not wish us to linger we must follow the orc if there is hope that ani of our compani are live prison but we do not know whether the ringbear is with them or not said aragorn are we to abandon him must we not seek him first an evil choic is now befor us then let us do first what we must do said legola we have not the time or the tool to buri our comrad fitli or to rais a mound over him a cairn we might build the labour would be hard and long there are no stone that we could use nearer than the watersid said gimli then let us lay him in a boat with hi weapon and the weapon of hi vanquish foe said aragorn we will send him to the fall of rauro and give him to anduin the river of gondor will take care at least that no evil creatur dishonour hi bone quickli they search the bodi of the orc gather their sword and cloven helm and shield into a heap see cri aragorn here we find token he pick out from the pile of grim weapon two knive leafblad damask in gold and red and search further he found also the sheath black set with small red gem no orctool these he said they were born by the hobbit doubtless the orc despoil them but fear to keep the knive know them for what they are work of westerness wound about with spell for the bane of mordor well now if they still live our friend are weaponless i will take these thing hope against hope to give them back and i said legola will take all the arrow that i can find for my quiver is empti he search in the pile and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamag and longer in the shaft than such arrow as the orc were accustom to use he look at them close and aragorn look on the slain and he said here lie mani that are not folk of mordor some are from the north from the misti mountain if i know anyth of orc and their kind and here are other strang to me their gear is not after the manner of orc at all there were four goblinsoldi of greater statur swart slantey with thick leg and larg hand they were arm with short broadblad sword not with the curv scimitar usual with orc and they had bow of yew in length and shape like the bow of men upon their shield they bore a strang devic a small white hand in the centr of a black field on the front of their iron helm wa set an srune wrought of some white metal i have not seen these token befor said aragorn what do they mean s is for sauron said gimli that is easi to read nay said legola sauron doe not use the elfrun neither doe he use hi right name nor permit it to be spelt or spoken said aragorn and he doe not use white the orc in the servic of baraddûr use the sign of the red eye he stood for a moment in thought s is for saruman i guess he said at length there is evil afoot in isengard and the west is no longer safe it is as gandalf fear by some mean the traitor saruman ha had news of our journey it is like too that he know of gandalf fall pursuer from moria may have escap the vigil of lórien or they may have avoid that land and come to isengard by other path orc travel fast but saruman ha mani way of learn news do you rememb the bird well we have no time to ponder riddl said gimli let us bear boromir away but after that we must guess the riddl if we are to choos our cours rightli answer aragorn mayb there is no right choic said gimli take hi axe the dwarf now cut sever branch these they lash togeth with bowstr and spread their cloak upon the frame upon thi rough bier they carri the bodi of their companion to the shore togeth with such trophi of hi last battl as they chose to send forth with him it wa onli a short way yet they found it no easi task for boromir wa a man both tall and strong at the watersid aragorn remain watch the bier while legola and gimli hasten back on foot to parth galen it wa a mile or more and it wa some time befor they came back paddl two boat swiftli along the shore there is a strang tale to tell said legola there are onli two boat upon the bank we could find no trace of the other have orc been there ask aragorn we saw no sign of them answer gimli and orc would have taken or destroy all the boat and the baggag as well i will look at the ground when we come there said aragorn now they laid boromir in the middl of the boat that wa to bear him away the grey hood and elvencloak they fold and place beneath hi head they comb hi long dark hair and array it upon hi shoulder the golden belt of lórien gleam about hi waist hi helm they set besid him and across hi lap they laid the cloven horn and the hilt and shard of hi sword beneath hi feet they put the sword of hi enemi then fasten the prow to the stern of the other boat they drew him out into the water they row sadli along the shore and turn into the swiftrun channel they pass the green sward of parth galen the steep side of tol brandir were glow it wa now midafternoon as they went south the fume of rauro rose and shimmer befor them a haze of gold the rush and thunder of the fall shook the windless air sorrow they cast loos the funer boat there boromir lay rest peac glide upon the bosom of the flow water the stream took him while they held their own boat back with their paddl he float by them and slowli hi boat depart wane to a dark spot against the golden light and then suddenli it vanish rauro roar on unchang the river had taken boromir son of denethor and he wa not seen again in mina tirith stand as he use to stand upon the white tower in the morn but in gondor in afterday it long wa said that the elvenboat rode the fall and the foam pool and bore him down through osgiliath and past the mani mouth of anduin out into the great sea at night under the star for a while the three companion remain silent gaze after him then aragorn spoke they will look for him from the white tower he said but he will not return from mountain or from sea then slowli he began to sing through rohan over fen and field where the long grass grow the west wind come walk and about the wall it goe what news from the west o wander wind do you bring to me tonight have you seen boromir the tall by moon or by starlight i saw him ride over seven stream over water wide and grey i saw him walk in empti land until he pass away into the shadow of the north i saw him then no more the north wind may have heard the horn of the son of denethor o boromir from the high wall westward i look afar but you came not from the empti land where no men are then legola sang from the mouth of the sea the south wind fli from the sandhil and the stone the wail of the gull it bear and at the gate it moan what news from the south o sigh wind do you bring to me at eve where now is boromir the fair he tarri and i griev ask not of me where he doth dwellso mani bone there lie on the white shore and the dark shore under the stormi sky so mani have pass down anduin to find the flow sea ask of the north wind news of them the north wind send to me o boromir beyond the gate the seaward road run south but you came not with the wail gull from the grey sea mouth then aragorn sang again from the gate of king the north wind ride and past the roar fall and clear and cold about the tower it loud horn call what news from the north o mighti wind do you bring to me today what news of boromir the bold for he is long away beneath amon hen i heard hi cri there mani foe he fought hi cloven shield hi broken sword they to the water brought hi head so proud hi face so fair hi limb they laid to rest and rauro golden raurosfal bore him upon it breast o boromir the tower of guard shall ever northward gaze to rauro golden raurosfal until the end of day so they end then they turn their boat and drove it with all the speed they could against the stream back to parth galen you left the east wind to me said gimli but i will say naught of it that is as it should be said aragorn in mina tirith they endur the east wind but they do not ask it for tide but now boromir ha taken hi road and we must make hast to choos our own he survey the green lawn quickli but thoroughli stoop often to the earth the orc have been on thi ground he said otherwis noth can be made out for certain all our footprint are here cross and recross i can not tell whether ani of the hobbit have come back sinc the search for frodo began he return to the bank close to where the rill from the spring trickl out into the river there are some clear print here he said a hobbit wade out into the water and back but i can not say how long ago how then do you read thi riddl ask gimli aragorn did not answer at onc but went back to the campingplac and look at the baggag two pack are miss he said and one is certainli sam it wa rather larg and heavi thi then is the answer frodo ha gone by boat and hi servant ha gone with him frodo must have return while we were all away i met sam go up the hill and told him to follow me but plainli he did not do so he guess hi master s mind and came back here befor frodo had gone he did not find it easi to leav sam behind but whi should he leav us behind and without a word said gimli that wa a strang deed and a brave deed said aragorn sam wa right i think frodo did not wish to lead ani friend to death with him in mordor but he knew that he must go himself someth happen after he left us that overcam hi fear and doubt mayb hunt orc came on him and he fled said legola he fled certainli said aragorn but not i think from orc what he thought wa the caus of frodo sudden resolv and flight aragorn did not say the last word of boromir he long kept secret well so much at least is now clear said legola frodo is no longer on thi side of the river onli he can have taken the boat and sam is with him onli he would have taken hi pack our choic then said gimli is either to take the remain boat and follow frodo or els to follow the orc on foot there is littl hope either way we have alreadi lost preciou hour let me think said aragorn and now may i make a right choic and chang the evil fate of thi unhappi day he stood silent for a moment i will follow the orc he said at last i would have guid frodo to mordor and gone with him to the end but if i seek him now in the wilder i must abandon the captiv to torment and death my heart speak clearli at last the fate of the bearer is in my hand no longer the compani ha play it part yet we that remain can not forsak our companion while we have strength left come we will go now leav all that can be spare behind we will press on by day and dark they drew up the last boat and carri it to the tree they laid beneath it such of their good as they did not need and could not carri away then they left parth galen the afternoon wa fade as they came back to the glade where boromir had fallen there they pick up the trail of the orc it need littl skill to find no other folk make such a trampl said legola it seem their delight to slash and beat down grow thing that are not even in their way but they go with a great speed for all that said aragorn and they do not tire and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare land well after them said gimli dwarv too can go swiftli and they do not tire sooner than orc but it will be a long chase they have a long start ye said aragorn we shall all need the endur of dwarv but come with hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemi and woe to them if we prove the swifter we will make such a chase as shall be account a marvel among the three kindr elv dwarv and men forth the three hunter like a deer he sprang away through the tree he sped on and on he led them tireless and swift now that hi mind wa at last made up the wood about the lake they left behind long slope they climb dark hardedg against the sky alreadi red with sunset dusk came they pass away grey shadow in a stoni land chapter the rider of rohan dusk deepen mist lay behind them among the tree below and brood on the pale margin of the anduin but the sky wa clear star came out the wax moon wa ride in the west and the shadow of the rock were black they had come to the feet of stoni hill and their pace wa slower for the trail wa no longer easi to follow here the highland of the emyn muil ran from north to south in two long tumbl ridg the western side of each ridg wa steep and difficult but the eastward slope were gentler furrow with mani gulli and narrow ravin all night the three companion scrambl in thi boni land climb to the crest of the first and tallest ridg and down again into the dark of a deep wind valley on the other side there in the still cool hour befor dawn they rest for a brief space the moon had long gone down befor them the star glitter abov them the first light of day had not yet come over the dark hill behind for the moment aragorn wa at a loss the orctrail had descend into the valley but there it had vanish which way would they turn do you think said legola northward to take a straighter road to isengard or fangorn if that is their aim as you guess or southward to strike the entwash they will not make for the river whatev mark they aim at said aragorn and unless there is much amiss in rohan and the power of saruman is greatli increas they will take the shortest way that they can find over the field of the rohirrim let us search northward the dale ran like a stoni trough between the ridg hill and a trickl stream flow among the boulder at the bottom a cliff frown upon their right to their left rose grey slope dim and shadowi in the late night they went on for a mile or more northward aragorn wa search bent toward the ground among the fold and gulli lead up into the western ridg legola wa some way ahead suddenli the elf gave a cri and the other came run toward him we have alreadi overtaken some of those that we are hunt he said look he point and they saw that what they had at first taken to be boulder lie at the foot of the slope were huddl bodi five dead orc lay there they had been hewn with mani cruel stroke and two had been behead the ground wa wet with their dark blood here is anoth riddl said gimli but it need the light of day and for that we can not wait yet howev you read it it seem not unhop said legola enemi of the orc are like to be our friend do ani folk dwell in these hill no said aragorn the rohirrim seldom come here and it is far from mina tirith it might be that some compani of men were hunt here for reason that we do not know yet i think not what do you think said gimli i think that the enemi brought hi own enemi with him answer aragorn these are northern orc from far away among the slain are none of the great orc with the strang badg there wa a quarrel i guess it is no uncommon thing with these foul folk mayb there wa some disput about the road or about the captiv said gimli let us hope that they too did not meet their end here aragorn search the ground in a wide circl but no other trace of the fight could be found they went on alreadi the eastward sky wa turn pale the star were fade and a grey light wa slowli grow a littl further north they came to a fold in which a tini stream fall and wind had cut a stoni path down into the valley in it some bush grew and there were patch of grass upon it side at last said aragorn here are the track that we seek up thi waterchannel thi is the way that the orc went after their debat swiftli now the pursuer turn and follow the new path as if fresh from a night rest they sprang from stone to stone at last they reach the crest of the grey hill and a sudden breez blew in their hair and stir their cloak the chill wind of dawn turn back they saw across the river the far hill kindl day leap into the sky the red rim of the sun rose over the shoulder of the dark land befor them in the west the world lay still formless and grey but even as they look the shadow of night melt the colour of the wake earth return green flow over the wide mead of rohan the white mist shimmer in the waterval and far off to the left thirti leagu or more blue and purpl stood the white mountain rise into peak of jet tip with glimmer snow flush with the rose of morn gondor gondor cri aragorn would that i look on you again in happier hour not yet doe my road lie southward to your bright stream gondor gondor between the mountain and the sea west wind blew there the light upon the silver tree fell like bright rain in garden of the king of old o proud wall white tower o wing crown and throne of gold o gondor gondor shall men behold the silver tree or west wind blow again between the mountain and the sea now let us go he said draw hi eye away from the south and look out west and north to the way that he must tread the ridg upon which the companion stood went down steepli befor their feet below it twenti fathom or more there wa a wide and rug shelf which end suddenli in the brink of a sheer cliff the east wall of rohan so end the emyn muil and the green plain of the rohirrim stretch away befor them to the edg of sight look cri legola point up into the pale sky abov them there is the eagl again he is veri high he seem to be fli now away from thi land back to the north he is go with great speed look no not even my eye can see him my good legola said aragorn he must be far aloft inde i wonder what is hi errand if he is the same bird that i have seen befor but look i can see someth nearer at hand and more urgent there is someth move over the plain mani thing said legola it is a great compani on foot but i can not say more nor see what kind of folk they may be they are mani leagu away twelv i guess but the flat of the plain is hard to measur i think nonetheless that we no longer need ani trail to tell us which way to go said gimli let us find a path down to the field as quick as may be i doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the orc chose said aragorn they follow their enemi now by the clear light of day it seem that the orc had press on with all possibl speed everi now and again the pursuer found thing that had been drop or cast away foodbag the rind and crust of hard grey bread a torn black cloak a heavi ironnail shoe broken on the stone the trail led them north along the top of the escarp and at length they came to a deep cleft carv in the rock by a stream that splash noisili down in the narrow ravin a rough path descend like a steep stair into the plain at the bottom they came with a strang sudden on the grass of rohan it swell like a green sea up to the veri foot of the emyn muil the fall stream vanish into a deep growth of cress and waterpl and they could hear it tinkl away in green tunnel down long gentl slope toward the fen of entwash vale far away they seem to have left winter cling to the hill behind here the air wa softer and warmer and faintli scent as if spring wa alreadi stir and the sap wa flow again in herb and leaf legola took a deep breath like one that drink a great draught after long thirst in barren place ah the green smell he said it is better than much sleep let us run light feet may run swiftli here said aragorn more swiftli mayb than ironshod orc now we have a chanc to lessen their lead they went in singl file run like hound on a strong scent and an eager light wa in their eye nearli due west the broad swath of the march orc tramp it ugli slot the sweet grass of rohan had been bruis and blacken as they pass present aragorn gave a cri and turn asid stay he shout do not follow me yet he ran quickli to the right away from the main trail for he had seen footprint that went that way branch off from the other the mark of small unshod feet these howev did not go far befor they were cross by orcprint also come out from the main trail behind and in front and then they curv sharpli back again and were lost in the trampl at the furthest point aragorn stoop and pick up someth from the grass then he ran back ye he said they are quit plain a hobbit footprint pippin i think he is smaller than the other and look at thi he held up a thing that glitter in the sunlight it look like the newopen leaf of a beechtre fair and strang in that treeless plain the brooch of an elvencloak cri legola and gimli togeth not idli do the leav of lórien fall said aragorn thi did not drop by chanc it wa cast away as a token to ani that might follow i think pippin ran away from the trail for that purpos then he at least wa aliv said gimli and he had the use of hi wit and of hi leg too that is hearten we do not pursu in vain let us hope that he did not pay too dearli for hi bold said legola come let us go on the thought of those merri young folk driven like cattl burn my heart the sun climb to the noon and then rode slowli down the sky light cloud came up out of the sea in the distant south and were blown away upon the breez the sun sank shadow rose behind and reach out long arm from the east still the hunter held on one day now had pass sinc boromir fell and the orc were yet far ahead no longer could ani sight of them be seen in the level plain as nightshad wa close about them aragorn halt onli twice in the day march had they rest for a brief while and twelv leagu now lay between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn we have come at last to a hard choic he said shall we rest by night or shall we go on while our will and strength hold unless our enemi rest also they will leav us far behind if we stay to sleep said legola sure even orc must paus on the march said gimli seldom will orc journey in the open under the sun yet these have done so said legola certainli they will not rest by night but if we walk by night we can not follow their trail said gimli the trail is straight and turn neither right nor left as far as my eye can see said legola mayb i could lead you at guess in the dark and hold to the line said aragorn but if we stray or they turn asid then when light came there might be long delay befor the trail wa found again and there is thi also said gimli onli by day can we see if ani track lead away if a prison should escap or if one should be carri off eastward say to the great river toward mordor we might pass the sign and never know it that is true said aragorn but if i read the sign back yonder rightli the orc of the white hand prevail and the whole compani is now bound for isengard their present cours bear me out yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsel said gimli and what of escap in the dark we should have pass the sign that led you to the brooch the orc will be doubli on their guard sinc then and the prison even wearier said legola there will be no escap again if we do not contriv it how that is to be done can not be guess but first we must overtak them and yet even i dwarf of mani journey and not the least hardi of my folk can not run all the way to isengard without ani paus said gimli my heart burn me too and i would have start sooner but now i must rest a littl to run the better and if we rest then the blind night is the time to do so i said that it wa a hard choic said aragorn how shall we end thi debat you are our guid said gimli and you are skill in the chase you shall choos my heart bid me go on said legola but we must hold togeth i will follow your counsel you give the choic to an ill chooser said aragorn sinc we pass through the argonath my choic have gone amiss he fell silent gaze north and west into the gather night for a long while we will not walk in the dark he said at length the peril of miss the trail or sign of other come and go seem to me the greater if the moon gave enough light we would use it but ala he set earli and is yet young and pale and tonight he is shroud anyway gimli murmur would that the ladi had given us a light such a gift as she gave to frodo it will be more need where it is bestow said aragorn with him lie the true quest our is but a small matter in the great deed of thi time a vain pursuit from it begin mayb which no choic of mine can mar or mend well i have chosen so let us use the time as best we may he cast himself on the ground and fell at onc into sleep for he had not slept sinc their night under the shadow of tol brandir befor dawn wa in the sky he woke and rose gimli wa still deep in slumber but legola wa stand gaze northward into the dark thought and silent as a young tree in a windless night they are far far away he said sadli turn to aragorn i know in my heart that they have not rest thi night onli an eagl could overtak them now nonetheless we will still follow as we may said aragorn stoop he rous the dwarf come we must go he said the scent is grow cold but it is still dark said gimli even legola on a hilltop could not see them till the sun is up i fear they have pass beyond my sight from hill or plain under moon or sun said legola where sight fail the earth may bring us rumour said aragorn the land must groan under their hate feet he stretch himself upon the ground with hi ear press against the turf he lay there motionless for so long a time that gimli wonder if he had swoon or fallen asleep again dawn came glimmer and slowli a grey light grew about them at last he rose and now hi friend could see hi face it wa pale and drawn and hi look wa troubl the rumour of the earth is dim and confus he said noth walk upon it for mani mile about us faint and far are the feet of our enemi but loud are the hoof of the hors it come to my mind that i heard them even as i lay on the ground in sleep and they troubl my dream hors gallop pass in the west but now they are draw ever further from us ride northward i wonder what is happen in thi land let us go said legola so the third day of their pursuit began dure all it long hour of cloud and fit sun they hardli paus now stride now run as if no weari could quench the fire that burn them they seldom spoke over the wide solitud they pass and their elvencloak fade against the background of the greygreen field even in the cool sunlight of midday few but elvish eye would have mark them until they were close at hand often in their heart they thank the ladi of lórien for the gift of lemba for they could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran all day the track of their enemi led straight on go northwest without a break or turn as onc again the day wore to it end they came to long treeless slope where the land rose swell up toward a line of low humpback down ahead the orctrail grew fainter as it bent north toward them for the ground becam harder and the grass shorter far away to the left the river entwash wound a silver thread in a green floor no move thing could be seen often aragorn wonder that they saw no sign of beast or man the dwell of the rohirrim were for the most part mani leagu away to the south under the wood eav of the white mountain now hidden in mist and cloud yet the horselord had formerli kept mani herd and stud in the eastemnet thi easterli region of their realm and there the herdsmen had wander much live in camp and tent even in wintertim but now all the land wa empti and there wa silenc that did not seem to be the quiet of peac at dusk they halt again now twice twelv leagu they had pass over the plain of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil wa lost in the shadow of the east the young moon wa glimmer in a misti sky but it gave small light and the star were veil now do i most grudg a time of rest or ani halt in our chase said legola the orc have run befor us as if the veri whip of sauron were behind them i fear they have alreadi reach the forest and the dark hill and even now are pass into the shadow of the tree gimli ground hi teeth thi is a bitter end to our hope and to all our toil he said to hope mayb but not to toil said aragorn we shall not turn back here yet i am weari he gaze back along the way that they had come toward the night gather in the east there is someth strang at work in thi land i distrust the silenc i distrust even the pale moon the star are faint and i am weari as i have seldom been befor weari as no ranger should be with a clear trail to follow there is some will that lend speed to our foe and set an unseen barrier befor us a weari that is in the heart more than in the limb truli said legola that i have known sinc first we came down from the emyn muil for the will is not behind us but befor us he point away over the land of rohan into the darkl west under the sickl moon saruman mutter aragorn but he shall not turn us back halt we must onc more for see even the moon is fall into gather cloud but north lie our road between down and fen when day return as befor legola wa first afoot if inde he had ever slept awak awak he cri it is a red dawn strang thing await us by the eav of the forest good or evil i do not know but we are call awak the other sprang up and almost at onc they set off again slowli the down drew near it wa still an hour befor noon when they reach them green slope rise to bare ridg that ran in a line straight toward the north at their feet the ground wa dri and the turf short but a long strip of sunken land some ten mile wide lay between them and the river wander deep in dim thicket of reed and rush just to the west of the southernmost slope there wa a great ring where the turf had been torn and beaten by mani trampl feet from it the orctrail ran out again turn north along the dri skirt of the hill aragorn halt and examin the track close they rest here a while he said but even the outward trail is alreadi old i fear that your heart spoke truli legola it is thrice twelv hour i guess sinc the orc stood where we now stand if they held to their pace then at sundown yesterday they would reach the border of fangorn i can see noth away north or west but grass dwindl into mist said gimli could we see the forest if we climb the hill it is still far away said aragorn if i rememb rightli these down run eight leagu or more to the north and then northwest to the issu of the entwash there lie still a wide land anoth fifteen leagu it may be well let us go on said gimli my leg must forget the mile they would be more will if my heart were less heavi the sun wa sink when at last they drew near to the end of the line of down for mani hour they had march without rest they were go slowli now and gimli back wa bent stonehard are the dwarv in labour or journey but thi endless chase began to tell on him as all hope fail in hi heart aragorn walk behind him grim and silent stoop now and again to scan some print or mark upon the ground onli legola still step as lightli as ever hi feet hardli seem to press the grass leav no footprint as he pass but in the waybread of the elv he found all the susten that he need and he could sleep if sleep it could be call by men rest hi mind in the strang path of elvish dream even as he walk openey in the light of thi world let us go up on to thi green hill he said wearili they follow him climb the long slope until they came out upon the top it wa a round hill smooth and bare stand by itself the most northerli of the down the sun sank and the shadow of even fell like a curtain they were alon in a grey formless world without mark or measur onli far away northwest there wa a deeper dark against the die light the mountain of mist and the forest at their feet noth can we see to guid us here said gimli well now we must halt again and wear the night away it is grow cold the wind is north from the snow said aragorn and ere morn it will be in the east said legola but rest if you must yet do not cast all hope away tomorrow is unknown rede oft is found at the rise of the sun three sun alreadi have risen on our chase and brought no counsel said gimli the night grew ever colder aragorn and gimli slept fit and whenev they awok they saw legola stand besid them or walk to and fro sing softli to himself in hi own tongu and as he sang the white star open in the hard black vault abov so the night pass togeth they watch the dawn grow slowli in the sky now bare and cloudless until at last the sunris came it wa pale and clear the wind wa in the east and all the mist had roll away wide land lay bleak about them in the bitter light ahead and eastward they saw the windi upland of the wold of rohan that they had alreadi glimps mani day ago from the great river northwestward stalk the dark forest of fangorn still ten leagu away stood it shadowi eav and it further slope fade into the distant blue beyond there glimmer far away as if float on a grey cloud the white head of tall methedra the last peak of the misti mountain out of the forest the entwash flow to meet them it stream now swift and narrow and it bank deepcloven the orctrail turn from the down toward it follow with hi keen eye the trail to the river and then the river back toward the forest aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green a dark swiftmov blur he cast himself upon the ground and listen again intent but legola stood besid him shade hi bright elveney with hi long slender hand and he saw not a shadow nor a blur but the small figur of horsemen mani horsemen and the glint of morn on the tip of their spear wa like the twinkl of minut star beyond the edg of mortal sight far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curl thread there wa a silenc in the empti field arid gimli could hear the air move in the grass rider cri aragorn spring to hi feet mani rider on swift steed are come toward us ye said legola there are one hundr and five yellow is their hair and bright are their spear their leader is veri tall aragorn smile keen are the eye of the elv he said nay the rider are littl more than five leagu distant said legola five leagu or one said gimli we can not escap them in thi bare land shall we wait for them here or go on our way we will wait said aragorn i am weari and our hunt ha fail or at least other were befor us for these horsemen are ride back down the orctrail we may get new s from them or spear said gimli there are three empti saddl but i see no hobbit said legola i did not say that we should hear good news said aragorn but evil or good we will await it here the three companion now left the hilltop where they might be an easi mark against the pale sky and they walk slowli down the northward slope a littl abov the hill foot they halt and wrap their cloak about them they sat huddl togeth upon the fade grass the time pass slowli and heavili the wind wa thin and search gimli wa uneasi what do you know of these horsemen aragorn he said do we sit here wait for sudden death i have been among them answer aragorn they are proud and wil but they are trueheart gener in thought and deed bold but not cruel wise but unlearn write no book but sing mani song after the manner of the children of men befor the dark year but i do not know what ha happen here of late nor in what mind the rohirrim may now be between the traitor saruman and the threat of sauron they have long been the friend of the peopl of gondor though they are not akin to them it wa in forgotten year long ago that eorl the young brought them out of the north and their kinship is rather with the bard of dale and with the beorn of the wood among whom may still be seen mani men tall and fair as are the rider of rohan at least they will not love the orc but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribut to mordor said gimli i believ it no more than did boromir answer aragorn you will soon learn the truth said legola alreadi they approach at length even gimli could hear the distant beat of gallop hoof the horsemen follow the trail had turn from the river and were draw near the down they were ride like the wind now the cri of clear strong voic came ring over the field suddenli they swept up with a nois like thunder and the foremost horseman swerv pass by the foot of the hill and lead the host back southward along the western skirt of the down after him they rode a long line of mailclad men swift shine fell and fair to look upon their hors were of great statur strong and cleanlimb their grey coat glisten their long tail flow in the wind their mane were braid on their proud neck the men that rode them match them well tall and longlimb their hair flaxenpal flow under their light helm and stream in long braid behind them their face were stern and keen in their hand were tall spear of ash paint shield were slung at their back long sword were at their belt their burnish skirt of mail hung down upon their knee in pair they gallop by and though everi now and then one rose in hi stirrup and gaze ahead and to either side they appear not to perceiv the three stranger sit silent and watch them the host had almost pass when suddenli aragorn stood up and call in a loud voic what news from the north rider of rohan with astonish speed and skill they check their steed wheel and came charg round soon the three companion found themselv in a ring of horsemen move in a run circl up the hillslop behind them and down round and round them and draw ever inward aragorn stood silent and the other two sat without move wonder what way thing would turn without a word or cri suddenli the rider halt a thicket of spear were point toward the stranger and some of the horsemen had bow in hand and their arrow were alreadi fit to the string then one rode forward a tall man taller than all the rest from hi helm as a crest a white horsetail flow he advanc until the point of hi spear wa within a foot of aragorn breast aragorn did not stir who are you and what are you do in thi land said the rider use the common speech of the west in manner and tone like to the speech of boromir man of gondor i am call strider answer aragorn i came out of the north i am hunt orc the rider leap from hi hors give hi spear to anoth who rode up and dismount at hi side he drew hi sword and stood face to face with aragorn survey him keenli and not without wonder at length he spoke again at first i thought that you yourselv were orc he said but now i see that it is not so inde you know littl of orc if you go hunt them in thi fashion they were swift and wellarm and they were mani you would have chang from hunter to prey if ever you had overtaken them but there is someth strang about you strider he bent hi clear bright eye again upon the ranger that is no name for a man that you give and strang too is your raiment have you sprung out of the grass how did you escap our sight are you elvish folk no said aragorn one onli of us is an elf legola from the woodland realm in distant mirkwood but we have pass through lothlórien and the gift and favour of the ladi go with us the rider look at them with renew wonder but hi eye harden then there is a ladi in the golden wood as old tale tell he said few escap her net they say these are strang day but if you have her favour then you also are netweav and sorcer mayb he turn a cold glanc suddenli upon legola and gimli whi do you not speak silent one he demand gimli rose and plant hi feet firmli apart hi hand grip the handl of hi axe and hi dark eye flash give me your name horsemast and i will give you mine and more besid he said as for that said the rider stare down at the dwarf the stranger should declar himself first yet i am name éomer son of éomund and am call the third marshal of riddermark then éomer son of éomund third marshal of riddermark let gimli the dwarf glóin son warn you against foolish word you speak evil of that which is fair beyond the reach of your thought and onli littl wit can excus you éomer eye blaze and the men of rohan murmur angrili and close in advanc their spear i would cut off your head beard and all master dwarf if it stood but a littl higher from the ground said éomer he stand not alon said legola bend hi bow and fit an arrow with hand that move quicker than sight you would die befor your stroke fell éomer rais hi sword and thing might have gone ill but aragorn sprang between them and rais hi hand your pardon éomer he cri when you know more you will understand whi you have anger my companion we intend no evil to rohan nor to ani of it folk neither to man nor to hors will you not hear our tale befor you strike i will said éomer lower hi blade but wander in the riddermark would be wise to be less haughti in these day of doubt first tell me your right name first tell me whom you serv said aragorn are you friend or foe of sauron the dark lord of mordor i serv onli the lord of the mark théoden king son of thengel answer éomer we do not serv the power of the black land far away but neither are we yet at open war with him and if you are flee from him then you had best leav thi land there is troubl now on all our border and we are threaten but we desir onli to be free and to live as we have live keep our own and serv no foreign lord good or evil we welcom guest kindli in the better day but in these time the unbidden stranger find us swift and hard come who are you whom do you serv at whose command do you hunt orc in our land i serv no man said aragorn but the servant of sauron i pursu into whatev land they may go there are few among mortal men who know more of orc and i do not hunt them in thi fashion out of choic the orc whom we pursu took captiv two of my friend in such need a man that ha no hors will go on foot and he will not ask for leav to follow the trail nor will he count the head of the enemi save with a sword i am not weaponless aragorn threw back hi cloak the elvensheath glitter as he grasp it and the bright blade of andúril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out elendil he cri i am aragorn son of arathorn and am call elessar the elfston dúnadan the heir of isildur elendil son of gondor here is the sword that wa broken and is forg again will you aid me or thwart me choos swiftli gimli and legola look at their companion in amaz for they had not seen him in thi mood befor he seem to have grown in statur while éomer had shrunk and in hi live face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesti of the king of stone for a moment it seem to the eye of legola that a white flame flicker on the brow of aragorn like a shine crown éomer step back and a look of awe wa in hi face he cast down hi proud eye these are inde strang day he mutter dream and legend spring to life out of the grass tell me lord he said what bring you here and what wa the mean of the dark word long ha boromir son of denethor been gone seek an answer and the hors that we lent him came back riderless what doom do you bring out of the north the doom of choic said aragorn you may say thi to théoden son of thengel open war lie befor him with sauron or against him none may live now as they have live and few shall keep what they call their own but of these great matter we will speak later if chanc allow i will come myself to the king now i am in great need and i ask for help or at least for tide you heard that we are pursu an orchost that carri off our friend what can you tell us that you need not pursu them further said éomer the orc are destroy and our friend we found none but orc but that is strang inde said aragorn did you search the slain were there no bodi other than those of orckind they would be small onli children to your eye unshod but clad in grey there were no dwarv nor children said éomer we count all the slain and despoil them and then we pile the carcas and burn them as is our custom the ash are smoke still we do not speak of dwarv or children said gimli our friend were hobbit hobbit said éomer and what may they be it is a strang name a strang name for a strang folk said gimli but these were veri dear to us it seem that you have heard in rohan of the word that troubl mina tirith they spoke of the halfl these hobbit are halfl halfl laugh the rider that stood besid éomer halfl but they are onli a littl peopl in old song and children tale out of the north do we walk in legend or on the green earth in the daylight a man may do both said aragorn for not we but those who come after will make the legend of our time the green earth say you that is a mighti matter of legend though you tread it under the light of day time is press said the rider not heed aragorn we must hasten south lord let us leav these wild folk to their fanci or let us bind them and take them to the king peac éothain said éomer in hi own tongu leav me a while tell the éore to assembl on the path and make readi to ride to the entwad mutter éothain retir and spoke to the other soon they drew off and left éomer alon with the three companion all that you say is strang aragorn he said yet you speak the truth that is plain the men of the mark do not lie and therefor they are not easili deceiv but you have not told all will you not now speak more fulli of your errand so that i may judg what to do i set out from imladri as it is name in the rhyme mani week ago answer aragorn with me went boromir of mina tirith my errand wa to go to that citi with the son of denethor to aid hi folk in their war against sauron but the compani that i journey with had other busi of that i can not speak now gandalf the grey wa our leader gandalf éomer exclaim gandalf greyham is known in the mark but hi name i warn you is no longer a password to the king favour he ha been a guest in the land mani time in the memori of men come as he will after a season or after mani year he is ever the herald of strang event a bringer of evil some now say inde sinc hi last come in the summer all thing have gone amiss at that time our troubl with saruman began until then we count saruman our friend hut gandalf came then and warn us that sudden war wa prepar in isengard he said that he himself had been a prison in orthanc and had hardli escap and he beg for help but théoden would not listen to him and he went away speak not the name of gandalf loudli in théoden ear he is wroth for gandalf took the hors that is call shadowfax the most preciou of all the king steed chief of the meara which onli the lord of the mark may ride for the sire of their race wa the great hors of eorl that knew the speech of men seven night ago shadowfax return but the king anger is not less for now the hors is wild and will let no man handl him then shadowfax ha found hi way alon from the far north said aragorn for it wa there that he and gandalf part but ala gandalf will ride no longer he fell into dark in the mine of moria and come not again that is heavi tide said éomer at least to me and to mani though not to all as you may find if you come to the king it is tide more grievou than ani in thi land can understand though it may touch them sore ere the year is much older said aragorn but when the great fall the less must lead my part it ha been to guid our compani on the long road from moria through lórien we came – of which it were well that you should learn the truth ere you speak of it again – and thenc down the leagu of the great river to the fall of rauro there boromir wa slain by the same orc whom you destroy your news is all of woe cri éomer in dismay great harm is thi death to mina tirith and to us all that wa a worthi man all spoke hi prais he came seldom to the mark for he wa ever in the war on the eastbord but i have seen him more like to the swift son of eorl than to the grave men of gondor he seem to me and like to prove a great captain of hi peopl when hi time came but we have had no word of thi grief out of gondor when did he fall it is now the fourth day sinc he wa slain answer aragorn and sinc the even of that day we have journey from the shadow of tol brandir on foot cri éomer ye even as you see us wide wonder came into éomer eye strider is too poor a name son of arathorn he said wingfoot i name you thi deed of the three friend should be sung in mani a hall forti leagu and five you have measur ere the fourth day is end hardi is the race of elendil but now lord what would you have me do i must return in hast to théoden i spoke warili befor my men it is true that we are not yet at open war with the black land and there are some close to the king ear that speak craven counsel but war is come we shall not forsak our old allianc with gondor and while they fight we shall aid them so say i and all who hold with me the eastmark is my charg the ward of the third marshal and i have remov all our herd and herdfolk withdraw them beyond entwash and leav none here but guard and swift scout then you do not pay tribut to sauron said gimli we do not and we never have said éomer with a flash of hi eye though it come to my ear that that lie ha been told some year ago the lord of the black land wish to purchas hors of us at great price but we refus him for he put beast to evil use then he sent plunder orc and they carri off what they can choos alway the black hors few of these are now left for that reason our feud with the orc is bitter but at thi time our chief concern is with saruman he ha claim lordship over all thi land and there ha been war between us for mani month he ha taken orc into hi servic and wolfrid and evil men and he ha close the gap against us so that we are like to be beset both east and west it is ill deal with such a foe he is a wizard both cun and dwimmercrafti have mani guis he walk here and there they say as an old man hood and cloak veri like to gandalf as mani now recal hi spi slip through everi net and hi bird of ill omen are abroad in the sky i do not know how it will all end and my heart misgiv me for it seem to me that hi friend do not all dwell in isengard but if you come to the king hous you shall see for yourself will you not come do i hope in vain that you have been sent to me for a help in doubt and need i will come when i may said aragorn come now said éomer the heir of elendil would be a strength inde to the son of eorl in thi evil tide there is battl even now upon the westemnet and i fear that it may go ill for us inde in thi ride north i went without the king leav for in my absenc hi hous is left with littl guard but scout warn me of the orchost come down out of the east wall three night ago and among them they report that some bore the white badg of saruman so suspect what i most fear a leagu between orthanc and the dark tower i led forth my éore men of my own household and we overtook the orc at nightfal two day ago near to the border of the entwood there we surround them and gave battl yesterday at dawn fifteen of my men i lost and twelv hors ala for the orc were greater in number than we count on other join them come out of the east across the great river their trail is plain to see a littl north of thi spot and other too came out of the forest great orc who also bore the white hand of isengard that kind is stronger and more fell than all other nonetheless we put an end to them but we have been too long away we are need south and west will you not come there are spare hors as you see there is work for the sword to do ye and we could find a use for gimli axe and the bow of legola if they will pardon my rash word concern the ladi of the wood i spoke onli as do all men in my land and i would gladli learn better i thank you for your fair word said aragorn and my heart desir to come with you but i can not desert my friend while hope remain hope doe not remain said éomer you will not find your friend on the northbord yet my friend are not behind we found a clear token not far from the east wall that one at least of them wa still aliv there but between the wall and the down we have found no other trace of them and no trail ha turn asid thi way or that unless my skill ha wholli left me then what do you think ha becom of them i do not know they may have been slain and burn among the orc but that you will say can not be and i do not fear it i can onli think that they were carri off into the forest befor the battl even befor you encircl your foe mayb can you swear that none escap your net in such a way i would swear that no orc escap after we sight them said éomer we reach the foresteav befor them and if after that ani live thing broke through our ring then it wa no orc and had some elvish power our friend were attir even as we are said aragorn and you pass us by under the full light of day i had forgotten that said éomer it is hard to be sure of anyth among so mani marvel the world is all grown strang elf and dwarf in compani walk in our daili field and folk speak with the ladi of the wood and yet live and the sword come back to war that wa broken in the long age ere the father of our father rode into the mark how shall a man judg what to do in such time as he ever ha judg said aragorn good and ill have not chang sinc yesteryear nor are they one thing among elv and dwarv and anoth among men it is a man part to discern them as much in the golden wood as in hi own hous true inde said éomer but i do not doubt you nor the deed which my heart would do yet i am not free to do all as i would it is against our law to let stranger wander at will in our land until the king himself shall give them leav and more strict is the command in these day of peril i have beg you to come back willingli with me and you will not loth am i to begin a battl of one hundr against three i do not think your law wa made for such a chanc said aragorn nor inde am i a stranger for i have been in thi land befor more than onc and ridden with the host of the rohirrim though under other name and in other guis you i have not seen befor for you are young but i have spoken with éomund your father and with théoden son of thengel never in former day would ani high lord of thi land have constrain a man to abandon such a quest as mine my duti at least is clear to go on come now son of éomund the choic must be made at last aid us or at the worst let us go free or seek to carri out your law if you do so there will be fewer to return to your war or to your king éomer wa silent for a moment then he spoke we both have need of hast he said my compani chafe to be away and everi hour lessen your hope thi is my choic you may go and what is more i will lend you hors thi onli i ask when your quest is achiev or is prove vain return with the hors over the entwad to meduseld the high hous in edora where théoden now sit thu you shall prove to him that i have not misjudg in thi i place myself and mayb my veri life in the keep of your good faith do not fail i will not said aragorn there wa great wonder and mani dark and doubt glanc among hi men when éomer gave order that the spare hors were to be lent to the stranger but onli éothain dare to speak openli it may be well enough for thi lord of the race of gondor as he claim he said but who ha heard of a hors of the mark be given to a dwarf no one said gimli and do not troubl no one will ever hear of it i would sooner walk than sit on the back of ani beast so great free or begrudg but you must ride now or you will hinder us said aragorn come you shall sit behind me friend gimli said legola then all will be well and you need neither borrow a hors nor be troubl by one a great darkgrey hors wa brought to aragorn and he mount it hasufel is hi name said éomer may he bear you well and to better fortun than gárulf hi late master a smaller and lighter hors but restiv and fieri wa brought to legola arod wa hi name but legola ask them to take off saddl and rein i need them not he said and leap lightli up and to their wonder arod wa tame and will beneath him move here and there with but a spoken word such wa the elvish way with all good beast gimli wa lift up behind hi friend and he clung to him not much more at eas than sam gamge in a boat farewel and may you find what you seek cri éomer return with what speed you may and let our sword hereaft shine togeth i will come said aragorn and i will come too said gimli the matter of the ladi galadriel lie still between us i have yet to teach you gentl speech we shall see said éomer so mani strang thing have chanc that to learn the prais of a fair ladi under the love stroke of a dwarf axe will seem no great wonder farewel with that they part veri swift were the hors of rohan when after a littl gimli look back the compani of éomer were alreadi small and far away aragorn did not look back he wa watch the trail as they sped on their way bend low with hi head besid the neck of hasufel befor long they came to the border of the entwash and there they met the other trail of which éomer had spoken come down from the east out of the wold aragorn dismount and survey the ground then leap back into the saddl he rode away for some distanc eastward keep to one side and take care not to overrid the footprint then he again dismount and examin the ground go backward and forward on foot there is littl to discov he said when he return the main trail is all confus with the passag of the horsemen as they came back their outward cours must have lain nearer the river but thi eastward trail is fresh and clear there is no sign there of ani feet go the other way back toward anduin now we must ride slower and make sure that no trace or footstep branch off on either side the orc must have been awar from thi point that they were pursu they may have made some attempt to get their captiv away befor they were overtaken as they rode forward the day wa overcast low grey cloud came over the wold a mist shroud the sun ever nearer the treeclad slope of fangorn loom slowli darkl as the sun went west they saw no sign of ani trail to right or left but here and there they pass singl orc fallen in their track as they ran with greyfeath arrow stick in back or throat at last as the afternoon wa wane they came to the eav of the forest and in an open glade among the first tree they found the place of the great burn the ash were still hot and smoke besid it wa a great pile of helm and mail cloven shield and broken sword bow and dart and other gear of war upon a stake in the middl wa set a great goblin head upon it shatter helm the white badg could still be seen further away not far from the river where it came stream out from the edg of the wood there wa a mound it wa newli rais the raw earth wa cover with freshcut turv about it were plant fifteen spear aragorn and hi companion search far and wide about the field of battl but the light fade and even soon drew down dim and misti by nightfal they had discov no trace of merri and pippin we can do no more said gimli sadli we have been set mani riddl sinc we came to tol brandir but thi is the hardest to unravel i would guess that the burn bone of the hobbit are now mingl with the orc it will be hard news for frodo if he live to hear it and hard too for the old hobbit who wait in rivendel elrond wa against their come but gandalf wa not said legola but gandalf chose to come himself and he wa the first to be lost answer gimli hi foresight fail him the counsel of gandalf wa not found on foreknowledg of safeti for himself or for other said aragorn there are some thing that it is better to begin than to refus even though the end may be dark but i shall not depart from thi place yet in ani case we must here await the morninglight a littl way beyond the battlefield they made their camp under a spread tree it look like a chestnut and yet it still bore mani broad brown leav of a former year like dri hand with long splay finger they rattl mourn in the nightbreez gimli shiver they had brought onli one blanket apiec let us light a fire he said i care no longer for the danger let the orc come as thick as summermoth round a candl if those unhappi hobbit are astray in the wood it might draw them hither said legola and it might draw other thing neither orc nor hobbit said aragorn we are near to the mountainmarch of the traitor saruman also we are on the veri edg of fangorn and it is peril to touch the tree of that wood it is said but the rohirrim made a great burn here yesterday said gimli and they fell tree for the fire as can be seen yet they pass the night after safe here when their labour wa end they were mani said aragorn and they do not heed the wrath of fangorn for they come here seldom and they do not go under the tree but our path are like to lead us into the veri forest itself so have a care cut no live wood there is no need said gimli the rider have left chip and bough enough and there is dead wood lie in plenti he went off to gather fuel and busi himself with build and kindl a fire but aragorn sat silent with hi back to the great tree deep in thought and legola stood alon in the open look toward the profound shadow of the wood lean forward as one who listen to voic call from a distanc when the dwarf had a small bright blaze go the three companion drew close to it and sat togeth shroud the light with their hood form legola look up at the bough of the tree reach out abov them look he said the tree is glad of the fire it may have been that the danc shadow trick their eye but certainli to each of the companion the bough appear to be bend thi way and that so as to come abov the flame while the upper branch were stoop down the brown leav now stood out stiff and rub togeth like mani cold crack hand take comfort in the warmth there wa a silenc for suddenli the dark and unknown forest so near at hand made itself felt as a great brood presenc full of secret purpos after a while legola spoke again celeborn warn us not to go far into fangorn he said do you know whi aragorn what are the fabl of the forest that boromir had heard i have heard mani tale in gondor and elsewher said aragorn but if it were not for the word of celeborn i should deem them onli fabl that men have made as true knowledg fade i had thought of ask you what wa the truth of the matter and if an elf of the wood doe not know how shall a man answer you have journey further than i said legola i have heard noth of thi in my own land save onli song that tell how the onodrim that men call ent dwelt there long ago for fangorn is old old even as the elv would reckon it ye it is old said aragorn as old as the forest by the barrowdown and it is far greater elrond say that the two are akin the last stronghold of the mighti wood of the elder day in which the firstborn roam while men still slept yet fangorn hold some secret of it own what it is i do not know and i do not wish to know said gimli let noth that dwell in fangorn be troubl on my account they now drew lot for the watch and the lot for the first watch fell to gimli the other lay down almost at onc sleep laid hold on them gimli said aragorn drowsili

thi pace he had had no food sinc the morn one of hi guard had a whip but at present the orcliquor wa still hot in him hi wit too were wideawak everi now and again there came into hi mind unbidden a vision of the keen face of strider bend over a dark trail and run run behind but what could even a ranger see except a confus trail of orcfeet hi own littl print and merri were overwhelm by the trampl of the ironshod shoe befor them and behind them and about them they had gone onli a mile or so from the cliff when the land slope down into a wide shallow depress where the ground wa soft and wet mist lay there paleglimm in the last ray of the sickl moon the dark shape of the orc in front grew dim and then were swallow up ai steadi now shout uglúk from the rear a sudden thought leap into pippin mind and he act on it at onc he swerv asid to the right and dive out of the reach of hi clutch guard headfirst into the mist he land sprawl on the grass halt yell uglúk there wa for a moment turmoil and confus pippin sprang up and ran but the orc were after him some suddenli loom up right in front of him no hope of escap thought pippin but there is a hope that i have left some of my own mark unspoilt on the wet ground he grope with hi two tie hand at hi throat and unclasp the brooch of hi cloak just as long arm and hard claw seiz him he let it fall there i suppos it will lie until the end of time he thought i dont know whi i did it if the other have escap theyv probabl all gone with frodo a whipthong curl round hi leg and he stifl a cri enough shout uglúk run up he still got to run a long way yet make em both run just use the whip as a remind but that not all he snarl turn to pippin i shant forget payment is onli put off leg it neither pippin nor merri rememb much of the later part of the journey evil dream and evil wake were blend into a long tunnel of miseri with hope grow ever fainter behind they ran and they ran strive to keep up the pace set by the orc lick everi now and again with a cruel thong cunningli handl if they halt or stumbl they were seiz and drag for some distanc the warmth of the orcdraught had gone pippin felt cold and sick again suddenli he fell face downward on the turf hard hand with rend nail grip and lift him he wa carri like a sack onc more and dark grew about him whether the dark of anoth night or a blind of hi eye he could not tell dimli he becam awar of voic clamour it seem that mani of the orc were demand a halt uglúk wa shout he felt himself flung to the ground and he lay as he fell till black dream took him but he did not long escap from pain soon the iron grip of merciless hand wa on him again for a long time he wa toss and shaken and then slowli the dark gave way and he came back to the wake world and found that it wa morn order were shout and he wa thrown roughli on the grass there he lay for a while fight with despair hi head swam but from the heat in hi bodi he guess that he had been given anoth draught an orc stoop over him and flung him some bread and a strip of raw dri flesh he ate the stale grey bread hungrili but not the meat he wa famish but not yet so famish as to eat flesh flung to him by an orc the flesh of he dare not guess what creatur he sat up and look about merri wa not far away they were by the bank of a swift narrow river ahead mountain loom a tall peak wa catch the first ray of the sun a dark smudg of forest lay on the lower slope befor them there wa much shout and debat among the orc a quarrel seem on the point of break out again between the northern and the isengard some were point back away south and some were point eastward veri well said uglúk leav them to me then no kill as ive told you befor but if you want to throw away what weve come all the way to get throw it away ill look after it let the fight urukhai do the work as usual if your afraid of the whiteskin run run there the forest he shout point ahead get to it it your best hope off you go and quick befor i knock a few more head off to put some sens into the other there wa some curs and scuffl and then most of the northern broke away and dash off over a hundr of them run wildli along the river toward the mountain the hobbit were left with the isengard a grim dark band four score at least of larg swart slantey orc with great bow and short broadblad sword a few of the larger and bolder northern remain with them now well deal with grishnákh said uglúk but some even of hi own follow were look uneasili southward i know growl uglúk the curs horseboy have got wind of us but that all your fault snaga you and the other scout ought to have your ear cut off but we are the fighter well feast on horseflesh yet or someth better at that moment pippin saw whi some of the troop had been point eastward from that direct there now came hoars cri and there wa grishnákh again and at hi back a coupl of score of other like him longarm crookleg orc they had a red eye paint on their shield uglúk step forward to meet them so youv come back he said thought better of it eh ive return to see that order are carri out and the prison safe answer grishnákh inde said uglúk wast of effort ill see that order are carri out in my

nazgûl ha he had anoth mount shot under him now if youd brought him along that might have been usefulif these nazgûl are all they make out nazgûl nazgûl said grishnákh shiver and lick hi lip as if the word had a foul tast that he savour pain you speak of what is deep beyond the reach of your muddi dream uglúk he said nazgûlah all that they make out one day youll wish that you had not said that ape he snarl fierc you ought to know that theyr the appl of the great eye but the wing nazgûl not yet not yet he wont let them show themselv across the great river yet not too soon theyr for the warand other purpos you seem to know a lot said uglúk more than is good for you i guess perhap those in lugbúrz might wonder how and whi but in the meantim the urukhai of isengard can do the dirti work as usual dont stand slaver there get your rabbl togeth the other swine are leg it to the forest youd better follow you wouldnt get back to the great river aliv right off the mark now ill be on your heel the isengard seiz merri and pippin again and slung them on their back then the troop start off hour after hour they ran paus now and again onli to sling the hobbit to fresh carrier either becaus they were quicker and hardier or becaus of some plan of grishnákh the isengard gradual pass through the orc of mordor and grishnákh folk close in behind soon they were gain also on the northern ahead the forest began to draw nearer pippin wa bruis and torn hi ach head wa grate by the filthi jowl and hairi ear of the orc that held him immedi in front were bow back and tough thick leg go up and down up and down unrest as if they were made of wire and horn beat out the nightmar second of an endless time in the afternoon uglúk troop overtook the northern they were flag in the ray of the bright sun winter sun shine in a pale cool sky though it wa their head were down and their tongu loll out maggot jeer the isengard your cook the whiteskin will catch you and eat you theyr come a cri from grishnákh show that thi wa not mere jest horsemen ride veri swiftli had inde been sight still far behind but gain on the orc gain on them like a tide over the flat on folk stray in a quicksand the isengard began to run with a redoubl pace that astonish pippin a terrif spurt it seem for the end of a race then he saw that the sun wa sink fall behind the misti mountain shadow reach over the land the soldier of mordor lift their head and also began to put on speed the forest wa dark and close alreadi they had pass a few outli tree the land wa begin to slope upward ever more steepli but the orc did not halt both uglúk and grishnákh shout spur them on to a last effort they will make it yet they will escap thought pippin and then he manag to twist hi neck so as to glanc back with one eye over hi shoulder he saw that rider away eastward were alreadi level with the orc gallop over the plain the sunset gild their spear and helmet and glint in their pale flow hair they were hem the orc in prevent them from scatter and drive them along the line of the river he wonder veri much what kind of folk they were he wish now that he had learn more in rivendel and look more at map and thing but in those day the plan for the journey seem to be in more compet hand and he had never reckon with be cut off from gandalf or from strider and even from frodo all that he could rememb about rohan wa that gandalf hors shadowfax had come from that land that sound hope as far as it went but how will they know that we are not orc he thought i dont suppos theyv ever heard of hobbit down here i suppos i ought to be glad that the beastli orc look like be destroy but i would rather be save myself the chanc were that he and merri would be kill togeth with their captor befor ever the men of rohan were awar of them a few of the rider appear to be bowmen skill at shoot from a run hors ride swiftli into rang they shot arrow at the orc that straggl behind and sever of them fell then the rider wheel away out of the rang of the answer bow of their enemi who shot wildli not dare to halt thi happen mani time and on one occas arrow fell among the isengard one of them just in front of pippin stumbl and did not get up again night came down without the rider close in for battl mani orc had fallen but fulli two hundr remain in the earli dark the orc came to a hillock the eav of the forest were veri near probabl no more than three furlong away but they could go no further the horsemen had encircl them a small band disobey uglúk command and ran on toward the forest onli three return well here we are sneer grishnákh fine leadership i hope the great uglúk will lead us out again put those halfl down order uglúk take no notic of grishnákh you lugdush get two other and stand guard over them theyr not to be kill unless the filthi whiteskin break through understand as long as im aliv i want em but theyr not to cri out and theyr not to be rescu bind their leg the last part of the order wa carri out mercilessli but pippin found that for the first time he wa close to merri the orc were make a great deal of nois shout and clash their weapon and the hobbit manag to whisper togeth for a while i dont think much of thi said merri i feel nearli done in dont think i could crawl away far even if i wa free lemba whisper pippin lemba ive got some have you i dont think theyv taken anyth but our sword ye i had a packet in my pocket answer merri but it must be batter to crumb anyway i cant put my mouth in my pocket you wont have to ive but just then a savag kick warn pippin that the nois had die down and the guard were watch the night wa cold and still all round the knoll on which the orc were gather littl watchfir sprang up goldenr in the dark a complet ring of them they were within a long bowshot but the rider did not show themselv against the light and the orc wast mani arrow shoot at the fire until uglúk stop them the rider made no sound later in the night when the moon came out of the mist then occasion they could be seen shadowi shape that glint now and again in the white light as they move in ceaseless patrol theyll wait for the sun curs them growl one of the guard whi

said still there one thing the fine fellow dont know mauhúr and hi lad are in the forest and they should turn up ani time now uglúk word were enough appar to satisfi the isengard but the other orc were both dispirit and rebelli they post a few watcher but most of them lay on the ground rest in the pleasant dark it did inde becom veri dark again for the moon pass westward into thick cloud and pippin could not see anyth a few feet away the fire brought no light to the hillock the rider were not howev content mere to wait for the dawn and let their enemi rest a sudden outcri on the east side of the knoll show that someth wa wrong it seem that some of the men had ridden in close slip off their hors crawl to the edg of the camp and kill sever orc and then had fade away again uglúk dash off to stop a stamped pippin and merri sat up their guard isengard had gone with uglúk but if the hobbit had ani thought of escap it wa soon dash a long hairi arm took each of them by the neck and drew

quickli and silent he went until he came to the edg of the knoll there choos a gap between the watcher he pass like an evil shadow out into the night down the slope and away westward toward the river that flow out of the forest in that direct there wa a wide open space with onli one fire after go a dozen yard he halt peer and listen noth could be seen or heard he crept slowli on bent almost doubl then he squat and listen again then he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash at that veri moment the dark form of a rider loom up right in front of him a hors snort and rear a man call out grishnákh flung himself on the ground flat drag the hobbit under him then he drew hi sword no doubt he meant to kill hi captiv rather than allow them to escap or to be rescu but it wa hi undo the sword rang faintli and glint a littl in the light of the fire away to hi left an arrow came whistl out of the gloom it wa aim with skill or guid by fate and it pierc hi right hand he drop the sword and shriek there wa a quick beat of hoof and even as grishnákh leap up and ran he wa ridden down and a spear pass through him he gave a hideou shiver cri and lay still the hobbit remain flat on the ground as grishnákh had left them anoth horseman came ride swiftli to hi comrad aid whether becaus of some special keen of sight or becaus of some other sens the hors lift and sprang lightli over them but it rider did not see them lie cover in their elvencloak too crush for the moment and too afraid to move at last merri stir and whisper softli so far so good but how are we to avoid be spit the answer came almost immedi the cri of grishnákh had rous the orc from the yell and screech that came from the knoll the hobbit guess that their disappear had been discov uglúk wa probabl knock off a few more head then suddenli the answer cri of orcvoic came from the right outsid the circl of watchfir from the direct of the forest and the mountain mauhúr had appar arriv and wa attack the besieg there wa the sound of gallop hors the rider were draw in their ring close round the knoll risk the orcarrow so as to prevent ani sorti while a compani rode off to deal with the newcom suddenli merri and pippin realiz that without move they were now outsid the circl there wa noth between them and escap now said merri if onli we had our leg and hand free we might get away but i cant touch the knot and i cant bite them no need to tri said pippin i wa go to tell you ive manag to free my hand these loop are onli left for show youd better have a bit of lemba first he slip the cord off hi wrist and fish out a packet the cake were broken but good still in their leafwrap the hobbit each ate two or three piec the tast brought back to them the memori of fair face and laughter and wholesom food in quiet day now far away for a while they ate thought sit in the dark heedless of the cri and sound of battl nearbi pippin wa the first to come back to the present we must be off he said half a moment grishnákh sword wa lie close at hand but it wa too heavi and clumsi for him to use so he crawl forward and find the bodi of the goblin he drew from it sheath a long sharp knife with thi he quickli cut their bond now for it he said when weve warm up a bit perhap we shall be abl to stand again and walk but in ani case we had better start by crawl they crawl the turf wa deep and yield and that help them but it seem a long slow busi they gave the watchfir a wide berth and worm their way forward bit by bit until they came to the edg of the river gurgl away in the black shadow under it deep bank then they look back the sound had die away evid mauhúr and hi lad had been kill or driven off the rider had return to their silent omin vigil it would not last veri much longer alreadi the night wa old in the east which had remain uncloud the sky wa begin to grow pale we must get under cover said pippin or we shall be seen it will not be ani comfort to us if these rider discov that we are not orc after we are dead he got up and stamp hi feet those cord have cut me like wire but my feet are get warm again i could stagger on now what about you merri merri got up ye he said i can manag it lemba doe put heart into you a more wholesom sort of feel too than the heat of that orcdraught i wonder what it wa made of better not to know i expect let get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it not here the bank are too steep said pippin forward now they turn and walk side by side slowli along the line of the river behind them the light grew in the east as they walk they compar note talk lightli in hobbitfashion of the thing that had happen sinc their captur no listen would have guess from their word that they had suffer cruelli and been in dire peril go without hope toward torment and death or that even now as they knew well they had littl chanc of ever find friend or safeti again you seem to have been do well master took said merri you will get almost a chapter in old bilbo book if ever i get a chanc to report to him good work especi guess that hairi villain littl game and play up to him but i wonder if anyon will ever pick up your trail and find that brooch i should hate to lose mine but i am afraid your is gone for good i shall have to brush up my toe if i am to get level with you inde cousin brandybuck is go in front now thi is where he come in i dont suppos you have much notion where we are but i spent my time at rivendel rather better we are walk west along the entwash the buttend of the misti mountain is in front and fangorn forest even as he spoke the dark edg of the forest loom up straight befor them night seem to have taken refug under it great tree creep away from the come dawn lead on master brandybuck said pippin or lead back we have been warn against fangorn but one so know will not have forgotten that i have not answer merri but the forest seem better to me all the same than turn back into the middl of a battl he led the way in under the huge branch of the tree old beyond guess they seem great trail beard of lichen hung from them blow and sway in the breez out of the shadow the hobbit peep gaze back down the slope littl furtiv figur that in the dim light look like elfchildren in the deep of time peer out of the wild wood in wonder at their first dawn far over the great river and the brown land leagu upon grey leagu away the dawn came red as flame loud rang the huntinghorn to greet it the rider of rohan sprang suddenli to life horn answer horn again merri and pippin heard clear in the cold air the neigh of warhors and the sudden sing of mani men the sun limb wa lift an arc of fire abov the margin of the world then with a great cri the rider charg from the east the red light gleam on mail and spear the orc yell and shot all the arrow that remain to them the hobbit saw sever horsemen fall but their line held on up the hill and over it and wheel round and charg again most of the raider that were left aliv then broke and fled thi way and that pursu one by one to the death but one band hold togeth in a black wedg drove forward resolut in the direct of the forest straight up the slope they charg toward the watcher now they were draw near and it seem certain that they would escap they had alreadi hewn down three rider that bar their way we have watch too long said merri there uglúk i dont want to meet him again the hobbit turn and fled deep into the shadow of the wood so it wa that they did not sec the last stand when uglúk wa overtaken and brought to bay at the veri edg of fangorn there he wa slain at last by éomer the third marshal of the mark who dismount and fought him sword to sword and over the wide field the keeney rider hunt down the few orc that had escap and still had strength to fli then when they had laid their fallen comrad in a mound and had sung their prais the rider made a great fire and scatter the ash of their enemi so end the raid and no news of it came ever back either to mordor or to isengard but the smoke of the burn rose high to heaven and wa seen by mani watch eye chapter treebeard meanwhil the hobbit went with as much speed as the dark and tangl forest allow follow the line of the run stream westward and up toward the slope of the mountain deeper and deeper into fangorn slowli their fear of the orc die away and their pace slacken a queer stifl feel came over them as if the air were too thin or too scanti for breath at last merri halt we cant go on like thi he pant i want some air let have a drink at ani rate said pippin im parch he clamber on to a great treeroot that wound down into the stream and stoop drew up some water in hi cup hand it wa clear and cold and he took mani draught merri follow him the water refresh them and seem to cheer their heart for a while they sat togeth on the brink of the stream dabbl their sore feet and leg and peer round at the tree that stood silent about them rank upon rank until they fade away into grey twilight in everi direct i suppos you havent lost us alreadi said pippin lean back against a great treetrunk we can at least follow the cours of thi stream the entwash or whatev you call it and get out again the way we came we could if our leg would do it said merri and if we could breath properli ye it is all veri dim and stuffi in here said pippin it remind me somehow of the old room in the great place of the took away back in the smial at tuckborough a huge place where the furnitur ha never been move or chang for gener they say the old took live in it year after year while he and the room got older and shabbier togetherand it ha never chang sinc he die a centuri ago and old gerontiu wa my greatgreatgrandfath that put it back a bit but that is noth to the old feel of thi wood look at all those weep trail beard and whisker of lichen and most of the tree seem to be half cover with rag dri leav that have never fallen untidi i cant imagin what spring would look like here if it ever come still less a springclean but the sun at ani rate must peep in sometim said merri it doe not look or feel at all like bilbo descript of mirkwood that wa all dark and black and the home of dark black thing thi is just dim and fright treeish you cant imagin anim live here at all or stay for long no nor hobbit said pippin and i dont like the thought of tri to get through it either noth to eat for a hundr mile i should guess how are our suppli low said merri we ran off with noth but a coupl of spare packet of lemba and left everyth els behind they look at what remain of the elvencak broken fragment for about five meagr day that wa all and not a wrap or a blanket said merri we shall be cold tonight whichev way we go well wed better decid on the way now said pippin the morn must be get on just then they becam awar of a yellow light that had appear some way further on into the wood shaft of sunlight seem suddenli to have pierc the forestroof hullo said merri the sun must have run into a cloud while weve been under these tree and now she ha run out again or els she ha climb high enough to look down through some open it isnt far – let go and investig they found it wa further than they thought the ground wa rise steepli still and it wa becom increasingli stoni the light grew broader as they went on and soon they saw that there wa a rockwal befor them the side of a hill or the abrupt end of some long root thrust out by the distant mountain no tree grew on it and the sun wa fall full on it stoni face the twig of the tree at it foot were stretch out stiff and still as if reach out to the warmth where all had look so shabbi and grey befor the wood now gleam with rich brown and with the smooth blackgrey of bark like polish leather the bole of the tree glow with a soft green like young grass earli spring or a fleet vision of it wa about them in the face of the stoni wall there wa someth like a stair natur perhap and made by the weather and split of the rock for it wa rough and uneven high up almost level with the top of foresttre there wa a shelf under a cliff noth grew there but a few grass and weed at it edg and one old stump of a tree with onli two bent branch left it look almost like the figur of some gnarl old man stand there blink in the morninglight up we go said merri joy now for a breath of air and a sight of the land they climb and scrambl up the rock if the stair had been made it wa for bigger feet and longer leg than their they were too eager to be surpris at the remark way in which the cut and sore of their captiv had heal and their vigour had return they came at length to the edg of the shelf almost at the feet of the old stump then they sprang up and turn round with their back to the hill breath deep and look out eastward they saw that they had onli come some three or four mile into the forest the head of the tree march down the slope toward the plain there near the fring of the forest tall spire of curl black smoke went up waver and float toward them the wind chang said merri it turn east again it feel cool up here ye said pippin im afraid thi is onli a pass gleam and it will all go grey again what a piti thi shaggi old forest look so differ in the sunlight i almost felt i like the place almost felt you like the forest that good that uncommonli kind of you said a strang voic turn round and let me have a look at your face i almost feel that i dislik you both but do not let us be hasti turn round a larg knobknuckl hand wa laid on each of their shoulder and they were twist round gentli but irresist then two great arm lift them up they found that they were look at a most extraordinari face it belong to a larg manlik almost trolllik figur at least fourteen foot high veri sturdi with a tall head and hardli ani neck whether it wa clad in stuff like green and grey bark or whether that wa it hide wa difficult to say at ani rate the arm at a short distanc from the trunk were not wrinkl but cover with a brown smooth skin the larg feet had seven toe each the lower part of the long face wa cover with a sweep grey beard bushi almost twiggi at the root thin and mossi at the end but at the moment the hobbit note littl but the eye these deep eye were now survey them slow and solemn but veri penetr they were brown shot with a green light often afterward pippin tri to describ hi first impress of them one felt as if there wa an enorm well behind them fill up with age of memori and long slow steadi think but their surfac wa sparkl with the present like sun shimmer on the outer leav of a vast tree or on the rippl of a veri deep lake i dont know but it felt as if someth that grew in the groundasleep you might say or just feel itself as someth between rooftip and leaftip between deep earth and sky had suddenli wake up and wa consid you with the

treebeard lift up first one larg foot and then the other and move them to the edg of the shelf the rootlik toe grasp the rock then care and solemnli he stalk down from step to step and reach the floor of the forest at onc he set off with long deliber stride through the tree deeper and deeper into the wood never far from the stream climb steadili up toward the slope of the mountain mani of the tree seem asleep or as unawar of him as of ani other creatur that mere pass by but some quiver and some rais up their branch abov hi head as he approach all the while as he walk he talk to himself in a long run stream of music sound the hobbit were silent for some time they felt oddli enough safe and comfort and they had a great deal to think and wonder about at last pippin ventur to speak again pleas treebeard he said could i ask you someth whi did celeborn warn us against your forest he told us not to risk get entangl in it hmm did he now rumbl treebeard and i might have said much the same if you had been go the other way do not risk get entangl in the wood of laurelindórenan that is what the elv use to call it but now they make the name shorter lothlórien they call it perhap they are right mayb it is fade not grow land of the valley of sing gold that wa it onc upon a time now it is the dreamflow ah well but it is a queer place and not for just ani one to ventur in i am surpris that you ever got out but much more surpris that you ever got in that ha not happen to stranger for mani a year it is a queer land and so is thi folk have come to grief here aye they have to grief laurelindórenan lindelorendor malinornélion ornemalin he hum to himself they are fall rather behind the world in there i guess he said neither thi countri nor anyth els outsid the golden wood is what it wa when celeborn wa young still taurelilómëatumbalemorna tumbaletaurëa lómëanor that is what they use to say thing have chang but it is still true in place what do you mean said pippin what is true the tree and the ent said treebeard i do not understand all that goe on myself so i can not explain it to you some of us are still true ent and live enough in our fashion but mani are grow sleepi go treeish as you might say most of the tree are just tree of cours but mani are half awak some are quit wide awak and a few are well ah well get entish that is go on all the time when that happen to a tree you find that some have bad heart noth to do with their wood i do not mean that whi i knew some good old willow down the entwash gone long ago ala they were quit hollow inde they were fall all to piec but as quiet and sweetspoken as a young leaf and then there are some tree in the valley under the mountain sound as a bell and bad right through that sort of thing seem to spread there use to be some veri danger part in thi countri there are still some veri black patch like the old forest away to the north do you mean ask merri aye aye someth like but much wors i do not doubt there is some shadow of the great dark lie there still away north and bad memori are hand down but there are hollow dale in thi land where the dark ha never been lift and the tree are older than i am still we do what we can we keep off stranger and the foolhardi and we train and we teach we walk and we weed we are treeherd we old ent few enough of us are left now sheep get like shepherd and shepherd like sheep it is said but slowli and neither have long in the world it is quicker and closer with tree and ent and they walk down the age togeth for ent are more like elv less interest in themselv than men are and better at get insid other thing and yet again ent are more like men more changeabl than elv are and quicker at take the colour of the outsid you might say or better than both for they are steadier and keep their mind on thing longer some of my kin look just like tree now and need someth great to rous them and they speak onli in whisper but some of my tree are limblith and mani can talk to me elv began it of cours wake tree up and teach them to speak and learn their treetalk they alway wish to talk to everyth the old elv did but then the great dark came and they pass away over the sea or fled into far valley and hid themselv and made song about day that would never come again never again aye aye there wa all one wood onc upon a time from here to the mountain of lune and thi wa just the east end those were the broad day time wa when i could walk and sing all day and hear no more than the echo of my own voic in the hollow hill the wood were like the wood of lothlórien onli thicker stronger younger and the smell of the air i use to spend a week just breath treebeard fell silent stride along and yet make hardli a sound with hi great feet then he began to hum again and pass into a murmur chant gradual the hobbit becam awar that he wa chant to them in the willowmead of tasarinan i walk in the spring ah the sight and the smell of the spring in nantasarion and i said that wa good i wander in summer in the elmwood of ossiriand ah the light and the music in the summer by the seven river of ossir and i thought that wa best to the beech of neldoreth i came in the autumn ah the gold and the red and the sigh of leav in the autumn in taurnaneldor it wa more than my desir to the pinetre upon the highland of dorthonion i climb in the winter ah the wind and the white and the black branch of winter upon orodnathôn my voic went up and sang in the sky and now all those land lie under the wave and i walk in ambaróna in tauremorna in aldalómë in my own land in the countri of fangorn where the root are long and the year lie thicker than the leav in tauremornalómë he end and strode on silent and in all the wood as far as ear could reach there wa not a sound the day wane and dusk wa twine about the bole of the tree at last the hobbit saw rise dimli befor them a steep dark land they had come to the feet of the mountain and to the green root of tall methedra down the hillsid the young entwash leap from it spring high abov ran noisili from step to step to meet them on the right of the stream there wa a long slope clad with grass now grey in the twilight no tree grew there and it wa open to the sky star were shine alreadi in lake between shore of cloud treebeard strode up the slope hardli slacken hi pace suddenli befor them the hobbit saw a wide open two great tree stood there one on either side like live gatepost but there wa no gate save their cross and interwoven bough as the old ent approach the tree lift up their branch and all their leav quiver and rustl for they were evergreen tree and their leav were dark and polish and gleam in the twilight beyond them wa a wide level space as though the floor of a great hall had been cut in the side of the hill on either hand the wall slope upward until they were fifti feet high or more and along each wall stood an aisl of tree that also increas in height as they march inward at the far end the rockwal wa sheer but at the bottom it had been hollow back into a shallow bay with an arch roof the onli roof of the hall save the branch of the tree which at the inner end overshadow all the ground leav onli a broad open path in the middl a littl stream escap from the spring abov and leav the main water fell tinkl down the sheer face of the wall pour in silver drop like a fine curtain in front of the arch bay the water wa gather again into a stone basin in the floor between the tree and thenc it spill and flow away besid the open path out to rejoin the entwash in it journey through the forest hm here we are said treebeard break hi long silenc i have brought you about seventi thousand entstrid but what that come to in the measur of your land i do not know anyhow we are near the root of the last mountain part of the name of thi place might be wellinghal if it were turn into your languag i like it we will stay here tonight he set them down on the grass between the aisl of the tree and they follow him toward the great arch the hobbit now notic that as he walk hi knee hardli bent but hi leg open in a great stride he plant hi big toe and they were inde big and veri broad on the ground first befor ani other part of hi feet for a moment treebeard stood under the rain of the fall spring and took a deep breath then he laugh and pass insid a great stone tabl stood there but no chair at the back of the bay it wa alreadi quit dark treebeard lift two great vessel and stood them on the tabl they seem to be fill with water but he held hi hand over them and immedi they began to glow one with a golden and the other with a rich green light and the blend of the two light lit the bay as if the sun of summer wa shine through a roof of young leav look back the hobbit saw that the tree in the court had also begun to glow faintli at first but steadili quicken until everi leaf wa edg with light some green some gold some red as copper while the treetrunk look like pillar mould out of lumin stone well well now we can talk again said treebeard you are thirsti i expect perhap you are also tire drink thi he went to the back of the bay and then they saw that sever tall stone jar stood there with heavi lid he remov one of the lid and dip in a great ladl and with it fill three bowl one veri larg bowl and two smaller one thi is an enthous he said and there are no seat i fear but you may sit on the tabl pick up the hobbit he set them on the great stone slab six feet abov the ground and there they sat dangl their leg and drink in sip the drink wa like water inde veri like the tast of the draught they had drunk from the entwash near the border of the forest and yet there wa some scent or savour in it which they could not describ it wa faint but it remind them of the smell of a distant wood born from afar by a cool breez at night the effect of the draught began at the toe and rose steadili through everi limb bring refresh and vigour as it cours upward right to the tip of the hair inde the hobbit felt that the hair on their head wa actual stand up wave and curl and grow as for treebeard he first lave hi feet in the basin beyond the arch and then he drain hi bowl at one draught one long slow draught the hobbit thought he would never stop at last he set the bowl down again ah – ah he sigh hm hoom now we can talk easier you can sit on the floor and i will lie down that will prevent thi drink from rise to my head and send me to sleep on the right side of the bay there wa a great bed on low leg not more than a coupl of feet high cover deep in dri grass and bracken treebeard lower himself slowli on to thi with onli the slightest sign of bend at hi middl until he lay at full length with hi arm behind hi head look up at the ceil upon which light were flicker like the play of leav in the sunshin merri and pippin sat besid him on pillow of grass now tell me your tale and do not hurri said treebeard the hobbit began to tell him the stori of their adventur ever sinc they left hobbiton they follow no veri clear order for they interrupt one anoth continu and treebeard often stop the speaker and went back to some earlier point or jump forward ask question about later event they said noth whatev about the ring and did not tell him whi they set out or where they were go to and he did not ask for ani reason he wa immens interest in everyth in the black rider in elrond and rivendel in the old forest and tom bombadil in the mine of moria and in lothlórien and galadriel he made them describ the shire and it countri over and over again he said an odd thing at thi point you never see ani hm ani ent round there do you he ask well not ent entwiv i should realli say entwiv said pippin are they like you at all ye hm well no i do not realli know now said treebeard thought but they would like your countri so i just wonder treebeard wa howev especi interest in everyth that concern gandalf and most interest of all in saruman do the hobbit regret veri much that they knew so littl about them onli a rather vagu report by sam of what gandalf had told the council but they were clear at ani rate that uglúk and hi troop came from isengard and spoke of saruman as their master hm hoom said treebeard when at last their stori had wound and wander down to the battl of the orc and the rider of rohan well well that is a bundl of news and no mistak you have not told me all no inde not by a long way but i do not doubt that you are do as gandalf would wish there is someth veri big go on that i can see and what it is mayb i shall learn in good time or in bad time by root and twig but it is a strang busi up sprout a littl folk that are not in the old list and behold the nine forgotten rider reappear to hunt them and gandalf take them on a great journey and galadriel harbour them in cara galadhon and orc pursu them down all the leagu of wilderland inde they seem to be caught up in a great storm i hope they weather it and what about yourself ask merri hoom hm i have not troubl about the great war said treebeard they mostli concern elv and men that is the busi of wizard wizard are alway troubl about the futur i do not like worri about the futur i am not altogeth on anybodi side becaus nobodi is altogeth on my side if you understand me nobodi care for the wood as i care for them not even elv nowaday still i take more kindli to elv than to other it wa the elv that cure us of dumb long ago and that wa a great gift that can not be forgotten though our way have part sinc and there are some thing of cours whose side i am altogeth not on i am against them altogeth these – burárum he again made a deep rumbl of disgust – these orc and their master i use to be anxiou when the shadow lay on mirkwood but when it remov to mordor i did not troubl for a while mordor is a long way away but it seem that the wind is set east and the wither of all wood may be draw near there is naught that an old ent can do to hold back that storm he must weather it or crack but saruman now saruman is a neighbour i can not overlook him i must do someth i suppos i have often wonder late what i should do about saruman who is saruman ask pippin do you know anyth about hi histori saruman is a wizard answer treebeard more than that i can not say i do not know the histori of wizard they appear first after the great ship came over the sea but if they came with the ship i never can tell saruman wa reckon great among them i believ he gave up wander about and mind the affair of men and elv some time ago – you would call it a veri long time ago and he settl down at angrenost or isengard as the men of rohan call it he wa veri quiet to begin with but hi fame began to grow he wa chosen to be head of the white council they say but that did not turn out too well i wonder now if even then saruman wa not turn to evil way but at ani rate he use to give no troubl to hi neighbour i use to talk to him there wa a time when he wa alway walk about my wood he wa polit in those day alway ask my leav at least when he met me and alway eager to listen i told him mani thing that he would never have found out by himself but he never repaid me in like kind i can not rememb that he ever told me anyth and he got more and more like that hi face as i rememb it – i have not seen it for mani a day – becam like window in a stone wall window with shutter insid i think that i now understand what he is up to he is plot to becom a power he ha a mind of metal and wheel and he doe not care for grow thing except as far as they serv him for the moment and now it is clear that he is a black traitor he ha taken up with foul folk with the orc brm hoom wors than that he ha been do someth to them someth danger for these isengard are more like wick men it is a mark of evil thing that came in the great dark that they can not abid the sun but saruman orc can endur it even if they hate it i wonder what he ha done are they men he ha ruin or ha he blend the race of orc and men that would be a black evil treebeard rumbl for a moment as if he were pronounc some deep subterranean entish maledict some time ago i began to wonder how orc dare to pass through my wood so freeli he went on onli late did i guess that saruman wa to blame and that long ago he had been spi out all the way and discov my secret he and hi foul folk are make havoc now down on the border they are fell treesgood tree some of the tree they just cut down and leav to rot – orcmischief that but most are hewn up and carri off to feed the fire of orthanc there is alway a smoke rise from isengard these day curs him root and branch mani of those tree were my friend creatur i had known from nut and acorn mani had voic of their own that are lost for ever now and there are wast of stump and brambl where onc there were sing grove i have been idl i have let thing slip it must stop treebeard rais himself from hi bed with a jerk stood up and thump hi hand on the tabl the vessel of light trembl and sent up two jet of flame there wa a flicker like green fire in hi eye and hi beard stood out stiff as a great besom i will stop it he boom and you shall come with me you may be abl to help me you will be help your own friend that way too for if saruman is not check rohan and gondor will have an enemi behind as well as in front our road go togeth – to isengard we will come with you said merri we will do what we can ye said pippin i should like to see the white hand overthrown i should like to be there even if i could not be of much use i shall never forget uglúk and the cross of rohan good good said treebeard but i spoke hastili we must not be hasti i have becom too hot i must cool myself and think for it is easier to shout stop than to do it he strode to the archway and stood for some time under the fall rain of the spring then he laugh and shook himself and wherev the drop of water fell glitter from him to the ground they glint like red and green spark he came back and laid himself on the bed again and wa silent after some time the hobbit heard him murmur again he seem to be count on hi finger fangorn fingla fladrif aye aye he sigh the troubl is that there are so few of us left he said turn toward the hobbit onli three remain of the first ent that walk in the wood befor the dark onli myself fangorn and fingla and fladrif – to give them their elvish name you may call them leaflock and skinbark if you like that better and of us three leaflock and skinbark are not much use for thi busi leaflock ha grown sleepi almost treeish you might say he ha taken to stand by himself halfasleep all through the summer with the deep grass of the meadow round hi knee cover with leafi hair he is he use to rous up in winter but of late he ha been too drowsi to walk far even then skinbark live on the mountainslop west of isengard that is where the worst troubl ha been he wa wound by the orc and mani of hi folk and hi treeherd have been murder and destroy he ha gone up into the high place among the birch that he love best and he will not come down still i daresay i could get togeth a fair compani of our younger folk – if i could make them understand the need if i could rous them we are not a hasti folk what a piti there are so few of us whi are there so few when you have live in thi countri so long ask pippin have a great mani die oh no said treebeard none have die from insid as you might say some have fallen in the evil chanc of the long year of cours and more have grown treeish but there were never mani of us and we have not increas there have been no ent – no children you would say not for a terribl long count of year you see we lost the entwiv how veri sad said pippin how wa it that they all die they did not die said treebeard i never said die we lost them i said we lost them and we can not find them he sigh i thought most folk knew that there were song about the hunt of the ent for the entwiv sung among elv and men from mirkwood to gondor they can not be quit forgotten well i am afraid the song have not come west over the mountain to the shire said merri wont you tell us some more or sing us one of the song ye i will inde said treebeard seem pleas with the request but i can not tell it properli onli in short and then we must end our talk tomorrow we have council to call and work to do and mayb a journey to begin it is rather a strang and sad stori he went on after a paus when the world wa young and the wood were wide and wild the ent and the entwiv – and there were entmaiden then ah the loveli of fimbrethil of wandlimb the lightfoot in the day of our youth – they walk togeth and they hous togeth but our heart did not go on grow in the same way the ent gave their love to thing that they met in the world and the entwiv gave their thought to other thing for the ent love the great tree and the wild wood and the slope of the high hill and they drank of the mountainstream and ate onli such fruit as the tree let fall in their path and they learn of the elv and spoke with the tree but the entwiv gave their mind to the lesser tree and to the mead in the sunshin beyond the feet of the forest and they saw the sloe in the thicket and the wild appl and the cherri blossom in spring and the green herb in the waterland in summer and the seed grass in the autumn field they did not desir to speak with these thing but they wish them to hear and obey what wa said to them the entwiv order them to grow accord to their wish and bear leaf and fruit to their like for the entwiv desir order and plenti and peac by which they meant that thing should remain where they had set them so the entwiv made garden to live in but we ent went on wander and we onli came to the garden now and again then when the dark came in the north the entwiv cross the great river and made new garden and till new field and we saw them more seldom after the dark wa overthrown the land of the entwiv blossom richli and their field were full of corn mani men learn the craft of the entwiv and honour them greatli but we were onli a legend to them a secret in the heart of the forest yet here we still are while all the garden of the entwiv are wast men call them the brown land now i rememb it wa long ago – in the time of the war between sauron and the men of the sea – desir came over me to see fimbrethil again veri fair she wa still in my eye when i had last seen her though littl like the entmaiden of old for the entwiv were bent and brown by their labour their hair parch by the sun to the hue of ripe corn and their cheek like red appl yet their eye were still the eye of our own peopl we cross over anduin and came to their land but we found a desert it wa all burn and uproot for war had pass over it but the entwiv were not there long we call and long we search and we ask all folk that we met which way the entwiv had gone some said they had never seen them and some said that they had seen them walk away west and some said east and other south but nowher that we went could we find them our sorrow wa veri great yet the wild wood call and we return to it for mani year we use to go out everi now and again and look for the entwiv walk far and wide and call them by their beauti name but as time pass we went more seldom and wander less far and now the entwiv are onli a memori for us and our beard are long and grey the elv made mani song concern the search of the ent and some of the song pass into the tongu of men but we made no song about it be content to chant their beauti name when we thought of the entwiv we believ that we may meet again in a time to come and perhap we shall find somewher a land where we can live togeth and both be content but it is forebod that that will onli be when we have both lost all that we now have and it may well be that that time is draw near at last for if sauron of old destroy the garden the enemi today seem like to wither all the wood there wa an elvish song that spoke of thi or at least so i understand it it use to be sung up and down the great river it wa never an entish song mark you it would have been a veri long song in entish but we know it by heart and hum it now and again thi is how it run in your tongu ent when spring unfold the beechen leaf and sap is in the bough when light is on the wildwood stream and wind is on the brow when stride is long and breath is deep and keen the mountainair come back to me come back to me and say my land is fair entwif when spring is come to garth and field and corn is in the blade when blossom like a shine snow is on the orchard laid when shower and sun upon the earth with fragranc fill the air ill linger here and will not come becaus my land is fair ent when summer lie upon the world and in a noon of gold beneath the roof of sleep leav the dream of tree unfold when woodland hall are green and cool and wind is in the west come back to me come back to me and say my land is best entwif when summer warm the hang fruit and burn the berri brown when straw is gold and ear is white and harvest come to town when honey spill and appl swell though wind be in the west ill linger here beneath the sun becaus my land is best ent when winter come the winter wild that hill and wood shall slay when tree shall fall and starless night devour the sunless day when wind is in the deadli east then in the bitter rain ill look for thee and call to thee ill come to thee again entwif when winter come and sing end when dark fall at last when broken is the barren bough and light and labour past ill look for thee and wait for thee until we meet again togeth we will take the road beneath the bitter rain both togeth we will take the road that lead into the west and far away will find a land where both our heart may rest treebeard end hi song that is how it goe he said it is elvish of cours lightheart quickword and soon over i daresay it is fair enough but the ent could say more on their side if they had time but now i am go to stand up and take a littl sleep where will you stand we usual lie down to sleep said merri we shall be all right where we are lie down to sleep said treebeard whi of cours you do hm hoom i wa forget sing that song put me in mind of old time almost thought that i wa talk to young ent i did well you can lie on the bed i am go to stand in the rain good night merri and pippin climb on to the bed and curl up in the soft grass and fern it wa fresh and sweetscent and warm the light die down and the glow of the tree fade but outsid under the arch they could see old treebeard stand motionless with hi arm rais abov hi head the bright star peer out of the sky and lit the fall water as it spill on to hi finger and head and drip drip in hundr of silver drop on to hi feet listen to the tinkl of the drop the hobbit fell asleep they woke to find a cool sun shine into the great court and on to the floor of the bay shred of high cloud were overhead run on a stiff easterli wind treebeard wa not to be seen but while merri and pippin were bath in the basin by the arch they heard him hum and sing as he came up the path between the tree hoo ho good morn merri and pippin he boom when he saw them you sleep long i have been mani a hundr stride alreadi today now we will have a drink and go to entmoot he pour them out two full bowl from a stone jar but from a differ jar the tast wa not the same as it had been the night befor it wa earthier and richer more sustain and foodlik so to speak while the hobbit drank sit on the edg of the bed and nibbl small piec of elfcak more becaus they felt that eat wa a necessari part of breakfast than becaus they felt hungri treebeard stood hum in entish or elvish or some strang tongu and look up at the sky where is entmoot pippin ventur to ask hoo eh entmoot said treebeard turn round it is not a place it is a gather of ent – which doe not often happen nowaday but i have manag to make a fair number promis to come we shall meet in the place where we have alway met derndingl men call it it is away south from here we must be there befor noon befor long they set off treebeard carri the hobbit in hi arm as on the previou day at the entranc to the court he turn to the right step over the stream and strode away southward along the feet of great tumbl slope where tree were scanti abov these the hobbit saw thicket of birch and rowan and beyond them dark climb pinewood soon treebeard turn a littl away from the hill and plung into deep grove where the tree were larger taller and thicker than ani that the hobbit had ever seen befor for a while they felt faintli the sens of stifl which they had notic when they first ventur into fangorn but it soon pass treebeard did not talk to them he hum to himself deepli and thought but merri and pippin caught no proper word it sound like boom boom rumboom boorar boom boom dahrar boom boom dahrar boom and so on with a constant chang of note and rhythm now and again they thought they heard an answer a hum or a quiver of sound that seem to come out of the earth or from bough abov their head or perhap from the bole of the tree but treebeard did not stop or turn hi head to either side they had been go for a long while – pippin had tri to keep count of the entstrid but had fail get lost at about three thousand – when treebeard began to slacken hi pace suddenli he stop put the hobbit down and rais hi curl hand to hi mouth so that they made a hollow tube then he blew or call through them a great hoom hom rang out like a deepthroat horn in the wood and seem to echo from the tree far off there came from sever direct a similar hoom hom hoom that wa not an echo but an answer treebeard now perch merri and pippin on hi shoulder and strode on again everi now and then send out anoth horncal and each time the answer came louder and nearer in thi way they came at last to what look like an impenetr wall of dark evergreen tree tree of a kind that the hobbit had never seen befor they branch out right from the root and were dens clad in dark glossi leav like thornless holli and they bore mani stiff upright flowerspik with larg shine olivecolour bud turn to the left and skirt thi huge hedg treebeard came in a few stride to a narrow entranc through it a worn path pass and dive suddenli down a long steep slope the hobbit saw that they were descend into a great dingl almost as round as a bowl veri wide and deep crown at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedg it wa smooth and grassclad insid and there were no tree except three veri tall and beauti silverbirch that stood at the bottom of the bowl two other path led down into the dingl from the west and from the east sever ent had alreadi arriv more were come in down the other path and some were now follow treebeard as they drew near the hobbit gaze at them they had expect to see a number of creatur as much like treebeard as one hobbit is like anoth at ani rate to a stranger eye and they were veri much surpris to see noth of the kind the ent were as differ from one anoth as tree from tree some as differ as one tree is from anoth of the same name but quit differ growth and histori and some as differ as one treekind from anoth as birch from beech oak from fir there were a few older ent beard and gnarl like hale but ancient tree though none look as ancient as treebeard and there were tall strong ent cleanlimb and smoothskin like foresttre in their prime but there were no young ent no sapl altogeth there were about two dozen stand on the wide grassi floor of the dingl and as mani more were march in at first merri and pippin were struck chiefli by the varieti that they saw the mani shape and colour the differ in girth and height and length of leg and arm and in the number of toe and finger anyth from three to nine a few seem more or less relat to treebeard and remind them of beechtre or oak but there were other kind some recal the chestnut brownskin ent with larg splayfing hand and short thick leg some recal the ash tall straight grey ent with manyfing hand and long leg some the fir the tallest ent and other the birch the rowan and the linden but when the ent all gather round treebeard bow their head slightli murmur in their slow music voic and look long and intent at the stranger then the hobbit saw that they were all of the same kindr and all had the same eye not all so old or so deep as treebeard but all with the same slow steadi thought express and the same green flicker as soon as the whole compani wa assembl stand in a wide circl round treebeard a curiou and unintellig convers began the ent began to murmur slowli first one join and then anoth until they were all chant togeth in a long rise and fall rhythm now louder on one side of the ring now die away there and rise to a great boom on the other side though he could not catch or understand ani of the word – he suppos the languag wa entish – pippin found the sound veri pleasant to listen to at first but gradual hi attent waver after a long time and the chant show no sign of slacken he found himself wonder sinc entish wa such an unhasti languag whether they had yet got further than good morn and if treebeard wa to call the roll how mani day it would take to sing all their name i wonder what the entish is for ye or no he thought he yawn treebeard wa immedi awar of him hm ha hey my pippin he said and the other ent all stop their chant you are a hasti folk i wa forget and anyway it is wearisom listen to a speech you do not understand you may get down now i have told your name to the entmoot and they have seen you and they have agre that you are not orc and that a new line shall be put in the old list we have got no further yet but that is quick work for an entmoot you and merri can stroll about in the dingl if you like there is a well of good water if you need refresh away yonder in the north bank there are still some word to speak befor the moot realli begin i will come and see you again and tell you how thing are go he put the hobbit down befor they walk away they bow low thi feat seem to amus the ent veri much to judg by the tone of their murmur and the flicker of their eye but they soon turn back to their own busi merri and pippin climb up the path that came in from the west and look through the open in the great hedg long treeclad slope rose from the lip of the dingl and away beyond them abov the firtre of the furthest ridg there rose sharp and white the peak of a high mountain southward to their left they could see the forest fall away down into the grey distanc there far away there wa a pale green glimmer that merri guess to be a glimps of the plain of rohan i wonder where isengard is said pippin i dont know quit where we are said merri but that peak is probabl methedra and as far as i can rememb the ring of isengard lie in a fork or deep cleft at the end of the mountain it is probabl down behind thi great ridg there seem to be a smoke or haze over there left of the peak dont you think what is isengard like said pippin i wonder what ent can do about it anyway so do i said merri isengard is a sort of ring of rock or hill i think with a flat space insid and an island or pillar of rock in the middl call orthanc saruman ha a tower on it there is a gate perhap more than one in the encircl wall and i believ there is a stream run through it it come out of the mountain and flow on across the gap of rohan it doe not seem the sort of place for ent to tackl but i have an odd feel about these ent somehow i dont think they are quit as safe and well funni as they seem they seem slow queer and patient almost sad and yet i believ they could be rous if that happen i would rather not be on the other side ye said pippin i know what you mean there might be all the differ between an old cow sit and thought chew and a bull charg and the chang might come suddenli i wonder if treebeard will rous them i am sure he mean to tri but they dont like be rous treebeard got rous himself last night and then bottl it up again the hobbit turn back the voic of the ent were still rise and fall in their conclav the sun had now risen high enough to look over the high hedg it gleam on the top of the birch and lit the northward side of the dingl with a cool yellow light there they saw a littl glitter fountain they walk along the rim of the great bowl at the feet of the evergreensit wa pleasant to feel cool grass about their toe again and not to be in a hurryand then they climb down to the gush water they drank a littl a clean cold sharp draught and sat down on a mossi stone watch the patch of sun on the grass and the shadow of the sail cloud pass over the floor of the dingl the murmur of the ent went on it seem a veri strang and remot place outsid their world and far from everyth that had ever happen to them a great long came over them for the face and voic of their companion especi for frodo and sam and for strider at last there came a paus in the entvoic and look up they saw treebeard come toward them with anoth ent at hi side hm hoom here i am again said treebeard are you get weari or feel impati hmm eh well i am afraid that you must not get impati yet we have finish the first stage now but i have still got to explain thing again to those that live a long way off far from isengard and those that i could not get round to befor the moot and after that we shall have to decid what to do howev decid what to do doe not take ent so long as go over all the fact and event that they have to make up their mind about still it is no use deni we shall be here a long time yet a coupl of day veri like so i have brought you a companion he ha an enthous nearbi bregalad is hi elvish name he say he ha alreadi made up hi mind and doe not need to remain at the moot hm hm he is the nearest thing among us to a hasti ent you ought to get on togeth goodby treebeard turn and left them bregalad stood for some time survey the hobbit solemnli and they look at him wonder when he would show ani sign of hasti he wa tall and seem to be one of the younger ent he had smooth shine skin on hi arm and leg hi lip were ruddi and hi hair wa greygreen he could bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind at last he spoke and hi voic though reson wa higher and clearer than treebeard ha hmm my friend let us go for a walk he said i am bregalad that is quickbeam in your languag but it is onli a nicknam of cours they have call me that ever sinc i said ye to an elder ent befor he had finish hi question also i drink quickli and go out while some are still wet their beard come with me he reach down two shape arm and gave a longfing hand to each of the hobbit all that day they walk about in the wood with him sing and laugh for quickbeam often laugh he laugh if the sun came out from behind a cloud he laugh if they came upon a stream or spring then he stoop and splash hi feet and head with water he laugh sometim at some sound or whisper in the tree whenev he saw a rowantre he halt a while with hi arm stretch out and sang and sway as he sang at nightfal he brought them to hi enthous noth more than a mossi stone set upon turv under a green bank rowantre grew in a circl about it and there wa water as in all enthous a spring bubbl out from the bank they talk for a while as dark fell on the forest not far away the voic of the entmoot could be heard still go on but now they seem deeper and less leisur and everi now and again one great voic would rise in a high and quicken music while all the other die away but besid them bregalad spoke gentli in their own tongu almost whisper and they learn that he belong to skinbark peopl and the countri where they had live had been ravag that seem to the hobbit quit enough to explain hi hasti at least in the matter of orc there were rowantre in my home said bregalad softli and sadli rowantre that took root when i wa an ent mani mani year ago in the quiet of the world the oldest were plant by the ent to tri and pleas the entwiv but they look at them and smile and said that they knew where whiter blossom and richer fruit were grow yet there are no tree of all that race the peopl of the rose that are so beauti to me and these tree grew and grew till the shadow of each wa like a green hall and their red berri in the autumn were a burden and a beauti and a wonder bird use to flock there i like bird even when they chatter and the rowan ha enough and to spare but the bird becam unfriendli and greedi and tore at the tree and threw the fruit down and did not eat it then orc came with axe and cut down my tree i came and call them by their long name but they did not quiver they did not hear or answer they lay dead o orofarnë lassemista carnimírië o rowan fair upon your hair how white the blossom lay o rowan mine i saw you shine upon a summer day your rind so bright your leav so light your voic so cool and soft upon your head how goldenr the crown you bore aloft o rowan dead upon your head your hair is dri and grey your crown is spill your voic is still for ever and a day o orofarnë lassemista carnimírië the hobbit fell asleep to the sound of the soft sing of bregalad that seem to lament in mani tongu the fall of tree that he had love the next day they spent also in hi compani but they did not go far from hi hous most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the bank for the wind wa colder and the cloud closer and greyer there wa littl sunshin and in the distanc the voic of the ent at the moot still rose and fell sometim loud and strong sometim low and sad sometim quicken sometim slow and solemn as a dirg a second night came and still the ent held conclav under hurri cloud and fit star the third day broke bleak and windi at sunris the ent voic rose to a great clamour and then die down again as the morn wore on the wind fell and the air grew heavi with expect the hobbit could see that bregalad wa now listen intent although to them down in the dell of hi enthous the sound of the moot wa faint the afternoon came and the sun go west toward the mountain sent out long yellow beam between the crack and fissur of the cloud suddenli they were awar that everyth wa veri quiet the whole forest stood in listen silenc of cours the entvoic had stop what did that mean bregalad wa stand up erect and tens look back northward toward derndingl then with a crash came a great ring shout rahoomrah the tree quiver and bent as if a gust had struck them there wa anoth paus and then a march music began like solemn drum and abov the roll beat and boom there well voic sing high and strong we come we come with roll of drum tarunda runda runda rom the ent were come ever nearer and louder rose their song we come we come with horn and drum tarûna rûna rûna rom bregalad pick up the hobbit and strode from hi hous befor long they saw the march line approach the ent were swing along with great stride down the slope toward them treebeard wa at their head and some fifti follow were behind him two abreast keep step with their feet and beat time with their hand upon their flank as they drew near the flash and flicker of their eye could be seen hoom hom here we come with a boom here we come at last call treebeard when he caught sight of bregalad and the hobbit come join the moot we are off we are off to isengard to isengard the ent cri in mani voic to isengard to isengard though isengard be ring and bar with door of stone though isengard be strong and hard as cold as stone and bare as bone we go we go we go to war to hew the stone and break the door for bole and bough are burn now the furnac roar – we go to war to land of gloom with tramp of doom with roll of drum we come we come to isengard with doom we come with doom we come with doom we come so they sang as they march southward bregalad hi eye shine swung into the line besid treebeard the old ent now took the hobbit back and set them on hi shoulder again and so they rode proudli at the head of the sing compani with beat heart and head held high though they had expect someth to happen eventu they were amaz at the chang that had come over the ent it seem now as sudden as the burst of a flood that had long been held back by a dike the ent made up their mind rather quickli after all didnt they pippin ventur to say after some time when for a moment the sing paus and onli the beat of hand and feet wa heard quickli said treebeard hoom ye inde quicker than i expect inde i have not seen them rous like thi for mani an age we ent do not like be rous and we never are rous unless it is clear to us that our tree and our live are in great danger that ha not happen in thi forest sinc the war of sauron and the men of the sea it is the orcwork the wanton hew – rárum – without even the bad excus of feed the fire that ha so anger us and the treacheri of a neighbour who should have help us wizard ought to know better they do know better there is no curs in elvish entish or the tongu of men bad enough for such treacheri down with saruman will you realli break the door of isengard ask merri ho hm well we could you know you do not know perhap how strong we are mayb you have heard of troll they are mighti strong but troll are onli counterfeit made by the enemi in the great dark in mockeri of ent as orc were of elv we are stronger than troll we are made of the bone of the earth we can split stone like the root of tree onli quicker far quicker if our mind are rous if we are not hewn down or destroy by fire or blast of sorceri we could split isengard into splinter and crack it wall into rubbl but saruman will tri to stop you wont he hm ah ye that is so i have not forgotten it inde i have thought long about it but you see mani of the ent are younger than i am by mani live of tree they are all rous now and their mind is all on one thing break isengard but they will start think again befor long they will cool down a littl when we take our even drink what a thirst we shall have but let them march now and sing we have a long way to go and there is time ahead for thought it is someth to have start treebeard march on sing with the other for a while but after a time hi voic die to a murmur and fell silent again pippin could see that hi old brow wa wrinkl and knot at last he look up and pippin could see a sad look in hi eye sad but not unhappi there wa a light in them as if the green flame had sunk deeper into the dark well of hi thought of cours it is like enough my friend he said slowli like enough that we are go to our doom the last march of the ent but if we stay at home and did noth doom would find us anyway sooner or later that thought ha long been grow in our heart and that is whi we are march now it wa not a hasti resolv now at least the last march of the ent may be worth a song aye he sigh we may help the other peopl befor we pass away still i should have like to see the song come true about the entwiv i should dearli have like to see fimbrethil again but there my friend song like tree bear fruit onli in their own time and their own way and sometim they are wither untim the ent went stride on at a great pace they had descend into a long fold of the land that fell away southward now they began to climb up and up on to the high western ridg the wood fell away and they came to scatter group of birch and then to bare slope where onli a few gaunt pinetre grew the sun sank behind the dark hillback in front grey dusk fell pippin look behind the number of the ent had grown – or what wa happen where the dim bare slope that they had cross should lie he thought he saw grove of tree but they were move could it be that the tree of fangorn were awak and the forest wa rise march over the hill to war he rub hi eye wonder if sleep and shadow had deceiv him but the great grey shape move steadili onward there wa a nois like wind in mani branch the ent were draw near the crest of the ridg now and all song had ceas night fell and there wa silenc noth wa to be heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the ent and a rustl the shade of a whisper as of mani drift leav at last they stood upon the summit and look down into a dark pit the great cleft at the end of the mountain nan curunír the valley of saruman night lie over isengard said treebeard chapter the white rider my veri bone are chill said gimli flap hi arm and stamp hi feet day had come at last at dawn the companion had made such breakfast as they could now in the grow light they were get readi to search the ground again for sign of the hobbit and do not forget that old man said gimli i should be happier if i could see the print of a boot whi would that make you happi said legola becaus an old man with feet that leav mark might be no more than he seem answer the dwarf mayb said the elf but a heavi boot might leav no print here the grass is deep and springi that would not baffl a ranger said gimli a bent blade is enough for aragorn to read but i do not expect him to find ani trace it wa an evil phantom of saruman that we saw last night i am sure of it even under the light of morn hi eye are look out on us from fangorn even now mayb it is like enough said aragorn yet i am not sure i am think of the hors you said last night gimli that they were scare away but i did not think so did you hear them legola did they sound to you like beast in terror no said legola i heard them clearli but for the dark and our own fear i should have guess that they were beast wild with some sudden glad they spoke as hors will when they meet a friend that they have long miss so i thought said aragorn but i can not read the riddl unless they return come the light is grow fast let us look first and guess later we should begin here near to our own campingground search care all about and work up the slope toward the forest to find the hobbit is our errand whatev we may think of our visitor in the night if they escap by some chanc then they must have hidden in the tree or they would have been seen if we find noth between here and the eav of the wood then we will make a last search upon the battlefield and among the ash but there is littl hope there the horsemen of rohan did their work too well for some time the companion crawl and grope upon the ground the tree stood mourn abov them it dri leav now hang limp and rattl in the chill easterli wind aragorn move slowli away he came to the ash of the watchfir near the riverbank and then began to retrac the ground back toward the knoll where the battl had been fought suddenli he stoop and bent low with hi face almost in the grass then he call to the other they came run up here at last we find news said aragorn he lift up a broken leaf for them to see a larg pale leaf of golden hue now fade and turn brown here is a mallornleaf of lórien and there are small crumb on it and a few more crumb in the grass and see there are some piec of cut cord lie nearbi and here is the knife that cut them said gimli he stoop and drew out of a tussock into which some heavi foot had trampl it a short jag blade the haft from which it had been snap wa besid it it wa an orcweapon he said hold it gingerli and look with disgust at the carv handl it had been shape like a hideou head with squint eye and leer mouth well here is the strangest riddl that we have yet found exclaim legola a bound prison escap both from the orc and from the surround horsemen he then stop while still in the open and cut hi bond with an orcknif but how and whi for if hi leg were tie how did he walk and if hi arm were tie how did he use the knife and if neither were tie whi did he cut the cord at all be pleas with hi skill he then sat down and quietli ate some waybread that at least is enough to show that he wa a hobbit without the mallornleaf after that i suppos he turn hi arm into wing and flew away sing into the tree it should be easi to find him we onli need wing ourselv there wa sorceri here right enough said gimli what wa that old man do what have you to say aragorn to the read of legola can you better it mayb i could said aragorn smile there are some other sign near at hand that you have not consid i agre that the prison wa a hobbit and must have had either leg or hand free befor he came here i guess that it wa hand becaus the riddl then becom easier and also becaus as i read the mark he wa carri to thi point by an orc blood wa spill there a few pace away orcblood there are deep print of hoof all about thi spot and sign that a heavi thing wa drag away the orc wa slain by horsemen and later hi bodi wa haul to the fire but the hobbit wa not seen he wa not in the open for it wa night and he still had hi elvencloak he wa exhaust and hungri and it is not to be wonder at that when he had cut hi bond with the knife of hi fallen enemi he rest and ate a littl befor he crept away but it is a comfort to know that he had some lemba in hi pocket even though he ran away without gear or pack that perhap is like a hobbit i say he though i hope and guess that both merri and pippin were here togeth there is howev noth to show that for certain and how do you suppos that either of our friend came to have a hand free ask gimli i do not know how it happen answer aragorn nor do i know whi an orc wa carri them away not to help them to escap we may be sure nay rather i think that i now begin to understand a matter that ha puzzl me from the begin whi when boromir had fallen were the orc content with the captur of merri and pippin they did not seek out the rest of us nor attack our camp but instead they went with all speed toward isengard did they suppos they had captur the ringbear and hi faith comrad i think not their master would not dare to give such plain order to orc even if they knew so much themselv they would not speak openli to them of the ring they are not trusti servant but i think the orc had been command to captur hobbit aliv at all cost an attempt wa made to slip out with the preciou prison befor the battl treacheri perhap like enough with such folk some larg and bold orc may have been tri to escap with the prize alon for hi own end there that is my tale other might be devis but on thi we may count in ani case one at least of our friend escap it is our task to find him and help him befor we return to rohan we must not be daunt by fangorn sinc need drove him into that dark place i do not know which daunt me more fangorn or the thought of the long road through rohan on foot said gimli then let us go to the forest said aragorn it wa not long befor aragorn found fresh sign at one point near the bank of the entwash he came upon footprint hobbitprint but too light for much to be made of them then again beneath the bole of a great tree on the veri edg of the wood more print were discov the earth wa bare and dri and did not reveal much one hobbit at least stood here for a while and look back and then he turn away into the forest said aragorn then we must go in too said gimli but i do not like the look of thi fangorn and we were warn against it i wish the chase had led anywher els i do not think the wood feel evil whatev tale may say said legola he stood under the eav of the forest stoop forward as if he were listen and peer with wide eye into the shadow no it is not evil or what evil is in it is far away i catch onli the faintest echo of dark place where the heart of the tree are black there is no malic near us but there is watch and anger well it ha no caus to be angri with me said gimli i have done it no harm that is just as well said legola but nonetheless it ha suffer harm there is someth happen insid or go to happen do you not feel the tens it take my breath i feel the air is stuffi said the dwarf thi wood is lighter than mirkwood but it is musti and shabbi it is old veri old said the elf so old that almost i feel young again as i have not felt sinc i journey with you children it is old and full of memori i could have been happi here if i had come in day of peac i dare say you could snort gimli you are a woodelf anyway though elv of ani kind are strang folk yet you comfort me where you go i will go but keep your bow readi to hand and i will keep my axe loos in my belt not for use on tree he ad hastili look up at the tree under which they stood i do not wish to meet that old man at unawar without an argument readi to hand that is all let us go with that the three hunter plung into the forest of fangorn legola and gimli left the track to aragorn there wa littl for him to see the floor of the forest wa dri and cover with a drift of leav but guess that the fugit would stay near the water he return often to the bank of the stream so it wa that he came upon the place where merri and pippin had drunk and bath their feet there plain for all to see were the footprint of two hobbit one somewhat smaller than the other thi is good tide said aragorn yet the mark are two day old and it seem that at thi point the hobbit left the watersid then what shall we do now said gimli we can not pursu them through the whole fast of fangorn we have come ill suppli if we do not find them soon we shall be of no use to them except to sit down besid them and show our friendship by starv togeth if that is inde all we can do then we must do that said aragorn let us go on they came at length to the steep abrupt end of treebeard hill and look up at the rockwal with it rough step lead to the high shelf gleam of sun were strike through the hurri cloud and the forest now look less grey and drear let us go up and look about us said legola i will feel my breath short i should like to tast a freer air for a while the companion climb up aragorn came last move slowli he wa scan the step and ledg close i am almost sure that the hobbit have been up here he said but there are other mark veri strang mark which i do not understand i wonder if we can see anyth from thi ledg which will help us to guess which way they went next he stood up and look about but he saw noth that wa of ani use the shelf face southward and eastward but onli on the east wa the view open there he could see the head of the tree descend in rank toward the plain from which they had come we have journey a long way round said legola we could have all come here safe togeth if we had left the great river on the second or third day and struck west few can forese whither their road will lead them till they come to it end but we did not wish to come to fangorn said gimli yet here we areand nice caught in the net said legola look look at what said gimli there in the tree where i have not elfey hush speak more softli look said legola point down in the wood back in the way that we have just come it is he can not you see him pass from tree to tree i see i see now hiss gimli look aragorn did i not warn you there is the old man all in dirti grey rag that is whi i could not see him at first aragorn look and beheld a bent figur move slowli it wa not far away it look like an old beggarman walk wearili lean on a rough staff hi head wa bow and he did not look toward them in other land they would have greet him with kind word but now they stood silent each feel a strang expect someth wa approach that held a hidden poweror menac gimli gaze with wide eye for a while as step by step the figur drew nearer then suddenli unabl to contain himself longer he burst out your bow legola bend it get readi it is saruman do not let him speak or put a spell upon us shoot first legola took hi bow and bent it slowli and as if some other will resist him he held an arrow loos in hi hand but did not fit it to the string aragorn stood silent hi face wa watch and intent whi are you wait what is the matter with you said gimli in a hiss whisper legola is right said aragorn quietli we may not shoot an old man so at unawar and unchalleng whatev fear or doubt be on us watch and wait at that moment the old man quicken hi pace and came with surpris speed to the foot of the rockwal then suddenli he look up while they stood motionless look down there wa no sound they could not see hi face he wa hood and abov the hood he wore a widebrim hat so that all hi featur were overshadow except for the end of hi nose and hi grey beard yet it seem to aragorn that he caught the gleam of eye keen and bright from within the shadow of the hood brow at last the old man broke the silenc well met inde my friend he said in a soft voic i wish to speak to you will you come down or shall i come up without wait for an answer he began to climb now said gimli stop him legola did i not say that i wish to speak to you said the old man put away that bow master elf the bow and arrow fell from legola hand and hi arm hung loos at hi side and you master dwarf pray take your hand from your axehaft till i am up you will not need such argument gimli start and then stood still as stone stare while the old man sprang up the rough step as nimbl as a goat all weari seem to have left him as he step up on to the shelf there wa a gleam too brief for certainti a quick glint of white as if some garment shroud by the grey rag had been for an instant reveal the intak of gimli breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the silenc well met i say again said the old man come toward them when he wa a few feet away he stood stoop over hi staff with hi head thrust forward peer at them from under hi hood and what may you be do in these part an elf a man and a dwarf all clad in elvish fashion no doubt there is a tale worth hear behind it all such thing are not often seen here you speak as one that know fangorn well said aragorn is that so not well said the old man that would be the studi of mani live but i come here now and again might we know your name and then hear what it is that you have to say to us said aragorn the morn pass and we have an errand that will not wait as for what i wish to say i have said it what may you be do and what tale can you tell of yourselv as for my name he broke off laugh long and softli aragorn felt a shudder run through him at the sound a strang cold thrill and yet it wa not fear or terror that he felt rather it wa like the sudden bite of a keen air or the slap of a cold rain that wake an uneasi sleeper my name said the old man again have you not guess it alreadi you have heard it befor i think ye you have heard it befor but come now what of your tale the three companion stood silent and made no answer there are some who would begin to doubt whether your errand is fit to tell said the old man happili i know someth of it you are track the footstep of two young hobbit i believ ye hobbit dont stare as if you had never heard the strang name befor you have and so have i well they climb up here the day befor yesterday and they met someon that they did not expect doe that comfort you and now you would like to know where they were taken well well mayb i can give you some news about that but whi are we stand your errand you see is no longer as urgent as you thought let us sit down and be more at eas the old man turn away and went toward a heap of fallen stone and rock at the foot of the cliff behind immedi as if a spell had been remov the other relax and stir gimli hand went at onc to hi axehaft aragorn drew hi sword legola pick up hi bow the old man took no notic but stoop and sat himself on a low flat stone then hi grey cloak drew apart and they saw beyond doubt that he wa cloth beneath all in white saruman cri gimli spring toward him with axe in hand speak tell us where you have hidden our friend what have you done with them speak or i will make a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find it hard to deal with the old man wa too quick for him he sprang to hi feet and leap to the top of a larg rock there he stood grown suddenli tall tower abov them hi hood and hi grey rag were flung away hi white garment shone he lift up hi staff and gimli axe leap from hi grasp and fell ring on the ground the sword of aragorn stiff in hi motionless hand blaze with a sudden fire legola gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air it vanish in a flash of flame mithrandir he cri mithrandir well met i say to you again legola said the old man they all gaze at him hi hair wa white as snow in the sunshin and gleam white wa hi robe the eye under hi deep brow were bright pierc as the ray of the sun power wa in hi hand between wonder joy and fear they stood and found no word to say at last aragorn stir gandalf he said beyond all hope you return to us in our need what veil wa over my sight gandalf gimli said noth hut sank to hi knee shade hi eye gandalf the old man repeat as if recal from old memori a long disus word ye that wa the name i wa gandalf he step down from the rock and pick up hi grey cloak wrap it about him it seem as if the sun had been shine but now wa hid in cloud again ye you may still call me gandalf he said and the voic wa the voic of their old friend and guid get up my good gimli no blame to you and no harm done to me inde my friend none of you have ani weapon that could hurt me be merri we meet again at the turn of the tide the great storm is come but the tide ha turn he laid hi hand on gimli head and the dwarf look up and laugh suddenli gandalf he said but you are all in white ye i am white now said gandalf inde i am saruman one might almost say saruman as he should have been but come now tell me of yourselv i have pass through fire and deep water sinc we part i have forgotten much that i thought i knew and learn again much that i had forgotten i can see mani thing far off but mani thing that are close at hand i can not see tell me of yourselv what do you wish to know said aragorn all that ha happen sinc we part on the bridg would be a long tale will you not first give us news of the hobbit did you find them and are they safe no i did not find them said gandalf there wa a dark over the valley of the emyn muil and i did not know of their captiv until the eagl told me the eagl said legola i have seen an eagl high and far off the last time wa three day ago abov the emyn muil ye said gandalf that wa gwaihir the windlord who rescu me from orthanc i sent him befor me to watch the river and gather tide hi sight is keen but he can not see all that pass under hill and tree some thing he ha seen and other i have seen myself the ring now ha pass beyond my help or the help of ani of the compani that set out from rivendel veri nearli it wa reveal to the enemi but it escap i had some part in that for i sat in a high place and i strove with the dark tower and the shadow pass then i wa weari veri weari and i walk long in dark thought then you know about frodo said gimli how do thing go with him i can not say he wa save from a great peril but mani lie befor him still he resolv to go alon to mordor and he set out that is all that i can say not alon said legola we think that sam went with him did he said gandalf and there wa a gleam in hi eye and a smile on hi face did he inde it is news to me yet it doe not surpris me good veri good you lighten my heart you must tell me more now sit by me and tell me the tale of your journey the companion sat on the ground at hi feet and aragorn took up the tale for a long while gandalf said noth and he ask no question hi hand were spread upon hi knee and hi eye were close at last when aragorn spoke of the death of boromir and of hi last journey upon the great river the old man sigh you have not said all that you know or guess aragorn my friend he said quietli poor boromir i could not see what happen to him it wa a sore trial for such a man a warrior and a lord of men galadriel told me that he wa in peril but he escap in the end i am glad it wa not in vain that the young hobbit came with us if onli for boromir sake but that is not the onli part they have to play they were brought to fangorn and their come wa like the fall of small stone that start an avalanch in the mountain even as we talk here i hear the first rumbl saruman had best not be caught away from home when the dam burst in one thing you have not chang dear friend said aragorn you still speak in riddl what in riddl said gandalf no for i wa talk aloud to myself a habit of the old they choos the wisest person present to speak to the long explan need by the young are weari he laugh but the sound now seem warm and kindli as a gleam of sunshin i am no longer young even in the reckon of men of the ancient hous said aragorn will you not open your mind more clearli to me what then shall i say said gandalf and paus for a while in thought thi in brief is how i see thing at the moment if you wish to have a piec of my mind as plain as possibl the enemi of cours ha long known that the ring is abroad and that it is born by a hobbit he know now the number of our compani that set out from rivendel and the kind of each of us but he doe not yet perceiv our purpos clearli he suppos that we were all go to mina tirith for that is what he would himself have done in our place and accord to hi wisdom it would have been a heavi stroke against hi power inde he is in great fear not know what mighti one may suddenli appear wield the ring and assail him with war seek to cast him down and take hi place that we should wish to cast him down and have no one in hi place is not a thought that occur to hi mind that we should tri to destroy the ring itself ha not yet enter into hi darkest dream in which no doubt you will see our good fortun and our hope for imagin war he ha let loos war believ that he ha no time to wast for he that strike the first blow if he strike it hard enough may need to strike no more so the forc that he ha long been prepar he is now set in motion sooner than he intend wise fool for if he had use all hi power to guard mordor so that none could enter and bent all hi guild to the hunt of the ring then inde hope would have fade neither ring nor bearer could long have elud him but now hi eye gaze abroad rather than near at home and mostli he look toward mina tirith veri soon now hi strength will fall upon it like a storm for alreadi he know that the messeng that he sent to waylay the compani have fail again they have not found the ring neither have they brought away ani hobbit as hostag had they done even so much as that it would have been a heavi blow to us and it might have been fatal but let us not darken our heart by imagin the trial of their gentl loyalti in the dark tower for the enemi ha failedso far thank to saruman then is not saruman a traitor said gimli inde ye said gandalf doubli and is not that strang noth that we have endur of late ha seem so grievou as the treason of isengard even reckon as a lord and captain saruman ha grown veri strong he threaten the men of rohan and draw off their help from mina tirith even as the main blow is approach from the east yet a treacher weapon is ever a danger to the hand saruman also had a mind to captur the ring for himself or at least to snare some hobbit for hi evil purpos so between them our enemi have contriv onli to bring merri and pippin with marvel speed and in the nick of time to fangorn where otherwis they would never have come at all also they have fill themselv with new doubt that disturb their plan no tide of the battl will come to mordor thank to the horsemen of rohan but the dark lord know that two hobbit were taken in the emyn muil and born away toward isengard against the will of hi own servant he now ha isengard to fear as well as mina tirith if mina tirith fall it will go ill with saruman it is a piti that our friend lie in between said gimli if no land divid isengard and mordor then they could fight while we watch and wait the victor would emerg stronger than either and free from doubt said gandalf but isengard can not fight mordor unless saruman first obtain the ring that he will never do now he doe not yet know hi peril there is much that he doe not know he wa so eager to lay hi hand on hi prey that he could not wait at home and he came forth to meet and to spi on hi messeng but he came too late for onc and the battl wa over and beyond hi help befor he reach these part he did not remain here long i look into hi mind and i see hi doubt he ha no woodcraft he believ that the horsemen slew and burn all upon the field of battl but he doe not know whether the orc were bring ani prison or not and he doe not know of the quarrel between hi servant and the orc of mordor nor doe he know of the wing messeng the wing messeng cri legola i shot at him with the bow of galadriel abov sarn gebir and i fell him from the sky he fill us all with fear what new terror is thi one that you can not slay with arrow said gandalf you onli slew hi steed it wa a good deed but the rider wa soon hors again for he wa a nazgûl one of the nine who ride now upon wing steed soon their terror will overshadow the last armi of our friend cut off the sun but they have not yet been allow to cross the river and saruman doe not know of thi new shape in which the ringwraith have been clad hi thought is ever on the ring wa it present in the battl wa it found what if théoden lord of the mark should come by it and learn of it power that is the danger that he see and he ha fled back to isengard to doubl and trebl hi assault on rohan and all the time there is anoth danger close at hand which he doe not see busi with hi fieri thought he ha forgotten treebeard now you speak to yourself again said aragorn with a smile treebeard is not known to me and i have guess part of saruman doubl treacheri yet i do not see in what way the come of two hobbit to fangorn ha serv save to give us a long and fruitless chase wait a minut cri gimli there is anoth thing that i should like to know first wa it you gandalf or saruman that we saw last night you certainli did not see me answer gandalf therefor i must guess that you saw saruman evid we look so much alik that your desir to make an incur dent in my hat must be excus good good said gimli i am glad that it wa not you gandalf laugh again ye my good dwarf he said it is a comfort not to be mistaken at all point do i not know it onli too well but of cours i never blame you for your welcom of me how could i do so who have so often counsel my friend to suspect even their own hand when deal with the enemi bless you gimli son of glóin mayb you will see us both togeth one day and judg between us but the hobbit legola broke in we have come far to seek them and you seem to know where they are where are they now with treebeard and the ent said gandalf the ent exclaim aragorn then there is truth in the old legend about the dweller in the deep forest and the giant shepherd of the tree are there still ent in the world i thought they were onli a memori of ancient day if inde they were ever more than a legend of rohan a legend of rohan cri legola nay everi elf in wilderland ha sung song of the old onodrim and their long sorrow yet even among us they are onli a memori if i were to meet one still walk in thi world then inde i should feel young again but treebeard that is onli a render of fangorn into the common speech yet you seem to speak of a person who is thi treebeard ah now you are ask much said gandalf the littl that i know of hi long slow stori would make a tale for which we have no time now treebeard is fangorn the guardian of the forest he is the oldest of the ent the oldest live thing that still walk beneath the sun upon thi middleearth i hope inde legola that you may yet meet him merri and pippin have been fortun they met him here even where we sit for he came here two day ago and bore them away to hi dwell far off by the root of the mountain he often come here especi when hi mind is uneasi and rumour of the world outsid troubl him i saw him four day ago stride among the tree and i think he saw me for he paus but i did not speak for i wa heavi with thought and weari after my struggl with the eye of mordor and he did not speak either nor call my name perhap he also thought that you were saruman said gimli but you speak of him as if he wa a friend i thought fangorn wa danger danger cri gandalf and so am i veri danger more danger than anyth you will ever meet unless you are brought aliv befor the seat of the dark lord and aragorn is danger and legola is danger you are beset with danger gimli son of glóin for you are danger yourself in your own fashion certainli the forest of fangorn is perilousnot least to those that are too readi with their axe and fangorn himself he is peril too yet he is wise and kindli nonetheless but now hi long slow wrath is brim over and all the forest is fill with it the come of the hobbit and the tide that they brought have spill it it will soon be run like a flood but it tide is turn against saruman and the axe of isengard a thing is about to happen which ha not happen sinc the elder day the ent are go to wake up and find that they are strong what will they do ask legola in astonish i do not know said gandalf i do not think they know themselv i wonder he fell silent hi head bow in thought the other look at him a gleam of sun through fleet cloud fell on hi hand which lay now upturn on hi lap they seem to be fill with light as a cup is with water at last he look up and gaze straight at the sun the morn is wear away he said soon we must go do we go to find our friend and to see treebeard ask aragorn no said gandalf that is not the road that you must take i have spoken word of hope but onli of hope hope is not victori war is upon us and all our friend a war in which onli the use of the ring could give us sureti of victori it fill me with great sorrow and great fear for much shall be destroy and all may be lost i am gandalf gandalf the white but black is mightier still he rose and gaze out eastward shade hi eye as if he saw thing far away that none of them could see then he shook hi head no he said in a soft voic it ha gone beyond our reach of that at least let us be glad we can no longer be tempt to use the ring we must go down to face a peril near despair yet that deadli peril is remov he turn come aragorn son of arathorn he said do not regret your choic in the valley of the emyn muil nor call it a vain pursuit you chose amid doubt the path that seem right the choic wa just and it ha been reward for so we have met in time who otherwis might have met too late but the quest of your companion is over your next journey is mark by your given word you must go to edora and seek out théoden in hi hall for you are need the light of andúril must now be uncov in the battl for which it ha so long wait there is war in rohan and wors evil it goe ill with théoden then are we not to see the merri young hobbit again said legola i did not say so said gandalf who know have patienc go where you must go and hope to edora i go thither also it is a long way for a man to walk young or old said aragorn i fear the battl will be over long ere i come there we shall see we shall see said gandalf will you come now with me ye we will set out togeth said aragorn but i do not doubt that you will come there befor me if you wish he rose and look long at gandalf the other gaze at them in silenc as they stood there face one anoth the grey figur of the man aragorn son of arathorn wa tall and stern as stone hi hand upon the hilt of hi sword he look as if some king out of the mist of the sea had step upon the shore of lesser men befor him stoop the old figur white shine now as if with some light kindl within bent laden with year but hold a power beyond the strength of king do i not say truli gandalf said aragorn at

spear as she stood still alon befor the door of the silent hous chapter helm deep the sun wa alreadi wester as they rode from edora and the light of it wa in their eye turn all the roll field of rohan to a golden haze there wa a beaten way northwestward along the foothil of the white mountain and thi they follow up and down in a green countri cross small swift stream by mani ford far ahead and to their right the misti mountain loom ever darker and taller they grew as the mile went by the sun went slowli down befor them even came behind the host rode on need drove them fear to come too late they rode with all the speed they could paus seldom swift and endur were the steed of rohan but there were mani leagu to go forti leagu and more it wa as a bird fli from edora to the ford of the isen where they hope to find the king men that held back the host of saruman night close about them at last they halt to make their camp they had ridden for some five hour and were far out upon the western plain yet more than half their journey lay still befor them in a great circl under the starri sky and the wax moon they now made their bivouac they lit no fire for they were uncertain of event but they set a ring of mount guard about them and scout rode out far ahead pass like shadow in the fold of the land the slow night pass without tide or alarm at dawn the horn sound and within an hour they took the road again there were no cloud overhead yet but a heavi wa in the air it wa hot for the season of the year the rise sun wa hazi and behind it follow it slowli up the sky there wa a grow dark as of a great storm move out of the east and away in the northwest there seem to be anoth dark brood about the feet of the misti mountain a shadow that crept down slowli from the wizard vale gandalf

downward from the hill and behind us come a veri storm of mordor said gandalf it will be a black night as the second day of their ride drew on the heavi in the air increas in the afternoon the dark cloud began to overtak them a sombr canopi with great billow edg fleck with dazzl light the sun went down bloodr in a smoke haze the spear of the rider were tip with fire as the last shaft of light kindl the steep face of the peak of thrihyrn now veri near they stood on the northernmost arm of the white mountain three jag horn stare at the sunset in the last red glow men in the vanguard saw a black speck a horseman ride back toward them they halt await him he came a weari man with dint helm and cloven shield slowli he climb from hi hors and stood there a while gasp at length he spoke is éomer here he ask you come at last but too late and with too littl strength thing have gone evilli sinc théodr fell we were driven back yesterday over the isen with great loss mani perish at the cross

said ride to helm deep go not to the ford of isen and do not tarri in the plain i must leav you for a while shadowfax must bear me now on a swift errand turn to aragorn and éomer and the men of the king household he cri keep well the lord of the mark till i return await me at helm gate farewel he spoke a word to shadowfax and like an arrow from the bow the great hors sprang away even as they look he wa gone a flash of silver in the sunset a wind over the grass a shadow that fled and pass from sight snowman snort and rear eager to follow but onli a swift bird on the wing could have overtaken him what doe that mean said one of the guard to háma that gandalf greyham ha need of hast answer háma ever he goe and come unlookedfor wormtongu were he here would not find it hard to explain said the other true enough said háma but for myself i will wait until i see gandalf again mayb you will wait long said the other the host turn away now from the road to the ford of isen and bent their cours southward night fell and still they rode on the hill drew near but the tall peak of thrihyrn were alreadi dim against the darken sky still some mile away on the far side of the westfold vale lay a green coomb a great bay in the mountain out of which a gorg open in the hill men of that land call it helm deep after a hero of old war who had made hi refug there ever steeper and narrow it wound inward from the north under the shadow of the thrihyrn till the crowhaunt cliff rose like mighti tower on either side shut out the light at helm gate befor the mouth of the deep there wa a heel of rock thrust outward by the northern cliff there upon it spur stood high wall of ancient stone and within them wa a lofti tower men said that in the faroff day of the glori of gondor the seak had built here thi fast with the hand of giant the hornburg it wa call for a trumpet sound upon the tower echo in the deep behind as if armi longforgotten were issu to war from cave beneath the hill a wall too the men of old had made from the hornburg to the southern cliff bar the entranc to the gorg beneath it by a wide culvert the deepingstream pass out about the feet of the hornrock it wound and flow then in a gulli through the midst of a wide green gore slope gentli down from helm gate to helm dike thenc it fell into the deepingcoomb and out into the westfold vale there in the hornburg at helm gate erkenbrand master of westfold on the border of the mark now dwelt as the day darken with threat of war be wise he had repair the wall and made the fast strong the rider were still in the low valley befor the mouth of the coomb when cri and hornblast were heard from their scout that went in front out of the dark arrow whistl swiftli a scout rode back and report that wolfrid were abroad in the valley and that a host of orc and wild men were hurri southward from the ford of isen and seem to be make for helm deep we have found mani of our folk lie slain as they fled thither said the scout and we have met scatter compani go thi way and that leaderless what ha becom of erkenbrand none seem to know it is like that he will be overtaken ere he can reach helm gate if he ha not alreadi perish ha aught been seen of gandalf ask théoden ye lord mani have seen an old man in white upon a hors pass hither and thither over the plain like wind in the grass some thought he wa saruman it is said that he went away ere nightfal toward isengard some say also that wormtongu wa seen earlier go northward with a compani of orc it will go ill with wormtongu if gandalf come upon him said théoden nonetheless i miss now both my counsellor the old and the new but in thi need we have no better choic than to go on as gandalf said to helm gate whether erkenbrand be there or no is it known how great is the host that come from the north it is veri great said the scout he that fli count everi foeman twice yet i have spoken to stoutheart men and i do not doubt that the main strength of the enemi is mani time as great as all that we have here then let us be swift said éomer let us drive through such foe as are alreadi between us and the fast there are cave in helm deep where hundr may lie hid and secret way lead thenc up on to the hill trust not to secret way said the king saruman ha long spi out thi land still in that place our defenc may last long let us go aragorn and legola went now with éomer in the van on through the dark night they rode ever slower as the dark deepen and their way climb southward higher and higher into the dim fold about the mountain feet they found few of the enemi befor them here and there they came upon rove band of orc but they fled ere the rider could take or slay them it will not be long i fear said éomer ere the come of the king host will be known to the leader of our enemi saruman or whatev captain he ha sent forth the rumour of war grew behind them now they could hear born over the dark the sound of harsh sing they had climb far up into the deepingcoomb when they look back then they saw torch countless point of fieri light upon the black field behind scatter like red flower or wind up from the lowland in long flicker line here and there a larger blaze leapt up it is a great host and follow us hard said aragorn they bring fire said théoden and they are burn as they come rick cot and tree thi wa a rich vale and had mani homestead ala for my folk would that day wa here and we might ride down upon them like a storm out of the mountain said aragorn it griev me to fli befor them we need not fli much further said éomer not far ahead now lie helm dike an ancient trench and rampart score across the coomb two furlong below helm gate there we can turn and give battl nay we are too few to defend the dike said théoden it is a mile long or more and the breach in it is wide at the breach our rearguard must stand if we are press said éomer there wa neither star nor moon when the rider came to the breach in the dike where the stream from abov pass out and the road besid it ran down from the hornburg the rampart loom suddenli befor them a high shadow beyond a dark pit as they rode up a sentinel challeng them the lord of the mark ride to helm gate éomer answer i éomer son of éomund speak thi is good tide beyond hope said the sentinel hasten the enemi is on your heel the host pass through the breach and halt on the slope sward abov they now learn to their joy that erkenbrand had left mani men to hold helm gate and more had sinc escap thither mayb we have a thousand fit to fight on foot said gaml an old man the leader of those that watch the dike but most of them have seen too mani winter as i have or too few as my son son here what news of erkenbrand word came yesterday that he wa retreat hither with all that is left of the best rider of westfold but he ha not come i fear that he will not come now said éomer our scout have gain no news of him and the enemi fill all the valley behind us i would that he had escap said théoden he wa a mighti man in him live again the valour of helm the hammerhand but we can not await him here we must draw all our forc now behind the wall are you well store we bring littl provis for we rode forth to open battl not to a sieg behind us in the cave of the deep are three part of the folk of westfold old and young children and women said gaml but great store of food and mani beast and their fodder have also been gather there that is well said éomer they are burn or despoil all that is left in the vale if they come to bargain for our good at helm gate they will pay a high price said gaml the king and hi rider pass on befor the causeway that cross the stream they dismount in a long file they led their hors up the ramp and pass within the gate of the hornburg there they were welcom again with joy and renew hope for now there were men enough to man both the burg and the barrier wall quickli éomer set hi men in readi the king and the men of hi household were in the hornburg and there also were mani of the westfoldmen but on the deep wall and it tower and behind it éomer array most of the strength that he had for here the defenc seem more doubt if the assault were determin and in great forc the hors were led far up the deep under such guard as could be spare the deep wall wa twenti feet high and so thick that four men could walk abreast along the top shelter by a parapet over which onli a tall man could look here and there were cleft in the stone through which men could shoot thi battlement could be reach by a stair run down from a door in the outer court of the hornburg three flight of step led also up on to the wall from the deep behind but in front it wa smooth and the great stone of it were set with such skill that no foothold could be found at their joint and at the top they hung over like a seadelv cliff gimli stood lean against the breastwork upon the wall legola sat abov on the parapet finger hi bow and peer out into the gloom thi is more to my like said the dwarf stamp on the stone ever my heart rise as we draw near the mountain there is good rock here thi countri ha tough bone i felt them in my

room to swing and all weari will fall from me a slow time pass far down in the valley scatter fire still burn the host of isengard were advanc in silenc now their torch could be seen wind up the coomb in mani line suddenli from the dike yell and scream and the fierc battlecri of men broke out flame brand appear over the brink and cluster thickli at the breach then they scatter and vanish men came gallop back over the field and up the ramp to the gate of the hornburg the rearguard of the westfold had been driven in the enemi is at hand they said we loos everi arrow that we had and fill the dike with orc but it will not halt them long alreadi they are scale the bank at mani point thick as march ant but we have taught them not to carri torch it wa now past midnight the sky wa utterli dark and the still of the heavi air forebod storm suddenli the cloud were sear by a blind flash branch lightn smote down upon the eastward hill for a stare moment the watcher on the wall saw all the space between them and the dike lit with white light it wa boil and crawl with black shape some squat and broad some tall and grim with high helm and sabl shield hundr and hundr more were pour over the dike and through the breach the dark tide flow up to the wall from cliff to cliff thunder roll in the valley rain came lash down arrow thick as the rain came whistl over the battlement and fell clink and glanc on the stone some found a mark the assault on helm deep had begun but no sound or challeng wa heard within no answer arrow came the assail host halt foil by the silent menac of rock and wall ever and again the lightn tore asid the dark then the orc scream wave spear and sword and shoot a cloud of arrow at ani that stood reveal upon the battlement and the men of the mark amaz look out as it seem to them upon a great field of dark corn toss by a tempest of war and everi ear glint with barb light brazen trumpet sound the enemi surg forward some against the deep wall other toward the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hornburgg there the hugest orc were muster and the wild men of the dunland fell a moment they hesit and then on they came the lightn flash and blazon upon everi helm and shield the ghastli hand of isengard wa seen they reach the summit of the rock they drove toward the gate then at last an answer came a storm of arrow met them and a hail of stone they waver broke and fled back and then charg again broke and charg again and each time like the incom sea they halt at a higher point again trumpet rang and a press of roar men leap forth they held their great shield abov them like a roof while in their midst they bore two trunk of mighti tree behind them orcarch crowd send a hail of dart against the bowmen on the wall they gain the gate the tree swung by strong arm smote the timber with a rend boom if ani man fell crush by a stone hurtl from abov two other sprang to take hi place again and again the great ram swung and crash éomer and aragorn stood togeth on the deep wall they heard the roar of voic and the thud of the ram and then in a sudden flash of light they beheld the peril of the gate come said aragorn thi is the hour when we draw sword togeth run like fire they sped along the wall and up the step and pass into the outer court upon the rock as they ran they gather a hand of stout swordsmen there wa a small posterndoor that open in an angl of the burgwal on the west where the cliff stretch out to meet it on that side a narrow path ran round toward the great gate between the wall and the sheer brink of the rock togeth éomer and aragorn sprang through the door their men close behind the sword flash from the sheath as one gúthwinë cri éomer gúthwinë for the mark andúril cri aragorn andúril for the dúnedain charg from the side they hurl themselv upon the wild men andúril rose and fell gleam with white fire a shout went up from wall and tower andúril andúril goe to war the blade that wa broken shine again dismay the rammer let fall the tree and turn to fight but the wall of their shield wa broken as by a lightningstrok and they were swept away hewn down or cast over the rock into the stoni stream below the orcarch shot wildli and then fled for a moment éomer and aragorn halt befor the gate the thunder wa rumbl in the distanc now the lightn flicker still far off among the mountain in the south a keen wind wa blow from the north again the cloud were torn and drift and star peep out and abov the hill of the coombsid the wester moon rode glimmer yellow in the stormwrack we did not come too soon said aragorn look at the gate their great hing and iron bar were wrench and bent mani of their timber were crack yet we can not stay here beyond the wall to defend them said éomer look he point to the causeway alreadi a great press of orc and men were gather again beyond the stream arrow whine and skip on the stone about them come we must get back and see what we can do to pile stone and beam across the gate within come now they turn and ran at that moment some dozen orc that had lain motionless among the slain leap to their feet and came silent and swiftli behind two flung themselv to the ground at éomer heel trip him and in a moment they were on top of him but a small dark figur that none had observ sprang out of the shadow and gave a hoars shout baruk khazâd khazâd aimênu an axe swung and swept back two orc fell headless the rest fled éomer struggl to hi feet even as aragorn ran back to hi aid the postern wa close again the iron door wa bar and pile insid with stone when all

have done better though now i must grope for spent arrow all mine are gone yet i make my tale twenti at the least but that is onli a few leav in a forest the sky now wa quickli clear and the sink moon wa shine brightli but the light brought littl hope to the rider of the mark the enemi befor them seem to have grown rather than diminish still more were press up from the valley through the breach the sorti upon the rock gain onli a brief respit the assault on the gate wa redoubl against the deep wall the host of isengard roar like a sea orc and hillmen swarm about it feet from end to end rope with grappl hook were hurl over the parapet faster than men could cut them or fling them back hundr of long ladder were lift up mani were cast down in ruin but mani more replac them and orc sprang up them like ape in the dark forest of the south befor the wall foot the dead and broken were pile like shingl in a storm ever higher rose the hideou mound and still the enemi came on the men of rohan grew weari all their arrow were spent and everi shaft wa shot their sword were notch and their shield were riven three time aragorn and éomer ralli them and three time andúril flame in a desper charg that drove the enemi from the wall then a clamour aros in the deep behind orc had crept like rat through the culvert through which the stream flow out there they had gather in the shadow of the cliff until the assault abov wa hottest and nearli all the men of the defenc had rush to the wall top then they sprang out alreadi some had pass into the jaw of the deep and were among the hors fight with the

gimli good said legola but my count is now two dozen it ha been knifework up here éomer and aragorn leant wearili on their sword away on the left the crash and clamour of the battl on the rock rose loud again but the hornburg still held fast like an island in the sea it gate lay in ruin but over the barricad of beam and stone within no enemi as yet had pass aragorn look at the pale star and at the moon now slope behind the western hill that enclos the valley thi is a night as long as year he said how long will the day tarri dawn is not far off said gaml who had now climb up besid him but dawn will not help us i fear yet dawn is ever the hope of men said aragorn but these creatur of isengard these halforc and goblinmen that the foul craft of saruman ha bred they will not quail at the sun said gaml and neither will the wild men of the hill do you not hear their voic i hear them said éomer but they are onli the scream of bird and the bellow of beast to my ear yet there are mani that

to them the king the king they cri we will take their king death to the forgoil death to the strawhead death to the robber of the north such name they have for us not in half a thousand year have they forgotten their grievanc that the lord of gondor gave the mark to eorl the young and made allianc with him that old hatr saruman ha inflam they are fierc folk when rous they will not give way now for dusk or dawn until théoden is taken or they themselv are slain nonetheless day will bring hope to me said aragorn is it not said that no foe ha ever taken the hornburg if men defend it so the minstrel say said éomer then let us defend it and hope said aragorn even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpet then there wa a crash and a flash of flame and smoke the water of the deepingstream pour out hiss and foam they were choke no longer a gape hole wa blast in the wall a host of dark shape pour in devilri of saruman cri aragorn they have crept in the culvert again while we talk and they have lit the fire of orthanc beneath our feet elendil elendil he shout as he leap down into the breach but even as he did so a hundr ladder were rais against the battlement over the wall and under the wall the last assault came sweep like a dark wave upon a hill of sand the defenc wa swept away some of the rider were driven back further and further into the deep fall and fight as they gave way step by step toward the cave other cut their way back toward the citadel a broad stairway climb from the deep up to the rock and the reargat of the hornburg near the bottom stood aragorn in hi hand still andúril gleam and the terror of the sword for a while held back the enemi as one by one all who could gain the stair pass up toward the gate behind on the upper step knelt legola hi bow wa bent but one glean arrow wa all that he had left and he peer out now readi to shoot the first orc that should dare to approach the stair all who can have now got safe within aragorn he call come back aragorn turn and sped up the stair but as he ran he stumbl in hi weari at onc hi enemi leapt forward up came the orc yell with their long arm stretch out to seiz him the foremost fell with legola last arrow in hi throat but the rest sprang over him then a great boulder cast from the outer wall abov crash down upon the stair and hurl them back into the deep aragorn gain the door and swiftli it clang to behind him thing go ill my friend he said wipe the sweat from hi brow with hi arm ill enough said legola but not yet hopeless while we have you with us where is gimli i do not know said aragorn i last saw him fight on the ground behind the wall but the enemi swept us apart ala that is evil news said legola he is stout and strong said aragorn let us hope that he will escap back to the cave there he would be safe for a while safer than we such a refug would be to the like of a dwarf that must be my hope said legola but i wish that he had come thi way i desir to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirtynin if he win back to the cave he will pass your count again laugh aragorn never did i see an axe so wield i must go and seek some arrow said legola would that thi night would end and i could have better light for shoot aragorn now pass into the citadel there to hi dismay he learn that éomer had not reach the hornburg nay he did not come to the rock said one of the westfoldmen i last saw him gather men about him and fight in the mouth of the deep gaml wa with him and the dwarf but i could not come to them aragorn strode on through the inner court and mount to a high chamber in the tower there stood the king dark against a narrow window look out upon the vale what is the news aragorn he said the deep wall is taken lord and all the defenc swept away but mani have escap hither to the rock is éomer here no lord but mani of your men retreat into the deep and some say that éomer wa amongst them in the narrow they may hold back the enemi and come within the cave what hope they may have then i do not know more than we good provis it is said and the air is wholesom there becaus of the outlet through fissur in the rock far abov none can forc an entranc against determin men they may hold out long but the orc have brought a devilri from orthanc said aragorn they have a blast fire and with it they took the wall if they can not come in the cave they may seal up those that are insid but now we must turn all our thought to our own defenc i fret in thi prison said théoden if i could have set a spear in rest ride befor my men upon the field mayb i could have felt again the joy of battl and so end but i serv littl purpos here here at least you are guard in the strongest fast of the mark said aragorn more hope we have to defend you in the hornburg than in edora or even at dunharrow in the mountain it is said that the hornburg ha never fallen to assault said théoden but now my heart is doubt the world chang and all that onc wa strong now prove unsur how shall ani tower withstand such number and such reckless hate had i known that the strength of isengard wa grown so great mayb i should not so rashli have ridden forth to meet it for all the art of gandalf hi counsel seem not now so good as it did under the morn sun do not judg the counsel of gandalf until all is over lord said aragorn the end will not be long said the king but i will not end here taken like an

you do not know your peril so great a power and royalti wa reveal in aragorn as he stood there alon abov the ruin gate befor the host of hi enemi that mani of the wild men paus and look back over their shoulder to the valley and some look up doubt at the sky but the orc laugh with loud voic and a hail of dart and arrow whistl over the wall as aragorn leap down there wa a roar and a blast of fire the archway of the gate abov which he had stood a moment befor crumbl and crash in smoke and dust the barricad wa scatter as if by a thunderbolt aragorn ran to the king tower but even as the gate fell and the orc about it yell prepar to charg a murmur aros behind them like a wind in the distanc and it grew to a clamour of mani voic cri strang news in the dawn the orc upon the rock hear the rumour of dismay waver and look back and then sudden and terribl from the tower abov the sound of the great horn of helm rang out all that heard that sound trembl mani of the orc cast themselv on their face and cover their ear with their claw back from the deep the echo came blast upon blast as if on everi cliff and hill a mighti herald stood but on the wall men look up listen with wonder for the echo did not die ever the hornblast wound on among the hill nearer now and louder they answer one to anoth blow fierc and free helm helm the rider shout helm is arisen and come back to war helm for théoden king and with that shout the king came hi hors wa white as snow golden wa hi shield and hi spear wa long at hi right hand wa aragorn elendil heir behind him rode the lord of the hous of

isengard as a wind among grass behind them from the deep came the stern cri of men issu from the cave drive forth the enemi out pour all the men that were left upon the rock and ever the sound of blow horn echo in the hill on they rode the king and hi companion captain and champion fell or fled befor them neither orc nor man withstood them their back were to the sword and spear of the rider and their face to the valley they cri and wail for fear and great wonder had come upon them with the rise of the day so king théoden rode from helm gate and clove hi path to the great dike there the compani halt light grew bright about them shaft of the sun flare abov the eastern hill and glimmer on their spear but they sat silent on their hors and they gaze down upon the deepingcoomb the land had chang where befor the green dale had lain it grassi slope lap the evermount hill there now a forest loom great tree bare and silent stood rank on rank with tangl bough and hoari head their twist root were buri in the long green grass dark wa under them between the dike and the eav of that nameless wood onli two open furlong lay there now cower the proud host of saruman in terror of the king and in terror of the tree they stream down from helm gate until all abov the dike wa empti of them but below it they were pack like swarm fli vainli they crawl and clamber about the wall of the coomb seek to escap upon the east too sheer and stoni wa the valley side upon the left from the west their final doom approach there suddenli upon a ridg appear a rider clad in white shine in the rise sun over the low hill the horn were sound behind him hasten down the long slope were a thousand men on foot their sword were in their hand amid them strode a man tall and strong hi shield wa red as he came to the valley brink he set to hi lip a great black horn and blew a ring blast erkenbrand the rider shout erkenbrand behold the white rider cri aragorn gandalf is come again mithrandir mithrandir said legola thi is wizardri inde come i would look on thi forest ere the spell chang the host of isengard roar sway thi way and that turn from fear to fear again the horn sound from the tower down through the breach of the dike charg the king compani down from the hill leap erkenbrand lord of westfold down leap shadowfax like a deer that run surefoot in the mountain the white rider wa upon them and the terror of hi come fill the enemi with mad the wild men fell on their face befor him the orc reel and scream and cast asid both sword and spear like a black smoke driven by a mount wind they fled wail they pass under the wait shadow of the tree and from that shadow none ever came again chapter the road to isengard so it wa that in the light of a fair morn king théoden and gandalf the white rider met again upon the green grass besid the deepingstream there wa also aragorn son of arathorn and legola the elf and erkenbrand of westfold and the lord of the golden hous about them were gather the rohirrim the rider of the mark wonder overcam their joy in victori and their eye were turn toward the wood suddenli there wa a great shout and down from the dike came those who had been driven back into the deep there came gaml the old and éomer son of éomund and besid them walk gimli the dwarf he had no helm and about hi head wa a linen band stain with blood but hi voic wa loud and strong fortytwo master legola he cri ala my axe is notch the fortysecond had an iron collar on hi neck how is it with you you have pass my score by one answer legola but i do not grudg you the game so glad am i to see you on your leg welcom éomer sisterson said théoden now that i see you safe i am glad inde hail lord of the mark said éomer the dark night ha pass and day ha come again but the day ha brought strang tide he turn and gaze in wonder first at the wood and then at gandalf onc more you come in the hour of need unlookedfor he said unlookedfor said gandalf i said that i would return and meet you here but you did not name the hour nor foretel the manner of your come strang help you bring you are mighti in wizardri gandalf the white that may be but if so i have not shown it yet i have but given good counsel in peril and made use of the speed of shadowfax your own valour ha done more and the stout leg of the westfoldmen march through the night then they all gaze at gandalf with still greater wonder some glanc darkli at the wood and pass their hand over their brow as if they thought their eye saw otherwis than hi gandalf laugh long and merrili the tree he said nay i see the wood as plainli as do you but that is no deed of mine it is a thing beyond the counsel of the wise better than my design and better even than my hope the event ha prove then if not your whose is the wizardri said théoden not saruman that is plain is there some mightier sage of whom we have yet to learn it is not wizardri but a power far older said gandalf a power that walk the earth ere elf sang or hammer rang ere iron wa found or tree wa hewn when young wa mountain under moon ere ring wa made or wrought wa woe it walk the forest long ago and what may be the answer to your riddl said théoden if you would learn that you should come with me to isengard answer gandalf to isengard they cri ye said gandalf i shall return to isengard and those who will may come with me there we may see strang thing but there are not men enough in the mark not if they were all gather togeth and heal of wound and weari to assault the stronghold of saruman said théoden nevertheless to isengard i go said gandalf i shall not stay there long my way lie now eastward look for me in edora ere the wane of the moon nay said théoden in the dark hour befor dawn i doubt but we will not part now i will come with you if that is your counsel i wish to speak with saruman as soon as may be now said gandalf and sinc he ha done you great injuri it would be fit if you were there but how soon and how swiftli will you ride my men are weari with battl said the king and i am weari also for i have ridden far and slept littl ala my old age is not feign nor due onli to the whisper of wormtongu it is an ill that no leech can wholli cure not even gandalf then let all who are to ride with me rest now said gandalf we will journey under the shadow of even it is as well for it is my counsel that all our come and go should be as secret as may be henceforth but do not command mani men to go with you théoden we go to a parley not to a fight the king then chose men that were unhurt and had swift hors and he sent them forth with tide of the victori into everi vale of the mark and they bore hi summon also bid all men young and old to come in hast to edora there the lord of the mark would hold an assembl of all that could bear arm on the second day after the full moon to ride with him to isengard the king chose éomer and twenti men of hi household with gandalf would go aragorn and legola and gimli in spite of hi hurt the dwarf would not stay behind it wa onli a feebl blow and the cap turn it he said it would take more than such an orcscratch to keep me back i will tend it while you rest said aragorn the king now return to the hornburg and slept such a sleep of quiet as he had not known for mani year and the remaind of hi chosen compani rest also but the other all that were not hurt or wound began a great labour for mani had fallen in the battl and lay dead upon the field or in the deep no orc remain aliv their bodi were uncount but a great mani of the hillmen had given themselv up and they were afraid and cri for merci the men of the mark took their weapon from them and set them to work help now to repair the evil in which you have join said erkenbrand and afterward you shall take an oath never again to pass the ford of isen in arm nor to march with the enemi of men and then you shall go free back to your land for you have been delud by saruman mani of you have got death as the reward of your trust in him but had you conquer littl better would your wage have been the men of dunland were amaz for saruman had told them that the men of rohan were cruel and burn their captiv aliv in the midst of the field befor the hornburg two mound were rais and beneath them were laid all the rider of the mark who fell in the defenc those of the east dale upon one side and those of westfold upon the other in a grave alon under the shadow of the hornburg lay háma captain of the king guard he fell befor the gate the orc were pile in great heap away from the mound of men not far from the eav of the forest and the peopl were troubl in their mind for the heap of carrion were too great for burial or for burn they had littl wood for fire and none would have dare to take an axe to the strang tree even if gandalf had not warn them to hurt neither bark nor bough at their great peril let the orc lie said gandalf the morn may bring new counsel in the afternoon the king compani prepar to depart the work of burial wa then but begin and théoden mourn for the loss of háma hi captain and cast the first earth upon hi grave great injuri inde ha saruman done to me and all thi land he said and i will rememb it when we meet the sun wa alreadi draw near the hill upon the west of the coomb when at last théoden and gandalf and their companion rode down from the dike behind them were gather a great host both of the rider and of the peopl of westfold old and young women and children who had come out from the cave a song of victori they sang with clear voic and then they fell silent wonder what would chanc for their eye were on the tree and they fear them the rider came to the wood and they halt hors and man they were unwil to pass in the tree were grey and menac and a shadow or a mist wa about them the end of their long sweep bough hung down like search finger their root stood up from the ground like the limb of strang monster and dark cavern open beneath them but gandalf went forward lead the compani and where the road from the hornburg met the tree they saw now an open like an arch gate under mighti bough and through it gandalf pass and they follow him then to their amaz they found that the road ran on and the deepingstream besid it and the sky wa open abov and full of golden light but on either side the great aisl of the wood were alreadi wrap in dusk stretch away into impenetr shadow and there they heard the creak and groan of bough and far cri and a rumour of wordless voic murmur angrili no orc or other live creatur could be seen legola and gimli were now ride togeth upon one hors and they kept close besid gandalf for gimli wa afraid of the wood it is hot in here said legola to gandalf i feel a great wrath about me do you not feel the air throb in your ear ye said gandalf what ha becom of the miser orc said legola that i think no one will ever know said gandalf they rode in silenc for a while but legola wa ever glanc from side to side and would often have halt to listen to the sound of the wood if gimli had allow it these are the strangest tree that ever i saw he said and i have seen mani an oak grow from acorn to ruinou age i wish that there were leisur now to walk among them they have voic and in time i might come to understand their thought no no said gimli let us leav them i guess their thought alreadi hatr of all that go on two leg and

come to the end of the tree how far is it to isengard gandalf about fifteen leagu as the crow of saruman make it said gandalf five from the mouth of deepingcoomb to the ford and ten more from there to the gate of isengard but we shall not ride all the way thi night and when we come there what shall we see ask gimli you may know but i can not guess i do not know myself for certain answer the wizard i wa there at nightfal yesterday but much may have happen sinc yet i think that you will not say that the journey wa in vain – not though the glitter cave of aglarond be left behind at last the compani pass through the tree and found that they had come to the bottom of the coomb where the road from helm deep branch go one way east to edora and the other north to the ford of isen as they rode from under the eav of the wood legola halt and look back with regret then he gave a sudden cri there are eye he said eye look out from the shadow of the bough i never saw such eye befor the other surpris by hi cri halt and turn but legola start to ride back no no cri gimli do as you pleas in your mad but let me first get down from thi hors i wish to see no eye stay legola greenleaf said gandalf do not go back into the wood not yet now is not your time even as he spoke there came forward out of the tree three strang shape as tall as troll they were twelv feet or more in height their strong bodi stout as young tree seem to be clad with raiment or with hide of closefit grey and brown their limb were long and their hand had mani finger their hair wa stiff and their beard greygreen as moss they gaze out with solemn eye but they were not look at the rider their eye were bent northward suddenli they lift their long hand to their mouth and sent forth ring call clear as note of a horn but more music and variou the call were answer and turn again the rider saw other creatur of the same kind approach stride through the grass they came swiftli from the north walk like wade heron in their gait but not in their speed for their leg in their long pace beat quicker than the heron wing the rider cri aloud in wonder and some set their hand upon their swordhilt you need no weapon said gandalf these are but herdsmen they are not enemi inde they are not concern with us at all so it seem to be for as he spoke the tall creatur without a glanc at the rider strode into the wood and vanish herdsmen said théoden where are their flock what are they gandalf for it is plain that to you at ani rate they are not strang they are the shepherd of the tree answer gandalf is it so long sinc you listen to tale by the firesid there are children in your land who out of the twist thread of stori could pick the answer to your question you have seen ent o king ent out of fangorn forest which in your tongu you call the entwood did you think that the name wa given onli in idl fanci nay théoden it is otherwis to them you are but the pass tale all the year from eorl the young to théoden the old are of littl count to them and all the deed of your hous but a small matter the king wa silent ent he said at length out of the shadow of legend i begin a littl to understand the marvel of the tree i think i have live to see strang day long we have tend our beast and our field built our hous wrought our tool or ridden away to help in the war of mina tirith and that we call the life of men the way of the world we care littl for what lay beyond the border of our land song we have that tell of these thing but we are forget them teach them onli to children as a careless custom and now the song have come down among us out of strang place and walk visibl under the sun you should be glad théoden king said gandalf for not onli the littl life of men is now endang but the life also of those thing which you have deem the matter of legend you are not without alli even if you know them not yet also i should be sad said théoden for howev the fortun of war shall go may it not so end that much that wa fair and wonder shall pass for ever out of middleearth it may said gandalf the evil of sauron can not be wholli cure nor made as if it had not been but to such day we are doom let us now go on with the journey we have begun the compani turn then away from the coomb and from the wood and took the road toward the ford legola follow reluctantli the sun had set alreadi it had sunk behind the rim of the world but as they rode out from the shadow of the hill and look west to the gap of rohan the sky wa still red and a burn light wa under the float cloud dark against it there wheel and flew mani blackwing bird some pass overhead with mourn cri return to their home among the rock the carrionfowl have been busi about the battlefield said éomer they rode now at an easi pace and dark came down upon the plain about them the slow moon mount now wax toward the full and in it cold silver light the swell grassland rose and fell like a wide grey sea they had ridden for some four hour from the branch of the road when they drew near to the ford long slope ran swiftli down to where the river spread in stoni shoal between high grassi terrac born upon the wind they heard the howl of wolv their heart were heavi rememb the mani men that had fallen in battl in thi place the road dip between rise turfbank carv it way through the terrac to the river edg and up again upon the further side there were three line of flat steppingston across the stream and between them ford for hors that went from either brink to a bare eyot in the midst the rider look down upon the cross and it seem strang to them for the ford had ever been a place full of the rush and chatter of water upon stone but now they were silent the bed of the stream were almost dri a bare wast of shingl and grey sand thi is becom a dreari place said éomer what sick ha befallen the river mani fair thing saruman ha destroy ha he devour the spring of isen too so it would seem said gandalf ala said théoden must we pass thi way where the carrionbeast devour so mani good rider of the mark thi is our way said gandalf grievou is the fall of your men but you shall see that at least the wolv of the mountain do not devour them it is with their friend the orc that they hold their feast such inde is the friendship of their kind come they rode down to the river and as they came the wolv ceas their howl and slunk away fear fell on them see gandalf in the moon and shadowfax hi hors shine like silver the rider pass over to the islet and glitter eye watch them wanli from the shadow of the bank look said gandalf friend have labour here and they saw that in the midst of the eyot a mound wa pile ring with stone and set about with mani spear here lie all the men of the mark that fell near thi place said gandalf here let them rest said éomer and when their spear have rot and rust long still may their mound stand and guard the ford of isen is thi your work also gandalf my friend said théoden you accomplish much in an even and a night with the help of shadowfax – and other said gandalf i rode fast and far but here besid the mound i will say thi for your comfort mani fell in the battl of the ford but fewer than rumour made them more were scatter than were slain i gather togeth all that i could find some men i sent with grimbold of westfold to join erkenbrand some i set to make thi burial they have now follow your marshal elfhelm i sent him with mani rider to edora saruman i knew had despatch hi full strength against you and hi servant had turn asid from all other errand and gone to helm deep the land seem empti of enemi yet i fear that wolfrid and plunder might ride nonetheless to meduseld while it wa undefend but now i think you need not fear you will find your hous to welcom your return and glad shall i be to see it again said théoden though brief now i doubt not shall be my abid there with that the compani said farewel to the island and the mound and pass over the river and climb the further bank then they rode on glad to have left the mourn ford as they went the howl of the wolv broke out anew there wa an ancient highway that ran down from isengard to the cross for some way it took it cours besid the river bend with it east and then north but at the last it turn away and went straight toward the gate of isengard and these were under the mountainsid in the west of the valley sixteen mile or more from it mouth thi road they follow but they did not ride upon it for the ground besid it wa firm and level cover for mani mile about with short spring turf they rode now more swiftli and by midnight the ford were nearli five leagu behind then they halt end their night journey for the king wa weari they were come to the feet of the misti mountain and the long arm of nan curunír stretch down to meet them dark lay the vale befor them for the moon had pass into the west and it light wa hidden by the hill but out of the deep shadow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour as it mount it caught the ray of the sink moon and spread in shimmer billow black and silver over the starri sky what do you think of that gandalf ask aragorn one would say that all the wizard vale wa burn there is ever a fume abov that valley in these day said éomer but i have never seen aught like thi befor these are steam rather than smoke saruman is brew some devilri to greet us mayb he is boil all the water of isen and that is whi the river run dri mayb he is said gandalf tomorrow we shall learn what he is do now let us rest for a while if we can they camp besid the bed of the isen river it wa still silent and empti some of them slept a littl but late in the night the watchmen cri out and all awok the moon wa gone star were shine abov but over the ground there crept a dark blacker than the night on both side of the river it roll toward them go northward stay where you are said gandalf draw no weapon wait and it will pass you by a mist gather about them abov them a few star still glimmer faintli but on either side there aros wall of impenetr gloom they were in a narrow lane between move tower of shadow voic they heard whisper and groan and an endless rustl sigh the earth shook under them long it seem to them that they sat and were afraid but at last the dark and the rumour pass and vanish between the mountain arm away south upon the hornburg in the middl night men heard a great nois as a wind in the valley and the ground trembl and all were afraid and no one ventur to go forth but in the morn they went out and were amaz for the slain orc were gone and the tree also far down into the valley of the deep the grass wa crush and trampl brown as if giant herdsmen had pastur great drove of cattl there but a mile below the dike a huge pit had been delv in the earth and over it stone were pile into a hill men believ that the orc whom they had slain were buri there but whether those who had fled into the wood were with them none could say for no man ever set foot upon that hill the death down it wa afterward call and no grass would grow there but the strang tree were never seen in deepingcoomb again they had return at night and had gone far away to the dark dale of fangorn thu they were reveng upon the orc the king and hi compani slept no more that night but they saw and heard no other strang thing save one the voic of the river besid them suddenli awok there wa a rush of water hurri down among the stone and when it had pass the isen flow and bubbl in it bed again as it had ever done at dawn they made readi to go on the light came grey and pale and they did not see the rise of the sun the air abov wa heavi with fog and a reek lay on the land about them they went slowli ride now upon the highway it wa broad and hard and welltend dimli through the mist they could descri the long arm of the mountain rise on their left they had pass into nan curunír the wizard vale that wa a shelter valley open onli to the south onc it had been fair and green and through it the isen flow alreadi deep and strong befor it found the plain for it wa fed by mani spring and lesser stream among the rainwash hill and all about it there had lain a pleasant fertil land it wa not so now beneath the wall of isengard there still were acr till by the slave of saruman but most of the valley had becom a wilder of weed and thorn brambl trail upon the ground or clamber over bush and bank made shaggi cave where small beast hous no tree grew there but among the rank grass could still be seen the burn and axehewn stump of ancient grove it wa a sad countri silent now but for the stoni nois of quick water smoke and steam drift in sullen cloud and lurk in the hollow the rider did not speak mani doubt in their heart wonder to what dismal end their journey led after they had ridden for some mile the highway becam a wide street pave with great flat stone squar and laid with skill no blade of grass wa seen in ani joint deep gutter fill with trickl water ran down on either side suddenli a tall pillar loom up befor them it wa black and set upon it wa a great stone carv and paint in the like of a long white hand it finger point north not far now they knew that the gate of isengard must stand and their heart were heavi but their eye could not pierc the mist ahead beneath the mountain arm within the wizard vale through year uncount had stood that ancient place that men call isengard partli it wa shape in the make of the mountain but mighti work the men of westerness had wrought there of old and saruman had dwelt there long and had not been idl thi wa it fashion while saruman wa at hi height account by mani the chief of wizard a great ringwal of stone like tower cliff stood out from the shelter of the mountainsid from which it ran and then return again one entranc onli wa there made in it a great arch delv in the southern wall here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn close at either end with mighti door of iron they were so wrought and pois upon their huge hing post of steel driven into the live stone that when unbar they could be move with a light thrust of the arm noiselessli one who pass in and came at length out of the echo tunnel beheld a plain a great circl somewhat hollow like a vast shallow bowl a mile it measur from rim to rim onc it had been green and fill with avenu and grove of fruit tree water by stream that flow from the mountain to a lake but no green thing grew there in the latter day of saruman the road were pave with stoneflag dark and hard and besid their border instead of tree there march long line of pillar some of marbl some of copper and of iron join by heavi chain mani hous there were chamber hall and passag cut and tunnel back into the wall upon their inner side so that all the open circl wa overlook by countless window and dark door thousand could dwell there worker servant slave and warrior with great store of arm wolv were fed and stabl in deep den beneath the plain too wa bore and delv shaft were driven deep into the ground their upper end were cover by low mound and dome of stone so that in the moonlight the ring of isengard look like a graveyard of unquiet dead for the ground trembl the shaft ran down by mani slope and spiral stair to cavern far under there saruman had treasuri storehous armouri smithi and great furnac iron wheel revolv there endlessli and hammer thud at night plume of vapour steam from the vent lit from beneath with red light or blue or venom green to the centr all the road ran between their chain there stood a tower of marvel shape it wa fashion by the builder of old who smooth the ring of isengard and yet it seem a thing not made by the craft of men but riven from the bone of the earth in the ancient torment of the hill a peak and isl of rock it wa black and gleam hard four mighti pier of manysid stone were weld into one but near the summit they open into gape horn their pinnacl sharp as the point of spear keenedg as knive between them wa a narrow space and there upon a floor of polish stone written with strang sign a man might stand five hundr feet abov the plain thi wa orthanc the citadel of saruman the name of which had by design or chanc a twofold mean for in the elvish speech orthanc signifi mount fang but in the languag of the mark of old the cun mind a strong place and wonder wa isengard and long it had been beauti and there great lord had dwelt the warden of gondor upon the west and wise men that watch the star but saruman had slowli shape it to hi shift purpos and made it better as he thought be deceivedfor all those art and subtl devic for which he forsook hi former wisdom and which fondli he imagin were hi own came but from mordor so that what he made wa naught onli a littl copi a child model or a slave flatteri of that vast fortress armouri prison furnac of great power baraddûr the dark tower which suffer no rival and laugh at flatteri bide it time secur in it pride and it immeasur strength thi wa the stronghold of saruman as fame report it for within live memori the men of rohan had not pass it gate save perhap a few such as wormtongu who came in secret and told no man what they saw now gandalf rode to the great pillar of the hand and pass it and as he did so the rider saw to their wonder that the hand appear no longer white it wa stain as with dri blood and look closer they perceiv that it nail were red unheed gandalf rode on into the mist and reluctantli they follow him all about them now as if there had been a sudden flood wide pool of water lay besid the road fill the hollow and rill went trickl down among the stone at last gandalf halt and beckon to them and they came and saw that beyond him the mist had clear and a pale sunlight shone the hour of noon had pass they were come to the door of isengard but the door lay hurl and twist on the ground and all about stone crack and splinter into countless jag shard wa scatter far and wide or pile in ruinou heap the great arch still stood but it open now upon a roofless chasm the tunnel wa laid bare and through the clifflik wall on either side great rent and breach had been torn their tower were beaten into dust if the great sea had risen in wrath and fallen on the hill with storm it could have work no greater ruin the ring beyond wa fill with steam water a bubbl cauldron in which there heav and float a wreckag of beam and spar chest and cask and broken gear twist and lean pillar rear their splinter stem abov the flood but all the road were drown far off it seem half veil in wind cloud there loom the island rock still dark and tall unbroken by the storm the tower of orthanc stood pale water lap about it feet the king and all hi compani sat silent on their hors marvel perceiv that the power of saruman wa overthrown but how they could not guess and now they turn their eye toward the archway and the ruin gate there they saw close besid them a great rubbleheap and suddenli they were awar of two small figur lie on it at their eas greyclad hardli to be seen among the stone there were bottl and bowl and platter laid besid them as if they had just eaten well and now rest from their labour one seem asleep the other with cross leg and arm behind hi head lean back against a broken rock and sent from hi mouth long wisp and littl ring of thin blue smoke for a moment théoden and éomer and all hi men stare at them in wonder amid all the wreck of isengard thi seem to them the strangest sight but befor the king could speak the small smokebreath figur becam suddenli awar of them as they sat there silent on the edg of the mist he sprang to hi feet a young man he look or like one though not much more than half a man in height hi head of brown curl hair wa uncov but he wa clad in a travelstain cloak of the same hue and shape as the companion of gandalf had worn when they rode to edora he bow veri low put hi hand upon hi breast then seem not to observ the wizard and hi

your brooch pippin said aragorn i have kept it safe for it is a veri preciou thing i know said pippin it wa a wrench to let it go but what els could i do noth els answer aragorn one who can not cast away a treasur at need is in fetter you did rightli the cut of the band on your wrist that wa smart work said gimli luck serv you there but you seiz your chanc with both hand one might say and set us a pretti riddl said legola i wonder if you had grown wing unfortun not said pippin but you did not know about grishnákh he shudder and said no more leav merri to tell of those last horribl moment the paw hand the hot breath and the dread strength of grishnákh hairi arm all thi about the orc of baraddûr lugbúrz as they call it make me uneasi said aragorn the dark lord alreadi knew too much and hi servant also and grishnákh evid sent some messag across the river after the quarrel the red eye will be look toward isengard but saruman at ani rate is in a cleft stick of hi own cut ye whichev side win hi outlook is poor said merri thing began to go all wrong for him from the moment hi orc set foot in rohan we caught a glimps of the old villain or so gandalf hint said gimli on the edg of the forest when wa that ask pippin five night ago said aragorn let me see said merri five night agonow we come to a part of the stori you know noth about we met treebeard that morn after the battl and that night we were at wellinghal one of hi enthous the next morn we went to entmoot a gather of ent that is and the queerest thing i have ever seen in my life it last all that day and the next and we spent the night with an ent call quickbeam and then late in the afternoon in the third day of their moot the ent suddenli blew up it wa amaz the forest had felt as tens as if a thunderstorm wa brew insid it then all at onc it explod i wish you could have heard their song as they march if saruman had heard it he would be a hundr mile away by now even if he had had to run on hi own leg said pippin though isengard be strong and hard as cold as stone and bare as bone we go we go we go to war to hew the stone and break the door there wa veri much more a great deal of the song had no word and wa like a music of horn and drum it wa veri excit but i thought it wa onli march music and no more just a song – until i got here i know better now we came down over the last ridg into nan curunír after night had fallen merri continu it wa then that i first had the feel that the forest itself wa move behind us i thought i wa dream an entish dream but pippin had notic it too we were both frighten but we did not find out more about it until later it wa the huorn or so the ent call them in short languag treebeard wont say much about them but i think they are ent that have becom almost like tree at least to look at they stand here and there in the wood or under it eav silent watch endlessli over the tree but deep in the darkest dale there are hundr and hundr of them i believ there is a great power in them and they seem abl to wrap themselv in shadow it is difficult to see them move but they do they can move veri quickli if they are angri you stand still look at the weather mayb or listen to the rustl of the wind and then suddenli you find that you are in the middl of a wood with great grope tree all around you they still have voic and can speak with the ent – that is whi they are call huorn treebeard say – but they have becom queer and wild danger i should be terrifi of meet them if there were no true ent about to look after them well in the earli night we crept down a long ravin into the upper end of the wizard vale the ent with all their rustl huorn behind we could not see them of cours but the whole air wa full of creak it wa veri dark a cloudi night they move at a great speed as soon as they had left the hill and made a nois like a rush wind the moon did not appear through the cloud and not long after midnight there wa a tall wood all round the north side of isengard there wa no sign of enemi nor of ani challeng there wa a light gleam from a high window in the tower that wa all treebeard and a few more ent crept on right round to within sight of the great gate pippin and i were with him we were sit on treebeard shoulder and i could feel the quiver tens in him but even when they are rous ent can be veri cautiou and patient they stood still as carv stone breath and listen then all at onc there wa a tremend stir trumpet blare and the wall of isengard echo we thought that we had been discov and that battl wa go to begin but noth of the sort all saruman peopl were march away i dont know much about thi war or about the horsemen of rohan but saruman seem to have meant to finish off the king and all hi men with one final blow he empti isengard i saw the enemi go endless line of march orc and troop of them mount on great wolv and there were battalion of men too mani of them carri torch and in the flare i could see their face most of them were ordinari men rather tall and darkhair and grim but not particularli evillook but there were some other that were horribl manhigh but with goblinfac sallow leer squintey do you know they remind me at onc of that southern at bree onli he wa not so obvious orclik as most of these were i thought of him too said aragorn we had mani of these halforc to deal with at helm deep it seem plain now that that southern wa a spi of saruman but whether he wa work with the black rider or for saruman alon i do not know it is difficult with these evil folk to know when they are in leagu and when they are cheat one anoth well of all sort togeth there must have been ten thousand at the veri least said merri they took an hour to pass out of the gate some went off down the highway to the ford and some turn away and went eastward a bridg ha been built down there about a mile away where the river run in a veri deep channel you could see it now if you stood up they were all sing with harsh voic and laugh make a hideou din i thought thing look veri black for rohan but treebeard did not move he said my busi is with isengard tonight with rock and stone but though i could not see what wa happen in the dark i believ that huorn began to move south as soon as the gate were shut again their busi wa with orc i think they were far down the valley in the morn or ani rate there wa a shadow there that one couldnt see through as soon as saruman had sent off all hi armi our turn came treebeard put us down and went up to the gate and began hammer on the door and call for saruman there wa no answer except arrow and stone from the wall but arrow are no use against ent they hurt them of cours and infuri them like sting fli but an ent can be stuck as full of orcarrow as a pincushion and take no seriou harm they can not be poison for one thing and their skin seem to be veri thick and tougher than bark it take a veri heavi axestrok to wound them serious they dont like axe but there would have to be a great mani axemen to one ent a man that hack onc at an ent never get a chanc of a second blow a punch from an entfist crumpl up iron like thin tin when treebeard had got a few arrow in him he began to warm up to get posit hasti as he would say he let out a great hoomhom and a dozen more ent came stride up an angri ent is terrifi their finger and their toe just freez on to rock and they tear it up like breadcrust it wa like watch the work of great treeroot in a hundr year all pack into a few moment they push pull tore shook and hammer and clangbang crashcrack in five minut they had these huge gate just lie in ruin and some were alreadi begin to eat into the wall like rabbit in a sandpit i dont know what saruman thought wa happen but anyway he did not know how to deal with it hi wizardri may have been fall off late of cours but anyway i think he ha not much grit not much plain courag alon in a tight place without a lot of slave and machin and thing if you know what i mean veri differ from old gandalf i wonder if hi fame wa not all along mainli due to hi clever in settl at isengard no said aragorn onc he wa as great as hi fame made him hi knowledg wa deep hi thought wa subtl and hi hand marvel skill and he had a power over the mind of other the wise he could persuad and the smaller folk he could daunt that power he certainli still keep there are not mani in middleearth that i should say were safe if they were left alon to talk with him even now when he ha suffer a defeat gandalf elrond and galadriel perhap now that hi wicked ha been laid bare but veri few other the ent are safe said pippin he seem at one time to have got round them but never again and anyway he did not understand them and he made the great mistak of leav them out of hi calcul he had no plan for them and there wa no time to make ani onc they had set to work as soon as our attack began the few remain rat in isengard start bolt through everi hole that the ent made the ent let the men go after they had question them two or three dozen onli down at thi end i dont think mani orcfolk of ani size escap not from the huorn there wa a wood full of them all round isengard by that time as well as those that had gone down the valley when the ent had reduc a larg part of the southern wall to rubbish and what wa left of hi peopl had bolt and desert him saruman fled in a panic he seem to have been at the gate when we arriv i expect he came to watch hi splendid armi march out when the ent broke their way in he left in a hurri they did not spot him at first but the night had open out and there wa a great light of star quit enough for ent to see by and suddenli quickbeam gave a cri the treekil the treekil quickbeam is a gentl creatur but he hate saruman all the more fierc for that hi peopl suffer cruelli from orcax he leapt down the path from the inner gate and he can move like a wind when he is rous there wa a pale figur hurri away in and out of the shadow of the pillar and it had nearli reach the stair to the towerdoor but it wa a near thing quickbeam wa so hot after him that he wa within a step or two of be caught and strangl when he slip in through the door when saruman wa safe back in orthanc it wa not long befor he set some of hi preciou machineri to work by that time there were mani ent insid isengard some had follow quickbeam and other had burst in from the north and east they were roam about and do a great deal of damag suddenli up came fire and foul fume the vent and shaft all over the plain began to spout and belch sever of the ent got scorch and blister one of them beechbon i think he wa call a veri tall handsom ent got caught in a spray of some liquid fire and burn like a torch a horribl sight that sent them mad i thought that they had been realli rous befor but i wa wrong i saw what it wa like at last it wa stagger they roar and boom and trumpet until stone began to crack and fall at the mere nois of them merri and i lay on the ground and stuf our cloak into our ear round and round the rock of orthanc the ent went stride and storm like a howl gale break pillar hurl avalanch of boulder down the shaft toss up huge slab of stone into the air like leav the tower wa in the middl of a spin whirlwind i saw iron post and block of masonri go rocket up hundr of feet and smash against the window of orthanc but treebeard kept hi head he had not had ani burn luckili he did not want hi folk to hurt themselv in their furi and he did not want saruman to escap out of some hole in the confus mani of the ent were hurl themselv against the orthancrock but that defeat them it is veri smooth and hard some wizardri is in it perhap older and stronger than saruman anyway they could not get a grip on it or make a crack in it and they were bruis and wound themselv against it so treebeard went out into the ring and shout hi enorm voic rose abov all the din there wa a dead silenc suddenli in it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the tower that had a queer effect on the ent they had been boil over now they becam cold grim as ice and quiet they left the plain and gather round treebeard stand quit still he spoke to them for a littl in their own languag i think he wa tell them of a plan he had made in hi old head long befor then they just fade silent away in the grey light day wa dawn by that time they set a watch on the tower i believ but the watcher were so well hidden in shadow and kept so still that i could not see them the other went away north all that day they were busi out of sight most of the time we were left alon it wa a dreari day and we wander about a bit though we kept out of the view of the window of orthanc as much as we could they stare at us so threateningli a good deal of the time we spent look for someth to eat and also we sat and talk wonder what wa happen away south in rohan and what had becom of all the rest of our compani everi now and then we could hear in the distanc the rattl and fall of stone and thud nois echo in the hill in the afternoon we walk round the circl and went to have a look at what wa go on there wa a great shadowi wood of huorn at the head of the valley and anoth round the northern wall we did not dare to go in but there wa a rend tear nois of work go on insid ent and huorn were dig great pit and trench and make great pool and dam gather all the water of the isen and everi other spring and stream that they could find we left them to it at dusk treebeard came back to the gate he wa hum and boom to himself and seem pleas he stood and stretch hi great arm and leg and breath deep i ask him if he wa tire tire he said tire well no not tire but stiff i need a good draught of entwash we have work hard we have done more stonecrack and earthgnaw today than we have done in mani a long year befor but it is nearli finish when night fall do not linger near thi gate or in the old tunnel water may come throughand it will be foul water for a while until all the filth of saruman is wash away then isen can run clean again he began to pull down a bit more of the wall in a leisur sort of way just to amus himself we were just wonder where it would be safe to lie and get some sleep when the most amaz thing of all happen there wa the sound of a rider come swiftli up the road merri and i lay quiet and treebeard hid himself in the shadow under the arch suddenli a great hors came stride up like a flash of silver it wa alreadi dark but i could see the rider face clearli it seem to shine and all hi cloth were white i just sat up stare with my mouth open i tri to call out and couldnt there wa no need he halt just by us and look down at us gandalf i said at last but my voic wa onli a whisper did he say hullo pippin thi is a pleasant surpris no inde he said get up you tomfool of a took where in the name of wonder in all thi ruin is treebeard i want him quick treebeard heard hi voic and came out of the shadow at onc and there wa a strang meet i wa surpris becaus neither of them seem surpris at all gandalf obvious expect to find treebeard here and treebeard might almost have been loiter about near the gate on purpos to meet him yet we had told the old ent all about moria but then i rememb a queer look he gave us at the time i can onli suppos that he had seen gandalf or had some news of him but would not say anyth in a hurri dont be hasti is hi motto but nobodi not even elv will say much about gandalf movement when he is not there hoom gandalf said treebeard i am glad you have come wood and water stock and stone i can master but there is a wizard to manag here treebeard said gandalf i need your help you have done much but i need more i have about ten thousand orc to manag then those two went off and had a council togeth in some corner it must have seem veri hasti to treebeard for gandalf wa in a tremend hurri and wa alreadi talk at a great pace befor they pass out of hear they were onli away a matter of minut perhap a quarter of an hour then gandalf came back to us and he seem reliev almost merri he did say he wa glad to see us then but gandalf i cri where have you been and have you seen the other wherev i have been i am back he answer in the genuin gandalf manner ye i have seen some of the other but news must wait thi is a peril night and i must ride fast but the dawn may be brighter and if so we shall meet again take care of yourselv and keep away from orthanc goodby treebeard wa veri thought after gandalf had gone he had evid learnt a lot in a short time and wa digest it he look at us and said hm well i find you are not such hasti folk as i thought you said much less than you might and not more than you should hm thi is a bundl of news and no mistak well now treebeard must get busi again befor he went we got a littl news out of him and it did not cheer us up at all but for the moment we thought more about you three than about frodo and sam or about poor boromir for we gather that there wa a great battl go on or soon would be and that you were in it and might never come out of it huorn will help said treebeard then he went away and we did not see him again until thi morn it wa deep night we lay on top of a pile of stone and could see noth beyond it mist or shadow blot out everyth like a great blanket all round us the air seem hot and heavi and it wa full of rustl creak and a murmur like voic pass i think that hundr more of the huorn must have been pass by to help in the battl later there wa a great rumbl of thunder away south and flash of lightn far away across rohan everi now and then we could see mountainpeak mile and mile away stab out suddenli black and white and then vanish and behind us there were nois like thunder in hill but differ at time the whole valley echo it must have been about midnight when the ent broke the dam and pour all the gather water through a gap in the northern wall down into isengard the huorndark had pass and the thunder had roll away the moon wa sink behind the western mountain isengard began to fill up with black creep stream and pool they glitter in the last light of the moon as they spread over the plain everi now and then the water found their way down into some shaft or spouthol great white steam hiss up smoke rose in billow there were explos and gust of fire one great coil of vapour went whirl up twist round and round orthanc until it look like a tall peak of cloud fieri underneath and moonlit abov and still more water pour in until at last isengard look like a huge flat saucepan all steam and bubbl we saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last night when we came to the mouth of nan curunír said aragorn we fear that saruman wa brew some new devilri for us not he said pippin he wa probabl choke and not laugh ani more by the morn yesterday morn the water had sunk down into all the hole and there wa a dens fog we took refug in that guardroom over there and we had rather a fright the lake began to overflow and pour out through the old tunnel and the water wa rapidli rise up the step we thought we were go to get caught like orc in a hole but we found a wind stair at the back of the storeroom that brought us out on top of the arch it wa a squeez to get out as the passag had been crack and half block with fallen stone near the top there we sat high up abov the flood and watch the drown of isengard the ent kept on pour in more water till all the fire were quench and everi cave fill the fog slowli gather togeth and steam up into a huge umbrella of cloud it must have been a mile high in the even there wa a great rainbow over the eastern hill and then the sunset wa blot out by a thick drizzl on the mountainsid it all went veri quiet a few wolv howl mourn far away the ent stop the inflow in the night and sent the isen back into it old cours and that wa the end of it all sinc then the water ha been sink again there must be outlet somewher from the cave underneath i think if saruman peep out of ani of hi window it must look an untidi dreari mess we felt veri lone not even a visibl ent to talk to in all the ruin and no news we spent the night up on top there abov the arch and it wa cold and damp and we did not sleep we had a feel that anyth might happen at ani minut saruman is still in hi tower there wa a nois in the night like a wind come up the valley i think the ent and huorn that had been away came back then but where they have all gone to now i dont know it wa a misti moisti morn when we climb down and look round again and nobodi wa about and that is about all there is to tell it seem almost peac now after all the turmoil and safer too somehow sinc gandalf came back i could sleep they all fell silent for a while gimli refil hi pipe there is one thing i wonder about he said as he lit it with hi flint and tinder wormtongu you told théoden he wa with saruman how did he get there oh ye i forgot about him said pippin he did not get here till thi morn we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when treebeard appear again we heard him hoom and call our name outsid i have just come round to see how you are fare my lad he said and to give you some news huorn have come back all well aye veri well inde he laugh and slap hi thigh no more orc in isengard no more axe and there will be folk come up from the south befor the day is old some that you may be glad to see he had hardli said that when we heard the sound of hoof on the road we rush out befor the gate and i stood and stare half expect to see strider and gandalf come ride up at the head of an armi but out of the mist there rode a man on an old tire hors and he look a queer twist sort of creatur himself there wa no one els when he came out of the mist and suddenli saw all the ruin and wreckag in front of him he sat and gape and hi face went almost green he wa so bewild that he did not seem to notic us at first when he did he gave a cri and tri to turn hi hors round and ride off but treebeard took three stride put out a long arm and lift him out of the saddl hi hors bolt in terror and he grovel on the ground he said he wa gríma friend and counsellor of the king and had been sent with import messag from théoden to saruman no one els would dare to ride through the open land so full of foul orc he said so i wa sent and i have had a peril journey and i am hungri and weari i fled far north out of my way pursu by wolv i caught the sidelong look he gave to treebeard and i said to myself liar treebeard look at him in hi long slow way for sever minut till the wretch man wa squirm on the floor then at last he said ha hm i wa expect you master wormtongu the man start at that name gandalf got here first so i know as much about you as i need and i know what to do with you put all the rat in one trap said gandalf and i will i am the master of isengard now but saruman is lock in hi tower and you can go there and give him all the messag that you can think of let me go let me go said wormtongu i know the way you knew the way i dont doubt said treebeard but thing have chang here a littl go and see he let wormtongu go and he limp off through the arch with us close behind until he came insid the ring and could see all the flood that lay between him and orthanc then he turn to us let me go away he whine let me go away my messag are useless now they are inde said treebeard but you have onli two choic to stay with me until gandalf and your master arriv or to cross the water which will you have the man shiver at the mention of hi master and put a foot into the water but he drew back i can not swim he said the water is not deep said treebeard it is dirti but that will not harm you master wormtongu in you go now with that the wretch flounder off into the flood it rose up nearli to hi neck befor he got too far away for me to see him the last i saw of him wa cling to some old barrel or piec of wood but treebeard wade after him and watch hi progress well he ha gone in he said when he return i saw him crawl up the step like a draggl rat there is someon in the tower still a hand came out and pull him in so there he is and i hope the welcom is to hi like now i must go and wash myself clean of the slime ill be away up on the north side if anyon want to see me there is no clean water down here fit for an ent to drink or to bath in so i will ask you two lad to keep a watch at the gate for the folk that are come therel be the lord of the field of rohan mark you you must welcom him as well as you know how hi men have fought a great fight with the orc mayb you know the right fashion of men word for such a lord better than ent there have been mani lord in the green field in my time and i have never learn their speech or their name they will be want manfood and you know all about that i guess so find what you think is fit for a king to eat if you can and that is the end of the stori though i should like to know who thi wormtongu is wa he realli the king counsellor he wa said aragorn and also saruman spi and servant in rohan fate ha not been kinder to him than he deserv the sight of the ruin of all that he thought so strong and magnific must have been almost punish enough but i fear that wors await him ye i dont suppos treebeard sent him to orthanc out of kind said merri he seem rather grimli delight with the busi and wa laugh to himself when he went to get hi bath and drink we spent a busi time after that search the flotsam and rummag about we found two or three storeroom in differ place nearbi abov the floodlevel but treebeard sent some ent down and they carri off a great deal of the stuff we want manfood for twentyf the ent said so you can see that somebodi had count your compani care befor you arriv you three were evid meant to go with the great peopl but you would not have fare ani better we kept as good as we sent i promis you better becaus we sent no drink what about drink i said to the ent there is water of isen they said and that is good enough for ent and men but i hope that the ent may have found time to brew some of their draught from the mountainspr and we shall see gandalf beard curl when he return after the ent had gone we felt tire and hungri but we did not grumbl – our labour had been well reward it wa through our search for manfood that pippin discov the prize of all the flotsam those hornblow barrel pipewe is better after food said pippin that is how the situat aros we understand it all perfectli now said gimli all except one thing said aragorn leaf from the southfarth in isengard the more i consid it the more curiou i find it i have never been in isengard but i have journey in thi land and i know well the empti countri that lie between rohan and the shire neither good nor folk have pass that way for mani a long year not openli saruman had secret deal with someon in the shire i guess wormtongu may be found in other hous than king théoden wa there a date on the barrel ye said pippin it wa the crop that is last year no the year befor of cours now a good year ah well whatev evil wa afoot is over now i hope or els it is beyond our reach at present said aragorn yet i think i shall mention it to gandalf small matter though it may seem among hi great affair i wonder what he is do said merri the afternoon is get on let us go and look round you can enter isengard now at ani rate strider if you want to but it is not a veri cheer sight chapter the voic of saruman they pass through the ruin tunnel and stood upon a heap of stone gaze at the dark rock of orthanc and it mani window a menac still in the desol that lay all about it the water had now nearli all subsid here and there gloomi pool remain cover with scum and wreckag but most of the wide circl wa bare again a wilder of slime and tumbl rock pit with blacken hole and dot with post and pillar lean drunkenli thi way and that at the rim of the shatter bowl there lay vast mound and slope like the shingl cast up by a great storm and beyond them the green and tangl valley ran up into the long ravin between the dark arm of the mountain across the wast they saw rider pick their way they were come from the north side and alreadi they were

most like if you ride to hi door with a light heart said gandalf but there is no know what he can do or may choos to tri a wild beast corner is not safe to approach and saruman ha power you do not guess bewar of hi voic they came now to the foot of orthanc it wa black and the rock gleam as if it were wet the mani face of the stone had sharp edg as though they had been newli chisel a few score and small flakelik splinter near the base were all the mark that it bore of the furi of the ent on the eastern side in the angl of two pier there wa a great door high abov the ground and over it wa a shutter window open upon a balconi hedg with iron bar up to the threshold of the door there mount a flight of twentyseven broad stair hewn by some unknown art of the same black stone thi wa the onli entranc to the tower but mani tall window were cut with deep embrasur in the climb wall far up they peer like littl eye in the sheer face of the horn at the foot of the stair gandalf and the king dismount i will go up said gandalf i have been in orthanc and i know my peril and i too will go up said the king i am old and fear no peril ani more i wish to speak with the enemi who ha done me so much wrong éomer shall come with me and see that my age feet do not falter as you will said gandalf aragorn shall come with me let the other await us at the foot of the stair they will hear and see

and théoden went besid him the rider of rohan sat uneasili upon their hors on either side of the stair and look up darkli at the great tower fear what might befal their lord merri and pippin sat on the bottom step feel both unimport and unsaf half a sticki mile from here to the gate mutter pippin i wish i could slip off back to the guardroom unnot what did we come for we are not want gandalf stood befor the door of orthanc and beat on it with hi staff it rang with a hollow sound saruman saruman he cri in a loud command voic saruman come forth for some time there wa no answer at last the window abov the door wa unbar hut no figur could be seen at it dark open who is it said a voic what do you wish théoden start i know that voic he said and i curs the day when i first listen to it go and fetch saruman sinc you have becom hi footman gríma wormtongu said gandalf and do not wast our time the window close they wait suddenli anoth voic spoke low and melodi it veri sound an enchant those who listen unwarili to that voic could seldom report the word that they heard and if they did they wonder for littl power remain in them mostli they rememb onli that it wa a delight to hear the voic speak all that it said seem wise and reason and desir awok in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselv when other spoke they seem harsh and uncouth by contrast and if they gainsaid the voic anger wa kindl in the heart of those under the spell fur some the spell last onli while the voic spoke to them and when it spake to anoth they smile as men do who see through a juggler trick while other gape at it for mani the sound of the voic alon wa enough to hold them enthral but for those whom it conquer the spell endur when they were far away and ever they heard that soft voic whisper and urg them but none were unmov none reject it plea and it command without an effort of mind and will so long as it master had control of it well it said now with gentl question whi must you disturb my rest will you give me no peac at all by night or day it tone wa that of a kindli heart aggriev by injuri undeserv they look up astonish for they had heard no sound of hi come and they saw a figur stand at the rail look down upon them an old man swath in a great cloak the colour of which wa not easi to tell for it chang if they move their eye or if he stir hi face wa long with a high forehead he had deep darkl eye hard to fathom though the look that they now bore wa grave and benevol and a littl weari hi hair and beard were white but strand of black still show about hi lip and ear like and yet unlik mutter gimli but come now said the soft voic two at least of you i know by name gandalf i know too well to have much hope that he seek help or counsel here but you théoden lord of the mark of rohan are declar by your nobl devic and still more by the fair counten of the hous of eorl o worthi son of thengel the thricerenown whi have you not come befor and as a friend much have i desir to see you mightiest king of western land and especi in these latter year to save you from the unwis and evil counsel that beset you is it yet too late despit the injuri that have been done to me in which the men of rohan ala have had some part still i would save you and deliv you from the ruin that draw nigh inevit if you ride upon thi road which you have taken inde i alon can aid you now théoden open hi mouth as if to speak but he said noth he look up at the face of saruman with it dark solemn eye bent down upon him and then to gandalf at hi side and he seem to hesit gandalf made no sign but stood silent as stone as one wait patient for some call that ha not yet come the rider stir at first murmur with approv of the word of saruman and then they too were silent as men spellbound it seem to them that gandalf had never spoken so fair and fittingli to their lord rough and proud now seem all hi deal with théoden and over their heart crept a shadow the fear of a great danger the end of the mark in a dark to which gandalf wa drive them while saruman stood besid a door of escap hold it half open so that a ray of light came through there wa a heavi silenc it wa gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenli the word of thi wizard stand on their head he growl grip the handl of hi axe in the languag of orthanc help mean ruin and save mean slay that is plain but we do not come here to beg peac said saruman and for a fleet moment hi voic wa less suav and a light flicker in hi eye and wa gone i do not speak to you yet gimli glóin son he said far away is your home and small concern of your are the troubl of thi land but it wa not by design of your own that you becam embroil in them and so i will not blame such part as you have playeda valiant one i doubt not but i pray you allow me first to speak with the king of rohan my neighbour and onc my friend what have you to say théoden king will you have peac with me and all the aid that my knowledg found in long year can bring shall we make our counsel togeth against evil day and repair our injuri with such good will that our estat shall both come to fairer flower than ever befor still théoden did not answer whether he strove with anger or doubt none could say éomer spoke lord hear me he said now we feel the peril that we were warn of have we ridden forth to victori onli to stand at last amaz by an old liar with honey on hi fork tongu so would the trap wolf speak to the hound if he could what aid can he give to you forsooth all he desir is to escap from hi plight but will you parley with thi dealer in treacheri and murder rememb théodr at the ford and the grave of háma in helm deep if we speak of poison tongu what shall we say of your young serpent said saruman and the flash of hi anger wa now plain to see but come éomer éomund son he went on in hi soft voic again to everi man h part valour in arm is your and you win high honour therebi slay whom your lord name as enemi and be content meddl not in polici which you do not understand but mayb if you becom a king you will find that he must choos hi friend with care the friendship of saruman and the power of orthanc can not be lightli thrown asid whatev grievanc real or fanci may lie behind you have won a battl but not a war and that with help on which you can not count again you may find the shadow of the wood at your own door next it is wayward and senseless and ha no love for men but my lord of rohan am i to be call a murder becaus valiant men have fallen in battl if you go to war needlessli for i did not desir it then men will be slain but if i am a murder on that account then all the hous of eorl is stain with murder for they have fought mani war and assail mani who defi them yet with some they have afterward made peac none the wors for be polit i say théoden king shall we have peac and friendship you and i it is our to command we will have peac said théoden at last thickli and with an effort sever of the rider cri out gladli théoden held up hi hand ye we will have peac he said now in a clear voic we will have peac when you and all your work have perish – and the work of your dark master to whom you would deliv us you are a liar saruman and a corrupt of men heart you hold out your hand to me and i perceiv onli a finger of the claw of mordor cruel and cold even if your war on me wa just as it wa not for were you ten time as wise you would have no right to rule me and mine for your own profit as you desir – even so what will you say of your torch in westfold and the children that lie dead there and they hew háma bodi befor the gate of the hornburg after he wa dead when you hang from a gibbet at your window for the sport of your own crow i will have peac with you and orthanc so much for the hous of eorl a lesser son of great sire am i but i do not need to lick your finger turn elsewhith but i fear your voic ha lost it charm the rider gaze up at théoden like men startl out of a dream harsh as an old raven their master voic sound in their ear after the music of saruman but saruman for a while wa besid himself with wrath he lean over the rail as if he would smite the king with hi staff to some suddenli it seem that they saw a snake coil itself to strike gibbet and crow he hiss and they shudder at the hideou chang dotard what is the hous of eorl but a thatch barn where brigand drink in the reek and their brat roll on the floor among the dog too long have they escap the gibbet themselv but the noos come slow in the draw tight and hard in the end hang if you will now hi voic chang as he slowli master himself i know not whi i have had the patienc to speak to you for i need you not nor your littl band of gallop as swift to fli as to advanc théoden horsemast long ago i offer you a state beyond

am griev feel for your shame how come it that you can endur such compani for you are proud gandalfand not without reason have a nobl mind and eye that look both deep and far even now will you not listen to my counsel gandalf stir and look up what have you to say that you did not say at our last meet he ask or perhap you have thing to unsay saruman paus unsay he muse as if puzzl unsay i endeavour to advis you for your own good but you scarc listen you are proud and do not love advic have inde a store of your own wisdom but on that occas you er i think misconstru my intent wil i fear that in my eager to persuad you i lost patienc and inde i regret it for i bore you no illwil and even now i bear none though you return to me in the compani of the violent and the ignor how should i are we not both member of a high and ancient order most excel in middleearth our friendship would profit us both alik much we could still accomplish togeth to heal the disord of the world let us understand one anoth and dismiss from thought these lesser folk let them wait on our decis for the common good i am will to redress the past and to receiv you will you not consult with me will you not come up so great wa the power that saruman exert in thi last effort that none that stood within hear were unmov but now the spell wa wholli differ they heard the gentl remonstr of a kindli king with an er but muchlov minist but they were shut out listen at a door to word not meant for them illmann children or stupid servant overhear the elus discours of their elder and wonder how it would affect their lot of loftier mould these two were made reverend and wise it wa inevit that they should make allianc gandalf would ascend into the tower to discuss deep thing beyond their comprehens in the high chamber of orthanc the door would be close and they would be left outsid dismiss to await allot work or punish even in the mind of théoden the thought took shape like a shadow of doubt he will betray us he will go – we shall be lost then gandalf laugh the fantasi vanish like a puff of smoke saruman saruman said gandalf still laugh saruman you miss your path in life you should have been the king jester and earn your bread and stripe too by mimick hi counsellor ah me he paus get the better of hi mirth understand one anoth i fear i am beyond your comprehens but you saruman i understand now too well i keep a clearer memori of your argument and deed than you suppos when last i visit you you were the jailor of mordor and there i wa to be sent nay the guest who ha escap from the roof will think twice befor he come back in by the door nay i do not think i will come up but listen saruman for the last time will you not come down isengard ha prove less strong than your hope and fanci made it so may other thing in which you still have trust would it not be well to leav it for a while to turn to new thing perhap think well saruman will you not come down a shadow pass over saruman face then it went deathli white befor he could conceal it they saw through the mask the anguish of a mind in doubt loath to stay and dread to leav it refug for a second he hesit and no one breath then he spoke and hi voic wa shrill and cold pride and hate were conquer him will i come down he mock doe an unarm man come down to speak with robber out of door i can hear you w ell enough here i am no fool and i do not trust you gandalf they do not stand openli on my stair but i know where the wild wooddemon are lurk at your command the treacher are ever distrust answer gandalf wearili but you need not fear for your skin i do not wish to kill you or hurt you as you would know if you realli understood me and i have the power to protect you i am give you a last chanc you can leav orthanc free – if you choos that sound well sneer saruman veri much in the manner of gandalf the grey so condescend and so veri kind i do not doubt that you would find orthanc commodi and my departur conveni but whi should i wish to leav and what do you mean by free there are condit i presum reason for leav you can see from your window answer gandalf other will occur to your thought your servant are destroy and scatter your neighbour you have made your enemi and you have cheat your new master or tri to do so when hi eye turn hither it will be the red eye of wrath but when i say free i mean free free from bond of chain or command to go where you will even even to mordor saruman if you desir but you will first surrend to me the key of orthanc and your staff they shall be pledg of your conduct to be return later if you merit them saruman face grew livid twist with rage and a red light wa kindl in hi eye he laugh wildli later he cri and hi voic rose to a scream later ye when you also have the key of baraddûr itself i suppos and the crown of seven king and the rod of the five wizard and have purchas yourself a pair of boot mani size larger than those that you wear now a modest plan hardli one in which my help is need i have other thing to do do not be a fool if you wish to treat with me while you have a chanc go away and come back when you are sober and leav behind these cutthroat and small ragtag that dangl at your tail good day he turn and left the balconi come back saruman said gandalf in a command voic to the amaz of the other saruman turn again and as if drag against hi will he came slowli back to the iron rail lean on it breath hard hi face wa line and shrunken hi hand clutch hi heavi black staff like a claw i did not give you leav to go said gandalf sternli i have not finish you have becom a fool saruman and yet pitiabl you might still have turn away from folli and evil and have been of servic but you choos to stay and gnaw the end of your old plot stay then but i warn you you will not easili come out again not unless the dark hand of the east stretch out to take you saruman he cri and hi voic grew in power and author behold i am not gandalf the grey whom you betray i am gandalf the white who ha return from death you have no colour now and i cast you from the order and from the council he rais hi hand and spoke slowli in a clear cold voic saruman your staff is broken there wa a crack and the staff split asund in saruman hand and the head of it fell down at gandalf feet go said gandalf with a cri saruman fell back and crawl away at that moment a heavi shine thing came hurtl down from abov it glanc off the iron rail even as saruman left it and pass close to gandalf head it smote the stair on which he stood the rail rang and snap the stair crack and splinter in glitter spark but the ball wa unharm it roll on down the step a globe of crystal dark but glow with a heart of fire as it bound away toward a pool pippin ran after it and pick it up the murder rogu cri éomer but gandalf wa unmov no that wa not thrown by saruman he said nor even at hi bid i think it came from a window far abov a part shot from master wormtongu i fanci but ill aim the aim wa poor mayb becaus he could not make up hi mind which he hate more you or saruman said aragorn that may be so said gandalf small comfort will those two have in their companionship they will gnaw one anoth with word but the punish is just if wormtongu ever come out of orthanc aliv it will be more than he deserv here my lad ill take that i did not ask you to handl it he cri turn sharpli and see pippin come up the step slowli as if he were bear a great weight he went down to meet him and hastili took the dark globe from the hobbit wrap it in the fold of hi cloak i will take care of thi he said it is not a thing i guess that saruman would have chosen to cast away but he may have other thing to cast said gimli if that is the end of the debat let us go out of stone throw at least it is the end said gandalf let us go they turn their back on the door of orthanc and went down the rider hail the king with joy and salut gandalf the spell of saruman wa broken they had seen him come at call and crawl away dismiss well that is done said gandalf now i must find treebeard and tell him how thing have gone he will have guess sure said merri were they like to end ani other way not like answer gandalf though they came to the balanc of a hair but i had reason for tri some merci and some less so first saruman wa shown that the power of hi voic wa wane he can not be both tyrant and counsellor when the plot is ripe it remain no longer secret yet he fell into the trap and tri to deal with hi victim piecem while other listen then i gave him a last choic and a fair one to renounc both mordor and hi privat scheme and make amend by help us in our need he know our need none better great servic he could have render but he ha chosen to withhold it and keep the power of orthanc he will not serv onli command he live now in terror of the shadow of mordor and yet he still dream of ride the storm unhappi fool he will be devour if the power of the east stretch out it arm to isengard we can not destroy orthanc from without but sauron – who know what he can do and what if sauron doe not conquer what will you do to him ask pippin i noth said gandalf i will do noth to him i do not wish for masteri what will becom of him i can not say i griev that so much that wa good now fester in the tower still for us thing have not gone badli strang are the turn of fortun often doe hatr hurt itself i guess that even if we had enter in we could have found few treasur in orthanc more preciou than the thing which wormtongu threw down at us a shrill shriek suddenli cut off came from an open window high abov it seem that saruman think so too said gandalf let us leav them they return now to the ruin of the gate hardli had they pass out under the arch when from among the shadow of the pile stone where they had stood treebeard and a dozen other ent came stride up aragorn gimli and legola gaze at them in wonder here are three of my companion treebeard said gandalf i have spoken of them but you have not yet seen them he name them one by one the old ent look at them long and searchingli and spoke to them in turn last he turn to legola so you have come all the way from mirkwood my good elf a veri great forest it use to be and still is said legola but not so great that we who dwell there ever tire of see new tree i should dearli love to journey in fangorn wood i scarc pass beyond the eav of it and i did not wish to turn back treebeard eye gleam with pleasur i hope you may have your wish ere the hill be much older he said i will come if i have the fortun said legola i have made a bargain with my friend that if all goe well we will visit fangorn togeth – by your leav ani elf that come with you will be welcom said treebeard the friend i speak of is not an elf said legola i mean gimli glóin son here gimli bow low and the axe slip from hi belt and clatter on the ground hoom hm ah now said treebeard look darkey at him a dwarf and an axebear hoom i have good will to elv but you ask much thi is a strang friendship strang it may seem said legola but while gimli live i shall not come to fangorn alon hi axe is not for tree but for orcneck o fangorn master of fangorn wood fortytwo he hew in the battl hoo come now said treebeard that is a better stori well well thing will go as they will and there is no need to hurri to meet them but now we must part for a while day is draw to an end yet gandalf say you must go ere nightfal and the lord of the mark is eager for hi own hous ye we must go and go now said gandalf i fear that i must take your gatekeep from you but you will manag well enough without them mayb i shall said treebeard but i shall miss them we have becom friend in so short a while that i think i must be get hasti – grow backward toward youth perhap but there they are the first new thing under sun or moon that i have seen for mani a long long day i shall not forget them i have put their name into the long list ent will rememb it ent the earthborn old as mountain the widewalk water drink and hungri as hunter the hobbit children the laughingfolk the littl peopl they shall remain friend as long as leav are renew fare you well but if you hear news up in your pleasant land in the shire send me word you know what i mean word or sight of the entwiv come yourselv if you can we will said merri and pippin togeth and they turn away hastili treebeard look at them and wa silent for a while shake hi head thought then he turn to gandalf so saruman would not leav he said i did not think he would hi heart is as rotten as a black huorn still if i were overcom and all my tree destroy i would not come while i had one dark hole left to hide in no said gandalf but you have not plot to cover all the world with your tree and choke all other live thing but there it is saruman remain to nurs hi hatr and weav again such web as he can he ha the key of orthanc but he must not be allow to escap inde no ent will see to that said treebeard saruman shall not set foot beyond the rock without my leav ent will watch over him good said gandalf that is what i hope now i can go and turn to other matter with one care the less but you must be wari the water have gone down it will not be enough to put sentinel round the tower i fear i do not doubt that there were deep way delv under orthanc and that saruman hope to go and come unmark befor long if you will undertak the labour i beg you to pour in the water again and do so until isengard remain a stand pool or you discov the outlet when all the underground place are drown and the outlet block then saruman must stay upstair and look out of the window leav it to the ent said treebeard we shall search the valley from head to foot and peer under everi pebbl tree are come back to live here old tree wild tree the watchwood we will call it not a squirrel will go here but i shall know of it leav it to ent until seven time the year in which he torment us have pass we shall not tire of watch him chapter the palantír the sun wa sink behind the long western arm of the mountain when gandalf and hi companion and the king with hi rider set out again from isengard gandalf took merri behind him and aragorn took pippin two of the king men went on ahead ride swiftli and pass soon out of sight down into the valley the other follow at an easi pace ent in a solemn row stood like statu at the gate with their long arm uplift but they made no sound merri and pippin look back when they had pass some way down the wind road sunlight wa still shine in the sky but long shadow reach over isengard grey ruin fall into dark treebeard stood alon there now like the distant stump of an old tree the hobbit thought of their first meet upon the sunni ledg far away on the border of fangorn they came to the pillar of the white hand the pillar wa still stand but the graven hand had been thrown down and broken into small piec right in the middl of the road the long forefing lay white in the dusk it red nail darken to black the ent pay attent to everi detail said gandalf they rode on and even deepen in the valley are we ride far tonight gandalf ask merri after a while i dont know how you feel with small ragtag dangl behind you but the ragtag is tire and will be glad to stop dangl and lie down so you heard that said gandalf dont let it rankl be thank no longer word were aim at you he had hi eye on you if it is ani comfort to your pride i should say that at the moment you and pippin are more in hi thought than all the rest of us who you are how you came there and whi what you know whether you were captur and if so how you escap when all the orc perish – it is with those littl riddl that the great mind of saruman is troubl a sneer from him meriadoc is a compliment if you feel honour by hi concern thank you said merri but it is a greater honour to dangl at your tail gandalf for one thing in that posit one ha a chanc of put a question a second time are we ride far tonight gandalf laugh a most unquench hobbit all wizard should have a hobbit or two in their care – to teach them the mean of the word and to correct them i beg your pardon but i have given thought even to these simpl matter we will ride for a few hour gentli until we come to the end of the valley tomorrow we must ride faster when we came we meant to go straight from isengard back to the king hous at edora over the plain a ride of some day but we have taken thought and chang the plan messeng have gone ahead to helm deep to warn them that the king is return tomorrow he will ride from there with mani men to dunharrow by path among the hill from now on no more than two or three togeth are to go openli over the land by day or night when it can be avoid noth or a doubl help is your way said merri i am afraid i wa not look beyond tonight bed where and what are helm deep and all the rest of it i dont know anyth about thi countri then youd best learn someth if you wish to understand what is happen but not just now and not from me i have too mani press thing to think about all right ill tackl strider by the campfir he less testi but whi all thi secreci i thought wed won the battl ye we have won but onli the first victor and that in itself increas our danger there wa some link between isengard and mordor which i have not yet fathom how they exchang news i am not sure but they did so the eye of baraddûr will be look

again now i will leav you two togeth for a while with that gandalf return to the other who were still stand by the orthancston in troubl thought peril come in the night when least expect he said we have had a narrow escap how is the hobbit pippin ask aragorn i think all will be well now answer gandalf he wa not held long and hobbit have an amaz power of recoveri the memori or the horror of it will probabl fade quickli too quickli perhap will you aragorn take the orthancston and guard it it is a danger charg danger inde but not to all said aragorn there is one who may claim it by right for thi assuredli is the palantír of orthanc from the treasuri of elendil set here by the king of gondor now my hour draw near i will take it gandalf look at aragorn and then to the surpris of the other he lift the cover stone and bow as he present it receiv it lord he said in earnest of other thing that shall be given back but if i may counsel you in the use of your own do not use it – yet be wari when have i been hasti or unwari who have wait and prepar for so mani long year said aragorn never yet do not then stumbl at the end of the road answer gandalf but at the least keep thi thing secret you and all other that stand here the hobbit peregrin abov all should not know where it is bestow the evil fit may come on him again for ala he ha handl it and look in it as should never have happen he ought never to have touch it in isengard and there i should have been quicker but my mind wa bent on saruman and i did not at onc guess the natur of the stone then i wa weari and as i lay ponder it sleep overcam me now i know ye there can be no doubt said aragorn at last we know the link between isengard and mordor and how it work much is explain strang power have our enemi and strang weak said théoden but it ha long been said oft evil will shall evil mar that mani time is seen said gandalf but at thi time we have been strang fortun mayb i have been save by thi hobbit from a grave blunder i had consid whether or not to probe thi stone myself to find it use had i done so i should have been reveal to him myself i am not readi for such a trial if inde i shall ever be so but even if i found the power to withdraw myself it would be disastr for him to see me yet – until the hour come when secreci will avail no longer that hour is now come i think said aragorn not yet said gandalf there remain a short while of doubt which we must use the enemi it is clear thought that the stone wa in orthanc – whi should he not and that therefor the hobbit wa captiv there driven to look in the glass for hi torment by saruman that dark mind will be fill now with the voic and face of the hobbit and with expect it may take some time befor he learn hi error we must snatch that time we have been too leisur we must move the neighbourhood of isengard is no place now to linger in i will ride ahead at onc with peregrin took it will be better for him than lie in the dark while other sleep i will keep éomer and ten rider said the king they shall ride with me at earli day the rest may go with aragorn and ride as soon as they have a mind as you will said gandalf but make all the speed you may to the cover of the hill to helm deep at that moment a shadow fell over them the bright moonlight seem to be suddenli cut off sever of the rider cri out and crouch hold their arm abov their head as if to ward off a blow from abov a blind fear and a deadli cold fell on them cower they look up a vast wing shape pass over the moon like a black cloud it wheel and went north fli at a speed greater than ani wind of middleearth the star faint befor it it wa gone they stood up rigid as stone gandalf wa gaze up hi arm out and downward stiff hi hand clench nazgûl he cri the messeng of mordor the storm is come the nazgûl have cross the river ride ride wait not for the dawn let not the swift wait for the slow ride he sprang away call shadowfax as he ran aragorn follow him go to pippin gandalf pick him up in hi arm you shall come with me thi time he said shadowfax shall show you hi pace then he ran to the place where he had slept shadowfax stood there alreadi sling the small bag which wa all hi luggag across hi shoulder the wizard leapt upon the hors back aragorn lift pippin and set him in gandalf arm wrap in cloak and blanket farewel follow fast cri gandalf away shadowfax the great hors toss hi head hi flow tail flick in the moonlight then he leapt forward spurn the earth and wa gone like the north wind from the mountain a beauti rest night said merri to aragorn some folk have wonder luck he did not want to sleep and he want to ride with gandalf – and there he goe instead of be turn into a stone himself to stand here for ever as a warn if you had been the first to lift the orthancston and not he how would it be now said aragorn you might have done wors who can say but now it is your luck to come with me i fear at onc go and get readi and bring anyth that pippin left behind make hast over the plain shadowfax wa fli need no urg and no guidanc less than an hour had pass and they had reach the ford of isen and cross them the mound of the rider and it cold spear lay grey behind them pippin wa recov he wa warm but the wind in hi face wa keen and refresh he wa with gandalf the horror of the stone and of the hideou shadow over the moon wa fade thing left behind in the mist of the mountain or in a pass dream he drew a deep breath i did not know you rode bareback gandalf he said you havent a saddl or a bridl i do not ride elffashion except on shadowfax said gandalf but shadowfax will have no har you do not ride shadowfax he is will to carri youor not if he is will that is enough it is then hi busi to see that you remain on hi back unless you jump off into the air how fast is he go ask pippin fast by the wind but veri smooth and how light hi footfal are he is run now as fast as the swiftest hors could gallop answer gandalf but that is not fast for him the land is rise a littl here and is more broken than it wa beyond the river but see how the white mountain are draw near under the star yonder are the thrihyrn peak like black spear it will not be long befor we reach the branch road and come to the deepingcoomb where the battl wa fought two night ago pippin wa silent again for a while he heard gandalf sing softli to himself murmur brief snatch of rhyme in mani tongu as the mile ran under them at last the wizard pass into a song of which the hobbit caught the word a few line came clear to hi ear through the rush of the wind tall ship and tall king three time three what brought they from the founder land over the flow sea seven star and seven stone and one white tree what are you say gandalf ask pippin i wa just run over some of the rhyme of lore in my mind answer the wizard hobbit i suppos have forgotten them even those that they ever knew no not all said pippin and we have mani of our own which wouldnt interest you perhap but i have never heard thi one what is it about – the seven star and seven stone about the palantíri of the king of old said gandalf and what are they the name meant that which look far away the orthancston wa one then it wa not made not made – pippin hesit – by the enemi no said gandalf nor by saruman it is beyond hi art and beyond sauron too the palantíri came from beyond westerness from eldamar the noldor made them fëanor himself mayb wrought them in day so long ago that the time can not be measur in year but there is noth that sauron can not turn to evil use ala for saruman it wa hi downfal as i now perceiv peril to us all are the devic of an art deeper than we possess ourselv yet he must bear the blame fool to keep it secret for hi own profit no word did he ever speak of it to ani of the council we had not yet given thought to the fate of the palantíri of gondor in it ruinou war by men they were almost forgotten even in gondor they were a secret known onli to a few in arnor they were rememb onli in a rhyme of lore among the dúnedain what did the men of old use them for ask pippin delight and astonish at get answer to so mani question and wonder how long it would last to see far off and to convers in thought with one anoth said gandalf in that way they long guard and unit the realm of gondor they set up stone at mina anor and at mina ithil and at orthanc in the ring of isengard the chief and master of these wa under the dome of star at osgiliath befor it ruin the three other were far away in the north in the hous of elrond it is told that they were at annúmina and amon sûl and elendil stone wa on the tower hill that look toward mithlond in the gulf of lune where the grey ship lie each palantír repli to each but all those in gondor were ever open to the view of osgiliath now it appear that as the rock of orthanc ha withstood the storm of time so there the palantír of that tower ha remain but alon it could do noth but see small imag of thing far off and day remot veri use no doubt that wa to saruman yet it seem that he wa not content further and further abroad he gaze until he cast hi gaze upon baraddûr then he wa caught who know where the lost stone of arnor and gondor now lie buri or drown deep but one at least sauron must have obtain and master to hi purpos i guess that it wa the ithilston for he took mina ithil long ago and turn it into an evil place mina morgul it ha becom easi it is now to guess how quickli the rove eye of saruman wa trap and held and how ever sinc he ha been persuad from afar and daunt when persuas would not serv the biter bit the hawk under the eagl foot the spider in a steel web how long i wonder ha he been constrain to come often to hi glass for inspect and instruct and the orthancston so bent toward baraddûr that if ani save a will of adam now look into it it will bear hi mind and sight swiftli thither and how it draw one to itself have i not felt it even now my heart desir to test my will upon it to see if i could not wrench it from him and turn it where i wouldto look across the wide sea of water and of time to tirion the fair and perceiv the unimagin hand and mind of fëanor at their work while both the white tree and the golden were in flower he sigh and fell silent i wish i had known all thi befor said pippin i had no notion of what i wa do oh ye you had said gandalf you knew you were behav wrongli and foolishli and you told yourself so though you did not listen i did not tell you all thi befor becaus it is onli by muse on all that ha happen that i have at last understood even as we ride togeth but if i had spoken sooner it would not have lessen your desir or made it easier to resist on the contrari no the burn hand teach best after that advic about fire goe to the heart it doe said pippin if all the seven stone were laid out befor me now i should shut my eye and put my hand in my pocket good said gandalf that is what i hope but i should like to know pippin began merci cri gandalf if the give of inform is to be the cure of your inquisit i shall spend all the rest of my day in answer you what more do you want to know the name of all the star and of all live thing and the whole histori of middleearth and overheaven and of the sunder sea laugh pippin of cours what less but i am not in a hurri tonight at the moment i wa just wonder about the black shadow i heard you shout messeng of mordor what wa it what could it do at isengard it wa a black rider on wing a nazgûl said gandalf it could have taken you away to the dark tower but it wa not come for me wa it falter pippin i mean it didnt know that i had of cours not said gandalf it is two hundr leagu or more in straight flight from baraddûr to orthanc and even a nazgûl would take a few hour to fli between them but saruman certainli look in the stone sinc the orcraid and more of hi secret thought i do not doubt ha been read than he intend a messeng ha been sent to find out what he is do and after what ha happen tonight anoth will come i think and swiftli so saruman will come to the last pinch of the vice that he ha put hi hand in he ha no captiv to send he ha no stone to see with and can not answer the summon sauron will onli believ that he is withhold the captiv and refus to use the stone it will not help saruman to tell the truth to the messeng for isengard may be ruin yet he is still safe in orthanc so whether he will or no he will appear a rebel yet he reject us so as to avoid that veri thing what he will do in such a plight i can not guess he ha power still i think while in orthanc to resist the nine rider he may tri to do so he may tri to trap the nazgûl or at least to slay the thing on which it now ride the air in that case let rohan look to it hors but i can not tell how it will fall out well or ill for us it may be that the counsel of the enemi will be confus or hinder by hi wrath with saruman it may be that he will learn that i wa there and stood upon the stair of orthancwith hobbit at my tail or that an heir of elendil live and stood besid me if wormtongu wa not deceiv by the armour of rohan he would rememb aragorn and the titl that he claim that is what i fear and so we fli – not from danger but into greater danger everi stride of shadowfax bear you nearer to the land of shadow peregrin took pippin made no answer but clutch hi cloak as if a sudden chill had struck him grey land pass under them see now said gandalf the westfold dale are open befor us here we come back to the eastward road the dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the deepingcoomb that way lie aglarond and the glitter cave do not ask me about them ask gimli if you meet again and for the first time you may get an answer longer than you wish you will not see the cave yourself not on thi journey soon they will be far behind i thought you were go to stop at helm deep said pippin where are you go then to mina tirith befor the sea of war surround it oh and how far is that leagu upon leagu answer gandalf thrice as far as the dwell of king théoden and they are more than a hundr mile east from here as the messeng of mordor fli shadowfax must run a longer road which will prove the swifter we shall ride now till daybreak and that is some hour away then even shadowfax must rest in some hollow of the hill at edora i hope sleep if you can you may see the first glimmer of dawn upon the golden roof of the hous of eorl and in two day thenc you shall see the purpl shadow of mount mindolluin and the wall of the tower of denethor white in the morn away now shadowfax run greatheart run as you have never run befor now we are come to the land where you were foal and everi stone you know run now hope is in speed shadowfax toss hi head and cri aloud as if a trumpet had summon him to battl then he sprang forward fire flew from hi feet night rush over him as he fell slowli into sleep pippin had a strang feel he and gandalf were still as stone seat upon the statu of a run hors while the world roll away beneath hi feet with a great nois of wind chapter the tame of sméagol well master were in a fix and no mistak said sam gamge he stood despond with hunch shoulder besid frodo and peer out with pucker eye into the gloom it wa the third even sinc they had fled from the compani as far as they could tell they had almost lost count of the hour dure which they had climb and labour among the barren slope and stone of the emyn muil sometim retrac their step becaus they could find no way forward sometim discov that they had wander in a circl back to where they had been hour befor yet on the whole they had work steadili eastward keep as near as they could find a way to the outer edg of thi strang twist knot of hill but alway they found it outward face sheer high and impass frown over the plain below beyond it tumbl skirt lay livid fester marsh where noth move and not even a bird wa to be seen the hobbit stood now on the brink of a tall cliff bare and bleak it feet wrap in mist and behind them rose the broken highland crown with drift cloud a chill wind blew from the east night wa gather over the shapeless land befor them the sickli green of them wa fade to a sullen brown far away to the right the anduin that had gleam fit in sunbreak dure the day wa now hidden in shadow but their eye did not look beyond the river back to gondor to their friend to the land of men south and east they stare to where at the edg of the oncom night a dark line hung like distant mountain of motionless smoke everi now and again a tini red gleam far away flicker upward on the rim of earth and sky what a fix said sam that the one place in all the land weve ever heard of that we dont want to see ani closer and that the one place were tri to get to and that just where we cant get nohow weve come the wrong way altogeth seemingli we cant get down and if we did get down wed find all that green land a nasti bog ill warrant phew can you smell it he snif at the wind ye i can smell it said frodo but he did not move and hi eye remain fix stare out toward the dark line and the flicker flame mordor he mutter under hi breath if i must go there i wish i could come there quickli and make an end he shudder the wind wa chilli and yet heavi with an odour of cold decay well he said at last withdraw hi eye we can not stay here all night fix or no fix we must find a more shelter spot and camp onc more and perhap anoth day will show us a path or anoth and anoth and anoth mutter sam or mayb no day weve come the wrong way i wonder said frodo it my doom i think to go to that shadow yonder so that a way will be found but will good or evil show it to me what hope we had wa in speed delay play into the enemi handsand here i am delay is it the will of the dark tower that steer us all my choic have prove ill i should have left the compani long befor and come down from the north east of the river and of the emyn muil and so over the hard of battl plain to the pass of mordor but now it isnt possibl for you and me alon to find a way back and the orc are prowl on the east bank everi day that pass is a preciou day lost i am tire sam i dont know what is to be done what food have we got left onli those what dyou call em lemba mr frodo a fair suppli but they are better than naught by a long bite i never thought though when i first set tooth in them that i should ever come to wish for a chang but i do now a bit of plain bread and a mug – aye half a mug – of beer would go down proper ive lug my cookinggear all the way from the last camp and what use ha it been naught to make a fire with for a start and naught to cook not even grass they turn away and went down into a stoni hollow the wester sun wa caught into cloud and night came swiftli they slept as well as they could for the cold turn and turn about in a nook among great jag pinnacl of weather rock at least they were shelter from the easterli wind did you see them again mr frodo ask sam as they sat stiff and chill munch wafer of lemba in the cold grey of earli morn no said frodo ive heard noth and seen noth for two night now nor me said sam grrr those eye did give me a turn but perhap weve shaken him off at last the miser slinker gollum ill give him gollum in hi throat if ever i get my hand on hi neck i hope youll never need to said frodo i dont know how he follow us but it may be that he lost us again as you say in thi dri bleak land we cant leav mani footprint nor much scent even for hi snuffl nose i hope that the way of it said sam i wish we could be rid of him for good so do i said frodo but he not my chief troubl i wish we could get away from these hill i hate them i feel all nake on the east side stuck up here with noth but the dead flat between me and that shadow yonder there an eye in it come on weve got to get down today somehow but that day wore on and when afternoon fade toward even they were still scrambl along the ridg and had found no way of escap sometim in the silenc of that barren countri they fanci that they heard faint sound behind them a stone fall or the imagin step of flap feet on the rock but if they halt and stood still listen they heard no more noth but the wind sigh over the edg of the stone – yet even that remind them of breath softli hiss through sharp teeth all that day the outer ridg of the emyn muil had been bend gradual northward as they struggl on along it brink there now stretch a wide tumbl flat of score and weather rock cut everi now and again by trenchlik gulli that slope steepli down to deep notch in the clifffac to find a path in these cleft which were becom deeper and more frequent frodo and sam were driven to their left well away from the edg and they did not notic that for sever mile they had been go slowli but steadili downhil the clifftop wa sink toward the level of the lowland at last they were brought to a halt the ridg took a sharper bend northward and wa gash by a deeper ravin on the further side it rear up again mani fathom at a singl leap a great grey cliff loom befor them cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke they could go no further forward and must turn now either west or east but west would lead them onli into more labour and delay back toward the heart of the hill east would take them to the outer precipic there noth for it but to scrambl down thi gulli sam said frodo let see what it lead to a nasti drop ill bet said sam the cleft wa longer and deeper than it seem some way down they found a few gnarl and stunt tree the first they had seen for day twist birch for the most part with here and there a firtre mani were dead and gaunt bitten to the core by the eastern wind onc in milder day there must have been a fair thicket in the ravin but now after some fifti yard the tree came to an end though old broken stump straggl on almost to the cliff brink the bottom of the gulli which lay along the edg of a rockfault wa rough with broken stone and slant steepli down when they came at last to the end of it frodo stoop and lean out look he said we must have come down a long way or els the cliff ha sunk it much lower here than it wa and it look easier too sam knelt besid him and peer reluctantli over the edg then he glanc up at the great cliff rise up away on their left easier he grunt well i suppos it alway easier get down than up those as cant fli can jump it would be a big jump still said frodo about well – he stood for a moment measur it with hi eye – about eighteen fathom i should guess not more and that enough said sam ugh how i do hate look down from a height but look better than climb all the same said frodo i think we could climb here and i think we shall have to tri see – the rock is quit differ from what it wa a few mile back it ha slip and crack the outer fall wa inde no longer sheer but slope outward a littl it look like a great rampart or seawal whose foundat had shift so that it cours were all twist and disord leav great fissur and long slant edg that were in place almost as wide as stair and if were go to tri and get down we had better tri at onc it get dark earli i think there a storm come the smoki blur of the mountain in the east wa lost in a deeper black that wa alreadi reach out westward with long arm there wa a distant mutter of thunder born on the rise breez frodo snif the air and look up doubt at the sky he strap hi belt outsid hi cloak and tighten it and settl hi light pack on hi back then he step toward the edg im go to tri it he said veri good said sam gloomili but im go first you said frodo what made you chang your mind about climb i havent chang my mind but it onli sens put the one lowest as is most like to slip i dont want to come down atop of you and knock you off no sens in kill two with one fall befor frodo could stop him he sat down swung hi leg over the brink and twist round scrabbl with hi toe for a foothold it is doubt if he ever did anyth braver in cold blood or more unwis no no sam you old ass said frodo youll kill yourself for certain go over like that without even a look to see what to make for come back he took sam under the armpit and haul him up again now wait a bit and be patient he said then he lay on the ground lean out and look down but the light seem to be fade quickli although the sun had not yet set i think we could manag thi he said present i could at ani rate and you could too if you kept your head and follow me care i dont know how you can be so sure said sam whi you cant see to the bottom in thi light what if you come to a place where there nowher to put your feet or your hand climb back i suppos said frodo easi said object sam better wait till morn and more light no not if i can help it said frodo with a sudden strang vehem i grudg everi hour everi minut im go down to tri it out dont you follow till i come back or call grip the stoni lip of the fall with hi finger he let himself gentli down until when hi arm were almost at full stretch hi toe found a ledg on e step down he said and thi ledg broaden out to the right i could stand there without a hold ill hi word were cut short the hurri dark now gather great speed rush up from the east and swallow the sky there wa a dri split crack of thunder right overhead sear lightn smote down into the hill then came a blast of savag wind and with it mingl with it roar there came a high shrill shriek the hobbit had heard just such a cri far away in the marish as they fled from hobbiton and even there in the wood of the shire it had frozen their blood out here in the wast it terror wa far greater it pierc them with cold blade of horror and despair stop heart and breath sam fell flat on hi face involuntarili frodo loos hi hold and put hi hand over hi head and ear he sway slip and slither downward

the wind seem to blow hi voic back into hi throat but as it pass roar up the gulli and away over the hill a faint answer cri came to hi ear all right all right im here but i cant see frodo wa call with a weak voic he wa not actual veri far away he had slid and not fallen and had come up with a jolt to hi feet on a wider ledg not mani yard lower down fortun the rockfac at thi point lean well back and the wind had press him against the cliff so that he had not toppl over he steadi himself a littl lay hi face against the cold stone feel hi heart pound but either the dark had grown complet or els hi eye had lost their sight all wa black about him he wonder if he had been struck blind he took a deep breath come back come back he heard sam voic out of the black abov i cant he said i cant see i cant find ani hold i cant move yet what can i do mr frodo what can i do shout sam lean out danger far whi could not hi master see it wa dim certainli but not as dark as all that he could see frodo below him a grey forlorn figur splay against the cliff but he wa far out of the reach of ani help hand there wa anoth crack of thunder and then the rain came in a blind sheet mingl with hail it drove against the cliff bitter cold im come down to you shout sam though how he hope to help in that way he could not have said no no wait frodo call back more strongli now i shall be better soon i feel better alreadi wait you cant do anyth without a rope rope cri sam talk wildli to himself in hi excit and relief well if i dont deserv to be hung on the end of one as a warn to numbskul your nowt but a ninnyhamm sam gamge that what the gaffer said to me often enough it be a word of hi rope stop chatter cri frodo now recov enough to feel both amus and annoy never mind your gaffer are you tri to tell yourself youv got some rope in your pocket if so out with it ye mr frodo in my pack and all carri it hundr of mile and id clean forgotten it then get busi and let an end down quickli sam unslung hi pack and rummag in it there inde at the bottom wa a coil of the silkengrey rope made by the folk of lórien he cast an end to hi master the dark seem to lift from frodo eye or els hi sight wa return he could see the grey line as it came dangl down and he thought it had a faint silver sheen now that he had some point in the dark to fix hi eye on he felt less giddi lean hi weight forward he made the end fast round hi waist and then he grasp the line with both hand sam step back and brace hi feet against a stump a yard or two from the edg half haul half scrambl frodo came up and threw himself on the ground thunder growl and rumbl in the distanc and the rain wa still fall heavili the hobbit crawl away back into the gulli but they did not find much shelter there rill of water began to run down soon they grew to a spate that splash and fume on the stone and spout out over the cliff like the gutter of a vast roof i should have been half drown down there or wash clean off said frodo what a piec of luck you had that rope better luck if id thought of it sooner said sam mayb you rememb them put the rope in the boat as we start off in the elvish countri i took a fanci to it and i stow a coil in my pack year ago it seem it may be a help in mani need he said haldir or one of those folk and he spoke right a piti i didnt think of bring anoth length said frodo but i left the compani in such a hurri and confus if onli we had enough we could use it to get down how long is your rope i wonder sam paid it out slowli measur it with hi arm five ten twenti thirti ell more or less he said whod have thought it frodo exclaim ah who would said sam elv are wonder folk it look a bit thin but it tough and soft as milk to the hand pack close too and as light as light wonder folk to be sure thirti ell said frodo consid i believ it would be enough if the storm pass befor nightfal im go to tri it the rain nearli given over alreadi said sam but dont you go do anyth riski in the dim again mr frodo and i havent got over that shriek on the wind yet if you have like a black rider it soundedbut one up in the air if they can fli im think wed best lay up in thi crack till night over and im think that i wont spend a moment longer than i need stuck up on thi edg with the eye of the dark countri look over the marsh said frodo with that he stood up and went down to the bottom of the gulli again he look out clear sky wa grow in the east onc more the skirt of the storm were lift rag and wet and the main battl had pass to spread it great wing over the emyn muil upon which the dark thought of sauron brood for a while thenc it turn smite the vale of anduin with hail and lightn and cast it shadow upon mina tirith with threat of war then lower in the mountain and gather it great spire it roll on slowli over gondor and the skirt of rohan until far away the rider on the plain saw it black tower move behind the sun as they rode into the west but here over the desert and the reek marsh the deep blue sky of even open onc more and a few pallid star appear like small white hole in the canopi abov the crescent moon it good to be abl to see again said frodo breath deep do you know i thought for a bit that i had lost my sight from the lightn or someth els wors i could see noth noth at all until the grey rope came down it seem to shimmer somehow it doe look sort of silver in the dark said sam never notic it befor though i cant rememb as ive ever had it out sinc i first stow it but if your so set on climb mr frodo how are you go to use it thirti ell or say about eighteen fathom that no more than your guess at the height of the cliff frodo thought for a while make it fast to that stump sam he said then i think you shall have your wish thi time and go first ill lower you and you need do no more than use your feet and hand to fend yourself off the rock though if you put your weight on some of the ledg and give me a rest it will help when your down ill follow i feel quit myself again now veri well said sam heavili if it must be let get it over he took up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to the brink then the other end he tie about hi own waist reluctantli he turn and prepar to go over the edg a second time it did not howev turn out half as bad as he had expect the rope seem to give him confid though he shut hi eye more than onc when he look down between hi feet there wa one awkward spot where there wa no ledg and the wall wa sheer and even undercut for a short space there he slip and swung out on the silver line but frodo lower him slowli and steadili and it wa over at last hi chief fear had been that the ropelength would give out while he wa still high up but there wa still a good bight in frodo hand when sam came to the bottom and call up im down hi voic came up clearli from below but frodo could not see him hi grey elvencloak had melt into the twilight frodo took rather more time to follow him he had the rope about hi waist and it wa fast abov and he had shorten it so that it would pull him up befor he reach the ground still he did not want to risk a fall and he had not quit sam faith in thi slender grey line he found two place all the same where he had to trust wholli to it smooth surfac where there wa no hold even for hi strong hobbit finger and the ledg were far apart but at last he too wa down well he cri weve done it weve escap from the emyn muil and now what next i wonder mayb we shall soon be sigh for good hard rock under foot again but sam did not answer he wa stare back up the cliff ninnyhamm he said noodl my beauti rope there it is tie to a stump and were at the bottom just as nice a littl stair for that slink gollum as we could leav better put up a signpost to say which way weve gone i thought it seem a bit too easi if you can think of ani way we could have both use the rope and yet brought it down with us then you can pass on to me ninnyhamm or ani other name your gaffer gave you said frodo climb up and unti it and let yourself down if you want to sam scratch hi head no i cant think how beg your pardon he said but i dont like leav it and that a fact he stroke the rope end and shook it gentli it goe hard part with anyth i brought out of the elfcountri made by galadriel herself too mayb galadriel he murmur nod hi head mourn he look up and gave one last pull to the rope as if in farewel to the complet surpris of both the hobbit it came loos sam fell over and the long grey coil slither silent down on top of him frodo laugh who tie the rope he said a good thing it held as long as it did to think that i trust all my weight to your knot sam did not laugh i may not be much good at climb mr frodo he said in injur tone but i do know someth about rope and about knot it in the famili as you might say whi my granddad and my uncl andi after him him that wa the gaffer eldest brother he had a ropewalk over by tighfield mani a year and i put as fast a hitch over the stump as ani one could have done in the shire or out of it then the rope must have broken – fray on the rockedg i expect said frodo i bet it didnt said sam in an even more injur voic he stoop and examin the end nor it hasnt neither not a strand then im afraid it must have been the knot said frodo sam shook hi head and did not answer he wa pass the rope through hi finger thought have it your own way mr frodo he said at last but i think the rope came off itself – when i call he coil it up and stow it lovingli in hi pack it certainli came said frodo and that the chief thing but now weve got to think of our next move night will be on us soon how beauti the star are and the moon they do cheer the heart dont they said sam look up elvish they are somehow and the moon grow we havent seen him for a night or two in thi cloudi weather he begin to give quit a light ye said frodo but he wont be full for some day i dont think well tri the marsh by the light of half a moon under the first shadow of night they start out on the next stage of their journey after a while sam turn and look back at the way they had come the mouth of the gulli wa a black notch in the dim cliff im glad weve got the rope he said weve set a littl puzzl for that footpad anyhow he can tri hi nasti flappi feet on those ledg they pick their step away from the skirt of the cliff among a wilder of boulder and rough stone wet and slipperi with the heavi rain the ground still fell away sharpli they had not gone veri far when they came upon a great fissur that yawn suddenli black befor their feet it wa not wide but it wa too wide to jump across in the dim light they thought they could hear water gurgl in it depth it curv away on their left northward back toward the hill and so bar their road in that direct at ani rate while dark last we had better tri a way back southward along the line of the cliff i think said sam we might find some nook there or even a cave or someth i suppos so said frodo im tire and i dont think i can scrambl among stone much longer tonight – though i grudg the delay i wish there wa a clear path in front of us then id go on till my leg gave way they did not find the go ani easier at the broken feet of the emyn muil nor did sam find ani nook or hollow to shelter in onli bare stoni slope frown over by the cliff which now rose again higher and more sheer as they went back in the end worn out they just cast themselv on the ground under the lee of a boulder lie not far from the foot of the precipic there for some time they sat huddl mourn togeth in the cold stoni night while sleep crept upon them in spite of all they could do to hold it off the moon now rode high and clear it thin white light lit up the face of the rock and drench the cold frown wall of the cliff turn all the wide loom dark into a chill pale grey score with black shadow well said frodo stand up and draw hi cloak more close round him you sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket ill walk up and down on sentri for a while suddenli he stiffen and stoop he grip sam by the arm what that he whisper look over there on the cliff sam look and breath in sharpli through hi teeth ssss he said that what it is it that gollum snake and adder and to think that i thought that wed puzzl him with our bit of a climb look at him like a nasti crawl spider on a wall down the face of a precipic sheer and almost smooth it seem in the pale moonlight a small black shape wa move with it thin limb splay out mayb it soft cling hand and toe were find crevic and hold that no hobbit could ever have seen or use but it look as if it wa just creep down on sticki pad like some larg prowl thing of insectkind and it wa come down head first as if it wa smell it way now and again it lift it head slowli turn it right back on it long skinni neck and the hobbit caught a glimps of two small pale gleam light it eye that blink at the moon for a moment and then were quickli lid again do you think he can see us said sam i dont know said frodo quietli but i think not it is hard even for friendli eye to see these elvencloak i can not see you in the shadow even at a few pace and ive heard that he doesnt like sun or moon then whi is he come down just here ask sam quietli sam said frodo he can smell us perhap and he can hear as keen as elv i believ i think he ha heard someth now our voic probabl we did a lot of shout away back there and we were talk far too loudli until a minut ago well im sick of him said sam he come onc too often for me and im go to have a word with him if i can i dont suppos we could give him the slip now anyway draw hi grey hood well over hi face sam crept stealthili toward the cliff care whisper frodo come behind dont alarm him he much more danger than he look the black crawl shape wa now threequart of the way down and perhap fifti feet or less abov the cliff foot crouch stonestil in the shadow of a larg boulder the hobbit watch him he seem to have come to a difficult passag or to be troubl about someth they could hear him snuffl and now and again there wa a harsh hiss of breath that sound like a curs he lift hi head and they thought they heard him spit then he move on again now they could hear hi voic creak and whistl ach sss cautiou my preciou more hast less speed we musstnt rissk our neck musst we preciou no preciou – gollum he lift hi head again blink at the moon and quickli shut hi eye we hate it he hiss nassti nassti shiveri light it is – sss – it spi on us preciou – it hurt our eye he wa get lower now and the hiss becam sharper and clearer where iss it where iss it my preciou my preciou it our it is and we want it the thiev the thiev the filthi littl thiev where are they with my preciou curs them we hate them it doesnt sound as if he knew we were here doe

side to side as if he wa listen hi pale eye were half unlid sam restrain himself though hi finger were twitch hi eye fill with anger and disgust were fix on the wretch creatur as he now began to move again still whisper and hiss to himself at last he wa no more than a dozen feet from the ground right abov their head from that point there wa a sheer drop for the cliff wa slightli undercut and even gollum could not find a hold of ani kind he seem to be tri to twist round so as to go leg first when suddenli with a shrill whistl shriek he fell as he did so he curl hi leg and arm up round him like a spider whose descend thread is snap sam wa out of hi hide in a flash and cross the space between him and the cliff foot in a coupl of leap befor gollum could get up he wa on top of him but he found gollum more than he bargain for even taken like that suddenli off hi guard after a fall befor sam could get a hold long leg and arm were wound round him pin hi arm and a cling grip soft but horribl strong wa squeez him like slowli tighten cord clammi finger were feel for hi throat then sharp teeth bit into hi shoulder all he could do wa to butt hi hard round head sideway into the creatur face gollum hiss and spat but he did not let go thing would have gone ill with sam if he had been alon but frodo sprang up and drew sting from it sheath with hi left hand he drew back gollum head by hi thin lank hair stretch hi long neck and forc hi pale venom eye to stare up at the sky let go gollum he said thi is sting you have seen it befor onc upon a time let go or youll feel it thi time ill cut

nice hobbit then sit down said frodo and dont move the hobbit seat themselv besid him one on either side with their back to the stoni wall rest their leg there wa no need for ani arrang by word they knew that they must not sleep for a moment slowli the moon went by shadow fell down from the hill and all grew dark befor them the star grew thick and bright in the sky abov no one stir gollum sat with hi leg drawn up knee under chin flat hand and feet splay on the ground hi eye close but he seem tens as if think or listen frodo look across at sam their eye met and they understood they relax lean their head back and shut their eye or seem to soon the sound of their soft breath could be heard gollum hand twitch a littl hardli percept hi head move to the left and the right and first one eye and then the other open a slit the hobbit made no sign suddenli with startl agil and speed straight off the ground with a jump like a grasshopp or a frog gollum bound forward into the dark but that wa

good tie hi legsor hi arm he seem to use them nearli as much tie one end to hi ankl and keep a grip on the other end he stood over gollum while sam tie the knot the result surpris them both gollum began to scream a thin tear sound veri horribl to hear he writh and tri to get hi mouth to hi ankl and bite the rope he kept on scream at last frodo wa convinc that he realli wa in pain but it could not be from the knot he examin it and found that it wa not too tight inde hardli tight enough sam wa gentler than hi word what the matter with you he said if you will tri to run away you must be tie but we dont wish to hurt you it hurt us it hurt us hiss gollum it freez it bite elv twist it curs them nasti cruel hobbit that whi we tri to escap of cours it is preciou we guess they were cruel

make that i can trust we will swear to do what he want ye yess said gollum still twist and grabbl at hi ankl it hurt us swear said frodo sméagol said gollum suddenli and clearli open hi eye wide and stare at frodo with a strang light sméagol will swear on the preciou frodo drew himself up and again sam wa startl by hi word and hi stern voic on the preciou how dare you he said think one ring to rule them all and in the dark bind them would you commit your promis to that sméagol it will hold you but it is more treacher than you are it may twist your word bewar gollum cower on the preciou on the preciou he repeat and what would you swear ask frodo to be veri veri good said gollum then crawl to frodo feet he grovel befor him whisper hoars a shudder ran over him as if the word shook hi veri bone with fear sméagol will swear never never to let him have it never sméagol will save it but he must swear on the preciou no not on it said frodo look down at him with stern piti all you wish is to see it and touch it if you can though you know it would drive you mad not on it swear by it if you will for you know where it is ye you know sméagol it is befor you for a moment it appear to sam that hi master had grown and gollum had shrunk a tall stern shadow a mighti lord who hid hi bright in grey cloud and at hi feet a littl whine dog yet the two were in some way akin and not alien they could reach one anoth mind gollum rais himself and began paw at frodo fawn at hi knee down down said frodo now speak your promis we promis ye i promis said gollum i will serv the master of the preciou good master good sméagol gollum gollum suddenli he began to weep and bite at hi ankl again take the rope off sam said frodo reluctantli sam obey at onc gollum got up and began pranc about like a whip cur whose master ha pat it from that moment a chang which last for some time came over him he spoke with less hiss and whine and he spoke to hi companion direct not to hi preciou self he would cring and flinch if they step near him or made ani sudden movement and he avoid the touch of their elvencloak but he wa friendli and inde piti anxiou to pleas he would cackl with laughter and caper if ani jest wa made or even if frodo spoke kindli to him and weep if frodo rebuk him sam said littl to him of ani sort he suspect him more deepli than ever and if possibl like the new gollum the sméagol less than the old well gollum or whatev it is were to call you he said now for it the moon gone and the night go wed better start ye ye agre gollum skip about off we go there onli one way across between the northend and the southend i found it i did orc dont use it orc dont know it orc dont cross the marsh they go round for mile and mile veri lucki you came thi way veri lucki you found sméagol ye follow sméagol he took a few step away and look back inquiringli like a dog invit them for a walk wait a bit gollum cri sam not too far ahead now im go to be at your tail and ive got the rope handi no no said gollum sméagol promis in the deep of night under hard clear star they set off gollum led them back northward for a while along the way they had come then he slant to the right away from the steep edg of the emyn muil down the broken stoni slope toward the vast fen below they fade swiftli and softli into the dark over all the leagu of wast befor the gate of mordor there wa a black silenc chapter the passag of the marsh gollum move quickli with hi head and neck thrust forward often use hi hand as well as hi feet frodo and sam were hard put to it to keep up with him but he seem no longer to have ani thought of escap and if they fell behind he would turn and wait for them after a time he brought them to the brink of the narrow gulli that they had struck befor but they were now further from the hill here it is he cri there is a way down insid ye now we follow it – out out away over there he point south and east toward the marsh the reek of them came to their nostril heavi and foul even in the cool night air gollum cast up and down along the brink and at length he call to them here we can get down here sméagol went thi way onc i went thi way hide from orc he led the way and follow him the hobbit climb down into the gloom it wa not difficult for the rift wa at thi point onli some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across there wa run water at the bottom it wa in fact the bed of one of the mani small river that trickl down from the hill to feed the stagnant pool and mire beyond gollum turn to the right southward more or less and splash along with hi feet in the shallow stoni stream he seem greatli delight to feel the water and chuckl to himself sometim even croak in a sort of song the cold hard land they bite our hand they gnaw our feet the rock and stone are like old bone all bare of meat but stream and pool is wet and cool so nice for feet and now we wish ha ha what doe we wish he said look sidelong at the hobbit well tell you he croak he guess it long ago baggin guess it a glint came into hi eye and sam catch the gleam in the dark thought it far from pleasant aliv without breath as cold as death never thirst ever drink clad in mail never clink drown on dri land think an island is a mountain think a fountain is a puff of air so sleek so fair what a joy to meet we onli wish to catch a fish so juicysweet these word onli made more press to sam mind a problem that had been troubl him from the moment when he understood that hir master wa go to adopt gollum as a guid the problem of food it did not occur to him that hi master might also have thought of it hut he suppos gollum had inde how had gollum kept himself in all hi lone wander not too well thought sam he look fair famish not too dainti to tri what hobbit tast like if there aint no fish ill wager – suppos as he could catch us nap well he wont not sam gamge for one they stumbl along in the dark wind gulli for a long time or so it seem to the tire feet of frodo and sam the gulli turn eastward and as they went on it broaden and got gradual shallow at last the sky abov grew faint with the first grey of morn gollum had shown no sign of tire but now he look up and halt day is near he whisper as if day wa someth that might overhear him and spring on him sméagol will stay here i will stay here and the yellow face wont see me we should be glad to see the sun said frodo but we will stay here we are too tire to go ani further at present you are not wise to be glad of the yellow face said gollum it show you up nice sensibl hobbit stay with sméagol orc and nasti thing are about they can see a long way stay and hide with me the three of them settl down to rest at the foot of the rocki wall of the gulli it wa not much more than a tall man height now and at it base there were wide flat shelv of dri stone the water ran in a channel on the other side frodo and sam sat on one of the flat rest their back gollum paddl and scrabbl in the stream we must take a littl food said frodo are you hungri sméagol we have veri littl to share but we will spare you what we can at the word hungri a greenish light wa kindl in gollum pale eye and they seem to protrud further than ever from hi thin sickli face for a moment he relaps into hi old gollummann we are famissh ye famissh we are preciou he said what is it they eat have they nice fissh hi tongu loll out between hi sharp yellow teeth lick hi colourless lip no we have got no fish said frodo we have onli got thi – he held up a wafer of lemba – and water if the water here is fit to drink yess yess nice water said gollum drink it drink it while we can but what is it theyv got preciou is it crunchabl is it tasti frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and hand it to him on it leafwrap gollum snif at the leaf and hi face chang a spasm of disgust came over it and a hint of hi old malic sméagol smell it he said leav out of the elfcountri gah they stink he climb in those tree and he couldnt wash the smell off hi hand my nice hand drop the leaf he took a corner of the lemba and nibbl it he spat and a fit of cough shook him ach no he splutter you tri to choke poor sméagol dust and ash he cant eat that he must starv but

know how long we shall take to – to finish said frodo we were miser delay in the hill but samwis gamge my dear hobbit – inde sam my dearest hobbit friend of friend – i do not think we need give thought to what come after that to do the job as you put it – what hope is there that we ever shall and if we do who know what will come of that if the one goe into the fire and we are at hand i ask you sam are we ever like to need bread again i think not if we can nurs our limb to bring us to mount doom that is all we can do more than i can i begin to feel sam nod silent he took hi master hand and bent over it he did not kiss it though hi tear fell on it then he turn away drew hi sleev over hi nose and got up and stamp about tri to whistl and say between the effort where that drat creatur it wa actual not long befor gollum return but he came so quietli that they did not hear him till he stood befor them hi finger and face were soil with black mud he wa still chew and slaver what he wa chew they did not ask or like to think worm or beetl or someth slimi out of hole thought sam brr the nasti creatur the poor wretch gollum said noth to them until he had drunk deepli and wash himself in the stream then he came up to them lick hi lip better now he said are we rest readi to go on nice hobbit they sleep beauti trust sméagol now veri veri good the next stage of their journey wa much the same as the last as they went on the gulli becam ever shallow and the slope of it floor more gradual it bottom wa less stoni and more earthi and slowli it side dwindl to mere bank it began to wind and wander that night drew to it end but cloud were now over moon and star and they knew of the come of day onli by the slow spread of the thin grey light in a chill hour they came to the end of the watercours the bank becam mossgrown mound over the last shelf of rot stone the stream gurgl and fell down into a brown bog and wa lost dri reed hiss and rattl though they could feel no wind on either side and in front wide fen and mire now lay stretch away southward and eastward into the dim halflight mist curl and smoke from dark and noisom pool the reek of them hung stifl in the still air far away now almost due south the mountainwal of mordor loom like a black bar of rug cloud float abov a danger fogbound sea the hobbit were now wholli in the hand of gollum they did now know and could not guess in that misti light that they were in fact onli just within the northern border of the marsh the main expans of which lay south of them they could if they had known the land with some delay have retrac their step a littl and then turn east have come round over hard road to the bare plain of dagorlad the field of the ancient battl befor the gate of mordor not that there wa great hope in such a cours on that stoni plain there wa no cover and across it ran the highway of the orc and the soldier of the enemi not even the cloak of lórien would have conceal them there how do we shape our cours now sméagol ask frodo must we cross these evilsmel fen no need no need at all said gollum not if hobbit want to reach the dark mountain and go to see him veri quick back a littl and round a littl – hi skinni arm wave north and east – and you can come on hard cold road to the veri gate of hi countri lot of hi peopl will be there look out for guest veri pleas to take them straight to him o ye hi eye watch that way all the time it caught sméagol there long ago gollum shudder but sméagol ha use hi eye sinc then ye ye ive use eye and feet and nose sinc then i know other way more difficult not so quick but better if we dont want him to see follow sméagol he can take you through the marsh through the mist nice thick mist follow sméagol veri care and you may go a long way quit a long way befor he catch you ye perhap it wa alreadi day a windless and sullen morn and the marshreek lay in heavi bank no sun pierc the low cloud sky and gollum seem anxiou to continu the journey at onc so after a brief rest they set out again and were soon lost in a shadowi silent world cut off from all view of the land about either the hill that they had left or the mountain that they sought they went slowli in singl file gollum sam frodo frodo seem the most weari of the three and slow though they went he often lag the hobbit soon found that what had look like one vast fen wa realli an endless network of pool and soft mire and wind halfstrangl watercours among these a cun eye and foot could thread a wander path gollum certainli had that cun and need all of it hi head on it long neck wa ever turn thi way and that while he snif and mutter all the time to himself sometim he would hold up hi hand and halt them while he went forward a littl crouch test the ground with finger or toe or mere listen with one ear press to the earth it wa dreari and wearisom cold clammi winter still held sway in thi forsaken countri the onli green wa the scum of livid weed on the dark greasi surfac of the sullen water dead grass and rot reed loom up in the mist like rag shadow of longforgotten summer as the day wore on the light increas a littl and the mist lift grow thinner and more transpar far abov the rot and vapour of the world the sun wa ride high and golden now in a seren countri with floor of dazzl foam but onli a pass ghost of her could they see below blear pale give no colour and no warmth but even at thi faint remind of her presenc gollum scowl and flinch he halt their journey and they rest squat like littl hunt anim in the border of a great brown reedthicket there wa a deep silenc onli scrape on it surfac by the faint quiver of empti seedplum and broken grassblad trembl in small airmov that they could not feel not a bird said sam mourn no no bird said gollum nice bird he lick hi teeth no bird here there are snakes worms thing in the pool lot of thing lot of nasti thing no bird he end sadli sam look at him with distast so pass the third day of their journey with gollum befor the shadow of even were long in happier land they went on again alway on and on with onli brief halt these they made not so much for rest as to help gollum for now even he had to go forward with great care and he wa sometim at a loss for a while they had come to the veri midst of the dead marsh and it wa dark they walk slowli stoop keep close in line follow attent everi move that gollum made the fen grew more wet open into wide stagnant mere among which it grew more and more difficult to find the firmer place where feet could tread without sink into gurgl mud the travel were light or mayb none of them would ever have found a way through present it grew altogeth dark the air itself seem black and heavi to breath when light appear sam rub hi eye he thought hi head wa go queer he first saw one with the corner of hi left eye a wisp of pale sheen that fade away but other appear soon after some like dimli shine smoke some like misti flame flicker slowli abov unseen candl here and there they twist like ghostli sheet unfurl by hidden hand but neither of hi companion spoke a word at last sam could bear it no longer what all thi gollum he said in a whisper these light theyr all round us now are we trap who are they gollum look up a dark water wa befor him and he wa crawl on the ground thi way and that doubt of the way ye they are all round us he whisper the tricksi light candl of corps ye ye dont you heed them dont look dont follow them where the master sam look back and found that frodo had lag again he could not see him he went some pace back into the dark not dare to move far or to call in more than a hoars whisper suddenli he stumbl against frodo who wa stand lost in thought look at the pale light hi hand hung stiff at hi side water and slime were drip from them come mr frodo said sam dont look at them gollum say we mustnt let keep up with him and get out of thi curs place as quick as we can – if we can all right said frodo as if return out of a dream im come go on hurri forward again sam trip catch hi foot in some old root or tussock he fell and came heavili on hi hand which sank deep into sticki ooz so that hi face wa brought close to the surfac of the dark mere there wa a faint hiss a noisom smell went up the light flicker and danc and swirl for a moment the water below him look like some window glaze with grimi glass through which he wa peer wrench hi hand out of the bog he sprang back with a cri there are dead thing dead face in the water he said with horror dead face gollum laugh the dead marsh ye ye that is their name he cackl you should not look in when the candl are lit who are they what are they ask sam shudder turn to frodo who wa now behind him i dont know said frodo in a dreamlik voic but i have seen them too in the pool when the candl were lit they lie in all the pool pale face deep deep under the dark water i saw them grim face and evil and nobl face and sad mani face proud and fair and weed in their silver hair but all foul all rot all dead a fell light is in them frodo hid hi eye in hi hand i know not who they are but i thought i saw there men and elv and orc besid them ye ye said gollum all dead all rotten elv and men and orc the dead marsh there wa a great battl long ago ye so they told him when sméagol wa young when i wa young befor the preciou came it wa a great battl tall men with long sword and terribl elv and orcs shriek they fought on the plain for day and month at the black gate but the marsh have grown sinc then swallow up the grave alway creep creep but that is an age and more ago said sam the dead cant be realli there is it some devilri hatch in the dark land who know sméagol doesnt know answer gollum you can not reach them you can not touch them we tri onc ye preciou i tri onc but you can not reach them onli shape to see perhap not to touch no preciou all dead sam look darkli at him and shudder again think that he guess whi sméagol had tri to touch them well i dont want to see them he said never again cant we get on and get away ye ye said gollum but slowli veri slowli veri care or hobbit go down to join the dead one and light littl candl follow sméagol dont look at light he crawl away to the right seek for a path round the mere they came close behind stoop often use their hand even as he did three preciou littl gollum in a row we shall be if thi goe on much longer thought sam at last they came to the end of the black mere and they cross it peril crawl or hop from one treacher island tussock to anoth often they flounder step or fall handsfirst into water as noisom as a cesspool till they were slime and foul almost up to their neck and stank in one anoth nostril it wa late in the night when at length they reach firmer ground again gollum hiss and whisper to himself but it appear that he wa pleas in some mysteri way by some blend sens of feel and smell and uncanni memori for shape in the dark he seem to know just where he wa again and to be sure of hi road ahead now on we go he said nice hobbit brave hobbit veri veri weari of cours so we are my preciou all of us but we must take master away from the wick light ye ye we must with these word he start off again almost at a trot down what appear to be a long lane between high reed and they stumbl after him as quickli as they could but in a littl while he stop suddenli and snif the air doubt hiss as if he wa troubl or displeas again what is it growl sam misinterpret the sign what the need to sniff the stink nearli knock me down with my nose held you stink and master stink the whole place stink ye ye and sam stink answer gollum poor sméagol smell it but good sméagol bear it help nice master but that no matter the air move chang is come sméagol wonder he not happi he went on again but hi uneasi grew and everi now and again he stood up to hi full height crane hi neck eastward and southward for some time the hobbit could not hear or feel what wa troubl him then suddenli all three halt stiffen and listen to frodo and sam it seem that they heard far away a long wail cri high and thin and cruel they shiver at the same moment the stir of the air becam percept to them and it grew veri cold as they stood strain their ear they heard a nois like a wind come in the distanc the misti light waver dim and went out gollum would not move he stood shake and gibber to himself until with a rush the wind came upon them hiss and snarl over the marsh the night becam less dark light enough for them to see or half see shapeless drift of fog curl and twist as it roll over them and pass them look up they saw the cloud break and shred and then high in the south the moon glimmer out ride in the fli wrack for a moment the sight of it gladden the heart of the hobbit but gollum cower down mutter curs on the white face then frodo and sam stare at the sky breath deepli of the fresher air saw it come a small cloud fli from the accurs hill a black shadow loos from mordor a vast shape wing and omin it scud across the moon and with a deadli cri went away westward outrun the wind in it fell speed they fell forward grovel heedlessli on the cold earth but the shadow of horror wheel and return pass lower now right abov them sweep the fenreek with it ghastli wing and then it wa gone fli back to mordor with the speed of the wrath of sauron and behind it the wind roar away leav the dead marsh bare and bleak the nake wast as far as the eye could pierc even to the distant menac of the mountain wa dappl with the fit moonlight frodo and sam got up rub their eye like children waken from an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world but gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stun they rous him with difficulti and for some time he would not lift hi face but knelt forward on hi elbow cover the back of hi head with hi larg flat hand wraith he wail wraith on wing the preciou is their master they see everyth everyth noth can hide from them curs the white face and they tell him everyth he see he know ach gollum gollum gollum it wa not until the moon had sunk wester far beyond tol brandir that he would get up or make a move from that time on sam thought that he sens a chang in gollum again he wa more fawn and wouldb friendli but sam surpris some strang look in hi eye at time especi toward frodo and he went back more and more into hi old manner of speak and sam had anoth grow anxieti frodo seem to be weari weari to the point of exhaust he said noth inde he hardli spoke at all and he did not complain but he walk like one who carri a load the weight of which is ever increas and he drag along slower and slower so that sam had often to beg gollum to wait and not to leav their master behind in fact with everi step toward the gate of mordor frodo felt the ring on it chain about hi neck grow more burdensom he wa now begin to feel it as an actual weight drag him earthward but far more he wa troubl by the eye so he call it to himself it wa that more than the drag of the ring that made him cower and stoop as he walk the eye that horribl grow sens of a hostil will that strove with great power to pierc all shadow of cloud and earth and flesh and to see you to pin you under it deadli gaze nake immov so thin so frail and thin the veil were becom that still ward it off frodo knew just where the present habit and heart of that will now wa as certainli as a man can tell the direct of the sun with hi eye shut he wa face it and it potenc beat upon hi brow gollum probabl felt someth of the same sort but what went on in hi wretch heart between the pressur of the eye and the lust of the ring that wa so near and hi grovel promis made half in the fear of cold iron the hobbit did not guess frodo gave no thought to it sam mind wa occupi mostli with hi master hardli notic the dark cloud that had fallen on hi own heart he put frodo in front of him now and kept a watch eye on everi movement of hi support him if he stumbl and tri to encourag him with clumsi word when day came at last the hobbit were surpris to see how much closer the omin mountain had alreadi drawn the air wa now clearer and colder and though still far off the wall of mordor were no longer a cloudi menac on the edg of sight but as grim black tower they frown across a dismal wast the marsh were at an end die away into dead peat and wide flat of dri crack mud the land ahead rose in long shallow slope barren and pitiless toward the desert that lay at sauron gate while the grey light last they cower under a black stone like worm shrink lest the wing terror should pass and spi them with it cruel eye the remaind of that journey wa a shadow of grow fear in which memori could find noth to rest upon for two more night they struggl on through the weari pathless land the air as it seem to them grew harsh and fill with a bitter reek that caught their breath and parch their mouth at last on the fifth morn sinc they took the road with gollum they halt onc more befor them dark in the dawn the great mountain reach up to roof of smoke and cloud out from their feet were flung huge buttress and broken hill that were now at the nearest scarc a dozen mile away frodo look round in horror dread as the dead marsh had been and the arid moor of the nomanland more loathsom far wa the countri that the crawl day now slowli unveil to hi shrink eye even to the mere of dead face some haggard phantom of green spring would come but here neither spring nor summer would ever come again here noth live not even the leprou growth that feed on rotten the gasp pool were choke with ash and crawl mud sickli white and grey as if the mountain had vomit the filth of their entrail upon the land about high mound of crush and powder rock great cone of earth fireblast and poisonstain stood like an obscen graveyard in endless row slowli reveal in the reluct light they had come to the desol that lay befor mordor the last monument to the dark labour of it slave that should endur when all their purpos were made void a land defil diseas beyond all heal – unless the great sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion i feel sick said sam frodo did not speak for a while they stood there like men on the edg of a sleep where nightmar lurk hold it off though they know that they can onli come to morn through the shadow the light broaden and harden the gasp pit and poison mound grew hideous clear the sun wa up walk among cloud and long flag of smoke but even the sunlight wa defil the hobbit had no welcom for that light unfriendli it seem reveal them in their helpless – littl squeak ghost that wander among the ashheap of the dark lord too weari to go further they sought for some place where they could rest for a while they sat without speak under the shadow of a mound of slag but foul fume leak out of it catch their throat and choke them gollum wa the first to get up splutter and curs he rose and without a word or a glanc at the hobbit he crawl away on all four frodo and sam crawl after him until they came to a wide almost circular pit highbank upon the west it wa cold and dead and a foul sump of oili manycolour ooz lay at it bottom in thi evil hole they cower hope in it shadow to escap the attent of the eye the day pass slowli a great thirst troubl them but they drank onli a few drop from their bottleslast fill in the gulli which now as they look back in thought seem to them a place of peac and beauti the hobbit took it in turn to watch at first tire as they were neither of them could sleep at all but as the sun far away wa climb down into slow move cloud sam doze it wa frodo turn to bc on guard he lay back on the slope of the pit but that did not eas the sens of burden that wa on him he look up at the smokestreak sky and saw strang phantom dark ride shape and face out of the past he lost count of time hover between sleep and wake until forget came over him suddenli sam woke up think that he heard hi master call it wa even frodo could not have call for he had fallen asleep and had slid down nearli to the bottom of the pit gollum wa by him for a moment sam thought that he wa tri to rous frodo then he saw that it wa not so gollum wa talk to himself sméagol wa hold a debat with some other thought that use the same voic but made it squeak and hiss a pale light and a green light altern in hi eye as he spoke sméagol promis said the first thought ye ye my preciou came the answer we promis to save our preciou not to let him have it – never but it go to him ye nearer everi step what the hobbit go to do with it we wonder ye we wonder i dont know i cant help it master got it sméagol promis to help the master ye ye to help the master the master of the preciou but if we wa master then we could help ourself ye and still keep promis but sméagol said

a last effort not now not yet we want it but – and here there wa a long paus as if a new thought had waken not yet eh perhap not she might help she might ye no no not that way wail sméagol ye we want it we want it each time that the second thought spoke gollum long hand crept out slowli paw toward frodo and then wa drawn back with a jerk as sméagol spoke again final both arm with long finger flex and twitch claw toward hi neck sam had lain still fascin by thi debat but watch everi move that gollum made from under hi halfclos eyelid to hi simpl mind ordinari hunger the desir to eat hobbit had seem the chief danger in gollum he realiz now that it wa not so gollum wa feel the terribl call of the ring the dark lord wa he of cours but sam wonder who she wa one of the nasti friend the littl wretch had made in hi wander he suppos then he forgot the point for thing had plainli gone far enough and were get danger a great heavi wa in all hi limb but he rous himself with an effort and sat up someth warn him to be care and not to reveal that he had overheard the debat he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn what the time he said sleepili gollum sent out a long hiss through hi teeth he stood up for a moment tens and menac and then he collaps fall forward on to all four and crawl up the bank of the pit nice hobbit nice sam he said sleepi head ye sleepi head leav good sméagol to watch but it even dusk is creep time to go high time thought sam and time we part too yet it cross hi mind to wonder if inde gollum wa not now as danger turn loos as kept with them curs him i wish he wa choke he mutter he stumbl down the bank and rous hi master strang enough frodo felt refresh he had been dream the dark shadow had pass and a fair vision had visit him in thi land of diseas noth remain of it in hi memori yet becaus of it he felt glad and lighter of heart hi burden wa less heavi on him gollum welcom him with doglik delight he chuckl and chatter crack hi long finger and paw at frodo knee frodo smile at him come he said you have guid us well and faith thi is the last stage bring us to the gate and then i will not ask you to go further bring us to the gate and you may go where you wish – onli not to our enemi to the gate eh gollum squeak seem surpris and frighten to the gate master say ye he say so and good sméagol doe what he ask o ye but when we get closer well see perhap well see then it wont look nice at all o no o no go on with you said sam let get it over in the fall dusk they scrambl out of the pit and slowli thread their way through the dead land they had not gone far befor they felt onc more the fear that had fallen on them when the wing shape swept over the marsh they halt cower on the evilsmel ground but they saw noth in the gloomi even sky abov and soon the menac pass high overhead go mayb on some swift errand from baraddûr after a while gollum got up and crept forward again mutter and shake about an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time but it now seem more remot as if it were pass far abov the cloud rush with terribl speed into the west gollum howev wa helpless with terror and wa convinc that they were be hunt that their approach wa known three time he whimper three time is a threat they feel us here they feel the preciou the preciou is their master we can not go ani further thi way no it no use no use plead and kind word were no longer of ani avail it wa not until frodo command him angrili and laid a hand on hi swordhilt that gollum would get up again then at last he rose with a snarl and went befor them like a beaten dog so they stumbl on through the weari end of the night and until the come of anoth day of fear they walk in silenc with bow head see noth and hear noth but the wind hiss in their ear chapter the black gate is close befor the next day dawn their journey to mordor wa over the marsh and the desert were behind them befor them darkl against a pallid sky the great mountain rear their threaten head upon the west of mordor march the gloomi rang of ephel dúath the mountain of shadow and upon the north the broken peak and barren ridg of ere lithui grey as ash but as these rang approach one anoth be inde but part of one great wall about the mourn plain of lithlad and of gorgoroth and the bitter inland sea of núrnen amidmost they swung out long arm northward and between these arm there wa a deep defil thi wa cirith gorgor the haunt pass the entranc to the land of the enemi high cliff lower upon either side and thrust forward from it mouth were two sheer hill blackbon and bare upon them stood the teeth of mordor two tower strong and tall in day long past they were built by the men of gondor in their pride and power after the overthrow of sauron and hi flight lest he should seek to return to hi old realm but the strength of gondor fail and men slept and for long year the tower stood empti then sauron return now the watchtow which had fallen into decay were repair and fill with arm and garrison with ceaseless vigil stonyfac they were with dark windowhol stare north and east and west and each window wa full of sleepless eye across the mouth of the pass from cliff to cliff the dark lord had built a rampart of stone in it there wa a singl gate of iron and upon it battlement sentinel pace unceasingli beneath the hill on either side the rock wa bore into a hundr cave and maggothol there a host of orc lurk readi at a signal to issu forth like black ant go to war none could pass the teeth of mordor and not feel their bite unless they were summon by sauron or knew the secret password that would open the morannon the black gate of hi land the two hobbit gaze at the tower and the wall in despair even from a distanc they could see in the dim light the movement of the black guard upon the wall and the patrol befor the gate they lay now peer over the edg of a rocki hollow beneath the outstretch shadow of the northmost buttress of ephel dúath wing the heavi air in a straight flight a crow mayb would have flown but a furlong from their hidingplac to the black summit of the nearer tower a faint smoke curl abov it as if fire smoulder in the hill beneath day came and the fallow sun blink over the lifeless ridg of ere lithui then suddenli the cri of brazenthro trumpet wa heard from the watchtow they blare and far away from hidden hold and outpost in the hill came answer call and further still remot but deep and omin there echo in the hollow land beyond the mighti horn and drum of baraddûr anoth dread day of fear and toil had come to mordor and the nightguard were summon to their dungeon and deep hall and the dayguard eviley and fell were march to their post steel gleam dimli on the battlement well here we are said sam here the gate and it look to me as if

filthi haggard and pinch with weari but he cower no longer and hi eye were clear i said so becaus i purpos to enter mordor and i know no other way therefor i shall go thi way i do not ask anyon to go with me no no master wail gollum paw at him and seem in great distress no use that way no use dont take the preciou to him hell eat us all if he get it eat all the world keep it nice master and be kind to sméagol dont let him have it or go away go to nice place and give it back to littl sméagol ye ye master give it back eh sméagol will keep it safe he will do lot of good especi to nice hobbit hobbit go home dont go to the gate i am command to go to the land of mordor and therefor i shall go said frodo if there is onli one way then i must take it what come after must come sam said noth the look on frodo face wa enough for him he knew that word of hi were useless and after all he never had ani real hope in the affair from the begin but be a cheer hobbit he had not need hope as long as despair could be postpon now they were come to the bitter end but he had stuck to hi master all the way that wa what he had chiefli come for and he would still stick to him hi master would not go to mordor alon sam would go with himand at ani rate they would get rid of gollum gollum howev did not intend to be got rid of yet he knelt at frodo feet wring hi hand and squeak not thi way master he plead there is anoth way o ye inde there is anoth way darker more difficult to find more secret but sméagol know it let sméagol show you anoth way said frodo doubt look down at gollum with search eye yess yess inde there wa anoth way sméagol found it let go and see if it still there you have not spoken of thi befor no master did not ask master did not say what he meant to do he doe not tell poor sméagol he say sméagol take me to the gate – and then good bye sméagol can run away and be good but now he say i purpos to enter mordor thi way so sméagol is veri afraid he doe not want to lose nice master and he promis master made him promis to save the preciou but master is go to take it to him straight to the black hand if master will go thi way so sméagol must save them both and he think of anoth way that there wa onc upon a time nice master sméagol veri good alway help sam frown if he could have bore hole in gollum with hi eye he would have done hi mind wa full of doubt to all appear gollum wa genuin distress and anxiou to help frodo but sam rememb the overheard debat found it hard to believ that the long submerg sméagol had come out on top that voic at ani rate had not had the last word in the debat sam guess wa that the sméagol and gollum halv or what in hi own mind he call slinker and stinker had made a truce and a temporari allianc neither want the enemi to get the ring both wish to keep frodo from captur and under their eye as long as possibl – at ani rate as long as stinker still had a chanc of lay hand on hi preciou whether there realli wa anoth way into mordor sam doubt and it a good thing neither half of the old villain dont know what master mean to do he thought if he knew that mr frodo is tri to put an end to hi preciou for good and all there be troubl pretti quick i bet anyhow old stinker is so frighten of the enemi – and he under order of some kind from him or wa – that hed give us away rather than be caught help us and rather than let hi preciou be melt mayb at least that my idea and i hope the master will think it out care he as wise as ani but he softheart that what he is it beyond ani gamge to guess what hell do next frodo did not answer gollum at onc while these doubt were pass through sam slow but shrewd mind he stood gaze out toward the dark cliff of cirith gorgor the hollow in which they had taken refug wa delv in the side of a low hill at some littl height abov a long trenchlik valley that lay between it and the outer buttress of the mountain in the midst of the valley stood the black foundat of the western watchtow by morninglight the road that converg upon the gate of mordor could now be clearli seen pale and dusti one wind back northward anoth dwindl eastward into the mist that clung about the feet of ere lithui and a third that ran toward him as it bent sharpli round the tower it enter a narrow defil and pass not far below the hollow where he stood westward to hi right it turn skirt the shoulder of the mountain and went off southward into the deep shadow that mantl all the western side of ephel dúath beyond hi sight it journey on into the narrow land between the mountain and the great river as he gaze frodo becam awar that there wa a great stir and movement on the plain it seem as if whole armi were on the march though for the most part they were hidden by the reek and fume drift from the fen and wast beyond but here and there he caught the gleam of spear and helmet and over the level besid the road horsemen could be seen ride in mani compani he rememb hi vision from afar upon amon hen so few day befor though now it seem mani year ago then he knew that the hope that had for one wild moment stir in hi heart wa vain the trumpet had not rung in challeng but in greet thi wa no assault upon the dark lord by the men of gondor risen like aveng ghost from the grave of valour long pass away these were men of other race out of the wide eastland gather to the summon of their overlord armi that had encamp befor hi gate by night and now march in to swell hi mount power as if suddenli made fulli awar of the peril of their posit alon in the grow light of day so near to thi vast menac frodo quickli drew hi frail grey hood close upon hi head and step down into the dell then he turn to gollum sméagol he said i will trust you onc more inde it seem that i must do so and that it is my fate to receiv help from you where i least look for it and your fate to help me whom you long pursu with evil purpos so far you have deserv well of me and have kept your promis truli truli i say and mean he ad with a glanc at sam for twice now we have been in your power and you have done no harm to us nor have you tri to take from me what you onc sought may the third time prove the best but i warn you sméagol you are in danger ye ye master said gollum dread danger sméagol bone shake to think of it but he doesnt run away he must help nice master i did not mean the danger that we all share said frodo i mean a danger to yourself alon you swore a promis by what you call the preciou rememb that it will hold you to it but it will seek a way to twist it to your own undo alreadi you are be twist you reveal yourself to me just now foolishli give it back to sméagol you said do not say that again do not let that thought grow in you you will never get it back but the desir of it may betray you to a bitter end you will never get it back in the last need sméagol i should put on the preciou and the preciou master you long ago if i wear it were to command you you would obey even if it were to leap from a precipic or to cast yourself into the fire and such would be my command so have a care sméagol sam look at hi master with approv but also with surpris there wa a look in hi face and a tone in hi voic that he had not known befor it had alway been a notion of hi that the kind of dear mr frodo wa of such a high degre that it must impli a fair measur of blind of cours he also firmli held the incompat belief that mr frodo wa the wisest person in the world with the possibl except of old mr bilbo and of gandalf gollum in hi own way and with much more excus as hi acquaint wa much briefer may have made a similar mistak confus kind and blind at ani rate thi speech abash and terrifi him he grovel on the ground and could speak no clear word but nice master frodo wait patient for a while then he spoke again less sternli come now gollum or sméagol if you wish tell me of thi other way and show me if you can what hope there is in it enough to justifi me in turn asid from my plain path i am in hast but gollum wa in a pitiabl state and frodo threat had quit unnerv him it wa not easi to get ani clear account out of him amid hi mumbl and squeak and the frequent interrupt in which he crawl on the floor and beg them both to be kind to poor littl sméagol after a while he grew a littl calmer and frodo gather bit by bit that if a travel follow the road that turn west of ephel dúath he would come in time to a cross in a circl of dark tree on the right a road went down to osgiliath and the bridg of the anduin in the middl the road went on southward on on on said gollum we never went that way but they say it goe a hundr leagu until you can see the great water that is never still there are lot of fish there and big bird eat fish nice bird but we never went there ala no we never had a chanc and further still there are more land they say but the yellow face is veri hot there and there are seldom ani cloud and the men are fierc and have dark face we do not want to see that land no said frodo but do not wander from your road what of the third turn o ye o ye there is a third way said gollum that is the road to the left at onc it begin to climb up up wind and climb back toward the tall shadow when it turn round the black rock youll see it suddenli youll see it abov you and youll want to hide see it see it what will you see the old fortress veri old veri horribl now we use to hear tale from the south when sméagol wa young long ago o ye we use to tell lot of tale in the even sit by the bank of the great river in the willowland when the river wa younger too gollum gollum he began to weep and mutter the hobbit wait patient tale out of the south gollum went on again about the tall men with the shine eye and their hous like hill of stone and the silver crown of their king and hi white tree wonder tale they built veri tall tower and one they rais wa silverwhit and in it there wa a stone like the moon and round it were great white wall o ye there were mani tale about the tower of the moon that would be mina ithil that isildur the son of elendil built said frodo it wa isildur who cut off the finger of the enemi ye he ha onli four on the black hand but they are enough said gollum shudder and he hate isildur citi what doe he not hate said frodo but what ha the tower of the moon to do with us well master there it wa and there it is the tall tower and the white hous and the wall but not nice now not beauti he conquer it long ago it is a veri terribl place now travel shiver when they see it they creep out of sight they avoid it shadow but master will have to go that way that is the onli other way for the mountain are lower there and the old road goe up and up until it reach a dark pass at the top and then it goe down down again – to gorgoroth hi voic sank to a whisper and he shudder but how will that help us ask sam sure the enemi know all about hi own mountain and that road will be guard as close as thi the tower isnt empti is it o no not empti whisper gollum it seem empti but it isnt o no veri dread thing live there orc ye alway orc but wors thing wors thing live there too the road climb right under the shadow of the wall and pass the gate noth move on the road that they dont know about the thing insid know the silent watcher so that your advic is it said sam that we should go anoth long march south to find ourselv in the same fix or a wors one when we get there if we ever do no no inde said gollum hobbit must see must tri to understand he doe not expect attack that way hi eye is all round but it attend more to some place than to other he cant see everyth all at onc not yet you see he ha conquer all the countri west of the shadowi mountain down to the river and he hold the bridg now he think no one can come to the moontow without fight big battl at the bridg or get lot of boat which they can not hide and he will know about you seem to know a lot about what he do and think said sam have you been talk to him late or just hobnob with orc not nice hobbit not sensibl said gollum give sam an angri glanc and turn to frodo sméagol ha talk to orc ye of cours befor he met master and to mani peopl he ha walk veri far and what he say now mani peopl are say it here in the north that the big danger is for him and for us he will come out of the black gate one day one day soon that is the onli way big armi can come but away down west he is not afraid and there are the silent watcher just so said sam not to be put off and so we are to walk up and knock at their gate and ask if were on the right road for mordor or are they too silent to answer it not sens we might as well do it here and save ourselv a long tramp dont make joke about it hiss gollum it isnt funni o no not amus it nut sens to tri and get into mordor at all but if master say i must go or i will go then he must tri some way but he must not go to the terribl citi o no of cours not that is where sméagol help nice sméagol though no one tell him what it is all about sméagol help again he found it he know it what did you find ask frodo gollum crouch down and hi voic sank to a whisper again a littl path lead up into the mountain and then a stair a narrow stair o ye veri long and narrow and then more stair and then – hi voic sank even lower – a tunnel a dark tunnel and at last a littl cleft and a path high abov the main pass it wa that way that sméagol got out of the dark but it wa year ago the path may have vanish now but perhap not perhap not i dont like the sound of it at all said sam sound too easi at ani rate in the tell if that path is still there itll be guard too wasnt it guard gollum as he said thi he caught or fanci he caught a green gleam in gollum eye gollum mutter but did not repli is it not guard ask frodo sternli and did you escap out of the dark sméagol were you not rather permit to depart upon an errand that at least is w hat aragorn thought who found you by the dead marsh some year ago it a lie hiss gollum and an evil light came into hi eye at the name of aragorn he lie on me ye he did i did escap all by my poor self inde i wa told to seek for the preciou and i have search and search of cours i have but not for the black one the preciou wa our it wa mine i tell you i did escap frodo felt a strang certainti that in thi matter gollum wa for onc not so far from the truth as might be suspect that he had somehow found a way out of mordor and at least believ that it wa by hi own cun for one thing he note that gollum use i and that seem usual to be a sign on it rare appear that some remnant of old truth and sincer were for the moment on top but even if gollum could be trust on thi point frodo did not forget the wile of the enemi the escap may have been allow or arrang and well known in the dark tower and in ani case gollum wa plainli keep a good deal back i ask you again he said is not thi secret way guard but the name of aragorn had put gollum into a sullen mood he had all the injur air of a liar suspect when for onc he ha told the truth or part of it he did not answer is it not guard frodo repeat ye ye perhap no safe place in thi countri said gollum sulkili no safe place but master must tri it or go home no other way they could not get him to say more the name of the peril place and the high pass he could not tell or would not it name wa cirith ungol a name of dread rumour aragorn could perhap have told them that name and it signific gandalf would have warn them but they were alon and aragorn wa far away and gandalf stood amid the ruin of isengard and strove with saruman delay by treason yet even as he spoke hi last word to saruman and the palantír crash in fire upon the step of orthanc hi thought wa ever upon frodo and samwis over the long leagu hi mind sought for them in hope and piti mayb frodo felt it not know it as he had upon amon hen even though he believ that gandalf wa gone gone for ever into the shadow in moria far away he sat upon the ground for a long while silent hi head bow strive to recal all that gandalf had said to him but for thi choic he could recal no counsel inde gandalf guidanc had been taken from them too soon too soon while the dark land wa still veri far away how they should enter it at the last gandalf had not said perhap he could not say into the stronghold of the enemi in the north into dol guldur he had onc ventur but into mordor to the mountain of fire and to baraddûr sinc the dark lord rose in power again had he ever journey there frodo did not think so and here he wa a littl halfl from the shire a simpl hobbit of the quiet countrysid expect to find a way where the great one could not go or dare not go it wa an evil fate but he had taken it on himself in hi own sittingroom in the faroff spring of anoth year so remot now that it wa like a chapter in a stori of the world youth when the tree of silver and gold were still in bloom thi wa an evil choic which way should he choos and if both led to terror and death what good lay in choic the day drew on a deep silenc fell upon the littl grey hollow where they lay so near to the border of the land of fear a silenc that could be felt as if it were a thick veil that cut them off from all the world about them abov them wa a dome of pale sky bar with fleet smoke but it seem high and far away as if seen through great deep of air heavi with brood thought not even an eagl pois against the sun would have mark the hobbit sit there under the weight of doom silent not move shroud in their thin grey cloak for a moment he might have paus to consid gollum a tini figur sprawl on the ground there perhap lay the famish skeleton of some child of men it rag garment still cling to it it long arm and leg almost bonewhit and bonethin no flesh worth a peck frodo head wa bow over hi knee but sam lean back with hand behind hi head stare out of hi hood at the empti sky at least for a long while it wa empti then present sam thought he saw a dark birdlik figur wheel into the circl of hi sight and hover and then wheel away again two more follow and then a fourth they were veri small to look at yet he knew somehow that they were huge with a vast stretch of pinion fli at a great height he cover hi eye and bent forward cower the same warn fear wa on him as he had felt in the presenc of the black rider the helpless horror that had come with the cri in the wind and the shadow on the moon though now it wa not so crush or compel the menac wa more remot but menac it wa frodo felt it too hi thought wa broken he stir and shiver but he did not look up gollum huddl himself togeth like a corner spider the wing shape wheel and stoop swiftli down speed back to mordor sam took a deep breath the rider are about again up in the air he said in a hoars whisper i saw them do you think they could see us they were veri high up and if they are black rider same as befor then they cant see much by daylight can they no perhap not said frodo but their steed could see and these wing creatur that they ride on now they can probabl see more than ani other creatur they are like great carrion bird they are look for someth the enemi is on the watch i fear the feel of dread pass but the enfold silenc wa broken for some time they had been cut off from the world as if in an invis island now they were laid bare again peril had return but still frodo did not speak to gollum or make hi choic hi eye were close as if he were dream or look inward into hi heart and memori at last he stir and stood up and it seem that he wa about to speak and to decid but hark he said what is that a new fear wa upon them they heard sing and hoars shout at first it seem a long way off but it drew nearer it wa come toward them it leap into all their mind that the black wing had spi them and had sent arm soldier to seiz them no speed seem too great for these terribl servant of sauron they crouch listen the voic and the clink of weapon and har were veri close frodo and sam loosen their small sword in their sheath flight wa imposs gollum rose slowli and crawl insectlik to the lip of the hollow veri cautious he rais himself inch by inch until he could peer over it between two broken point of stone he remain there without move for some time make no sound present the voic began to reced again and then they slowli fade away far off a horn blew on the rampart of the morannon then quietli gollum drew back and slip down into the hollow more men go to mordor he said in a low voic dark face we have not seen men like these befor no sméagol ha not they are fierc they have black eye and long black hair and gold ring in their ear ye lot of beauti gold and some have red paint on their cheek and red cloak and their flag are red and the tip of their spear and they have round shield yellow and black with big spike not nice veri cruel wick men they look almost as bad as orc and much bigger sméagol think they have come out of the south beyond the great river end they came up that road they have pass on to the black gate but more may follow alway more peopl come to mordor one day all the peopl will be insid were there ani oliphaunt ask sam forget hi fear in hi eager for news of strang place no no oliphaunt what are oliphaunt said gollum sam stood up put hi hand behind hi back as he alway did when speak poetri and began grey as a mous big as a hous nose like a snake i make the earth shake as i tramp through the grass tree crack as i pass with horn in my mouth i walk in the south flap big ear beyond count of year i stump round and round never lie on the ground not even to die oliphaunt am i biggest of all huge old and tall if ever youd met me you wouldnt forget me if you never do you wont think im true but old oliphaunt am i and i never lie that said sam when he had finish recit that a rhyme we have in the shire nonsens mayb and mayb not but we have our tale too and news out of the south you know in the old day hobbit use to go on their travel now and again not that mani ever came back and not that all they said wa believ news from bree and not sure as shiretalk as the say go but ive heard tale of the big folk down away in the sunland swert we call em in our tale and they ride on oliphaunt ti said when they fight they put hous and tower on the oliphaunts back and all and the oliphaunt throw rock and tree at one anoth so when you said men out of the south all in red and gold i said were there ani oliphaunt for if there wa i wa go to take a look risk or no but now i dont suppos ill ever see an oliphaunt mayb there aint no such a beast he sigh no no oliphaunt said gollum again sméagol ha not heard of them he doe not want to see them he doe not want them to be sméagol want to go away from here and hide somewher safer sméagol want master to go nice master wont he come with sméagol frodo stood up he had laugh in the midst of all hi care when sam trot out the old firesid rhyme of oliphaunt and the laugh had releas him from hesit i wish we had a thousand oliphaunt with gandalf on a white one at their head he said then wed break a way into thi evil land perhap but weve not just our own tire leg that all well sméagol the third turn may turn the best i will come with you good master wise master nice master cri gollum in delight pat frodo knee good master then rest now nice hobbit under the shadow of the stone close under the stone rest and lie quiet till the yellow face goe away then we can go quickli soft and quick as shadow we must be chapter of herb and stew rabbit for the few hour of daylight that were left they rest shift into the shade as the sun move until at last the shadow of the western rim of their dell grew long and dark fill all the hollow then they ate a littl and drank sparingli gollum ate noth but he accept water gladli soon get more now he said lick hi lip good water run down in stream to the great river nice water in the land we are go to sméagol will get food there too perhap he veri hungri ye gollum he set hi two larg flat hand on hi shrunken belli and a pale green light came into hi eye the dusk wa deep when at length they set out creep over the westward rim of the dell and fade like ghost into the broken countri on the border of the road the moon wa now three night from the full but it did not climb over the mountain until nearli midnight and the earli night wa veri dark a singl red light burn high up in the tower of the teeth but otherwis no sign could be seen or heard of the sleepless watch on the morannon for mani mile the red eye seem to stare at them as they fled stumbl through a barren stoni countri they did not dare to take the road but they kept it on their left follow it line as well as they could at a littl distanc at last when night wa grow old and they were alreadi weari for they had taken onli one short rest the eye dwindl to a small fieri point and then vanish they had turn the dark northern shoulder of the lower mountain and were head southward with heart strang lighten they now rest again but not for long they were not go quick enough for gollum by hi reckon it wa nearli thirti leagu from the morannon to the crossroad abov osgiliath and he hope to cover that distanc in four journey so soon they struggl on onc more until the dawn began to spread slowli in the wide grey solitud they had then walk almost eight leagu and the hobbit could not have gone ani further even if they had dare the grow light reveal to them a land alreadi less barren and ruinou the mountain still loom up omin on their left but near at hand they could see the southward road now bear away from the black root of the hill and slant westward beyond it were slope cover with sombr tree like dark cloud but all about them lay a tumbl heathland grown with ling and broom and cornel and other shrub that they did not know here and there they saw knot of tall pinetre the heart of the hobbit rose again a littl in spite of weari the air wa fresh and fragrant and it remind them of the upland of the northfarth far away it seem good to be repriev to walk in a land that had onli been for a few year under the dominion of the dark lord and wa not yet fallen wholli into decay but they did not forget their danger nor the black gate that wa still all too near hidden though it wa behind the gloomi height they look about for a hidingplac where they could shelter from evil eye while the light last the day pass uneasili they lay deep in the heather and count out the slow hour in which there seem littl chang for they were still under the shadow of the ephel dúath and the sun wa veil frodo slept at time deepli and peac either trust gollum or too tire to troubl about him but sam found it difficult to do more than doze even when gollum wa plainli fast asleep whiffl and twitch in hi secret dream hunger perhap more than mistrust kept him wake he had begun to long for a good home meal someth hot out of the pot as soon as the land fade into a formless grey under come night they start out again in a littl while gollum led them down on to the southward road and after that they went on more quickli though the danger wa greater their ear were strain for the sound of hoof or foot on the road ahead or follow them from behind but the night pass and they heard no sound of walker or rider the road had been made in a long lost time and for perhap thirti mile below the morannon it had been newli repair but as it went south the wild encroach upon it the handiwork of men of old could still be seen in it straight sure flight and level cours now and again it cut it way through hillsid slope or leap over a stream upon a wide shape arch of endur masonri but at last all sign of stonework fade save for a broken pillar here and there peer out of bush at the side or old pavingston still lurk amid weed and moss heather and tree and bracken scrambl down and overhung the bank or sprawl out over the surfac it dwindl at last to a countri cartroad littl use but it did not wind it held on it own sure cours and guid them by the swiftest way so they pass into the northern march of that land that men onc call ithilien a fair countri of climb wood and swiftfal stream the night becam fine under star and round moon and it seem to the hobbit that the fragranc of the air grew as they went forward and from the blow and mutter of gollum it seem that he notic it too and did not relish it at the first sign of day they halt again they had come to the end of a long cut deep and sheersid in the middl by which the road clove it way through a stoni ridg now they climb up the westward bank and look abroad day wa open in the sky and they saw that the mountain were now much further off reced eastward in a long curv that wa lost in the distanc befor them as they turn west gentl slope ran down into dim haze far below all about them were small wood of resin tree fir and cedar and cypress and other kind unknown in the shire with wide glade among them and everywher there wa a wealth of sweetsmel herb and shrub the long journey from rivendel had brought them far south of their own land but not until now in thi more shelter region had the hobbit felt the chang of clime here spring wa alreadi busi about them frond pierc moss and mould larch were greenfing small flower were open in the turf bird were sing ithilien the garden of gondor now desol kept still a dishevel dryad loveli south and west it look toward the warm lower vale of anduin shield from the east by the ephel dúath and yet not under the mountainshadow protect from the north by the emyn muil open to the southern air and the moist wind from the sea far away mani great tree grew there plant long ago fall into untend age amid a riot of careless descend and grove and thicket there were of tamarisk and pungent terebinth of oliv and of bay and there were junip and myrtl and thyme that grew in bush or with their woodi creep stem mantl in deep tapestri the hidden stone sage of mani kind put forth blue flower or red or pale green and marjoram and newsprout parsley and mani herb of form and scent beyond the gardenlor of sam the grot and rocki wall were alreadi star with saxifrag and stonecrop primerol and anemon were awak in the filbertbrak and asphodel and mani lilyflow nod their halfopen head in the grass deep green grass besid the pool where fall stream halt in cool hollow on their journey down to anduin the travel turn their back on the road and went downhil as they walk brush their way through bush and herb sweet odour rose about them gollum cough and retch but the hobbit breath deep and suddenli sam laugh for heart eas not for jest they follow a stream that went quickli down befor them present it brought them to a small clear lake in a shallow dell it lay in the broken ruin of an ancient stone basin the carven rim of which wa almost wholli cover with moss and rosebrambl irissword stood in rank about it and waterlili leav float on it dark gentlyrippl surfac but it wa deep and fresh and spill ever softli out over a stoni lip at the far end here they wash themselv and drank their fill at the infal freshet then they sought for a restingplac and a hidingplac for thi land fairseem still wa nonetheless now territori of the enemi they had not come veri far from the road and yet even in so short a space they had seen scar of the old war and the newer wound made by the orc and other foul servant of the dark lord a pit of uncov filth and refus tree hewn down wantonli and left to die with evil rune or the fell sign of the eye cut in rude stroke on their bark sam scrambl below the outfal of the lake smell and touch the unfamiliar plant and tree forget for the moment of mordor wa remind suddenli of their everpres peril he stumbl on a ring still scorch by fire and in the midst of it he found a pile of char and broken bone and skull the swift growth of the wild with briar and eglantin and trail clemati wa alreadi draw a veil over thi place of dread feast and slaughter but it wa not ancient he hurri back to hi companion but he said noth the bone were best left in peac and not paw and rout by gollum let find a place to lie up in he said not lower down higher up for me a littl way back abov the lake they found a deep brown bed of last year fern beyond it wa a thicket of darkleav baytre climb up a steep bank that wa crown with old cedar here they decid to rest and pass the day which alreadi promis to be bright and warm a good day for stroll on their way along the grove and glade of ithilien but though orc may shun the sunlight there were too mani place here where they could lie hid and watch and other evil eye were abroad sauron had mani servant gollum in ani case would not move under the yellow face soon it would look over the dark ridg of the ephel dúath and he would faint and cower in the light and heat sam had been give earnest thought to food as they march now that the despair of the impass gate wa behind him he did not feel so inclin as hi master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end of their errand and anyway it seem wiser to him to save the waybread of the elv for wors time ahead six day or more had

rins hi gear as he stood up to return he look back up the slope at that moment he saw the sun rise out of the reek or haze or dark shadow or whatev it wa that lay ever to the east and it sent it golden beam down upon the tree and glade about him then he notic a thin spiral of bluegrey smoke plain to see as it caught the sunlight rise from a thicket abov him with a shock he realiz that thi wa the smoke from hi littl cookingfir which he had neglect to put out that wont do never thought it would show like that he mutter and he start to hurri back suddenli he halt and listen had he heard a whistl or not or wa it the call of some strang bird if it wa a whistl it did not come from frodo direct there it went again from anoth place sam began to run as well as he could uphil he found that a small brand burn away to it outer end had kindl some fern at the edg of the fire and the fern blaze up had set the turv smoulder hastili he stamp out what wa left of the fire scatter the ash and laid

voic the two hobbit truss their small pack put them on readi for flight and then crawl deeper into the fern there they crouch listen there wa no doubt of the voic they were speak low and furtiv but they were near and come nearer then quit suddenli one spoke clearli close at hand here here is where the smoke came from it said twill be nigh at hand in the fern no doubt we shall have it like a coney in a trap then we shall learn what kind of thing it is aye and what it know said a second voic at onc four men came stride through the fern from differ direct sinc flight and hide were no longer possibl frodo and sam sprang to their feet put back to back and whip out their small sword if they were astonish at what they saw their captor were even more astonish four tall men stood there two had spear in their hand with broad bright head two had great bow almost of their own height and great quiver of long greenfeath arrow all had sword at their side and were clad in green and brown of vari hue as if the better to walk unseen in the glade of ithilien green gauntlet cover their hand and their face were hood and mask with green except for their eye which were veri keen and bright at onc frodo thought of boromir for these men were like him in statur and bear and in their manner of speech we have not found what we sought said one but what have we found not orc said anoth releas the hilt of hi sword which he had seiz when he saw the glitter of sting in frodo hand elv said a third doubt nay not elv said the fourth the tallest and as it appear the chief among them elv do not walk in ithilien in these day and elv are wondrou fair to look upon or so ti said mean were not i take you said sam thank you kindli and when youv finish discuss us perhap youll say who you are and whi you cant let two tire travel rest the tall green man laugh grimli i am faramir captain of gondor he said but there are no travel in thi land onli the servant of the dark tower or of the white but we are neither said frodo and travel we are whatev captain faramir may say then make hast to declar yourselv and your errand said faramir we have a work to do and thi is no time or place for riddl or parley come where is the third of your compani the third ye the skulk fellow that we saw with hi nose in the pool down yonder he had an illfavour look some spi breed of orc i guess or a creatur of their but he gave us the slip by some foxtrick i do not know where he is said frodo he is onli a chanc companion met upon our road and i am not answer for him if you come on him spare him bring him or send him to us he is onli a wretch gangrel creatur but i have him under my care for a while but as for us we are hobbit of the shire far to the north and west beyond mani river frodo son of drogo is my name and with me is samwis son of hamfast a worthi hobbit in my servic we have come by long way – out of rivendel or imladri as some call it here faramir start and grew intent seven companion we had one we lost at moria the other we left at parth galen abov rauro two of my kin a dwarf there wa also and an elf and two men they were aragorn and boromir who said that he came out of mina tirith a citi in the south boromir all the four men exclaim boromir son of the lord denethor said faramir and a strang stern look came into hi face you came with him that is news inde if it be true know littl stranger that boromir son of denethor wa high warden of the white tower and our captaingener sore do we miss him who are you then and what had you to do with him be swift for the sun is climb are the riddl word known to you that boromir brought to rivendel frodo repli seek for the sword that wa broken in imladri it dwell the word are known inde said faramir in astonish it is some token of your truth that you also know them aragorn whom i name is the bearer of the sword that wa broken said frodo and we are the halfl that the rhyme spoke of that i see said faramir thought or i see that it might be so and what is isildur bane that is hidden answer frodo doubtless it will be made clear in time we must learn more of thi said faramir and know what bring you so far east under the shadow of yonder he point and said no name but not now we have busi in hand you are in peril and you would not have gone far by field or road thi day there will be hard handstrok nigh at hand ere the day is full then death or swift flight bark to anduin i will leav two to guard you for your good and for mine wise man trust not to chancemeet on the road in thi land if i return i will speak more with you farewel said frodo bow low think what you will i am a friend of all enemi of the one enemi we would go with you if we halfl folk could hope to serv you such doughti men and strong as you seem and if my errand permit it may the light shine on your sword the halfl are courteou folk whatev els they be said faramir farewel the hobbit sat down again but they said noth to one anoth of their thought and doubt close by just under the dappl shadow of the dark baytre two men remain on guard they took off their mask now and again to cool them as the dayheat grew and frodo saw that they were goodli men paleskin dark of hair with grey eye and face sad and proud they spoke togeth in soft voic at first use the common speech but after the manner of older day and then chang to anoth languag of their own to hi amaz as he listen frodo becam awar that it wa the elventongu that they spoke or one but littl differ and he look at them with wonder for he knew then that they must be dúnedain of the south men of the line of the lord of westerness after a while he spoke to them but they were slow and cautiou in answer they name themselv mablung and damrod soldier of gondor and they were ranger of ithilien for they were descend from folk who live in ithilien at one time befor it wa overrun from such men the lord denethor chose hi foray who cross the anduin secretli how or where they would not say to harri the orc and other enemi that roam between the ephel dúath and the river it is close on ten leagu henc to the eastshor of anduin said mablung and we seldom come so far afield but we have a new errand on thi journey we come to ambush the men of harad curs them aye curs the southron said damrod ti said that there were deal of old between gondor and the kingdom of the harad in the far south though there wa never friendship in those day our bound were away south beyond the mouth of anduin and umbar the nearest of their realm acknowledg our sway but that is long sinc ti mani live of men sinc ani pass to or fro between us now of late we have learn that the enemi ha been among them and they are gone over to him or back to himthey were ever readi to hi willa have so mani also in the east i doubt not that the day of gondor are number and the wall of mina tirith are doom so great is hi strength and malic but still we will not sit idl and let him do all as he would said mablung these curs southron come now march up the ancient road to swell the host of the dark tower yea up the veri road that craft of gondor made and they go ever more heedlessli we learn think that the power of their new master is great enough so that the mere shadow of hi hill will protect them we come to teach them anoth lesson great strength of them wa report to us some day ago march north one of their regiment is due by our reckon to pass by some time ere noonup on the road abov where it pass through the cloven way the road may pass but they shall not not while faramir is captain he lead now in all peril ventur but hi life is charm or fate spare him for some other end their talk die down into a listen silenc all seem still and watch sam crouch by the edg of the fernbrak peer out with hi keen hobbitey he saw that mani more men were about he could see them steal up the slope singli or in long file keep alway to the shade of grove or thicket or crawl hardli visibl in their brown and green raiment through grass and brake all were hood and mask and had gauntlet on their hand and were arm like faramir and hi companion befor long they had all pass and vanish the sun rose till it near the south the shadow shrank i wonder where that drat gollum is thought sam as he crawl back into deeper shade he stand a fair chanc of be spit for an orc or of be roast by the yellow face but i fanci hell look after himself he lay down besid frodo and began to doze he woke think that he had heard horn blow he sat up it wa now high noon the guard stood alert and tens in the shadow of the tree suddenli the horn rang out louder and beyond mistak from abov over the top of the slope sam thought that he heard cri and wild shout also but the sound wa faint as if it came out of some distant cave then present the nois of fight broke out near at hand just abov their hidingplac he could hear plainli the ring grate of steel on steel the clang of sword on iron cap the dull beat of blade on shield men were yell and scream and one clear loud voic wa call gondor gondor it sound like a hundr blacksmith all smithi togeth said sam to frodo theyr as near as i want them now but the nois grew closer they are come cri damrod see some of the southron have broken from the trap and are fli from the road there they go our men after them and the captain lead sam eager to see more went now and join the guard he scrambl a littl way up into one of the larger of the baytre for a moment he caught a glimps of swarthi men in red run down the slope some way off with greenclad warrior leap after them hew them down as they fled arrow were thick in the air then suddenli straight over the rim of their shelter bank a man fell crash through the slender tree nearli on top of them he came to rest in the fern a few feet away face downward green arrowfeath stick from hi neck below a golden collar hi scarlet robe were tatter hi corslet of overlap brazen plate wa rent and hewn hi black plait of hair braid with gold were drench with blood hi brown hand still clutch the hilt of a broken sword it wa sam first view of a battl of men against men and he did not like it much he wa glad that he could not see the dead face he wonder what the man name wa and where he came from and if he wa realli evil of heart or what lie or threat had led him on the long march from hi home and if he would not realli rather have stay there in peaceal in a flash of thought which wa quickli driven from hi mind for just as mablung step toward the fallen bodi there wa a new nois great cri and shout amidst it sam heard a shrill bellow or trumpet and then a great thud and bump like huge ram din on the ground ware ware cri damrod to hi companion may the valar turn him asid mûmak mûmak to hi astonish and terror and last delight sam saw a vast shape crash out of the tree and come career down the slope big as a hous much bigger than a hous it look to him a greyclad move hill fear and wonder mayb enlarg him in the hobbit eye but the mûmak of harad wa inde a beast of vast bulk and the like of him doe not walk now in middleearth hi kin that live still in latter day are but memori of hi girth and majesti on he came straight toward the watcher and then swerv asid in the nick of time pass onli a few yard away rock the ground beneath their feet hi great leg like tree enorm saillik ear spread out long snout uprais like a huge serpent about to strike hi small red eye rage hi upturn hornlik tusk were bound with band of gold and drip with blood hi trap of scarlet and gold flap about him in wild tatter the ruin of what seem a veri wartow lay upon hi heav back smash in hi furiou passag through the wood and high upon hi neck still desper clung a tini figureth bodi of a mighti warrior a giant among the swert on the great beast thunder blunder in blind wrath through pool and thicket arrow skip and snap harmlessli about the tripl hide of hi flank men of both side fled befor him but mani he overtook and crush to the ground soon he wa lost to view still trumpet and stamp far away what becam of him sam never heard whether he escap to roam the wild for a time until he perish far from hi home or wa trap in some deep pit or whether he rage on until he plung in the great river and wa swallow up sam drew a deep breath an oliphaunt it wa he said so there are oliphaunt and i have seen one what a life but no one at home will ever believ me well if that over ill have a bit of sleep sleep while you may said mablung but the captain will return if he is unhurt and when he come we shall depart swiftli we shall be pursu as soon as news of our deed reach the enemi and that will not be long go quietli when you must said sam no need to disturb my sleep i wa walk all night mablung laugh i do not think the captain will leav you here master samwis he said but you shall see chapter the window on the west it seem to sam that he had onli doze for a few minut when he awok to find that it wa late afternoon and faramir had come back he had brought mani men with him inde all the survivor of the foray were now gather on the slope nearbi two or three hundr strong they sat in a wide semicircl between the arm of which faramir wa seat on the ground while frodo stood befor him it look strang like the trial of a prison sam crept out from the fern but no one paid ani attent to him and he place himself at the end of the row of men where he could see and hear all that wa go on he watch and listen intent readi to dash to hi master aid if need he could see faramir face which wa now unmask it wa stern and command and a keen wit lay behind hi search glanc doubt wa in the grey eye that gaze steadili at frodo sam soon becam awar that the captain wa not satisfi with frodo account of himself at sever point what part he had to play in the compani that set out from rivendel whi he had left boromir and where he wa now go in particular he return often to isildur bane plainli he saw that frodo wa conceal from him some matter of great import but it wa at the come of the halfl that isildur bane should waken or so one must read the word he insist if then you are the halfl that wa name doubtless you brought thi thing whatev it may be to the council of which you speak and there boromir saw it do you deni it frodo made no answer so said faramir i wish then to learn from you more of it for what concern boromir concern me an orcarrow slew isildur so far as old tale tell but orcarrow are plenti and the sight of one would not be taken as a sign of doom by boromir of gondor had you thi thing in keep it is hidden you say but is not that becaus you choos to hide it no not becaus i choos answer frodo it doe not belong to me it doe not belong to ani mortal great or small though if ani could claim it it would be aragorn son of arathorn whom i name the leader of our compani from moria to rauro whi so and not boromir princ of the citi that the son of elendil found becaus aragorn is descend in direct lineag father to father from isildur elendil son himself and the sword that he bear wa elendil sword a murmur of astonish ran through all the ring of men some cri aloud the sword of elendil the sword of elendil come to mina tirith great tide but faramir face wa unmov mayb he said but so great a claim will need to be establish and clear proof will be requir should thi aragorn ever come to mina tirith he had not come nor ani of your compani when i set out six day ago boromir wa satisfi of that claim said frodo inde if boromir were here he would answer all your question and sinc he wa alreadi at rauro mani day back and intend then to go straight to your citi if you return you may soon learn the answer there my part in the compani wa known to him as to all the other for it wa appoint to me by elrond of imladri himself befor the whole council on that errand i came into thi countri but it is not mine to reveal to ani outsid the compani yet those who claim to oppos the enemi would do well not to hinder it frodo tone wa proud whatev he felt and sam approv of it but it did not appeas faramir so he said you bid me mind my own affair and get me back home and let you be boromir will tell all when he come when he come say you were you a friend of boromir vividli befor frodo mind came the memori of boromir assault upon him and for a moment he hesit faramir eye watch him grew harder boromir wa a valiant member of our compani said frodo at length ye i wa hi friend for my part faramir smile grimli then you would griev to learn that boromir is dead i would griev inde said frodo then catch the look in faramir eye he falter dead he said do you mean that he is dead and that you knew it you have been tri to trap me in word play with me or are you now tri to snare me with a falsehood i would not snare even an orc with a falsehood said faramir how then did he die and how do you know of it sinc you say that none of the compani had reach the citi when you left as to the manner of hi death i had hope that hi friend and companion would tell me how it wa but he wa aliv and strong when we part and he live still for all that i know though sure there are mani peril in the world mani inde said faramir and treacheri not the least sam had been get more and more impati and angri at thi convers these last word were more than he could bear and burst into the middl of the ring he strode up to hi master side beg your pardon mr frodo he said but thi ha gone on long enough he no right to talk to you so after all youv gone through as much for hi good and all these great men as for anyon els see here captain he plant himself squar in front of faramir hi hand on hi hip and a look on hi face as if he wa address a young hobbit who had offer him what he call sauc when question about visit to the orchard there wa some murmur but also some grin on the face of the men look on the sight of their captain sit on the ground and eye to eye with a young hobbit leg well apart bristl with wrath wa one beyond their experi see here he said what are you drive at let come to the point befor all the orc of mordor come down on us if you think my master murder thi boromir and then ran away youv got no sens but say it and have done and then let us know what you mean to do about it but it a piti that folk as talk about fight the enemi cant let other do their bit in their own way without interf hed be mighti pleas if he could see you now think hed got a new friend he would patienc said faramir but without anger do not speak befor your master whose wit is greater than your and i do not need ani to teach me of our peril even so i spare a brief time in order to judg justli in a hard matter were i as hasti as you i might have slain you long ago for i am command to slay all whom i find in thi land without the leav of the lord of gondor but i do not slay man or beast needlessli and not gladli even when it is need neither do i talk in vain so be comfort sit by your master and be silent sam sat down heavili with a red face faramir turn to frodo again you ask how do i know that the son of denethor is dead tide of death have mani wing night oft bring news to near kindr ti said boromir wa my brother a shadow of sorrow pass over hi face do you rememb aught of special mark that the lord boromir bore with him among hi gear frodo thought for a moment fear some further trap and wonder how thi debat would turn in the end he had hardli save the ring from the proud grasp of boromir and how he would fare now among so mani men warlik and strong he did not know yet he felt in hi heart that faramir though he wa much like hi brother in look wa a man less selfregard both sterner and wiser i rememb that boromir bore a horn he said at last you rememb well and as one who ha in truth seen him said faramir then mayb you can see it in your mind eye a great horn of the wild ox of the east bound with silver and written with ancient charact that horn the eldest son of our hous ha born for mani gener and it is said that if it be blown at need anywher within the bound of gondor as the realm wa of old it voic will not pass unheed five day ere i set out on thi ventur eleven day ago at about thi hour of the day i heard the blow of that horn from the northward it seem but dim as if it were but an echo in the mind a bode of ill we thought it my father and i for no tide had we heard of boromir sinc he went away and no watcher on our border had seen him pass and on the third night after anoth and a stranger thing befel me i sat at night by the water of anduin in the grey dark under the young pale moon watch the evermov stream and the sad reed were rustl so do we ever watch the shore nigh osgiliath which our enemi now partli hold and issu from it to harri our land but that night all the world slept at the midnight hour then i saw or it seem that i saw a boat float on the water glimmer grey a small boat of a strang fashion with a high prow and there wa none to row or steer it an awe fell on me for a pale light wa round it but i rose and went to the bank and began to walk out into the stream for i wa drawn toward it then the boat turn toward me and stay it pace and float slowli by within my hand reach yet i durst not handl it it wade deep as if it were heavili burden and it seem to me as it pass under my gaze that it wa almost fill with clear water from which came the light and lap in the water a warrior lay asleep a broken sword wa on hi knee i saw mani wound on him it wa boromir my brother dead i knew hi gear hi sword hi belov face one thing onli i miss hi horn one thing onli i knew not a fair belt as it were of link golden leav about hi waist boromir i cri where is thi horn whither goest thou o boromir but he wa gone the boat turn into the stream and pass glimmer on into the night dreamlik it wa and yet no dream for there wa no wake and i do not doubt that he is dead and ha pass down the river to the sea ala said frodo that wa inde boromir as i knew him for the golden belt wa given to him in lothlórien by the ladi galadriel she it wa that cloth us as you see us in elvengrey thi brooch is of the same workmanship he touch the green and silver leaf that fasten hi cloak beneath hi throat faramir look close at it it is beauti he said ye ti work of the same craft so then you pass through the land of lórien laurelindórenan it wa name of old but long now it ha lain beyond the knowledg of men he ad softli regard frodo with a new wonder in hi eye much that wa strang about you i begin now to understand will you not tell me more for it is a bitter thought that boromir die within sight of the land of hi home no more can i say than i have said answer frodo though your tale fill me with forebod a vision it wa that you saw i think and no more some shadow of evil fortun that ha been or will be unless inde it is some lie trick of the enemi i have seen the face of fair warrior of old laid in sleep beneath the pool of the dead marsh or seem so by hi foul art nay it wa not so said faramir for hi work fill the heart with loath but my heart wa fill with grief and piti yet how could such a thing have happen in truth ask frodo for no boat could have been carri over the stoni hill from tol brandir and boromir purpos to go home across the entwash and the field of rohan and yet how could ani vessel ride the foam of the great fall and not founder in the boil pool though laden with water i know not said faramir but whenc came the boat from lórien said frodo in three such boat we row down anduin to the fall they also were of elvenwork you pass through the hidden land said faramir but it seem that you littl understood it power if men have deal with the mistress of magic who dwell in the golden wood then they may look for strang thing to follow for it is peril for mortal man to walk out of the world of thi sun and few of old came thenc unchang ti said boromir o boromir he cri what did she say to you the ladi that die not what did she see what woke in your heart then whi went you ever to laurelindórenan and came not by your own road upon the hors of rohan ride home in the morn then turn again to frodo he spoke in a quiet voic onc more to those question i guess that you could make some answer frodo son of drogo but not here or now mayb but lest you still should think my tale a vision i will tell you thi the horn of boromir at least return in truth and not in seem the horn came but it wa cloven in two as it were by axe or sword the shard came sever to shore one wa found among the reed where watcher of gondor lay northward below the infal of the entwash the other wa found spin on the flood by one who had an errand in the water strang chanc but murder will out ti said and now the horn of the elder son lie in two piec upon the lap of denethor sit in hi high chair wait for news and you can tell me noth of the cleav of the horn no i did not know of it said frodo but the day when you heard it blow if your reckon is true wa the day when we part when i and my servant left the compani and now your tale fill me with dread for if boromir wa then in peril and wa slain i must fear that all my companion perish too and they were my kindr and my friend will you not put asid your doubt of me and let me go i am weari and full of grief and afraid but i have a deed to do or to attempt befor i too am slain and the more need of hast if we two halfl are all that remain of our fellowship go back faramir valiant captain of gondor and defend your citi while you may and let me go where my doom take me for me there is no comfort in our speech togeth said faramir but you sure draw from it more dread than need be unless the peopl of lórien themselv came to him who array boromir as for a funer not orc or servant of the nameless some of your compani i guess live still but whatev befel on the north march you frodo i doubt no longer if hard day have made me ani judg of men word and face then i may make a guess at halfl though and now he smile there is someth strang about you frodo an elvish air mayb but more lie upon our word togeth than i thought at first i should now take you back to mina tirith to answer there to denethor and my life will justli be forfeit if i now choos a cours that prove ill for my citi so i will not decid in hast what is to be done yet we must move henc without more delay he sprang to hi feet and issu some order at onc the men who were gather round him broke up into small group and went off thi way and that vanish quickli into the shadow of the rock and tree soon onli mablung and damrod remain now you frodo and samwis will come with me and my guard said faramir you can not go along the road southward if that wa your purpos it will be unsaf for some day and alway more close watch after thi affray than it ha been yet and you can not i think go far today in ani case for you are weari and so are we we are go now to a secret place we have somewhat less than ten mile from here the orc and spi of the enemi have not found it yet and if they did we could hold it long even against mani there we may lie up and rest for a while and you with us in the morn i will decid what is best for me to do and for you there wa noth for frodo to do but to fall in with thi request or order it seem in ani case a wise cours for the moment sinc thi foray of the men of gondor had made a journey in ithilien more danger than ever they set out at onc mablung and damrod a littl ahead and faramir with frodo and sam behind skirt the hither side of the pool where the hobbit had bath they cross the stream climb a long bank and pass into greenshadow woodland that march ever downward and westward while they walk as swiftli as the hobbit could go they talk in hush voic i broke off our speech togeth said faramir not onli becaus time press as master samwis had remind me but also becaus we were draw near to matter that were better not debat openli befor mani men it wa for that reason that i turn rather to the matter of my brother and let be isildur bane you were not wholli frank with me frodo i told no lie and of the truth all i could said frodo i do not blame you said faramir you spoke with skill in a hard place and wise it seem to me but i learn or guess more from you than your word said you were not friendli with boromir or you did not part in friendship you and master samwis too i guess have some grievanc now i love him dearli and would gladli aveng hi death yet i knew him well isildur bane – i would hazard that isildur bane lay between you and wa a caus of content in your compani clearli it is a mighti heirloom of some sort and such thing do not breed peac among confeder not if aught may be learn from ancient tale do i not hit near the mark near said frodo but not in the gold there wa no content in our compani though there wa doubt doubt which way we should take from the emyn muil but be that as it may ancient tale teach us also the peril of rash word concern such thing as – heirloom ah then it is as i thought your troubl wa with boromir alon he wish thi thing brought to mina tirith ala it is a crook fate that seal your lip who saw him last and hold from me that which i long to know what wa in hi heart and thought in hi latest hour whether he er or no of thi i am sure he die well achiev some good thing hi face wa more beauti even than in life but frodo i press you hard at first about isildur bane forgiv me it wa unwis in such an hour and place i had not had time for thought we had had a hard fight and there wa more than enough to fill my mind but even as i spoke with you i drew nearer to the mark and so deliber shot wider for you must know that much is still preserv of ancient lore among the ruler of the citi that is not spread abroad we of my hous are not of the line of elendil though the blood of númenor is in us for we reckon back our line to mardil the good steward who rule in the king stead when he went away to war and that wa king eärnur last of the line of anárion and childless and he came never back and the steward have govern the citi sinc that day though it wa mani gener of men ago and thi i rememb of boromir as a boy when we togeth learn the tale of our sire and the histori of our citi that alway it displeas him that hi father wa not king how mani hundr of year need it to make a steward a king if the king return not he ask few year mayb in other place of less royalti my father answer in gondor ten thousand year would not suffic ala poor boromir doe that not tell you someth of him it doe said frodo yet alway he treat aragorn with honour i doubt it not said faramir if he were satisfi of aragorn claim as you say he would greatli rever him but the pinch ha not yet come they had not yet reach mina tirith or becom rival in her war but i stray we in the hous of denethor know much ancient lore by long tradit and there are moreov in our treasuri mani thing preserv book and tablet writ on wither parchment yea and on stone and on leav of silver and of gold in diver charact some none can now read and for the rest few ever unlock them i can read a littl in them for i have had teach it wa these record that brought the grey pilgrim to us i first saw him when i wa a child and he ha been twice or thrice sinc then the grey pilgrim said frodo had he a name mithrandir we call him in elffashion said faramir and he wa content mani are my name in mani countri he said mithrandir among the elv tharkûn to the dwarv olórin i wa in my youth in the west that is forgotten in the south incánu in the north gandalf to the east i go not gandalf said frodo i thought it wa he gandalf the grey dearest of counsellor leader of our compani he wa lost in moria mithrandir wa lost said faramir an evil fate seem to have pursu your fellowship it is hard inde to believ that one of so great wisdom and of power – for mani wonder thing he did among us – could perish and so much lore be taken from the world are you sure of thi and that he did not just leav you and depart where he would ala ye said frodo i saw him fall into the abyss i see that there is some great tale of dread in thi said faramir which perhap you may tell me in the eveningtim thi mithrandir wa i now guess more than a loremast a great mover of the deed that are done in our time had he been among us to consult concern the hard word of our dream he could have made them clear to us without need of messeng yet mayb he would not have done so and the journey of boromir wa doom mithrandir never spoke to us of what wa to be nor did he reveal hi purpos he got leav of denethor how i do not know to look at the secret of our treasuri and i learn a littl of him when he would teach and that wa seldom ever he would search and would question us abov all els concern the great battl that wa fought upon dagorlad in the begin of gondor when he whom we do not name wa overthrown and he wa eager for stori of isildur though of him we had less to tell for noth certain wa ever known among us of hi end now faramir voic sank to a whisper but thi much i learn or guess and i have kept it ever secret in my heart sinc that isildur took somewhat from the hand of the unnam ere he went away from gondor never to be seen among mortal men again here i thought wa the answer to mithrandir question but it seem then a matter that concern onli the seeker after ancient learn nor when the riddl word of our dream were debat among us did i think of isildur bane as be thi same thing for isildur wa ambush and slain by orcarrow accord to the onli legend that we knew and mithrandir had never told me more what in truth thi thing is i can not yet guess but some heirloom of power and peril it must be a fell weapon perchanc devis by the dark lord if it were a thing that gave advantag in battl i can well believ that boromir the proud and fearless often rash ever anxiou for the victori of mina tirith and hi own glori therein might desir such a thing and be allur by it ala that ever he went on that errand i should have been chosen by my father and the elder but he put himself forward as be the older and the hardier both true and he would not be stay but fear no more i would not take thi thing if it lay by the highway not were mina tirith fall in ruin and i alon could save her so use the weapon of the dark lord for her good and my glori no i do not wish for such triumph frodo son of drogo neither did the council said frodo nor do i i would have noth to do with such matter for myself said faramir i would see the white tree in flower again in the court of the king and the silver crown return and mina tirith in peac mina anor again as of old full of light high and fair beauti as a queen among other queen not a mistress of mani slave nay not even a kind mistress of will slave war must be while we defend our live against a destroy who would devour all but i do not love the bright sword for it sharp nor the arrow for it swift nor the warrior for hi glori i love onli that which they defend the citi of the men of númenor and i would have her love for her memori her ancientri her beauti and her present wisdom not fear save as men may fear the digniti of a man old and wise so fear me not i do not ask you to tell me more i do not even ask you to tell me whether i now speak nearer the mark but if you will trust me it may be that i can advis you in your present quest whatev that bey and even aid you frodo made no answer almost he yield to the desir for help and counsel to tell thi grave young man whose word seem so wise and fair all that wa in hi mind but someth held him back hi heart wa heavi with fear and sorrow if he and sam were inde as seem like all that wa now left of the nine walker then he wa in sole command of the secret of their errand better mistrust undeserv than rash word and the memori of boromir of the dread chang that the lure of the ring had work in him wa veri present to hi mind when he look at faramir and listen to hi voic unlik they were and yet also much akin they walk on in silenc for a while pass like grey and green shadow under the old tree their feet make no sound abov them mani bird sang and the sun glisten on the polish roof of dark leav in the evergreen wood of ithilien sam had taken no part in the convers though he had listen and at the same time he had attend with hi keen hobbit ear to all the soft woodland nois about them one thing he had note that in all the talk the name of gollum had not onc come up he wa glad though he felt that it wa too much to hope that he would never hear it again he soon becam awar also that though they walk alon there were mani men close at hand not onli damrod and mablung flit in and out of the shadow ahead but other on either side all make their swift secret way to some appoint place onc look suddenli back as if some prickl of the skin told him that he wa watch from behind he thought he caught a brief glimps of a small dark shape slip behind a treetrunk he open hi mouth to speak and shut it again im not sure of it he said to himself and whi should i remind them of the old villain if they choos to forget him i wish i could so they pass on until the woodland grew thinner and the land began to fall more steepli then they turn asid again to the right and came quickli to a small river in a narrow gorg it wa the same stream that trickl far abov out of the round pool now grown to a swift torrent leap down over mani stone in a deepcloven bed overhung with ilex and dark boxwood look west they could see below them in a haze of light lowland and broad mead and glint far off in the wester sun the wide water of the anduin here ala i must do you a discourtesi said faramir i hope you will pardon it to one who ha so far made hi order give way to courtesi as not to slay you or to bind you but it is a command that no stranger not even one of rohan that fight with us shall see the path we now go with open eye i must blindfold you as you will said frodo even the elv do likewis at need and blindfold we cross the border of fair lothlórien gimli the dwarf took it ill but the hobbit endur it it is to no place so fair that i shall lead you said faramir but i am glad that you will take thi willingli and not by forc he call softli and immedi mablung and damrod step out of the tree and came back to him blindfold these guest said faramir secur but not so as to discomfort them do not tie their hand they will give their word not to tri and see i could trust them to shut their eye of their own accord but eye will blink if the feet stumbl lead them so that they do not falter with green scarv the two guard now bound up the hobbit eye and drew their hood down almost to their mouth then quickli they took each one by the hand and went on their way all that frodo and sam knew of thi last mile of the road they learn from guess in the dark after a littl they found that they were on a path descend steepli soon it grew so narrow that they went in singl file brush a stoni wall on either side their guard steer them from behind with hand laid firmli on their shoulder now and again they came to rough place and were lift from their feet for a while and then set down again alway the nois of the run water wa on their right hand and it grew nearer and louder at length they were halt quickli mablung and damrod turn them about sever time and they lost all sens of direct they climb upward a littl it seem cold and the nois of the stream had becom faint then they were pick up and carri down down mani step and round a corner suddenli they heard the water again loud now rush and splash all round them it seem and they felt a fine rain on their hand and cheek at last they were set on their feet onc more for a moment they stood so half fear blindfold not know where they were and no one spoke then came the voic of faramir close behind let them see he said the scarv were remov and their hood drawn back and they blink and gasp they stood on a wet floor of polish stone the doorstep as it were of a roughhewn gate of rock open dark behind them but in front a thin veil of water wa hung so near that frodo could have put an outstretch arm into it it face westward the level shaft of the set sun behind beat upon it and the red light wa broken into mani flicker beam of everchang colour it wa as if they stood at the window of some elventow curtain with thread jewel of silver and gold and rubi sapphir and amethyst all kindl with an unconsum fire at least by good chanc we came at the right hour to reward you for your patienc said faramir thi is the window of the sunset henneth annûn fairest of all the fall of ithilien land of mani fountain few stranger have ever seen it but there is no kingli hall behind to match it enter now and see even as he spoke the sun sank and the fire fade in the flow water they turn and pass under the low forbid arch at onc they found themselv in a rockchamb wide and rough with an uneven stoop roof a few torch were kindl and cast a dim light on the glisten wall mani men were alreadi there other were still come in by two and three through a dark narrow door on one side as their eye grew accustom to the gloom the hobbit saw that the cave wa larger than they had guess and wa fill with great store of arm and victual well here is our refug said faramir not a place of great eas but here you may pass the night in peac it is dri at least and there is food though no fire at one time the water flow down through thi cave and out of the arch but it cours wa chang further up the gorg by workmen of old and the stream sent down in a fall of doubl height over the rock far abov all the way into thi grot were then seal against the entri of water or aught els all save one there are now but two way out that passag yonder by which you enter blindfold and through the windowcurtain into a deep bowl fill with knive of stone now rest a while until the even meal is set the hobbit were taken to a corner and given a low bed to lie on if they wish meanwhil men busi themselv about the cave quietli and in orderli quick light tabl were taken from the wall and set up on trestl and laden with gear thi wa plain and unadorn for the most part but all well and fairli made round platter bowl and dish of glaze brown clay or turn boxwood smooth and clean here and there wa a cup or basin of polish bronz and a goblet of plain silver wa set by the captain seat in the middl of the inmost tabl faramir went about among the men question each as he came in in a soft voic some came back from the pursuit of the southron other left behind as scout near the road came in latest all the southron had been account for save onli the great mûmak what happen to him none could say of the enemi no movement could be seen not even an orcspi wa abroad you saw and heard noth anborn faramir ask of the latest comer well no lord said the man no orc at least but i saw or thought i saw someth a littl strang it wa get deep dusk when the eye make thing greater than they should be so perhap it may have been no more than a squirrel sam prick up hi ear at thi yet if so it wa a black squirrel and i saw no tail twa like a shadow on the ground and it whisk behind a treetrunk when i drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as ani squirrel could you will not have us slay wild beast for no purpos and it seem no more so i tri no arrow it wa too dark for sure shoot anyway and the creatur wa gone into the gloom of the leav in a twinkl but i stay for a while for it seem strang and then i hasten back i thought i heard the thing hiss at me from high abov as i turn away a larg squirrel mayb perhap under the shadow of the unnam some of the beast of mirkwood are wander hither to our wood they have black squirrel there ti said perhap said faramir but that would be an ill omen if it were so we do not want the escap of mirkwood in ithilien sam fanci that he gave a swift glanc toward the hobbit as he spoke but sam said noth for a while he and frodo lay back and watch the torchlight and the men move to and fro speak in hush voic then suddenli frodo fell asleep sam struggl with himself argu thi way and that he may be all right he thought and then he may not fair speech may hide a foul heart he yawn i could sleep for a week and id be better for it and what can i do if i do keep awak me all alon and all these great men about noth sam gamge but youv got to keep awak all the same and somehow he manag it the light fade from the cave door and the grey veil of fall water grew dim and wa lost in gather shadow alway the sound of the water went on never chang it note morn or even or night it murmur and whisper of sleep sam stuck hi knuckl in hi eye now more torch were be lit a cask of wine wa broach storag barrel were be open men were fetch water from the fall some were lave their hand in basin a wide copper bowl and a white cloth were brought to faramir and he wash wake our guest he said and take them water it is time to eat frodo sat up and yawn and stretch sam not use to be wait on look with some surpris at the tall man who bow hold a basin of water befor him put it on the ground master if you pleas he said easier for me and you then to the astonish and amus of the men he plung hi head into the cold water and splash hi neck and ear is it the custom in your land to wash the head befor supper said the man who wait on the hobbit no befor breakfast said sam but if your short of sleep cold water on the neck like rain on a wilt lettuc there now i can keep awak long enough to eat a bit they were led then to seat besid faramir barrel cover with pelt and high enough abov the bench of the men for their conveni befor they ate faramir and all hi men turn and face west in a moment of silenc faramir sign to frodo and sam that they should do likewis so we alway do he said as they sat down we look toward númenor that wa and beyond to elvenhom that is and to that which is beyond elvenhom and will ever be have you no such custom at meat no said frodo feel strang rustic and untutor but if we are guest we bow to our host and after we have eaten we rise and thank him that we do also said faramir after so long journey and camp and day spent in the lone wild the even meal seem a feast to the hobbit to drink pale yellow wine cool and fragrant and eat bread and butter and salt meat and dri fruit and good red chees with clean hand and clean knive and plate neither frodo nor sam refus anyth that wa offer nor a second nor inde a third help the wine cours in their vein and tire limb and they felt glad and easi of heart as they had not done sinc they left the land of lórien when all wa done faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave partli screen by curtain and a chair and two stool were brought there a littl earthenwar lamp burn in a nich you may soon desir to sleep he said and especi good samwis who would not close hi eye befor he ate – whether for fear of blunt the edg of a nobl hunger or for fear of me i do not know but it is not good to sleep too soon after meat and that follow a fast let us talk a while on your journey from rivendel there must have been mani thing to tell and you too would perhap wish to learn someth of us and the land where you now are tell me of boromir my brother and of old mithrandir and of the fair peopl of lothlórien frodo no longer felt sleepi and he wa will to talk but though the food and wine had put him at hi eas he had not lost all hi caution sam wa beam and hum to himself but when frodo spoke he wa at first content to listen onli occasion ventur to make an exclam of agreement frodo told mani tale yet alway he steer the matter away from the quest of the compani and from the ring enlarg rather on the valiant part boromir had play in all their adventur with the wolv of the wild in the snow under caradhra and in the mine of moria where gandalf fell faramir wa most move by the stori of the fight on the bridg it must have irk boromir to run from orc he said or even from the fell thing you name the balrog – even though he wa the last to leav he wa the last said frodo but aragorn wa forc to lead us he alon knew the way after gandalf fall but had there not been us lesser folk to care for i do not think that either he or boromir would have fled mayb it would have been better had boromir fallen there with mithrandir said faramir and not gone on to the fate that wait abov the fall of rauro mayb but tell me now of your own fortun said frodo turn the matter asid onc again for i would learn more of mina ithil and osgiliath and mina tirith the longendur what hope have you for that citi in your long war what hope have we said faramir it is long sinc we had ani hope the sword of elendil if it return inde may rekindl it but i do not think that it will do more than put off the evil day unless other help unlookedfor also come from elv or men for the enemi increas and we decreas we are a fail peopl a springless autumn the men of númenor were settl far and wide on the shore and seaward region of the great land but for the most part they fell into evil and folli mani becam enamour of the dark and the black art some were given over wholli to idl and eas and some fought among themselv until they were conquer in their weak by the wild men it is not said that evil art were ever practis in gondor or that the nameless one wa ever name in honour there and the old wisdom and beauti brought out of the west remain long in the realm of the son of elendil the fair and they linger there still yet even so it wa gondor that brought about it own decay fall by degre into dotag and think that the enemi wa asleep who wa onli banish not destroy death wa ever present becaus the númenorean still as they had in their old kingdom and so lost it hunger after endless life unchang king made tomb more splendid than hous of the live and count old name in the roll of their descent dearer than the name of son childless lord sat in age hall muse on heraldri in secret chamber wither men compound strong elixir or in high cold tower ask question of the star and the last king of the line of anárion had no heir but the steward were wiser and more fortun wiser for they recruit the strength of our peopl from the sturdi folk of the seacoast and from the hardi mountain of ere nimrai and they made a truce with the proud peopl of the north who often had assail us men of fierc valour but our kin from afar off unlik the wild easterl or the cruel haradrim so it came to pass in the day of cirion the twelfth steward and my father is the sit and twentieth that they rode to our aid and at the great field of celebr they destroy our enemi that had seiz our northern provinc these are the rohirrim as we name them master of hors and we cede to them the field of calenardhon that are sinc call rohan for that provinc had long been spars peopl and they becam our alli and have ever prove true to us aid us at need and guard our northern march and the gap of rohan of our lore and manner they have learn what they would and their lord speak our speech at need yet for the most part they hold by the way of their own father and to their own memori and they speak among themselv their own north tongu and we love them tall men and fair women valiant both alik goldenhair brightey and strong they remind us of the youth of men as they were in the elder day inde it is said by our loremast that they have from of old thi affin with us that they are come from those same three hous of men as were the númenorean in their begin not from hador the goldenhair the elffriend mayb yet from such of hi son and peopl as went not over sea into the west refus the call for so we reckon men in our lore call them the high or men of the west which were númenorean and the middl peopl men of the twilight such as are the rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far in the north and the wild the men of dark yet now if the rohirrim are grown in some way more like to us enhanc in art and gentl we too have becom more like to them and can scarc claim ani longer the titl high we are becom middl men of the twilight but with memori of other thing for as the rohirrim do we now love war and valour as thing good in themselv both a sport and an end and though we still hold that a warrior should have more skill and knowledg than onli the craft of weapon and slay we esteem a warrior nonetheless abov men of other craft such is the need of our day so even wa my brother boromir a man of prowess and for that he wa account the best man in gondor and veri valiant inde he wa no heir of mina tirith ha for long year been so hardi in toil so onward into battl or blown a mightier note on the great horn faramir sigh and fell silent for a while you dont say much in all your tale about the elv sir said sam suddenli pluck up courag he had note that faramir seem to refer to elv with rever and thi even more than hi courtesi and hi food and wine had won sam respect and quiet hi suspicion no inde master samwis said faramir for i am not learn in elvenlor but there you touch upon anoth point in which we have chang declin from númenor to middleearth for as you may know if mithrandir wa your companion and you have spoken with elrond the edain the father of the númenorean fought besid the elv in the first war and were reward by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the sea within sight of elvenhom but in middleearth men and elv becam estrang in the day of dark by the art of the enemi and by the slow chang of time in which each kind walk further down their sunder road men now fear and misdoubt the elv and yet know littl of them and we of gondor grow like other men like the men of rohan for even they who are the foe of the dark lord shun the elv and speak of the golden wood with dread yet there are among us still some who have deal with the elv when they may and ever and anon one will go in secret to lórien seldom to return not i for i deem it peril now for mortal man wil to seek out the elder peopl yet i envi you that have spoken with the white ladi the ladi of lórien galadriel cri sam you should see her inde you should sir i am onli a hobbit and garden my job at home sir if you understand me and im not much good at poetri – not at make it a bit of a comic rhyme perhap now and again you know but not real poetri – so i cant tell you what i mean it ought to be sung youd have to get strider aragorn that is or old mr bilbo for that but i wish i could make a song about her beauti she is sir love sometim like a great tree in flower sometim like a white daffadowndilli small and slender like hard as dimond soft as moonlight warm as sunlight cold as frost in the star proud and faroff as a snowmountain and as merri as ani lass i ever saw with daisi in her hair in springtim but that a lot o nonsens and all wide of my mark then she must be love inde said faramir peril fair i dont know about peril said sam it strike me that folk take their peril with them into lórien and find it there becaus theyv brought it but perhap you could call her peril becaus she so strong in herself you you could dash yourself to piec on her like a ship on a rock or drownd yourself like a hobbit in a river but neither rock nor river would be to blame now boro – he stop and went red in the face ye now boromiry would say said faramir what would you say he took hi peril with him ye sir beg your pardon and a fine man as your brother wa if i may say so but youv been warm on the scent all along now i watch boromir and listen to him from rivendel all down the road – look after my master as youll understand and not mean ani harm to boromir – and it my opinion that in lórien he first saw clearli what i guess sooner what he want from the moment he first saw it he want the enemi ring sam cri frodo aghast he had fallen deep into hi own thought for a while and came out of them suddenli and too late save me said sam turn white and then flush scarlet there i go again when ever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it the gaffer use to say to me and right enough o dear o dear now look here

becom a dazzl veil of silk and pearl and silver thread melt icicl of moonlight but he did not paus to admir it and turn asid he follow hi master through the narrow doorway in the wall of the cave they went first along a black passag then up mani wet step and so came to a small flat land cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky gleam high abov through a long deep shaft from here two flight of step led one go on as it seem up on to the high bank of the stream the other turn away to the left thi they follow it wound it way up like a turretstair at last they came out of the stoni dark and look

forc of water fleck with foam and curl and rush almost at their feet it plung sheer over the edg that yawn upon their left a man stood there near the brink silent gaze down frodo turn to watch the sleek neck of the water as they curv and dive then he lift hi eye and gaze far away the world wa quiet and cold as if dawn were near far off in the west the full moon wa sink round and white pale mist

the voic of faramir order them to be uncov they stood under the bough of the wood again no nois of the fall could be heard for a long southward slope lay now between them and the ravin in which the stream flow to the west they could see light through the tree as if the world came there to a sudden end at a brink look out onli on to sky here is the last part of our way said faramir if you take my counsel you will not turn eastward yet go straight on for thu you will have the cover of the woodland for mani mile on your west is an edg where the land fall into the great vale sometim suddenli and sheer sometim in long hillsid keep near to thi edg and the skirt of the forest in the begin of your journey you may walk under daylight i think the land dream in a fals peac and for a while all evil

men he said they bow to the ground then he turn and without look back he left them and went to hi two guard that stood at a littl distanc away they marvel to see with what speed these greenclad men now move vanish almost in the twinkl of an eye the forest where faramir had stood seem empti and drear as if a dream had pass frodo sigh and turn back southward as if to mark hi disregard of all such courtesi gollum wa scrabbl in the mould at the foot of a tree hungri again alreadi thought sam well now for it again have they gone at last said gollum nassti wick men sméagol neck still hurt him ye it doe let go ye let us go said frodo but if you can onli speak ill of those who show you merci keep silent nice master said gollum sméagol wa onli joke alway forgiv he doe ye ye even nice master littl tricks oh ye nice master nice sméagol frodo and sam did not answer hoist their pack and take their stave in hand they pass on into the wood of ithilien twice that day they rest and took a littl of the food provid by faramir dri fruit and salt meat enough for mani day and bread enough to last while it wa still fresh gollum ate noth the sun rose and pass overhead unseen and began to sink and the light through the tree to the west grew golden and alway they walk in cool green shadow and all about them wa silenc the bird seem all to have flown away or to have fallen dumb dark came earli to the silent wood and befor the fall of night they halt weari for they had walk seven leagu or more from henneth annûn frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an ancient tree sam besid him wa more uneasi he woke mani time but there wa never a sign of gollum who had slip off as soon as the other had settl to rest whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearbi or had wander restlessli prowl through the night he did not say but he return with the first glimmer of light and rous hi companion must get up ye they must he said long way to go still south and east hobbit must make hast that day pass much as the day befor had gone except that the silenc seem deeper the air grew heavi and it began to be stifl under the tree it felt as if thunder wa brew gollum often paus snif the air and then he would mutter to himself and urg them to greater speed as the third stage of their day march drew on and afternoon wane the forest open out and the tree becam larger and more scatter great ilex of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide glade with here and there among them hoari ashtre and giant oak just put out their browngreen bud about them lay long laund of green grass dappl with celandin and anemon white and blue now fold for sleep and there were acr popul with the leav of woodland hyacinth alreadi their sleek bellstem were thrust through the mould no live creatur beast or bird wa to be seen but in these open place gollum grew afraid and they walk now with caution flit from one long shadow to anoth light wa fade fast when they came to the forestend there they sat under an old gnarl oak that sent it root twist like snake down a steep crumbl bank a deep dim valley lay befor them on it further side the wood gather again blue and grey under the sullen even and march on southward to the right the mountain of gondor glow remot in the west under a firefleck sky to the left lay dark the tower wall of mordor and out of that dark the long valley came fall steepli in an everwiden trough toward the anduin at it bottom ran a hurri stream frodo could hear it stoni voic come up through the silenc and besid it on the hither side a road went wind down like a pale ribbon down into chill grey mist that no gleam of sunset touch there it seem to frodo that he descri far off float as it were on a shadowi sea the high dim top and broken pinnacl of old tower forlorn and dark he turn to gollum do you know where we are he said ye master danger place thi is the road from the tower of the moon master down to the ruin citi by the shore of the river the ruin citi ye veri nasti place full of enemi we shouldnt have taken men advic hobbit have come a long way out of the path must go east now away up there he wave hi skinni arm toward the darkl mountain and we cant use thi road oh no cruel peopl come thi way down from the tower frodo look down on to the road at ani rate noth wa move on it now it appear lone and forsaken run down to empti ruin in the mist but there wa an evil feel in the air as if thing might inde be pass up and down that eye could not see frodo shudder as he look again at the distant pinnacl now dwindl into night and the sound of the water seem cold and cruel the voic of morgulduin the pollut stream that flow from the valley of the wraith what shall we do he said we have walk long and far shall we look for some place in the wood behind where we can lie hidden no good hide in the dark said gollum it in day that hobbit must hide now ye in day oh come said sam we must rest for a bit even if we get up again in the middl of the night therel still be hour of dark then time enough for you to take us a long march if you know the way gollum reluctantli agre to thi and he turn back toward the tree work eastward for a while along the straggl edg of the wood he would not rest on the ground so near the evil road and after some debat they all climb up into the crotch of a larg holmoak whose thick branch spring togeth from the trunk made a good hidingplac and a fairli comfort refug night fell and it grew altogeth dark under the canopi of the tree frodo and sam drank a littl water and ate some bread and dri fruit but gollum at onc curl up and went to sleep the hobbit did not shut their eye it must have been a littl after midnight when gollum woke up suddenli they were awar of hi pale eye unlid gleam at them he listen and snif which seem as they had notic befor hi usual method of discov the time of night are we rest have we had beauti sleep he said let go we arent and we havent growl sam but well go if we must gollum drop at onc from the branch of the tree on to all four and the hobbit follow more slowli as soon as they were down they went on again with gollum lead eastward up the dark slope land they could see littl for the night wa now so deep that they were hardli awar of the stem of tree befor they stumbl against them the ground becam more broken and walk wa more difficult but gollum seem in no way troubl he led them through thicket and wast of brambl sometim round the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit sometim down into black bushshroud hollow and out again but if ever they went a littl downward alway the further slope wa longer and steeper they were climb steadili at their first halt they look back and they could dimli perceiv the roof of the forest they had left behind lie like a vast dens shadow a darker night under the dark blank sky there seem to be a great black loom slowli out of the east eat up the faint blur star later the sink moon escap from the pursu cloud but it wa ring all about with a sickli yellow glare at last gollum turn to the hobbit day soon he said hobbit must hurri not safe to stay in the open in these place make hast he quicken hi pace and they follow him wearili soon they began to climb up on to a great hogback of land for the most part it wa cover with a thick growth of gors and whortleberri and low tough thorn though here and there clear open the scar of recent fire the gorsebush becam more frequent as they got nearer the top veri old and tall they were gaunt and leggi below but thick abov and alreadi put out yellow flower that glimmer in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent so tall were the spini thicket that the hobbit could walk upright under them pass through long dri aisl carpet with a deep prickli mould on the further edg of thi broad hillback they stay their march and crawl for hide underneath a tangl knot of thorn their twist bough stoop to the ground were overridden by a clamber maze of old briar deep insid there wa a hollow hall rafter with dead branch and brambl and roof with the first leav and shoot of spring there they lay for a while too tire yet to eat and peer out through the hole in the covert they watch for the slow growth of day but no day came onli a dead brown twilight in the east there wa a dull red glare under the lower cloud it wa not the red of dawn across the tumbl land between the mountain of the ephel dúath frown at them black and shapeless below where night lay thick and did not pass away abov with jag top and edg outlin hard and menac against the fieri glow away to their right a great shoulder of the mountain stood out dark and black amid the shadow thrust westward which way do we go from here ask frodo is that the open ofof the morgul valley away over there beyond that black mass need we think about it yet said sam sure were not go to move ani more today if day it is perhap not perhap not said gollum but we must go soon to the crossroad ye to the crossroad that the way over there ye master the red glare over mordor die away the twilight deepen as great vapour rose in the east and crawl abov them frodo and sam took a littl food and then lay down but gollum wa restless he would not eat ani of their food but he drank a littl water and then crawl about under the bush snif and mutter then suddenli he disappear off hunt i suppos said sam and yawn it wa hi turn to sleep first and he wa soon deep in a dream he thought he wa back in the bag end garden look for someth but he had a heavi pack on hi back which made him stoop it all seem veri weedi and rank

there hope as my gaffer use to say and need of vittl as he mostway use to add you have a bite mr frodo and then a bit of sleep the afternoon as sam suppos it must be call wore on look out from the covert he could see onli a dun shadowless world fade slowli into a featureless colourless gloom it felt stifl but not warm frodo slept unquietli turn and toss and sometim murmur twice sam thought he heard him speak gandalf name the time seem to drag intermin suddenli sam heard a hiss behind him and there wa gollum on all four peer at them with gleam eye wake up wake up wake up sleepi he whisper wake up no time to lose we must go ye we must go at onc no time to lose sam stare at him suspici he seem frighten or excit go now what your littl game it isnt time yet it cant be teatim even leastway not in decent place where there is teatim silli hiss gollum were not in decent place time run short ye run fast no time to lose we must go wake up master wake u he claw at frodo and frodo startl out

been and what he thought wa brew to make him in such a hurri he would not say sam wa fill with deep suspicion and show it but frodo gave no sign of what wa pass in hi mind he sigh hoist hi pack and prepar to go out into the evergath dark veri stealthili gollum led them down the hillsid keep under cover wherev it wa possibl and run almost bent to the ground across ani open space but the light wa now so dim that even a keeney beast of the wild could scarc have seen the hobbit hood in their grey cloak nor heard them walk as warili as the littl peopl can without the crack of a twig or the rustl of a leaf they pass and vanish for about an hour they went on silent in singl file oppress by the gloom and by the absolut still of the land broken onli now and again by the faint rumbl as of thunder far away or drumbeat in some hollow of the hill down from their hidingplac they went and then turn south they steer as straight a cours as gollum could find across a long broken slope that lean up toward the mountain present not far ahead loom up like a black wall they saw a belt of tree as they drew nearer they becam awar that these were of vast size veri ancient it seem and still tower high though their top were gaunt and broken as if tempest and lightningblast had swept across them but had fail to kill them or to shake their fathomless root the crossroad ye whisper gollum the first word that had been spoken sinc they left their hidingplac we must go that way turn eastward now he led them up the slope and then suddenli there it wa befor them the southward road wind it way about the outer feet of the mountain until present it plung into the great ring of tree thi is the onli way whisper gollum no path beyond the road no path we must go to the crossroad but make hast be silent as furtiv as scout within the campment of their enemi they crept down on to the road and stole along it westward edg under the stoni bank grey as the stone themselv and softfoot as hunt cat at length they reach the tree and found that they stood in a great roofless ring open in the middl to the sombr sky and the space between their immens bole were like the great dark arch of some ruin hall in the veri centr four way met behind them lay the road to the morannon befor them it ran out again upon it long journey south to their right the road from old osgiliath came climb up and cross pass out eastward into dark the fourth way the road they were to take stand there for a moment fill with dread frodo becam awar that a light wa shine he saw it glow on sam face besid him turn toward it he saw beyond an arch of bough the road to osgiliath run almost as straight as a stretch ribbon down down into the west there far away beyond sad gondor now overwhelm in shade the sun wa sink find at last the hem of the great slowrol pall of cloud and fall in an omin fire toward the yet unsulli sea the brief glow fell upon a huge sit figur still and solemn as the great stone king of argonath the year had gnaw it and violent hand had maim it it head wa gone and in it place wa set in mockeri a round roughhewn stone rude paint by savag hand in the like of a grin face with one larg red eye in the midst of it forehead upon it knee and mighti chair and all about the pedest were idl scrawl mix with the foul symbol that the maggotfolk of mordor use suddenli caught by the level beam frodo saw the old king head it wa lie roll away by the roadsid look sam he cri startl into speech look the king ha got a crown again the eye were hollow and the carven beard wa broken but about the high stern forehead there wa a coron of silver and gold a trail plant with flower like small white star had bound itself across the brow as if in rever for the fallen king and in the crevic of hi stoni hair yellow stonecrop gleam they can not conquer for ever said frodo and then suddenli the brief glimps wa gone the sun dip and vanish and as if at the shutter of a lamp black night fell chapter the stair of cirith ungol gollum wa tug at frodo cloak and hiss with fear and impati we must go he said we mustnt stand here make hast reluctantli frodo turn hi back on the west and follow as hi guid led him out into the dark of the east they left the ring of tree and crept along the road toward the mountain thi road too ran straight for a while but soon it began to bend away southward until it came right under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distanc black and forbid it loom abov them darker than the dark sky behind crawl under it shadow the road went on and round it sprang east again and began to climb steepli frodo and sam were plod along with heavi heart no longer abl to care greatli about their peril frodo head wa bow hi burden wa drag him down again as soon as the great crossroad had been pass the weight of it almost forgotten in ithilien had begun to grow onc more now feel the way becom steep befor hi feet he look wearili up and then he saw it even as gollum had said that he would the citi of the ringwraith he cower against the stoni bank a longtilt valley a deep gulf of shadow ran back far into the mountain upon the further side some way within the valley arm high on a rocki seat upon the black knee of the ephel dúath stood the wall and tower of mina morgul all wa dark about it earth and sky but it wa lit with light not the imprison moonlight well through the marbl wall of mina ithil long ago tower of the moon fair and radiant in the hollow of the hill paler inde than the moon ail in some slow eclips wa the light of it now waver and blow like a noisom exhal of decay a corpselight a light that illumin noth in the wall and tower window show like countless black hole look inward into empti but the topmost cours of the tower revolv slowli first one way and then anoth a huge ghostli head leer into the night for a moment the three companion stood there shrink stare up with unwil eye gollum wa the first to recov again he pull at their cloak urgent but he spoke no word almost he drag them forward everi step wa reluct and time seem to slow it pace so that between the rais of a foot and the set of it down minut of loath pass so they came slowli to the white bridg here the road gleam faintli pass over the stream in the midst of the valley and went on wind devious up toward the citi gate a black mouth open in the outer circl of the northward wall wide flat lay on either bank shadowi mead fill with pale white flower lumin these were too beauti and yet horribl of shape like the dement form in an uneasi dream and they gave forth a faint sicken charnelsmel an odour of rotten fill the air from mead to mead the bridg sprang figur stood there at it head carven with cun in form human and bestial but all corrupt and loathsom the water flow beneath wa silent and it steam but the vapour that rose from it curl and twist about the bridg wa deadli cold frodo felt hi sens reel and hi mind darken then suddenli as if some forc were at work other than hi own will he began to hurri totter forward hi grope hand held out hi head loll from side to side both sam and gollum ran after him sam caught hi master in hi arm as he stumbl and almost fell right on the threshold of the bridg not that way no not that way whisper gollum but the breath between hi teeth seem to tear the heavi still like a whistl and he cower to the ground in terror hold up mr frodo mutter sam in frodo ear come back not that way gollum say not and for onc i agre with him frodo pass hi hand over hi brow and wrench hi eye away from the citi on the hill the lumin tower fascin him and he fought the desir that wa on him to run up the gleam road toward it gate at last with an effort he turn back and as he did so he felt the ring resist him drag at the chain about hi neck and hi eye too as he look away seem for the moment to have been blind the dark befor him wa impenetr gollum crawl on the ground like a frighten anim wa alreadi vanish into the gloom sam support and guid hi stumbl master follow after him as quickli as he could not far from the near bank of the stream there wa a gap in the stonewal besid the road through thi they pass and sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleam faintli at first as the main road did until climb abov the mead of deadli flower it fade and went dark wind it crook way up into the northern side of the valley along thi path the hobbit trudg side by side unabl to see gollum in front of them except when he turn back to beckon them on then hi eye shone with a greenwhit light reflect the noisom morgulsheen perhap or kindl by some answer mood within of that deadli gleam and of the dark eyehol frodo and sam were alway consciou ever glanc fear over their shoulder and ever drag their eye back to find the darken path slowli they labour on as they rose abov the stench and vapour of the poison stream their breath becam easier and their head clearer but now their limb were deadli tire as if they had walk all night under a burden or had been swim long against a heavi tide of water at last they could go no further without a halt frodo stop and sat down on a stone they had now climb up to the top of a great hump of bare rock ahead of them there wa a bay in the valleysid and round the head of thi the path went on no more than a wide ledg with a chasm on the right across the sheer southward face of the mountain it crawl upward until it disappear into the black abov i must rest a while sam whisper frodo it heavi on me sam lad veri heavi i wonder how far i can carri it anyway i must rest befor we ventur on to that he point to the narrow way ahead sssh ssh hiss gollum hurri back to them sssh hi finger were on hi lip and he shook hi head urgent tug at frodo sleev he point toward the path but frodo would not move not yet he said not yet weari and more than weari oppress him it seem as if a heavi spell wa laid on hi mind and bodi i must rest he mutter at thi gollum fear and agit becam so great that he spoke again hiss behind hi hand as if to keep the sound from unseen listen in the air not here no not rest here fool eye can see us when they come to the bridg they will see us come away climb climb come come mr frodo said sam he right again we cant stay here all right said frodo in a remot voic as of one speak half asleep i will tri wearili he got to hi feet but it wa too late at that moment the rock quiver and trembl beneath them the great rumbl nois louder than ever befor roll in the ground and echo in the mountain then with sear sudden there came a great red flash far beyond the eastern mountain it leapt into the sky and splash the lower cloud with crimson in that valley of shadow and cold deathli light it seem unbear violent and fierc peak of stone and ridg like notch knive sprang out in stare black against the uprush flame in gorgoroth then came a great crack of thunder and mina morgul answer there wa a flare of livid lightn fork of blue flame spring up from the tower and from the encircl hill into the sullen cloud the earth groan and out of the citi there came a cri mingl with harsh high voic as of bird of prey and the shrill neigh of hors wild with rage and fear there came a rend screech shiver rise swiftli to a pierc pitch beyond the rang of hear the hobbit wheel round toward it and cast themselv down hold their hand upon their ear as the terribl cri end fall back through a long sicken wail to silenc frodo slowli rais hi head across the narrow valley now almost on a level with hi eye the wall of the evil citi stood and it cavern gate shape like an open mouth with gleam teeth wa gape wide and out of the gate an armi came all that host wa clad in sabl dark as the night against the wan wall and the lumin pavement of the road frodo could see them small black figur in rank upon rank march swiftli and silent pass outward in an endless stream befor them went a great cavalri of horsemen move like order shadow and at their head wa one greater than all the rest a rider all black save that on hi hood head he had a helm like a crown that flicker with a peril light now he wa draw near the bridg below and frodo stare eye follow him unabl to wink or to withdraw sure there wa the lord of the nine rider return to earth to lead hi ghastli host to battl here ye here inde wa the haggard king whose cold hand had smitten down the ringbear with hi deadli knife the old wound throb with pain and a great chill spread toward frodo heart even as these thought pierc him with dread and held him bound as with a spell the rider halt suddenli right befor the entranc of the bridg and behind him all the host stood still there wa a paus a dead silenc mayb it wa the ring that call to the wraithlord and for a moment he wa troubl sens some other power within hi valley thi way and that turn the dark head helm and crown with fear sweep the shadow with it unseen eye frodo wait like a bird at the approach of a snake unabl to move and as he wait he felt more urgent than ever befor the command that he should put on the ring but great as the pressur wa he felt no inclin now to yield to it he knew that the ring would onli betray him and that he had not even if he put it on the power to face the morgulkingnot yet there wa no longer ani answer to that command in hi own will dismay by terror though it wa and he felt onli the beat upon him of a great power from outsid it took hi hand and as frodo watch with hi mind not will it but in suspens as if he look on some old stori far away it move the hand inch by inch toward the chain upon hi neck then hi own will stir slowli it forc the hand back and set it to find anoth thing a thing lie hidden near hi breast cold and hard it seem as hi grip close on it the phial of galadriel so long treasur and almost forgotten till that hour as he touch it for a while all thought of the ring wa banish from hi mind he sigh and bent hi head at that moment the wraithk turn and spur hi hors and rode across the bridg and all hi dark host follow him mayb the elvenhood defi hi unseen eye and the mind of hi small enemi be strengthen had turn asid hi thought but he wa in hast alreadi the hour had struck and at hi great master bid he must march with war into the west soon he had pass like a shadow into shadow down the wind road and behind him still the black rank cross the bridg so great an armi had never issu from that vale sinc the day of isildur might no host so fell and strong in arm had yet assail the ford of anduin and yet it wa but one and not the greatest of the host that mordor now sent forth frodo stir and suddenli hi heart went out to faramir the storm ha burst at last he thought thi great array of spear and sword is go to osgiliath will faramir get across in time he guess it but did he know the hour and who can now hold the ford when the king of the nine rider come and other armi will come i am too late all is lost i tarri on the way all is lost even if my errand is perform no one will ever know there will be no one i can tell it will be in vain overcom with weak he wept and still the host of morgul cross the bridg then at a great distanc as if it came out of memori of the shire some sunlit earli morn when the day call and door were open he heard sam voic speak wake up mr frodo wake up had the voic ad your breakfast is readi he would hardli have been surpris certainli sam wa urgent wake up mr frodo theyr gone he said there wa a dull clang the gate of mina morgul had close the last rank of spear had vanish down the road the tower still grin across the valley but the light wa fade in it the whole citi wa fall back into a dark brood shade and silenc yet still it wa fill with watch wake up mr frodo theyr gone and wed better go too there someth still aliv in that place someth with eye or a see mind if you take me and the longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us come on mr frodo frodo rais hi head and then stood up despair had not left him but the weak had pass he even smile grimli feel now as clearli as a moment befor he had felt the opposit that what he had to do he had to do if he could and that whether faramir or aragorn or elrond or galadriel or gandalf or anyon els ever knew about it wa besid the purpos he took hi staff in one hand and the phial in hi other when he saw that the clear light wa alreadi well through hi finger he thrust it into hi bosom and held it against hi heart then turn from the citi of morgul now no more than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf he prepar to take the upward road gollum it seem had crawl off along the ledg into the dark beyond when the gate of mina morgul open leav the hobbit where they lay he now came creep back hi teeth chatter and hi finger snap foolish silli he hiss make hast they mustnt think danger ha pass it hasnt make hast they did not answer but they follow him on to the climb ledg it wa littl to the like of either of them not even after face so mani other peril but it did not last long soon the path reach a round angl where the mountainsid swell out again and there it suddenli enter a narrow open in the rock they had come to the first stair that gollum had spoken of the dark wa almost complet and they could see noth much beyond their hand stretch but gollum eye shone pale sever feet abov as he turn back toward them care he whisper step lot of step must be care care wa certainli need frodo and sam at first felt easier have now a wall on either side but the stairway wa almost as steep as a ladder and as they climb up and up they becam more and more awar of the long black fall behind them and the step were narrow space unevenli and often treacher they were worn and smooth at the edg and some were broken and some crack as foot wa set upon them the hobbit struggl on until at last they were cling with desper finger to the step ahead and forc their ach knee to bend and straighten and ever as the stair cut it way deeper into the sheer mountain the rocki wall rose higher and higher abov their head at length just as they felt that they could endur no more they saw gollum eye peer down at them again were up he whisper first stair past clever hobbit to climb so high veri clever hobbit just a few more littl step and that all ye dizzi and veri tire sam and frodo follow him crawl up the last step and sat down rub their leg and knee they were in a deep dark passag that seem still to go up befor them though at a gentler slope and without step gollum did not let them rest long there anoth stair still he said much longer stair rest when we get to the top of next stair not yet sam groan longer did you say he ask ye yess longer said gollum but not so difficult hobbit have climb the straight stair next come the wind stair and what after that said sam we shall see said gollum softli o ye we shall see i thought you said there wa a tunnel said sam isnt there a tunnel or someth to go through o ye there a tunnel said gollum but hobbit can rest befor they tri that if they get through that theyll be nearli at the top veri nearli if they get through o ye frodo shiver the climb had made him sweat but now he felt cold and clammi and there wa a chill draught in the dark passag blow down from the invis height abov he got up and shook himself well let go on he said thi is no place to sit in the passag seem to go on for mile and alway the chill air flow over them rise as they went on to a bitter wind the mountain seem to be tri with their deadli breath to daunt them to turn them back from the secret of the high place or to blow them away into the dark behind they onli knew that they had come to the end when suddenli they felt no wall at their right hand they could see veri littl great black shapeless mass and deep grey shadow loom abov them and about them but now and again a dull red light flicker up under the lower cloud and for a moment they were awar of tall peak in front and on either side like pillar hold up a vast sag roof they seem to have climb up mani hundr of feet on to a wide shelf a cliff wa on their left and a chasm on their right gollum led the way close under the cliff for the present they were no longer climb but the ground wa now more broken and danger in the dark and there were block and lump of fallen stone in the way their go wa slow and cautiou how mani hour had pass sinc they had enter the morgul vale neither sam nor frodo could ani longer guess the night seem endless at length they were onc more awar of a wall loom up and onc more a stairway open befor them again they halt and again they began to climb it wa a long and weari ascent but thi stairway did not delv into the mountainsid here the huge cliff face slope backward and the path like a snake wound to and fro across it at one point it crawl sideway right to the edg of the dark chasm and frodo glanc down saw below him as a vast deep pit the great ravin at the head of the morgul valley down in it depth glimmer like a glowworm thread the wraithroad from the dead citi to the nameless pass he turn hastili away still on and up the stairway bent and crawl until at last with a final flight short and straight it climb out again on to anoth level the path had veer away from the main pass in the great ravin and it now follow it own peril cours at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the higher region of the ephel dúath dimli the hobbit could discern tall pier and jag pinnacl of stone on either side between which were great crevic and fissur blacker than the night where forgotten winter had gnaw and carv the sunless stone and now the red light in the sky seem stronger though they could not tell whether a dread morn were inde come to thi place of shadow or whether they saw onli the flame of some great violenc of sauron in the torment of gorgoroth beyond still far ahead and still high abov frodo look up saw as he guess the veri crown of thi bitter road against the sullen red of the eastern sky a cleft wa outlin in the topmost ridg narrow deepcloven between two black shoulder and on either shoulder wa a horn of stone he paus and look more attent the horn upon the left wa tall and slender and in it burn a red light or els the red light in the land beyond wa shine through a hole he saw now it wa a black tower pois abov the outer pass he touch sam arm and point i dont like the look of that said sam so thi secret way of your is guard after all he growl turn to gollum as you knew all along i suppos all way are watch ye said gollum of cours they are but hobbit must tri some way thi may be least watch perhap theyv all gone away to big battl perhap perhap grunt sam well it still seem a long way off and a long way up befor we get there and there still the tunnel i think you ought to rest now mr frodo i dont know what time of day or night it is but weve kept go for hour and hour ye we must rest said frodo let us find some corner out of the wind and gather our strengthfor the last lap for so he felt it to be the terror of the land beyond and the deed to be done there seem remot too far off yet to troubl him all hi mind wa bent on get through or over thi impenetr wall and guard if onc he could do that imposs thing then somehow the errand would be accomplish or so it seem to him in that dark hour of weari still labour in the stoni shadow under cirith ungol in a dark crevic between two great pier of rock they sat down frodo and sam a littl way within and gollum crouch upon the ground near the open there the hobbit took what they expect would be their last meal befor they went down into the nameless land mayb the last meal they would ever eat togeth some of the food of gondor they ate and wafer of the waybread of the elv and they drank a littl but of their water they were spare and took onli enough to moisten their dri mouth i wonder when well find water again said sam but i suppos even over there they drink orc drink dont they ye they drink said frodo but do not let us speak of that such drink is not for us then all the more need to fill our bottl said sam but there isnt ani water up here not a sound or a trickl have i heard and anyway faramir said we were not to drink ani water in morgul no water flow out of imlad morgul were hi word said frodo we are not in that valley now and if we came on a spring it would be flow into it and not out of it i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i wa die of thirst there a wick feel about thi place he snif and a smell i fanci do you notic it a queer kind of a smell stuffi i dont like it i dont like anyth here at all said frodo step or stone breath or bone earth air and water all seem accurs but so our path is laid ye that so said sam and we shouldnt be here at all if wed known more about it befor we start but i suppos it often that way the brave thing in the old tale and song mr frodo adventur as i use to call them i use to think that they were thing the wonder folk of the stori went out and look for becaus they want them becaus they were excit and life wa a bit dull a kind of a sport as you might say but that not the way of it with the tale that realli matter or the one that stay in the mind folk seem to have been just land in them usual – their path were laid that way as you put it but i expect they had lot of chanc like us of turn back onli they didnt and if they had we shouldnt know becaus theyd have been forgotten we hear about those as just went on – and not all to a good end mind you at least not to what folk insid a stori and not outsid it call a good end you know come home and find thing all right though not quit the same – like old mr bilbo but those arent alway the best tale to hear though they may be the best tale to get land in i wonder what sort of a tale weve fallen into i wonder said frodo but i dont know and that the way of a real tale take ani one that your fond of you may know or guess what kind of a tale it is happyend or sadend but the peopl in it dont know and you dont want them to no sir of cours not beren now he never thought he wa go to get that silmaril from the iron crown in thangorodrim and yet he did and that wa a wors place and a blacker danger than our but that a long tale of cours and goe on past the happi and into grief and beyond it – and the silmaril went on and came to eärendil and whi sir i never thought of that befor weve got – youv got some of the light of it in that starglass that the ladi gave you whi to think of it were in the same tale still it go on dont the great tale never end no they never end as tale said frodo but the peopl in them come and go when their part end our part will end later – or sooner and then we can have some rest and some sleep said sam he laugh grimli and i mean just that mr frodo i mean plain ordinari rest and sleep and wake up to a morn work in the garden im afraid that all im hope for all the time all the big import plan are not for my sort still i wonder if we shall ever be put into song or tale were in one or cours but i mean put into word you know told by the firesid or read out of a great big book with red and black letter year and year afterward and peopl will say let hear about frodo and the ring and theyll say ye that one of my favourit stori frodo wa veri brave wasnt he dad ye my boy the famousest of the hobbit and that say a lot it say a lot too much said frodo and he laugh a long clear laugh from hi heart such a sound had not been heard in those place sinc sauron came to middleearth to sam suddenli it seem as if all the stone were listen and the tall rock lean over them but frodo did not heed them he laugh again whi sam he said to hear you somehow make me as merri as if the stori wa alreadi written but youv left out one of the chief charact samwis the stoutheart i want to hear more about sam dad whi didnt they put in more of hi talk dad that what i like it make me laugh and frodo wouldnt have got far without sam would he dad now mr frodo said sam you shouldnt make fun i wa seriou so wa i said frodo and so i am were go on a bit too fast you and i sam are still stuck in the worst place of the stori and it is all too like that some will say at thi point shut the book now dad we dont want to read ani more mayb said sam but i wouldnt be one to say that thing done and over and made into part of the great tale are differ whi even gollum might be good in a tale better than he is to have by you anyway and he use to like tale himself onc by hi own account i wonder if he think he the hero or the villain gollum he call would you like to be the hero – now where he got to again there wa no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadow near he had refus their food though he had as usual accept a mouth of water and then he had seem to curl up for a sleep they had suppos that one at ani rate of hi object in hi long absenc the day befor had been to hunt for food to hi own like and now he had evid slip off again while they talk but what for thi time i dont like hi sneak off without say said sam and least of all now he cant be look for food up here not unless there some kind of rock he fanci whi there isnt even a bit of moss it no good worri about him now said frodo we couldnt have got so far not even within sight of the pass without him and so well have to put up with hi way if he fals he fals all the same id rather have him under my eye said sam all the more so if he fals do you rememb he never would say if thi pass wa guard or no and now we see a tower there – and it may be desert and it may not do you think he gone to fetch them orc or whatev they are no i dont think so answer frodo even if he up to some wicked and i suppos that not unlik i dont think it that not to fetch orc or ani servant of the enemi whi wait till now and go through all the labour of the climb and come so near the land he fear he could probabl have betray us to orc mani time sinc we met him no if it anyth it will be some littl privat trick of hi ownthat he think is quit secret well i suppos your right mr frodo said sam not that it comfort me mightili i dont make no mistak i dont doubt hed hand me over to orc as gladli as kiss hi hand but i wa forget – hi preciou no i suppos the whole time it been the preciou for poor sméagol that the one idea in all hi littl scheme if he ha ani but how bring us up here will help him in that is more than i can guess veri like he cant guess himself said frodo and i dont think he got just one plain scheme in hi muddl head i think he realli is in part tri to save the preciou from the enemi as long as he can for that would be the last disast for himself too if the enemi got it and in the other part perhap he just bide hi time and wait on chanc ye slinker and stinker as ive said befor said sam but the nearer they get to the enemi land the more like stinker slinker will get mark my word if ever we get to the pass he wont let us realli take the preciou thing over the border without make some kind of troubl we havent got there yet said frodo no but wed better keep our eye skin till we do if were caught nap stinker will come out on top pretti quick not but what it would be safe for you to have a wink now master safe if you lay close to me id be dearli glad to see you have a sleep id keep watch over you and anyway if you lay near with my arm round you no one could come paw you without your sam know it sleep said frodo and sigh as if out of a desert he had seen a mirag of cool green ye even here i could sleep sleep then master lay your head in my lap and so gollum found them hour later when he return crawl and creep down the path out of the gloom ahead sam sat prop against the stone hi head drop sideway and hi breath heavi in hi lap lay frodo head drown deep in sleep upon hi white forehead lay one of sam brown hand and the other lay softli upon hi master breast peac wa in both their face gollum look at them a strang express pass over hi lean hungri face the gleam fade from hi eye and they went dim and grey old and tire a spasm of pain seem to twist him and he turn away peer back up toward the pass shake hi head as if engag in some interior debat then he came back and slowli put out a trembl hand veri cautious he touch frodo knee – but almost the touch wa a caress for a fleet moment could one of the sleeper have seen him they would have thought that they beheld an old weari hobbit shrunken by the year that had carri him far beyond hi time beyond friend and kin and the field and stream of youth an old starv pitiabl thing but at that touch frodo stir and cri out softli in hi sleep and immedi sam wa wide awak the first thing he saw wa gollum – paw at master as he thought hey you he said roughli what are you up to noth noth said gollum softli nice master i daresay said sam but where have you been to – sneak off and sneak back you old villain gollum withdrew himself and a green glint flicker under hi heavi lid almost spiderlik he look now crouch back on

is thirsti he is ye thirsti and he guid them and he search for path and they say sneak sneak veri nice friend o ye my preciou veri nice sam felt a bit remors though not more trust sorri he said im sorri but you startl me out of my sleep and i shouldnt have been sleep and that made me a bit sharp but mr frodo he that tire i ask him to have a wink and well that how it is sorri but where have you been to sneak said gollum and the green glint did not leav hi eye o veri well said sam have it your own way i dont suppos it so far from the truth and now wed better all be sneak along togeth what the time is it today or tomorrow it tomorrow said gollum or thi wa tomorrow when hobbit went to sleep veri foolish veri dangerousif poor sméagol wasnt sneak about to watch i think we shall get tire of that word soon said sam but never mind ill wake master up gentli he smooth the hair back from frodo brow and bend down spoke softli to him wake up mr frodo wake up frodo stir and open hi eye and smile see sam face bend over him call me earli arent you sam he said it dark still ye it alway dark here said sam but gollum come back mr frodo and he say it tomorrow so we must be walk on the last lap frodo drew a deep breath and sat up the last lap he said hullo sméagol found ani food have you had ani rest no food no rest noth for sméagol said gollum he a sneak sam click hi tongu but restrain himself dont take name to yourself sméagol said frodo it unwis whether they are true or fals sméagol ha to take what given him answer gollum he wa given that name by kind master samwis the hobbit that know so much frodo look at sam ye sir he said i did use the word wake up out of my sleep sudden and all and find him at hand i said i wa sorri but i soon shant be come let it pass then said frodo but now we seem to have come to the point you and i sméagol tell me can we find the rest of the way by ourselv were in sight of the pass of a way in and if we can find it now then i suppos our agreement can be said to be over you have done what you promis and your free free to go back to food and rest wherev you wish to go except to servant of the enemi and one day i may reward you i or those that rememb me no no not yet gollum whine o no they cant find the way themselv can they o no inde there the tunnel come sméagol must go on no rest no food not yet chapter shelob lair it may inde have been daytim now as gollum said but the hobbit could see littl differ unless perhap the heavi sky abov wa less utterli black more like a great roof of smoke while instead of the dark of deep night which linger still in crack and hole a grey blur shadow shroud the stoni world about them they pass on gollum in front and the hobbit now side by side up the long ravin between the pier and column of torn and weather rock stand like huge unshapen statu on either hand there wa no sound some way ahead a mile or so perhap wa a great grey wall a last huge upthrust mass of mountainston darker it loom and steadili it rose as they approach until it tower up high abov them shut out the view of all that lay beyond deep shadow lay befor it feet sam snif the air ugh that smell he said it get stronger and stronger present they were under the shadow and there in the midst of it they saw the open of a cave thi is the way in said gollum softli thi is the entranc to the tunnel he did not speak it name torech ungol shelob lair out of it came a stench not the sickli odour of decay in the mead of morgul but a foul reek as if filth unnam were pile and hoard in the dark within is thi the onli way sméagol said frodo ye ye he answer ye we must go thi way now dyou mean to say youv been through thi hole said sam phew but perhap you dont mind bad smell gollum eye glint he doesnt know what we mind doe he preciou no he doesnt but sméagol can bear thing ye he been through o ye right through it the onli way and what make the smell i wonder said sam it like – well i wouldnt like to say some beastli hole of the orc ill warrant with a hundr year of their filth in it well said frodo orc or no if it the onli way we must take it draw a deep breath they pass insid in a few step they were in utter and impenetr dark not sinc the lightless passag of moria had frodo or sam known such dark and if possibl here it wa deeper and denser there there were air move and echo and a sens of space here the air wa still stagnant heavi and sound fell dead they walk as it were in a black vapour wrought of verit dark itself that as it wa breath brought blind not onli to the eye but to the mind so that even the memori of colour and of form and of ani light fade out of thought night alway had been and alway would be and night wa all but for a while they could still feel and inde the sens of their feet and finger at first seem sharpen almost pain the wall felt to their surpris smooth and the floor save for a step now and again wa straight and even go ever up at the same stiff slope the tunnel wa high and wide so wide that though the hobbit walk abreast onli touch the sidewal with their outstretch hand they were separ cut off alon in the dark gollum had gone in first and seem to be onli a few step ahead while they were still abl to give heed to such thing they could hear hi breath hiss and gasp just in front of them but after a time their sens becam duller both touch and hear seem to grow numb and they kept on grope walk on and on mainli by the forc of the will with which they had enter will to go through and desir to come at last to the high gate beyond befor they had gone veri far perhap but time and distanc soon pass out of hi reckon sam on the right feel the wall wa awar that there wa an open at the side for a moment he caught a faint breath of some air less heavi and then they pass it by there more than one passag here he whisper with an effort it seem hard to make hi breath give ani sound it as orclik a place as ever there could be after that first he on the right and then frodo on the left pass three or four such open some wider some smaller but there wa as yet no doubt of the main way for it wa straight and did not turn and still went steadili up but how long wa it how much more of thi would they have to endur or could they endur the breathless of the air wa grow as they climb and now they seem often in the blind dark to sens some resist thicker than the foul air as they thrust forward they felt thing brush against their head or against their hand long tentacl or hang growth perhap they could not tell what they were and still the stench grew it grew until almost it seem to them that smell wa the onli clear sens left to them and that wa for their torment one hour two hour three hour how mani had they pass in thi lightless hole hoursday week rather sam left the tunnelsid and shrank toward frodo and their hand met and clasp and so togeth they still went on at length frodo grope along the lefthand wall came suddenli to a void almost he fell sideway into the empti here wa some open in the rock far wider than ani they had yet pass and out of it came a reek so foul and a sens of lurk malic so intens that frodo reel and at that moment sam too lurch and fell forward fight off both the sick and the fear frodo grip sam hand up he said in a hoars breath without voic it all come from here the stench and the peril now for it quick call up hi remain strength and resolut he drag sam to hi feet and forc hi own limb to move sam stumbl besid him one step two step three stepsat last six step mayb they had pass the dread unseen open but whether that wa so or not suddenli it wa easier to move as if some hostil will for the moment had releas them they struggl on still hand in hand but almost at onc they came to a new difficulti the tunnel fork or so it seem and in the dark they could not tell which wa the wider way or which kept nearer to the straight which should they take the left or the right they knew of noth to guid them yet a fals choic would almost certainli be fatal which way ha gollum gone pant sam and whi didnt he wait sméagol said frodo tri to call sméagol but hi voic croak and the name fell dead almost as it left hi lip there wa no answer not an echo not even a tremor of the air he realli gone thi time i fanci mutter sam i guess thi is just exactli where he meant to bring us gollum if ever i lay hand on you again youll be sorri for it present grope and fumbl in the dark they found that the open on the left wa block either it wa a blind or els some great stone had fallen in the passag thi cant be the way frodo whisper right or wrong we must take the other and quick sam pant there someth wors than gollum about i can feel someth look at us they had not gone more than a few yard when from behind them came a sound startl and horribl in the heavi pad silenc a gurgl bubbl nois and a long venom hiss they wheel round but noth could be seen still as stone they stood stare wait for they did not know what it a trap said sam and he laid hi hand upon the hilt of hi sword and as he did so he thought of the dark of the barrow whenc it came i wish old tom wa near us now he thought then as he stood dark about him and a black of despair and anger in hi heart it seem to him that he saw a light a light in hi mind almost unbear bright at first as a sunray to the eye of one long hidden in a windowless pit then the light becam colour green gold silver white far off as in a littl pictur drawn by elvenfing he saw the ladi galadriel stand on the grass in lórien and gift were in her hand and you ringbear he heard her say remot but clear for you i have prepar thi the bubbl hiss drew nearer and there wa a creak as of some great joint thing that move with slow purpos in the dark a reek came on befor it master master cri sam and the life and urgenc came back into hi voic the ladi gift the starglass a light to you in dark place she said it wa to be the starglass the starglass mutter frodo as one answer out of sleep hardli comprehend whi ye whi had i forgotten it a light when all other light go out and now inde light alon can help us slowli hi hand went to hi bosom and slowli he held aloft the phial of galadriel for a moment it glimmer faint as a rise star struggl in heavi earthward mist and then as it power wax and hope grew in frodo mind it began to burn and kindl to a silver flame a minut heart of dazzl light as though eärendil had himself come down from the high sunset path with the last silmaril upon hi brow the dark reced from it until it seem to shine in the centr of a globe of airi crystal and the hand that held it sparkl with white fire frodo gaze in wonder at thi marvel gift that he had so long carri not guess it full worth and potenc seldom had he rememb it on the road until they came to morgul vale and never had he use it for fear of it reveal light aiya eärendil elenion ancalima he cri and knew not what he had spoken for it seem that anoth voic spoke through hi clear untroubl by the foul air of the pit but other potenc there are in middleearth power of night and they are old and strong and she that walk in the dark had heard the elv cri that cri far back in the deep of time and she had not heed it and it did not daunt her now even as frodo spoke he felt a great malic bent upon him and a deadli regard consid him not far down the tunnel between them and the open where they had reel and stumbl he wa awar of eye grow visibl two great cluster of manywindow eye – the come menac wa unmask at last the radianc of the starglass wa broken and thrown back from their thousand facet but behind the glitter a pale deadli fire began steadili to glow within a flame kindl in some deep pit of evil thought monstrou and abomin eye they were bestial and yet fill with purpos and with hideou delight gloat over their prey trap beyond all hope of escap frodo and sam horrorstricken began slowli to back away their own gaze held by the dread stare of those bale eye but as they back so the eye advanc frodo hand waver and slowli the phial droop then suddenli releas from the hold spell to run a littl while in vain panic for the amus of the eye they both turn and fled togeth but even as they ran frodo look back and saw with terror that at onc the eye came leap up behind the stench of death wa like a cloud about him stand stand he cri desper run is no use slowli the eye crept nearer galadriel he call and gather hi courag he lift up the phial onc more the eye halt for a moment their regard relax as if some hint of doubt troubl them then frodo heart flame within him and without think what he did whether it wa folli or despair or courag he took the phial in hi left hand and with hi right hand drew hi sword sting flash out and the sharp elvenblad sparkl in the silver light but at it edg a blue fire flick then hold the star aloft and the bright sword advanc frodo hobbit of the shire walk steadili down to meet the eye they waver doubt came into them as the light approach one by one they dim and slowli they drew back no bright so deadli had ever afflict them befor from sun and moon and star they had been safe underground but now a star had descend into the veri earth still it approach and the eye began to quail one by one they all went dark they turn away and a great bulk beyond the light reach heav it huge shadow in between they were gone master master cri sam he wa close behind hi own sword drawn and readi star and glori but the elv would make a song of that if ever they heard of it and may i live to tell them and hear them sing but dont go on master dont go down to that den now our onli chanc now let get out of thi foul hole and so back they turn onc more first walk and then run for as they went the floor of the tunnel rose steepli and with everi stride they climb higher abov the stench of the unseen lair and strength return to limb and heart but still the hatr of the watcher lurk behind them blind for a while perhap but undef still bent on death and now there came a flow of air to meet them cold and thin the open the tunnel end at last it wa befor them pant yearn for a roofless place they flung themselv forward and then in amaz they stagger tumbl back the outlet wa block with some barrier but not of stone soft and a littl yield it seem and yet strong and impervi air filter through hut not a glimmer of ani light onc more they charg and were hurl back hold aloft the phial frodo look and befor him he saw a grey which the radianc of the starglass did not pierc and did not illumin as if it were a shadow that be cast by no light no light could dissip across the width and height of the tunnel a vast web wa spun orderli as the web of some huge spider but denserwoven and far greater and each thread wa as thick as rope sam laugh grimli cobweb he said is that all cobweb but what a spider have at em down with em in a furi he hew at them with hi sword but the thread that he struck did not break it gave a littl and then sprang back like a pluck bowstr turn the blade and toss up both sword and arm three time sam struck with all hi forc and at last one singl cord of all the countless cord snap and twist curl and whip through the air one end of it lash sam hand and he cri out in pain start back and draw hi hand across hi mouth it will take day to clear the road like thi he said what to be done have those eye come back no not to be seen said frodo but i still feel that they are look at me or think about me make some other plan perhap if thi light were lower or if it fail they would quickli come again trap in the end said sam bitterli hi anger rise again abov weari and despair gnat in a net may the curs of faramir bite that gollum and bite him quick that would not help us now said frodo come let us see what sting can do it is an elvenblad there were web of horror in the dark ravin of beleriand where it wa forg but you must be the guard and hold back the eye here take the starglass do not be afraid hold it up and watch then frodo step up to the great grey net and hew it with a wide sweep stroke draw the bitter edg swiftli across a ladder of closestrung cord and at onc spring away the bluegleam blade shore through them like a scyth through grass and they leap and writh and then hung loos a great rent wa made stroke after stroke he dealt until at last all the web within hi reach wa shatter and the upper portion blew and sway like a loos veil in the incom wind the trap wa broken come cri frodo on on wild joy at their escap from the veri mouth of despair suddenli fill all hi mind hi head whirl as with a draught of potent wine he sprang out shout as he came it seem light in that dark land to hi eye that had pass through the den of night the great smoke had risen and grown thinner and the last hour of a sombr day were pass the red glare of mordor had die away in sullen gloom yet it seem to frodo that he look upon a morn of sudden hope almost he had reach the summit of the wall onli a littl higher now the cleft cirith ungol wa befor him a dim notch in the black ridg and the horn of rock darkl in the sky on either side a short race a sprinter cours and he would be through the pass sam he cri not heed the shrill of hi voic that releas from the choke air of the tunnel rang out now high and wild the pass run run and well be throughthrough befor ani one can stop us sam came up behind as fast as he could urg hi leg but glad as he wa to be free he wa uneasi and as he ran he kept on glanc back at the dark arch of the tunnel fear to see eye or some shape beyond hi imagin spring out in pursuit too littl did he or hi master know of the craft of shelob she had mani exit from her lair there agelong she had dwelt an evil thing in spiderform even such as onc of old had live in the land of the elv in the west that is now under the sea such as beren fought in the mountain of terror in doriath and so came to lúthien upon the green sward amid the hemlock in the moonlight long ago how shelob came there fli from ruin no tale tell for out of the dark year few tale have come but still she wa there who wa there befor sauron and befor the first stone of baraddûr and she serv none but herself drink the blood of elv and men bloat and grown fat with endless brood on her feast weav web of shadow for all live thing were her food and her vomit dark far and wide her lesser brood bastard of the miser mate her own offspr that she slew spread from glen to glen from the ephel dúath to the eastern hill to dol guldur and the fast of mirkwood but none could rival her shelob the great last child of ungoli to troubl the unhappi world alreadi year befor gollum had beheld her sméagol who pri into all dark hole and in past day he had bow and worship her and the dark of her evil will walk through all the way of hi weari besid him cut him off from light and from regret and he had promis to bring her food but her lust wa not hi lust littl she knew of or care for tower or ring or anyth devis by mind or hand who onli desir death for all other mind and bodi and for herself a glut of life alon swollen till the mountain could no longer hold her up and the dark could not contain her but that desir wa yet far away and long now had she been hungri lurk in her den while the power of sauron grew and light and live thing forsook hi border and the citi in the valley wa dead and no elf or man came near onli the unhappi orc poor food and wari but she must eat and howev busili they delv new wind passag from the pass and from their tower ever she found some way to snare them but she lust for sweeter meat and gollum had brought it to her well see well see he said often to himself when the evil mood wa on him as he walk the danger road from emyn muil to morgul vale well see it may well be o ye it may well be that when she throw away the bone and the empti garment we shall find it we shall get it the preciou a reward for poor sméagol who bring nice food and well save the preciou as we promis o ye and when weve got it safe then shell know it o ye then well pay her back my preciou then well pay everyon back so he thought in an inner chamber of hi cun which he still hope to hide from her even when he had come to her again and had bow low befor her while hi companion slept and as for sauron he knew where she lurk it pleas him that she should dwell there hungri but unab in malic a more sure watch upon that ancient path into hi land than ani other that hi skill could have devis and orc they were use slave but he had them in plenti if now and again shelob caught them to stay her appetit she wa welcom he could spare them and sometim as a man may cast a dainti to hi cat hi cat he call her but she own him not sauron would send her prison that he had no better use for he would have them driven to her hole and report brought back to him of the play she made so they both live delight in their own devic and fear no assault nor wrath nor ani end of their wicked never yet had ani fli escap from shelob web and the greater now wa her rage and hunger but noth of thi evil which they had stir up against them did poor sam know except that a fear wa grow on him a menac which he could not see and such a weight did it becom that it wa a burden to him to run and hi feet seem leaden dread wa round him and enemi befor him in the pass and hi master wa in a fey mood run heedlessli to meet them turn hi eye away from the shadow behind and the deep gloom beneath the cliff upon hi left he look ahead and he saw two thing that increas hi dismay he saw that the sword which frodo still held unsheath wa glitter with blue flame and he saw that though the sky behind wa now dark still the window in the tower wa glow red orc he mutter well never rush it like thi there orc about and wors than orc then return quickli to hi long habit of secreci he close hi hand about the preciou phial which he still bore red with hi own live blood hi hand shone for a moment and then he

gave forth a stench her leg were bent with great knob joint high abov her back and hair that stuck out like steel spine and at each leg end there wa a claw as soon as she had squeez her soft squelch bodi and it fold limb out of the upper exit from her lair she move with a horribl speed now run on her creak leg now make a sudden bound she wa between sam and hi master either she did not see sam or she avoid him for the moment as the bearer of the light and fix all her intent upon one prey upon frodo bereft of hi phial run heedless up the path unawar yet of hi peril swiftli he ran but shelob wa swifter in a few leap she would have him sam gasp and gather all hi remain breath to shout look out behind he yell look out master im – but suddenli hi cri wa stifl a long clammi hand went over hi mouth and anoth caught him by the neck while someth wrap itself about hi leg taken off hi guard he toppl backward into the arm of hi attack got him hiss gollum in hi ear at last my preciou weve got

furi at the treacheri and desper at the delay when hi master wa in deadli peril gave to sam a sudden violenc and strength that wa far beyond anyth that gollum had expect from thi slow stupid hobbit as he thought him not gollum himself could have twist more quickli or more fierc hi hold on sam mouth slip and sam duck and lung forward again tri to tear away from the grip on hi neck hi sword wa still in hi hand and on hi left arm hang by it thong wa faramir staff desper he tri to turn and stab hi enemi but gollum wa too quick hi long right arm shot out and he grab sam wrist hi finger were like a vice slowli and relentlessli he bent the hand down and forward till with a cri of pain sam releas the sword and it fell to the ground and all the while gollum other hand wa tighten on sam throat then sam play hi last trick with all hi strength he pull away and got hi feet firmli plant then suddenli he drove hi leg against the ground and with hi whole forc hurl himself backward not expect even thi simpl trick from sam gollum fell over with sam on top and he receiv the weight of the sturdi hobbit in hi stomach a sharp hiss came out of him and for a second hi hand upon sam throat loosen but hi finger still grip the swordhand sam tore himself forward and away and stood up and then quickli he wheel away to hi right pivot on the wrist held by gollum lay hold of the staff with hi left hand sam swung it up and down it came with a whistl crack on gollum outstretch arm just below the elbow with a squeal gollum let go then sam wade in not wait to chang the staff from left to right he dealt anoth savag blow quick as a snake gollum slither asid and the stroke aim at hi head fell across hi back the staff crack and broke that wa enough for him grab from behind wa an old game of hi and seldom had he fail in it but thi time misl by spite he had made the mistak of speak and gloat befor he had both hand on hi victim neck everyth had gone wrong with hi beauti plan sinc that horribl light had so unexpectedli appear in the dark and now he wa face to face with a furiou enemi littl less than hi own size thi fight wa not for him sam swept up hi sword from the ground and rais it gollum squeal and spring asid on to all four he jump away in one big bound like a frog befor sam could reach him he wa off run with amaz speed back toward the tunnel sword in hand sam went after him for the moment he had forgotten everyth els but the red furi in hi brain and the desir to kill gollum but befor he could overtak him gollum wa gone then as the dark hole stood befor him and the stench came out to meet him like a clap of thunder the thought of frodo and the monster smote upon sam mind he spun round and rush wildli up the path call and call hi master name he wa too late so far gollum plot had succeed chapter the choic of master samwis frodo wa lie face upward on the ground and the monster wa bend over him so intent upon her victim that she took no heed of sam and hi cri until he wa close at hand as he rush up he saw that frodo wa alreadi bound in cord wound about him from ankl to shoulder and the monster with her great foreleg wa begin half to lift half to drag hi bodi away on the near side of him lay gleam on the ground hi elvenblad where it had fallen useless from hi grasp sam did not wait to wonder what wa to be done or whether he wa brave or loyal or fill with rage he sprang forward with a yell and seiz hi master sword in hi left hand then he charg no onslaught more fierc wa ever seen in the savag world of beast where some desper small creatur arm with littl teeth alon will spring upon a tower of horn and hide that stand abov it fallen mate disturb as if out of some gloat dream by hi small yell she turn slowli the dread malic of her glanc upon him but almost befor she wa awar that a furi wa upon her greater than ani she had known in countless year the shine sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw sam sprang in insid the arch of her leg and with a quick upthrust of hi other hand stab at the cluster eye upon her lower head one great eye went dark now the miser creatur wa right under her for the moment out of the reach of her sting and of her claw her vast belli wa abov him with it putrid light and the stench of it almost smote him down still hi furi held for one more blow and befor she could sink upon him smother him and all hi littl impud of courag he slash the bright elvenblad across her with desper strength but shelob wa not as dragon are no softer spot had she save onli her eye knob and pit with corrupt wa her ageold hide but ever thicken from within with layer on layer of evil growth the blade score it with a dread gash but those hideou fold could not be pierc by ani strength of men not though elf or dwarf should forg the steel or the hand of beren or of túrin wield it she yield to the stroke and then heav up the great bag of her belli high abov sam head poison froth and bubbl from the wound now splay her leg she drove her huge bulk down on him again too soon for sam still stood upon hi feet and drop hi own sword with both hand he held the elvenblad point upward fend off that ghastli roof and so shelob with the drive forc of her own cruel will with strength greater than ani warrior hand thrust herself upon a bitter spike deep deep it prick as sam wa crush slowli to the ground no such anguish had shelob ever known or dream of know in all her long world of wicked not the doughtiest soldier of old gondor nor the most savag orc entrap had ever thu endur her or set blade to her belov flesh a shudder went through her heav up again wrench away from the pain she bent her writh limb beneath her and sprang backward in a convuls leap sam had fallen to hi knee by frodo head hi sens reel in the foul stench hi two hand still grip the hilt of the sword through the mist befor hi eye he wa awar dimli of frodo face and stubbornli he fought to master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that wa upon him slowli he rais hi head and saw her onli a few pace away eye him her beak drabbl a spittl of venom and a green ooz trickl from below her wound eye there she crouch her shudder belli splay upon the ground the great bow of her leg quiver as she gather herself for anoth springthi time to crush and sting to death no littl bite of poison to still the struggl of her meat thi time to slay and then to rend even as sam himself crouch look at her see hi death in her eye a thought came to him as if some remot voic had spoken and he fumbl in hi breast with hi left hand and found what he sought cold and hard and solid it seem to hi touch in a phantom world of horror the phial of galadriel galadriel he said faintli and then he heard voic far off but clear the cri of the elv as they walk under the star in the belov shadow of the shire and the music of the elv as it came through hi sleep in the hall of fire in the hous of elrond gilthoniel a elbereth and then hi tongu wa loos and hi voic cri in a languag which he did not know a elbereth gilthoniel o menel palandiriel le nallon sí dingurutho a tiro nin fanuilo and with that he stagger to hi feet and wa samwis the hobbit hamfast son again now come you filth he cri youv hurt my master you brute and youll pay for it were go on but well settl with you first come on and tast it again as if hi indomit spirit had set it potenc in motion the glass blaze suddenli like a white torch in hi hand it flame like a star that leap from the firmament sear the dark air with intoler light no such terror out of heaven had ever burn in shelob face befor the beam of it enter into her wound head and score it with unbear pain and the dread infect of light spread from eye to eye she fell back beat the air with her foreleg her sight blast by inner lightn her mind in agoni then turn her maim head away she roll asid and began to crawl claw by claw toward the open in the dark cliff behind sam came on he wa reel like a drunken man but he came on and shelob cow at last shrunken in defeat jerk and quiver as she tri to hasten from him she reach the hole and squeez down leav a trail of greenyellow slime she slip in even as sam hew a last stroke at her drag leg then he fell to the ground shelob wa gone and whether she lay long in her lair nurs her malic and her miseri and in slow year of dark heal herself from within rebuild her cluster eye until with hunger like death she spun onc more her dread snare in the glen of the mountain of shadow thi tale doe not tell sam wa left alon wearili as the even of the nameless land fell upon the place of battl he crawl back to hi master master dear master he said but frodo did not speak as he had run forward eager rejoic to be free shelob with hideou speed had come behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck he lay now pale and heard no voic and did not move master dear master said sam and through a long silenc wait listen in vain then as quickli as he could he cut away the bind cord and laid hi head upon frodo breast and to hi mouth but no stir of life could he find nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart often he chafe hi master hand and feet and touch hi brow but all were cold frodo mr frodo he call dont leav me here alon it your sam call dont go where i cant follow wake up mr frodo o wake up frodo me dear me dear wake up then anger surg over hint and he ran about hi master bodi in a rage stab the air and smite the stone and shout challeng present he came back and bend look at frodo face pale beneath him in the dusk and suddenli he saw that he wa in the pictur that wa reveal to him in the mirror of galadriel in lórien frodo with a pale face lie fast asleep under a great dark cliff or fast asleep he had thought then he dead he said not asleep dead and as he said it as if the word had set the venom to it work again it seem to him that the hue of the face grew livid green and then black despair came down on him and sam bow to the ground and drew hi grey hood over hi head and night came into hi heart and he knew no more when at last the black pass sam look up and shadow were about him but for how mani minut or hour the world had gone drag on he could not tell he wa still in the same place and still hi master lay besid him dead the mountain had not crumbl nor the earth fallen into ruin what shall i do what shall i do he said did i come all thi way with him for noth and then he rememb hi own voic speak word that at the time he did not understand himself at the begin of their journey i have someth to do befor the end i must see it through sir if you understand but what can i do not leav mr frodo dead unburi on the top of the mountain and go home or go on go on he repeat and for a moment doubt and fear shook him go on is that what ive got to do and leav him then at last he began to weep and go to frodo he compos hi bodi and fold hi cold hand upon hi breast and wrap hi cloak about him and he laid hi own sword at one side and the staff that faramir had given at the other if im to go on he said then i must take your sword by your leav mr frodo but ill put thi one to lie by you as it lay by the old king in the barrow and youv got your beauti mithril coat from old mr bilbo and your starglass mr frodo you did lend it to me and ill need it for ill be alway in the dark now it too good for me and the ladi gave it to you but mayb shed understand do you understand mr frodo ive got to go on but he could not go not yet he knelt and held frodo hand and could not releas it and time went by and still he knelt hold hi master hand and in hi heart keep a debat now he tri to find strength to tear himself away and go on a lone journey – for vengeanc if onc he could go hi anger would bear him down all the road of the world pursu until he had him at last gollum then gollum would die in a corner but that wa not what he had set out to do it would not be worth while to leav hi master for that it would not bring him back noth would they had better both be dead togeth and that too would be a lone journey he look on the bright point of the sword he thought of the place behind where there wa a black brink and an empti fall into nothing there wa no escap that way that wa to do noth not even to griev that wa not what he had set out to do what am i to do then he cri again and now he seem plainli to know the hard answer see it through anoth lone journey and the worst what me alon go to the crack of doom and all he quail still but the resolv grew what me take the ring from him the council gave it to him but the answer came at onc and the council gave him companion so that the errand should not fail and you are the last of all the compani the errand must not fail i wish i wasnt the last he groan i wish old gandalf wa hare or somebodi whi am i left all alon to make up my mind im sure to go wrong and it not for me to go take the ring put myself forward but you havent put yourself forward youv been put forward and as for not be the right and proper person whi mr frodo wasnt as you might say nor mr bilbo they didnt choos themselv ah well i must make up my own mind i will make it up but ill be sure to go wrong thatd be sam gamge all over let me see now if were found here or mr frodo found and that thing on him well the enemi will get it and that the end of all of us of lorien and rivendel and the shire and all and there s no time to lose or itll be the end anyway the war begun and more than like thing are all go the enemi way alreadi no chanc to go back with it and get advic or permiss no it sit here till they come and kill me over master bodi and get it or take it and go he drew a deep breath then take it it is he stoop veri gentli he undid the clasp at the neck and slip hi hand insid frodo tunic then with hi other hand rais the head he kiss the cold forehead and softli drew the chain over it and then the head lay quietli back again in rest no chang came over the still face and by that more than by all other token sam wa convinc at last that frodo had die and laid asid the quest goodby master my dear he murmur forgiv your sam hell come back to thi spot when the job done – if he manag it and then hell not leav you again rest you quiet till i come and may no foul creatur come anigh you and if the ladi could hear me and give me one wish i would wish to come back and find you again goodby and then he bent hi own neck and put the chain upon it and at onc hi head wa bow to the ground with the weight of the ring as if a great stone had been strung on him but slowli as if the weight becam less or new strength grew in him he rais hi head and then with a great effort got to hi feet and found that he could walk and bear hi burden and for a moment he lift up the phial and look down at hi master and the light burn gentli now with the soft radianc of the eveningstar in summer and in that light frodo face wa fair of hue again pale but beauti with an elvish beauti as of one who ha long pass the shadow and with the bitter comfort of that last sight sam turn and hid the light and stumbl on into the grow dark he had not far to go the tunnel wa some way behind the cleft a coupl of hundr yard ahead or less the path wa visibl in the dusk a deep rut worn in age of passag run now gentli up in a long trough with cliff on either side the trough narrow rapidli soon sam came to a long flight of broad shallow step now the orctow wa right abov him frown black and in it the red eye glow now he wa hidden in the dark shadow under it he wa come to the top of the step and wa in the cleft at last ive made up my mind he kept say to himself but he had not though he had done hi best to think it out what he wa do wa altogeth against the grain of hi natur have i got it wrong he mutter what ought i to have done as the sheer side of the cleft close about him befor he reach the actual summit befor he look at last on the path descend into the nameless land he turn for a moment motionless in intoler doubt he look back he could still see like a small blot in the gather gloom the mouth of the tunnel and he thought he could see or guess where frodo lay he fanci there wa a glimmer on the ground down there or perhap it wa some trick of hi tear as he peer out at that high stoni place where all hi life had fallen in ruin if onli i could have my wish my one wish he sigh to go back and find him then at last he turn to the road in front and took a few step the heaviest and the most reluct he had ever taken onli a few step and now onli a few more and he would be go down and would never see that high place again and then suddenli he heard cri and voic he stood still as stone orcvoic they were behind him and befor him a nois of tramp feet and harsh shout orc were come up to the cleft from the far side from some entri to the tower perhap tramp feet and shout behind he wheel round he saw small red light torch wink away below there as they issu from the tunnel at last the hunt wa up the red eye of the tower had not been blind he wa caught now the flicker of approach torch and the clink of steel ahead wa veri near in a minut they would reach the top and be on him he had taken too long in make up hi mind and now it wa no good how could he escap or save himself or save the ring the ring he wa not awar of ani thought or decis he simpli found himself draw out the chain and take the ring in hi hand the head of the orccompani appear in the cleft right befor him then he put it on the world chang and a singl moment of time wa fill with an hour of thought at onc he wa awar that hear wa sharpen while sight wa dim but otherwis than in shelob lair all thing about him now were not dark but vagu while he himself wa there in a grey hazi world alon like a small black solid rock and the ring weigh down hi left hand wa like an orb of hot gold he did not feel invis at all but horribl and uniqu visibl and he knew that somewher an eye wa search for him he heard the crack of stone and the murmur of water far off in morgul vale and down away under the rock the bubbl miseri of shelob grope lost in some blind passag and voic in the dungeon of the tower and the cri of the orc as they came out of the tunnel and deafen roar in hi ear the crash of the feet and the rend clamour of the orc befor him he shrank against the cliff but they march up like a phantom compani grey distort figur in a mist onli dream of fear with pale flame in their hand and they pass him by he cower tri to creep away into some cranni and to hide he listen the orc from the tunnel and the other march down had sight one anoth and both parti were now hurri and shout he heard them both clearli and he understood what they said perhap the ring gave understand of tongu or simpli understand especi of the servant of sauron it maker so that if he gave heed he understood and translat the thought to himself certainli the ring had grown greatli in power as it approach the place of it forg but one thing it did not confer and that wa courag at present sam still thought onli of hide of lie low till all wa quiet again and he listen anxious he could not tell how near the voic were the word seem almost in hi ear hola gorbag what are you do up here had enough of war alreadi order you lubber and what are you do shagrat tire of lurk up there think of come down to fight order to you im in command of thi pass so speak civil what your report noth hai hai yoi a yell broke into the exchang of the leader the orc lower down had suddenli seen someth they began to run so did the other hai hola here someth lie right in the road a spi a spi there wa a hoot of snarl horn and a babel of bay voic with a dread stroke sam wa waken from hi cower mood they had seen hi master what would they do he had heard tale of the orc to make the blood run cold it could not be born he sprang up he flung the quest and all hi decis away and fear and doubt with them he knew now where hi place wa and had been at hi master side though what he could do there wa not clear back he ran down the step down the path toward frodo how mani are there he thought thirti or forti from the tower at least and a lot more than that from down below i guess how mani can i kill befor they get me theyll see the flame of the sword as soon as i draw it and theyll get me sooner or later i wonder if ani song will ever mention it how samwis fell in the high pass and made a wall of bodi round hi master no no song of cours not for the ringll be found and therel be no more song i cant help it my place is by mr frodo they must understand that – elrond and the council and the great lord and ladi with all their wisdom their plan have gone wrong i cant be their ringbear not without mr frodo but the orc were out of hi dim sight now he had had no time to consid himself but now he realiz that he wa weari weari almost to exhaust hi leg would not carri him as he wish he wa too slow the path seem mile long where had they all got to in the mist there they were again a good way ahead still a cluster of figur round someth lie on the ground a few seem to be dart thi way and that bent like dog on a trail he tri to make a spurt come on sam he said or youll be too late again he loosen the sword in it sheath in a minut he would draw it and then there wa a wild clamour hoot and laugh as someth wa lift from the ground ya hoi ya harri hoi up up then a voic shout now off the quick way back to the underg shell not troubl us tonight by all the sign the whole band of orcfigur began to move four in the middl were carri a bodi high on their shoulder ya hoi they had taken frodo bodi they were off he could not catch them up still he labour on the orc reach the tunnel and were pass in those with the burden went first and behind them there wa a good deal of struggl and jostl sam came on he drew the sword a flicker of blue in hi waver hand but they did not see it even as he came pant up the last of them vanish into the black hole for a moment he stood gasp clutch hi breast then he drew hi sleev across hi face wipe away the grime and sweat and tear curs the filth he said and sprang after them into the dark it no longer seem veri dark to him in the tunnel rather it wa as if he had step out of a thin mist into a heavier fog hi weari wa grow but hi will harden all the more he thought he could see the light of torch a littl way ahead but tri as he would he could not catch them up orc go fast in tunnel and thi tunnel they knew well for in spite of shelob they were forc to use it often as the swiftest way from the dead citi over the mountain in what faroff time the main tunnel and the great round pit had been made where shelob had taken up her abod in age past they did not know but mani byway they had themselv delv about in on either side so as to escap the lair in their go to and fro on the busi of their master tonight they did not intend to go far down but were hasten to find a sidepassag that led back to their watchtow on the cliff most of them were gleeful delight with what they had found and seen and as they ran they gabbl and yammer after the fashion of their kind sam heard the nois of their harsh voic flat and hard in the dead air and he could distinguish two voic from among all the rest they were louder and nearer to him the captain of the two parti seem to be bring up the rear debat as they went cant you stop your rabbl make such a racket shagrat grunt the one we dont want shelob on us go on gorbag your are make more than half the nois said the other but let the lad play no need to worri about shelob for a bit i reckon she sat on a nail it seem and we shant cri about that didnt you see a nasti mess all the way back to that curs crack of her if weve stop it onc weve stop it a hundr time so let em laugh and weve struck a bit of luck at last got someth that lugbúrz want lugbúrz want it eh what is it dyou think elvish it look to me but unders what the danger in a thing like that dont know till weve had a look oho so they havent told you what to expect they dont tell us all they know do they not by half but they can make mistak even the top one can sh gorbag shagrat voic wa lower so that even with hi strang sharpen hear sam could onli just catch what wa said they may but theyv got eye and ear everywher some among my lot as like as not but there no doubt about it theyr troubl about someth the nazgûl down below are by your account and lugbúrz is too someth nearli slip nearli you say said gorbag all right said shagrat but well talk of that later wait till we get to the underway there a place there where we can talk a bit while the lad go on shortli afterward sam saw the torch disappear then there wa a rumbl nois and just as he hurri up a bump as far as he could guess the orc had turn and gone into the veri open which frodo and he had tri and found block it wa still block there seem to be a great stone in the way but the orc had got through somehow for he could hear their voic on the other side they were still run along deeper and deeper into the mountain back toward the tower sam felt desper they were carri off hi master bodi for some foul purpos and he could not follow he thrust and push at the block and he threw himself against it but it did not yield then not far insid or so he thought he heard the two captain voic talk again he stood still listen for a littl hope perhap to learn someth use perhap gorbag who seem to belong to mina morgul would come out and he could then slip in no i dont know said gorbag voic the messag go through quicker than anyth could fli as a rule but i dont enquir how it done safest not to grr those nazgûl give me the creep and they skin the bodi off you as soon as look at you and leav you all cold in the dark on the other
