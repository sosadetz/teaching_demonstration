taran could onli admir yet thi man held him prison in fetter of blood right craddoc would touch no food until taran and gurgi had their fill and often went hungri as a result all the while insist hi appetit wa dull yet the gift stuck in taran throat and he scorn the generos he mould have honor in ani other man are there two herdsman in thi valley taran cri to himself one i can onli love and one i can onli hate so pass the summer to forget the anguish of hi divid heart taran labor for the sake of the labor itself mani task were still to be done and the flock alway to be tend until now craddoc had been hardpress to keep the new lamb from stray and as the sheep rove farther afield seek better pastur to gather all into the fold at even gurgi plead to be given charg of them and the flock seem

hammer and anvil with hevydd the smith wave a sooti hand in farewel the companion travel on bear northward along the rich valley of great avren a few day of easi ride through pleasant countrysid brought them to the edg of commot gwenith here a shower suddenli began pelt down on them and the wayfar gallop for the first shelter they could find it wa a cluster of shed stabl chicken roost and storehous seem to rambl in all direct but as taran dismount and hasten to the cottag amid the maze of build he realiz all were link by cover walkway or flagston path and whichev he follow would sooner or later have brought him to the doorway that open almost befor he knock on it come in and a good greet to you call a voic crackl like twig in a fire as gurgi scuttl insid to escap the teem rain taran saw a bent old woman cloak in gray beckon him to the hearth her long hair wa white as the wool on the distaff hang from her belt of plait cord below her shortgirt robe her boni shin look thin and hard as spindl a web of wrinkl cover her face her cheek were wither but for all her year she gave no sign of frailti as though time had onli toughen and season her and her gray eye were sharp and bright as a pair of new needl i am dwyvach weaverwoman she repli as taran bow courteous and told her hi name taran wander she repeat with a tart smile from the look of you id say youv inde been wander more than youv been wash and that clear as the warp and weft on my loom ye ye cri gurgi see loom of weav see wind and bind so mani it make gurgi poor tender head swim with twirl and whirl taran for the first time notic a high loom stand like a giant harp of a thousand string in a corner of the cottag around it were stack bobbin of thread of all color from the rafter dangl skein of yarn hank of wool and flax on the wall hung length of finish fabric some of bright hue and simpl design other of subtler craftsmanship and pattern more difficult to follow taran gaze astonish at the endless varieti then turn to the weaverwoman of gwenith thi call for skill beyond anyth i know he said admiringli how is such work done how done the weaverwoman chuckl it would take me more breath to tell than you have ear to listen but if you look you shall see so say she hobbl to the loom climb to the bench in front of it and with surpris vigor began pli the shuttl back and forth all the while work her feet on the treadl below hardli paus to glanc at her handiwork at last she stop cock her head at taran fix him with her sharp gray eye and said thu is it done wander as all thing are each in it own way thread by thread taran amaz had grown all the more thi would i gladli learn he said eagerli the craft of the swordsmith wa not mine perhap the craft of the weaver may be i pray you will you teach it to me that i will sinc you ask repli dwyvach but mind you it is one thing to admir a wellwoven bit of cloth and anoth to sit yourself befor the loom my thank to you taran exclaim ill not fear to labor at your loom with hevydd the smith i didnt shrink from hot iron or the flame of hi forg and a weaver shuttl is a lighter burden than a smith hammer think you so dwyvach ask with a dri chuckl that sound like knit needl click togeth then what shall you weav to begin with she went on eye him sharpli taran wander you call yourself taran threadbar would be more like it would you weav yourself a new cloak thu youll gain someth to put on your back and ill see what skill you have in your finger taran willingli agre but next day instead of teach him weav dwyvach led the companion to one of her mani chamber which taran saw full nearli to burst with pile of wool teas out the thorn pick out the cocklebur the weaverwoman order comb it card it care wander or when your cloak is done youll feel it made of thistl instead of wool the size of the task ahead of him made taran despair of ever finish but he and gurgi start the painstak work with dwyvach herself lend a hand the age weaverwoman taran soon learn had not onli a tart tongu but a keen eye noth escap her she spi the smallest knot speck or flaw and brought taran attent to it with a sharp rap from her distaff to hi knuckl but what smart taran more than the distaff wa to learn that dwyvach despit her year could work faster longer and harder than he himself at the end of each day taran eye were bleari hi finger raw and hi head nod wearili yet the old weaverwoman wa bright and spri as if the day had scarc begun nevertheless the work at last wa finish but now dwyvach set him in front of a huge spin wheel the finest wool is useless until it spun to thread the weaver woman told him so youd best begin learn that as well but spin are woman toil gurgi protest no no spin are not fit for bold and clever weavermen inde snort dwyvach then sit you down and learn otherwis ive heard men complain of do woman work and women complain of do man work she ad fasten her boni thumb and forefing on gurgi ear and march him to a stool besid taran but ive never heard the work complain of who did it so long as it got done and so under dwyvach watch eye taran and gurgi spun thread and fill bobbin dure the next few day chasten by dwyvach word gurgi did hi best to help though all too often the hapless creatur manag onli to tangl himself in the long strand next dwyvach took the companion to a shed where pot of dye bubbl over a fire here taran fare no better than gurgi for when the yarn wa at last dy he wa bespatt from head to toe with color and gurgi himself look like a rainbow suddenli sprout hair not until all these other task were done to dwyvach satisfact did she take taran to a weav room and there hi heart sank for the loom stood bare and stark as a leafless tree how then cluck the weaverwoman as taran gave her a rueful glanc the loom must be thread did i not tell you all thing are done step by step and strand by strand hevydd the smith told me life wa a forg taran sigh as he labori tri to reckon the countless thread need and i think ill be welltemp befor my cloak is finish life a forg said the weaverwoman a loom rather where live and day intertwin and wise he is who can learn to see the pattern but if you mean to have a new cloak youd do better to work more and chatter less or did you hope for a host of spider to come and labor for you even after decid on the pattern and thread the loom taran still saw onli a hopeless confus tangl of thread the cloth wa pain slow in form and at the end of a long day he had littl more than a hand breadth of fabric to show for all hi toil did i ever think a weaver shuttl a light burden taran sigh it feel heavier than hammer tong and anvil all togeth it not the shuttl that burden you answer dwyvach but lack of skill a heavi burden wander that onli one thing can lift what secret is that taran cri teach it to me now or my cloak will never be done but dwyvach onli smile it is patienc wander as for teach it that i can not do it is both the first thing and the last thing you must learn for yourself taran gloomili went back to work sure he would be as ancient as dwyvach befor finish the garment nevertheless as hi hand becam use to the task the shuttl dart back and forth like a fish among reed and the cloth grew steadili on the loom though dwyvach wa satisfi with hi progress taran to hi own surpris wa not the pattern he murmur frown it i dont know somehow it doesnt pleas me now then wander repli dwyvach no man put a sword to your throat the choic of pattern wa your own that it wa taran admit but now i see it close i would rather have chosen anoth ah ah said dwyvach with her dri chuckl in that case you have but one of two thing to do either finish a cloak youll be illcont to wear or unravel it and start anew for the loom weav onli the pattern set upon it taran stare a long while at hi handiwork at last he took a deep breath sigh and shook hi head so be it ill start anew over the next few day he ruefulli unthread and rethread the loom but after it wa readi and he began weav onc again he wa delight to find the cloth grow faster than ever it had done befor and hi spirit rose with hi newfound skill when the cloak at last wa done he held it up proudli thi is far better than what i had he cri but i doubt ill ever be abl to wear a cloak again without think of everi thread gurgi shout triumphantli and dwyvach bob her head in approv wellwoven she said her express had lost much of it tart and she look fondli at taran seem to smile within herself you have skill in your finger wander she said with unaccustom gentl enough to make you one of the finest weaver in prydain and if my distaff and your knuckl met more often than you like it wa becaus i deem you worth reprov dwell in my hous if you choos work at my loom and what i know i will teach you taran did not answer immedi and as he hesit the weaverwoman smile and spoke again i know what is in your heart wander she said a young man way is restless ye and a young girl too im not so gone in year that ive forgotten your face tell me it is not your wish to stay in commot gwenith taran nod as much as i hope to be a swordsmith so i hope to be a weaver but you speak truth thi is not the way i would follow then must we say farewel answer the weaver woman but mind you she ad in her usual sharp tone if life is a loom the pattern you weav is not so easili unravel taran and gurgi set off again still journey northward and soon commot gwenith wa far behind them though taran wore hi new cloak on hi shoulder and hi new blade at hi side hi pleasur in them shortli gave way to disquiet the word of dwyvach linger in hi mind and hi thought turn to anoth loom in the distant marsh of morva and what of orddu he said doe she weav with more than thread the robin ha truli been scratch for hi worm but have i inde chosen my own pattern or am i no more than a thread on her loom if that be so then i fear it a thread serv littl purpos at ani rate he ad with a rueful laugh it a long and tangl one but these gloomi thought flew from hi mind when some day later melynla bore him to the top of a rise and he look down on the fairest commot he had ever seen a tall stand of fir and hemlock circl broad welltend field green and abund white thatchroof cottag sparkl in shaft of sunlight the air itself seem differ to him cool and touch with the sharp scent of evergreen hi heart quicken as he watch and a strang excit fill him gurgi had ridden up besid him kindli master can we not stop here ye taran murmur hi eye never leav the field and cottag ye here shall we rest he urg melynla down the slope with gurgi canter eagerli behind him cross a shallow stream taran rein up at the sight of a hale old man dig busili near the water edg besid him stood a pair of wooden bucket on a yoke and into these he care pour spade of pale brown earth hi irongray hair and beard were crop short despit hi age hi arm seem as brawni as those of hevydd the smith a good greet to you master delver taran call what place is thi the man turn wipe hi deepli line brow with a forearm and look at taran with keen blue eye the water your hors is stand in and churn to mud by the way is fernbrak stream the commot thi is commot merin chapter the potter wheel ive told you where you are the man went on goodnaturedli as taran dismount at the bank of the stream now might you be will to tell me who you are and what bring you to a place whose name you must ask have you lost your way and found merin when you sought anoth commot i am call wander taran repli as for lose my way he ad with a laugh i cant say that i have for im not sure myself where my path lie then merin is as fair a place as ani to break your journey the man said come along if youd see what hospit i can offer the two of you as the man drop a last spade of clay into the wooden bucket taran step forward and offer to carri them and sinc the man did not refus set hi shoulder under the yoke but the bucket were heavier than taran reckon hi brow soon burst out in sweat he could bare stagger along under the load he felt doubl at everi pace and the hut to which the man point seem to grow farther instead of closer if you seek daub to mend your chimney taran gasp youv come a long way to find it youv not caught the trick of that yoke said the man grin broadli at taran effort he shoulder the bucket which taran gladli gave back and strode along so briskli despit the weight of hi burden that he nearli outdistanc the companion arriv at a long shed he pour the clay into a great wooden vat then beckon the wayfar to enter hi hut insid taran saw rack and shelv hold earthenwar of all kind vessel of plain bake clay grace jar and among these at random piec whose craftsmanship and beauti made him catch hi breath onli onc in the treasur hous of lord gast had he set eye on handiwork such as thi he turn astonish to the old man who had begun lay dish and bowl on an oaken tabl when i ask if you sought daub to mend your chimney i spoke foolishli taran said humbl bow if thi is your work i have seen some of it befor and i know you annlaw clayshap the potter nod my work it is if youv seen it it may be that inde you do know me for i am old at my craft wander and no longer sure where the clay end and annlaw begin or in truth if theyr not one and the same taran look closer at the vessel crowd the hut at the newli finish wine bowl shape even more skill than the one in lord gast trove at the long clayspatt tabl cover with jar of paint pigment and glaze now he saw in wonder that what he had first taken for common scullerywar wa as beauti in it own way as the wine bowl all had come from a master hand he turn to annlaw it wa told me taran said that one piec of your make is worth more than all of a cantrev lord treasur hous and i well believ it and here he shook hi head in amaz thi is a treasur hous in itself ye ye gurgi cri oh skill potter gain rich and fortun from clever shape rich and fortun repli annlaw smile food for my tabl rather most of these pot and bowl i send to the small commot where the folk have no potter of their own as i give what they need they give what i need and treasur is what i need the least my joy is in the craft not the gain would all the fortun in prydain help my finger shape a better bowl there are those taran said half in earnest as he glanc at the potter wheel who claim work such as your come by enchant at thi annlaw threw back hi head and laugh heartili i wish it did for it would spare much toil no no wander my wheel ala is like ani other true it is he ad that govannion the lame master craftsman of prydain long ago fashion all manner of enchant implement he gave them to whom he deem would use them wise and well but one by one they fell into the clutch of arawn deathlord now all are gone but govannion too discov and set down the high secret of all craft annlaw went on these as well arawn stole to hoard in annuvin where none may ever profit from them the potter face turn grave a lifetim have i striven to discov them again to guess what might have been their natur much have i learn learn by do as a child learn to walk but my step falter the deepest lore yet lie beyond my grasp i fear it ever shall let me gain thi lore annlaw said and ill yearn for no magic tool let me find the knowledg and these he ad hold up hi claycrust hand these will be enough to serv me but you know what you seek taran answer i ala seek without know even where to look he then told annlaw of hevydd the smith and dwyvach the weaverwoman of the sword and cloak he had made i wa proud of my work taran went on yet at the end neither anvil nor loom satisfi me what of the potter wheel ask annlaw when taran admit he knew noth of thi craft and pray annlaw to let him see the shape of clay the old potter willingli agre annlaw drew up hi coars robe and seat himself at the wheel which he quickli set spin and on it flung a lump of clay the potter bent almost humbl to hi work and reach out hi hand as tenderli as if he were lift an unfledg bird befor taran eye annlaw began shape a tall slender vessel as taran stare in awe the clay seem to shimmer on the swiftli turn wheel and to chang from moment to moment now taran understood annlaw word for inde between the potter deft finger and the clay he saw no separ as though annlacv hand flow into the clay and gave it life annlaw wa silent and intent hi line face had brighten the year had fallen away from it taran felt hi heart fill with a joy that seem to reach from the potter to himself and in that moment understood that he wa in the presenc of a true master craftsman greater than ani he had ever known fflewddur wa wrong taran murmur if there is enchant it lie not in the potter wheel but in the potter enchant there is none answer annlaw never turn from hi work a gift perhap but a gift that bear with it much toil if i could make a thing of such beauti it is toil i would welcom taran said sit you down then said annlaw make room for taran at the wheel shape the clay for yourself when taran protest he would spoil annlaw halfform vessel the potter onli laugh spoil it you will sure ill toss it back into the knead trough mix it with the other clay and sooner or later it will serv again it will not be lost inde noth ever is but come back in one shape or anoth but for yourself taran said the skill you have alreadi put in it will be wast the potter shook hi head not so craftsmanship isnt like water in an earthen pot to be taken out by the dipper until it empti no the more drawn out the more remain the heart renew itself wander and skill grow all the better for it here then your hand thu your thumb thu from the first moment taran felt the clay whirl beneath hi finger hi heart leap with the same joy he had seen on the potter face the pride of forg hi own sword and weav hi own cloak dwindl befor thi new discoveri that made him cri out in sudden delight but hi hand falter and the clay went awri annlaw stop the wheel taran first vessel wa so lopsid and misshapen that despit hi disappoint he threw back hi head and laugh annlaw clap him on the shoulder welltri wander the first bowl i turn wa as illfavor and wors you have the touch for it but befor you learn the craft you must first learn the clay dig sift and knead it know it natur better than that of your closest companion then grind pigment for your glaze understand how the fire of the kiln work upon them annlaw clayshap taran said in a low voic that hid noth of hi yearn will you teach me your craft thi more than all els i long to do annlaw hesit sever moment and look deepli at taran i can teach you onli what you can learn said the potter how much that may be time will tell stay if that is your wish tomorrow we shall begin the two wayfar made themselv comfort that night in a snug corner of the potteri shed gurgi curl on the straw pallet but taran sat with knee drawn up and arm clasp about them it strang he murmur the more of the commot folk ive known the fonder have i grown of them yet commot merin drew me at first sight closer than all the other the night wa soft and still taran smile wist in the dark the moment i saw it i thought it the one place id be content to dwell and that that even eilonwi might have been happi here and at annlaw wheel he went on when my hand touch the clay i knew i would count myself happi to be a potter more than smith more than weav it as though i could speak through my finger as though i could give shape to what wa in my heart i understand what annlaw meant there is no differ between him and hi work inde annlaw put himself into the clay and make it live with hi own life if i too might learn to do thi gurgi did not answer the weari creatur wa fast asleep taran smile and drew the cloak over gurgi shoulder sleep well he said we may have come to the end of our journey annlaw wa as good as hi word in the day that follow the potter show taran skill no less import than the work of the clay itself the find of proper earth judg their textur and qualiti sift mix temper gurgi join taran in all the task and soon hi shaggi hair grew so crust with dust mud and gritti glaze that he look like an unbak clay pot set on a pair of skinni leg the summer sped quickli and happili and the more taran saw the potter at hi craft the more he marvel at the knead trough annlaw pound the clay with greater vigor than hevydd the smith at hi anvil and at the wheel did the most intric work with a deft surpass even that of dwyvach the weaverwoman as earli as he rose in the morn taran alway found the potter alreadi up and about hi task annlaw wa tireless often spend night without sleep and day without food absorb in labor at hi wheel seldom wa the potter content to repeat a pattern but strove to better even what he himself had origin stale water is a poor drink said annlaw stale skill is wors and the man who walk in hi own footstep onli end where he began not until autumn did annlaw let taran tri hi hand at the wheel again thi time the bowl taran shape wa not as illform as the other annlaw studi it care nod hi head and told him you have learn a littl wander nevertheless to taran dismay annlaw cast the bowl into the knead trough never fear said the potter when you shape one worth the keep it will be fire in the kiln though taran fear such a time might never come it wa not long befor annlaw judg a vessel a shallow bowl simpl in design yet wellproport to be readi for fire he set it along with other pot and bowl he had craft for the folk of commot isav into a kiln taller and deeper than hevydd furnac while annlaw calmli turn to finish other vessel for the commot folk taran anxieti grew until he felt that he himself wa bake in the flame but at last when the fire wa done and the piec had cool the potter drew out the bowl turn it around in hi hand as taran wait breathlessli and tap it with a clayrim finger he grin at taran it ring true beginn work wander but not to be asham of taran heart lift as if he had fashion a wine bowl handsom than ever lord gast ha seen but hi joy chang soon to despair through autumn taran shape other vessel yet to hi grow dismay none satisfi him none match hi hope despit the pain toil he pour into the work what lack he cri to annlaw i could forg a sword well enough and weav a cloak well enough but now what i truli long to grasp is beyond my reach must the one skill i sought abov all be deni me he burst out in an anguish voic is the gift forbidden me he bow hi head and hi heart froze even as he spoke the word for he knew within himself he had touch the truth annlaw did not gainsay him but onli look at him for a long while with deep sad whi taran whisper whi is thi so it is a heavi question annlaw repli at last he put a hand on taran shoulder inde no man can answer it there are those who have labor all their live to gain the gift strive until the end onli to find themselv mistaken and those who had it born in them yet never knew those who lost heart too soon and those who should never have begun at all count yourself lucki the potter went on that you have understood thi now and not spent your year in vain hope thi much have you learn and no learn is wast what then shall i do taran ask grief and bitter such as he had known in craddoc valley flood over him there are more way to happi than in the shape of a pot repli annlaw you have been happi in merin you still can be there is work for you to do your help is welcom and valuabl to me as a friend as much as an apprentic whi look you now he went on in a cheer tone tomorrow i would send my ware to commot isav but a day journey is long for one of my year as a friend will you bear the burden for me taran nod i will carri your ware to isav he turn away know that hi happi wa end like a flaw vessel shatter in the fire chapter the spoiler next morn as taran had promis he load melynla and gurgi poni with the potter ware and gurgi besid him set out for commot isav annlaw he knew could as well have sent word to the commot folk ask them to come and bear away their own vessel thi is not an errand i do for him but a kind he doe for me taran told gurgi i think he mean to give me time to myself to find my own thought as for that he ad sorrow so far ive found none i long to stay in merin yet there littl to keep me here i prize annlaw as my friend and as a master of hi craft but hi craft will never be mine still ponder and troubl at heart taran reach isav some while befor dusk it wa the smallest commot of all he had seen with fewer than halfadozen cottag and a littl graze plot for a hand of sheep and cattl a knot of men were gather by the sheepfold as taran rode closer he saw their face tightli drawn and grim perplex at thi he call out hi name and told them he brought potteri from annlaw clayshap greet to you said one man name himself as drudwa son of pebyr and farewel in the same breath he ad our thank to annlaw and yourself but stay to share our hospit and you may stay to shed your blood outlaw rove the hill drudwa went on quickli answer taran question frown a band perhap a dozen strong we have heard they plunder two commot alreadi and not content were they with a sheep or cow for their own food but slaughter all the herd for the joy of it today not long past i saw horsemen over the rise and lead them a yellowhair ruffian on a sorrel mare dorath taran cri how then ask one of the commot men do you know thi band if it dorath compani i know them well enough taran answer they are paid sword and if none will hire them i judg them glad to kill even without fee hard warrior they are as i have seen them and cruel as the huntsmen of annuvin drudwa nod grave so it is said it may be they will pass us by he went on but thi i doubt commot isav is small prey but where defend are few the reason to attack are all the more taran glanc at the men from their face and bear he knew their courag would not lack but onc more he heard dorath laughter and recal the man cun and ruthless and if they attack he ask what shall you do what would you have us do drudwa angrili burst out offer tribut and beg them to spare us give our anim to their sword and our home to their torch commot isav ha ever been at peac our pride is husbandri not warfar but we mean to stand against them have we better choic i can ride back to merin taran repli and bring you help too far and too long drudwa answer nor would i do so even then for it would leav merin illdefend no we stand as we are against twelv seven my son llassar he began indic a tall eagerfac boy scarc older than taran had been when coll first dub him assist pigkeep your count is amiss taran interrupt you are not seven but nine gurgi and i stand with you drudwa shook hi head you owe us no servic or duti wander we welcom your sword but will not ask for them they are your nonetheless taran repli and gurgi nod agreement will you heed me nine may stand against a dozen and win the day but with dorath number count less than skill were he alon i would still fear him as much as twelv he will fight shrewdli and strive to gain the most at least cost we must answer him in kind the commot men listen care as taran then spoke of a ruse to make the raider believ themselv outnumb and to attack where dorath would expect no more than feebl defens if two men were to lie wait in the sheepfold and two in the cattl pen readi to spring up taran said they might take the band unawar and hold them a few moment while the rest of us attack from ambush in the rear at the same time if the women of your household set up a din with rake and hoe it would seem other swordsmen had hasten to join us drudwa thought a long moment then nod your plan may be sound wander but i fear for those in the pen as they must bear the brunt for all of us if aught should go awri small chanc of escap would they have i shall be one to keep watch in the sheepfold taran began and i the other llassar broke in quickli drudwa frown i would not spare you becaus you are my son you are a good lad and gentl with the flock i think of your year the flock is in my charg llassar cri by right my place is with the wander the men spoke hurriedli among themselv at last agre that llassar would keep watch with taran while drudwa stood guard over the cattl along with gurgi who fear though he wa refus to be ani farther from taran side by the time all plan were set and the commot men post among the tree just beyond the sheepfold a full moon had risen abov thin cloud the cold light sharpen the edg of the shadow and the outlin of brush and branch in the fold taran and llassar crouch amid the restless flock for a time neither spoke in the bright moonlight the face of llassar seem to taran more boyish than befor he saw the youth wa afraid and make all effort to hide it though uneasi himself he grin assuringli at llassar drudwashad been right the boy wa young untri and yet taran smile know that he himself at llassar age would have claim the same right your plan is good wander llassar said at last in a hush voic speak taran knew more to eas hi own disquiet than anyth els better than we should have done it can not fail all plan can fail taran said almost harshli he fell silent then fear had begun stir in him like leav in a chill wind sweat drench hi bodi under the fleec jacket he had come to isav unknown unproven yet
