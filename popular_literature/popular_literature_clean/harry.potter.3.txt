hand and a larg leather苑ound book a histori of magic by bathilda bagshot prop open against the pillow harri move the tip of hi eagle苯eath quill down the page frown as he look for someth that would help him write hi essay witch burn in the fourteenth centuri wa complet pointless discuss the quill paus at the top of a likely衍ook paragraph harri push hi round glass up the bridg of hi nose move hi flashlight closer to the book and read non衫ag peopl more commonli known as muggl were particularli afraid of magic in mediev time but not veri good at recogn it on the rare occas that they did catch a real witch or wizard burn had no effect whatsoev the witch or wizard would perform a basic flame freez charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoy a gentl tickl sensat inde wendelin the weird enjoy be burn so much that she allow herself to be caught no less than fortyseven time in variou disguis harri put hi quill between hi teeth and reach underneath hi pillow for hi ink bottl and a roll of parchment slowli and veri care he unscrew the ink bottl dip hi quill into it and began to write paus everi now and then to listen becaus if ani of the dursley heard the scratch of hi quill on their way to the bathroom hed probabl find himself lock in the cupboard under the stair for the rest of the summer the dursley famili of number four privet drive wa the reason that harri never enjoy hi summer holiday uncl vernon aunt petunia and their son dudley were harri onli live rel they were muggl and they had a veri mediev attitud toward magic harri dead parent who had been a witch and wizard themselv were never mention under the dursley roof for year aunt petunia and uncl vernon had hope that if they kept harri as downtrodden as possibl they would be abl to squash the magic out of him to their furi they had been unsuccess these day they live in terror of anyon find out that harri had spent most of the last two year at hogwart school of witchcraft and wizardri the most they could do howev wa to lock away harri spellbook wand cauldron and broomstick at the start of the summer break and forbid him to talk to the neighbor thi separ from hi spellbook had been a real problem for harri becaus hi teacher at hogwart had given him a lot of holiday work one of the essay a particularli nasti one about shrink potion wa for harri least favorit teacher professor snape who would be
