bicker histori of magic wa the dullest subject on their schedul pro­fessor binn who taught it wa their onli ghost teacher and the most excit thing that ever happen in hi class wa hi enter­ the room through the blackboard ancient and shrivel mani peopl said he hadnt notic he wa dead he had simpli got up to teach one day and left hi bodi behind him in an armchair in front of the staffroom fire hi routin had not vari in the slightest sinc today wa as bore as ever professor binn open hi note and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearli everyon in the class wa in a deep stupor occasion com­ to long enough to copi down a name or date then fall asleep again he had been speak for half an hour when some­th happen that had never happen befor hermion put up her hand professor binn glanc up in the middl of a deadli dull lectur on the intern warlock convent of look amaz miss — er — granger professor i wa wonder if you could tell us any­th about the chamber of secret said hermion in a clear voic dean thoma who had been sit with hi mouth hang open gaze out of the window jerk out of hi tranc lavend brown head came up off her arm and nevil longbottom el­bow slip off hi desk professor binn blink my subject is histori of magic he said in hi dri wheezi voic i deal with fact miss granger not myth and legend he clear hi throat with a small nois like chalk snap and con­tinu in septemb of that year a subcommitte of sardinian sorcer — he stutter to a halt hermion hand wa wave in the air again miss grant pleas sir dont legend alway have a basi in fact professor binn wa look at her in such amaz harri wa sure no student had ever interrupt him befor aliv or dead well said professor binn slowli ye one could argu that i suppos he peer at hermion as though he had never seen a student properli befor howev the legend of which you speak is such a veri sensat even ludicr tale — but the whole class wa now hang on professor binnss everi word he look dimli at them all everi face turn to hi harri could tell he wa complet thrown by such an unusu show of interest oh veri well he said slowli let me see … the chamber of secret … you all know of cours that hogwart wa found over a thousand year ago — the precis date is uncertain — by the four greatest witch and wizard of the age the four school hous are name after them godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw and salazar slytherin they built thi castl togeth far from pri muggl eye for it wa an age when magic wa fear by common peopl and witch and wizard suffer much persecut he paus gaze blearili around the room and continu for a few year the founder work in harmoni togeth seek out youngster who show sign of magic and bring them to the castl to be educ but then disagr sprang up between them a rift began to grow between slytherin and the other slytherin wish to be more select about the student ad­mit to hogwart he believ that magic learn should be kept within allmag famili he dislik take student of mug­gl parentag believ them to be untrustworthi after a while there wa a seriou argument on the subject between slytherin and gryffindor and slytherin left the school professor binn paus again purs hi lip look like a wrinkl old tortois reliabl histor sourc tell us thi much he said but these honest fact have been obscur by the fanci legend of the chamber of secret the stori goe that slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castl of which the other founder knew noth slytherin accord to the legend seal the chamber of se­cret so that none would be abl to open it until hi own true heir arriv at the school the heir alon would be abl to unseal the chamber of secret unleash the horror within and use it to purg the school of all who were unworthi to studi magic there wa silenc as he finish tell the stori but it wasnt the usual sleepi silenc that fill professor binnss class there wa uneas in the air as everyon continu to watch him hope for more professor binn look faintli annoy the whole thing is arrant nonsens of cours he said natu­r the school ha been search for evid of such a chamber mani time by the most learn witch and wizard it doe not exist a tale told to frighten the gullibl hermion hand wa back in the air sir — what exactli do you mean by the horror within the chamber that is believ to be some sort of monster which the heir of slytherin alon can control said professor binn in hi dri reedi voic the class exchang nervou look i tell you the thing doe not exist said professor binn shuf­fl hi note there is no chamber and no monster but sir said seamu finnigan if the chamber can onli be open by slytherin true heir no one els would be abl to find it would they nonsens oflaherti said professor binn in an aggrav tone if a long success of hogwart headmast and head­mistress havent found the thing — but professor pipe up parvati patil youd probabl have to use dark magic to open it — just becaus a wizard doesnt use dark magic doesnt mean he cant miss pennyfeath snap professor binn i repeat if the like of dumbledor — but mayb youv got to be relat to slytherin so dumble­dor couldnt — began dean thoma but professor binn had had enough that will do he said sharpli it is a myth it doe not exist there is not a shred of evid that slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard i regret tell you such a foolish stori we will return if you pleas to histori to solid believ verifi­ fact and within five minut the class had sunk back into it usual torpor i alway knew salazar slytherin wa a twist old looni ron told harri and hermion as they fought their way through the teem corridor at the end of the lesson to drop off their bag befor dinner but i never knew he start all thi pureblood stuff i wouldnt be in hi hous if you

all direct but none as larg as their which twist and turn slope steepli downward and he knew that he wa fall deeper below the school than even the dungeon behind him he could hear ron thud slightli at the curv and then just as he had begun to worri about what would hap­pen when he hit the ground the pipe level out and he shot out of the end with a wet thud land on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel larg enough to stand in lockhart wa get to hi feet a littl way away cover in slime and white as a ghost harri stood asid as ron came whizz out of the pipe too we must be mile under the school
