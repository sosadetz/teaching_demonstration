two hundr mile away the boy call harri potter woke with a start chapter two ­ the scar harri lay flat on hi back breath hard as though he had been run he had awoken from a vivid dream with hi hand press over hi face the old scar on hi forehead which wa shape like a bolt of lightn wa burn beneath hi finger as though someon had just press a white­hot wire to hi skin he sat up one hand still on hi scar the other hand reach out in the dark for hi glass which were on the bedsid tabl he put them on and hi bedroom came into clearer focu lit by a faint misti orang light that wa filter through the curtain from the street lamp outsid the window harri ran hi finger over the scar again it wa still pain he turn on the lamp besid him scrambl out of bed cross the room open hi wardrob and peer into the mirror on the insid of the door a skinni boy of fourteen look back at him hi bright green eye puzzl under hi untidi black hair he examin the lightning­bolt scar of hi reflect more close it look

cube had slip down into hi stomach at the veri thought he close hi eye tightli and tri to rememb what voldemort had look like but it wa impossibleal harri knew wa that at the moment when voldemort chair had swung around and he harri had seen what wa sit in it he had felt a spasm of horror which had awoken himor had that been the pain in hi scar and who had the old man been for there had definit been an old man harri had watch him fall to the ground it wa all becom confus harri put hi face into hi hand block out hi bedroom tri to hold on to the pictur of that dimli lit room but it wa like tri to keep water in hi cup hand the detail were now trickl away as fast as he tri to hold on to themvoldemort and wormtail had been talk about someon they had kill though harri could not rememb the nameand they had been plot to kill someon elsehim harri took hi face out of hi hand open hi eye and stare around hi bedroom as though expect to see someth unusu there as it happen there wa an extraordinari number of unusu thing in thi room a larg wooden trunk stood open at the foot of hi bed reveal a cauldron broomstick black robe and assort spellbook roll of parchment litter that part of hi desk that wa not taken up by the larg empti cage in which hi snowi owl hedwig usual perch on the floor besid hi bed a book lay open harri had been read it befor he fell asleep last night the pictur in thi book were all move men in bright orang robe were zoom in and out of sight on broomstick throw a red ball to one anoth harri walk over to the book pick it up and watch on of the wizard score a spectacular goal by put the ball through a fifty­foot­high hoop then he snap the book shut even quidditch ­­ in harri opinion the best sport in the world ­­ couldnt distract him at the moment he place fli with the cannon on hi bedsid tabl cross to the window and drew back the curtain to survey the street below privet drive look exactli as a respect suburban street would be expect to look inth earli hour of saturday morn all the curtain were close as far as harri could see through the dark there wasnt a live creatur in sight not even a cat and yetand yetharri went restlessli back to the bed and sat down on it run a finger over hi scar again it wasnt the pain that bother him harri wa no stranger to pain and injuri he had lost all the bone from hi right arm onc and had them pain regrown in a night the same arm had been pierc by a venem foot­long fang not long afterward onli last year harri had fallen fifti feet from an airborn broomstick he wa use to bizarr accid and injuri they were unavoid if you attend hogwart school of witchcraft and wizardri and had a knack for attract a lot of troubl no the thing that wa bother harri wa the last time hi scar had hurt him it had been becaus voldemort had been close bybut voldemort couldnt be here nowth idea of voldemort lurk in privet drive wa absurd imposs harri listen close to the silenc around him wa he half expect to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak and then he jump slightli as he heard hi cousin dudley give a tremend grunt snore from the next room harri shook himself mental he wa be stupid there wa no one in the hous with him except uncl vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainli still asleep their dream untroubl and painless asleep wa the way harri like the dursley best it wasnt as though they were ever ani help to him awak uncl vernon aunt petunia and dudley were harri onli live rel they were muggl who hate and despis magic in ani form which meant that harri wa about as welcom in their hous as dri rot they had explain away harri long absenc at hogwart over the last three year by tell everyon that he went to st brutuss secur center for incur crimin boy they knew perfectli well that as an underag wizard harri wasnt allow to use magic outsid hogwart but they were still apt to blame him for anyth that went wrong about the hous harri had never been abl to confid in them or tell them anyth about hi life in the wizard world the veri idea of go to them when they awok and tell them about hi scar hurt him and about hi worri about voldemort wa laughabl and yet it wa becaus of voldemort that harri had come to live with the dursley in the first place if it hadnt been for voldemort harri would not have had the lightn scar on hi forehead if it hadnt been for voldemort harri would still have had parent harri had been a year old the night that voldemort ­­ the most power dark wizard for a centuri a wizard who had been gain power steadili for eleven year ­­ arriv at hi hous and kill hi father and mother voldemort had then turn hi wand on harri he had perform the curs that had dispos of mani full­grown witch and wizard in hi steadi rise to power ­­ and incred it had not work instead of kill the small boy the curs had rebound upon voldemort harri had surviv with noth but a lightning­shap cut on hi forehead and voldemort had been reduc to someth bare aliv hi power gone hi life almost extinguish voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret commun of witch and wizard had live for so long had lift voldemort follow had disband and harri potter had becom famou it had been enough of a shock for harri to discov on hi eleventh birthday that he wa a wizard it had been even more disconcert to find out that everyon in the hidden wizard world knew hi name harri had arriv at hogwart to find that head turn and whisper follow him wherev he went but he wa use to it now at the end of thi summer he would be start hi fourth year at hogwart and harri wa alreadi count the day until he would be back at the castl again but there wa still a fortnight to go befor he went back to school he look hopelessli around hi room again and hi eye paus on the birthday card hi two best friend had sent him at the end of juli what would they say if harri wrote to them and told them about hi scar hurt at onc hermion granger voic seem to fill hi head shrill and panicki your scar hurt harri that realli seriou write to professor dumbledor and ill go and check common magic ailment and afflict mayb there someth in there about curs scar ye that would be hermion advic go straight to the headmast of hogwart and in the meantim consult a book harri stare out of the window at the inki blue­black sky he doubt veri much whether a book could help him now as far as he knew he wa the onli live person to have surviv a curs like voldemort it wa highli unlik therefor that he would find hi symptom list in common magic ailment and afflict as for inform the headmast harri had no idea where dumbledor went dure the summer holiday he amus himself for a moment pictur dumbledor with hi long silver beard full length wizard robe and point hat stretch out on a beach somewher rub suntan lotion onto hi long crook nose wherev dumbledor wa though harri wa sure that hedwig would be abl to find him harri owl had never yet fail to deliv a letter to anyon even without an address but what would he write dear professor dumbledor sorri to bother you but my scar hurt thi morn your sincer harri potter even insid hi head the word sound stupid and so he tri to imagin hi other best friend ron weasley reaction and in a moment ron red hair and long­nos freckl face seem to swim befor harri wear a bemus express your scar hurt but but you­know­who cant be near you now can he i mean youd know wouldnt you hed be tri to do you in again wouldnt be i dunno harri mayb curs scar alway twing a bit ill ask dad mr weasley wa a fulli qualifi wizard who work in the misus of muggl artifact offic at the ministri of magic but he didnt have ani particular expertis in the matter of curs as far as harri knew in ani case harri didnt like the idea of the whole weasley famili know that he harri wa get jumpi about a few moment pain mr weasley would fuss wors than hermion and fred and georg ron sixteen­ year­old twin brother might think harri wa lose hi nerv the weasley were harri favorit famili in the world he wa hope that they might invit him to stay ani time now ron had mention someth about the quidditch world cup and he somehow didnt want hi visit punctuat with anxiou inquiri about hi scar harri knead hi forehead with hi knuckl what he realli want and it felt almost shame to admit it to himself wa someon like ­ someon like a parent an adult wizard whose advic he could ask without feel stupid someon who care about him who had had experi with dark magic and then the solut came to him it wa so simpl and so obviou that he couldnt believ it had taken so long ­ siriu harri leapt up from the bed hurri across the room and sat down at hi desk he pull a piec of parchment toward him load hi eagle­feath quill with ink wrote dear siriu then paus wonder how best to phrase hi problem still marvel at the fact that he hadnt thought of siriu straight away but then perhap it wasnt so surpris ­ after all he had onli found out that siriu wa hi godfath two month ago there wa a simpl reason for siriuss complet absenc from harri life until then ­ siriu had been in azkaban the terrifi wizard jail guard by creatur call dementor sightless soul­suck fiend who had come to search for siriu at hogwart when he had escap yet siriu had been innoc ­ the murder for which he had been convict had been commit by wormtail voldemort support whom nearli everybodi now believ dead harri ron and hermion knew otherwis howev they had come face­to­fac with wormtail onli the previou year though onli professor dumbledor had believ their stori for one gloriou hour harri had believ that he wa leav the dursley at last becaus siriu had offer him a home onc hi name had been clear but the chanc had been snatch away from him ­ wormtail had escap befor they could take him to the ministri of magic and siriu had had to flee for hi life harri had help him escap on the back of a hippogriff call buckbeak and sinc then siriu had been on the run the home harri might have had if wormtail had not escap had been haunt him all summer it had been doubli hard to return to the dursley know that he had so nearli escap them forev nevertheless siriu had been of some help to harri even if he couldnt be with him it wa due to siriu that harri now had all hi school thing in hi bedroom with him the dursley had never allow thi befor their gener wish of keep harri as miser as possibl coupl with their fear of hi power had led them to lock hi school trunk in the cupboard under the stair everi summer prior to thi but their attitud had chang sinc they had found out that harri had a danger murder for a godfath ­ for harri had conveni forgotten to tell them that siriu wa innoc harri had receiv two letter from siriu sinc he had been back at privet drive both had been deliv not by owl as wa usual with wizard but by larg brightli color tropic bird hedwig had not approv of these flashi intrud she had been most reluct to allow them to drink from her water tray befor fli off again harri on the other hand had like them they put him in mind of palm tree and white sand and he hope that wherev siriu wa siriu never said in case the letter were intercept he wa enjoy himself somehow harri found it hard to imag dementor

closest he had ever come to feel like thi had been dure those month in hi second year when a larg part of the school had suspect him of attack hi fellow student but ron had been on hi side then he thought he could have cope with the rest of the school behavior if he could just have had ron back as a friend but he wasnt go to tri and persuad ron to talk to him if ron didnt want to nevertheless it wa lone with dislik pour in on him from all side he could understand the hufflepuff attitud even if he didnt like it they had their own champion to support he expect noth less than viciou insult from the slytherin ­ he wa highli unpopular there and alway had been becaus he had help gryffindor beat them so often both at quidditch and in the inter­ hous championship but he had hope the ravenclaw might have found it in their heart to support him as much as cedric he wa wrong howev most ravenclaw seem to think that he had been desper to earn himself a bit more fame by trick the goblet into accept hi name then there wa the fact that cedric look the part of a champion so much more than he did except handsom with hi straight nose dark hair and gray eye it wa hard to say who wa receiv more admir these day cedric or viktor krum harri actual saw the same sixth­year girl who had been so keen to get krum autograph beg cedric to sign their school bag one lunchtim meanwhil there wa no

look differ from harri memori of him when they had said good­ bye siriuss face had been gaunt and sunken surround by a quantiti of long black mat hair ­ but the hair wa short and clean now siriuss face wa fuller and he look younger much more like the onli photograph harri had of him which had been taken at the potter wed never mind me how are you said siriu serious im ­ for a second harri tri to say fine ­ but he couldnt do it befor he could stop himself he wa talk more than hed talk in day ­ about how no one believ he hadnt enter the tournament of hi own free will how rita skeeter had lie about him in the daili prophet how he couldnt walk down a corridor without be sneer at ­ and about ron ron not believ him ron jealousi and now hagrid just shown me what come in the first task and it dragon siriu and im a goner he finish desper siriu look at him eye full of concern eye that had not yet lost the look that azkaban had given them ­ that deaden haunt look he had let harri talk himself into silenc without interrupt but now he said dragon we can deal with harri but well get to that in a minut ­ i havent got long here ive broken into a wizard hous to use the fire but they could be back at ani time there are thing i need to warn you about what said harri feel hi spirit slip a further few notch sure there could be noth wors than dragon come karkaroff said siriu harri he wa a death eater you know what death eater are dont you ye ­ he ­ what he wa caught he wa in azkaban with me but he got releas id bet everyth that whi dumbledor want an auror at hogwart thi year ­ to keep an eye on him moodi caught karkaroff put him into azkaban in the first place karkaroff got releas harri said slowli ­ hi brain seem to be struggl to absorb yet anoth piec of shock inform whi did they releas him he did a deal with the ministri of magic said siriu bitterli he said hed seen the error of hi way and then he name name he put a load of other peopl into azkaban in hi place he not veri popular in there i can tell you and sinc he got out from what i can tell he been teach the dark art to everi student who pass through that school of hi so watch out for the durmstrang champion as well okay said harri slowli but are you say karkaroff put my name in the goblet becaus if he did he a realli good actor he seem furiou about it he want to stop me from compet we know he a good actor said siriu becaus he convinc the ministri of magic to set him free didnt he now ive been keep an eye on the daili prophet harri ­ you and the rest of the world said harri bitterli ­ and read between the line of that skeeter woman articl last month moodi wa attack the night befor he start at hogwart ye i know she say it wa anoth fals alarm siriu said hastili see harri about to speak but i dont think so somehow i think someon tri to stop him from get to hogwart i think someon knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around and no one go to look into it too close mad­ey heard intrud a bit too often but that doesnt mean he cant still spot the real thing moodi wa the best auror the ministri ever had so what are you say said harri slowli karkaroff tri to kill me but ­ whi siriu hesit ive been near some veri strang thing he said slowli the death eater seem to be a bit more activ than usual late they show themselv at the quidditch world cup didnt they someon set off the dark mark and then ­ did you hear about that ministri of magic witch who gone miss bertha jorkin said harri exactli she disappear in albania and that definit where voldemort wa rumor to be last and she would have known the triwizard tournament wa come up wouldnt she yeah but it not veri like shed have walk straight into voldemort is it said harri listen i knew bertha jorkin said siriu grimli she wa at hogwart when i wa a few year abov your dad and me and she wa an idiot veri nosi but no brain none at all it not a good combin harri id say shed be veri easi to lure into a trap so so voldemort could have found out about the tournament said harri is that what you mean you think karkaroff might be here on hi order i dont know said siriu slowli i just dont knowkarkaroff doesnt strike me as the type whod go back to voldemort unless he knew voldemort wa power enough to protect him but whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason and i cant help think the tournament would be a veri good way to attack you and make it hook like an accid look hike a realli good plan from where im stand said harri grin bleaki theyll just have to stand back and let the dragon do their stuff right ­ these dragon said siriu speak veri quickli now there a way harri dont be tempt to tri a stun spell ­ dragon are strong and too power magic to be knock out by a singl stunner you need about half a dozen wizard at a time to overcom a dragon ­ yeah i know i just saw said harri but you can do it alon said siriu there is away and a simpl spell all you need just ­ but harri held up a hand to silenc him hi heart suddenli pound as though it would burst he could hear footstep come down the spiral staircas behind him go he hiss at siriu go there someon come harri scrambl to hi feet hide the fire ­ if someon saw siriuss face within the wall of hogwart they would rais an almighti uproar ­ the ministri would get drag in ­ he harri would be question about siriuss whereabout ­ harri heard a tini pop in the fire behind him and knew siriu had gone he watch the bottom of the spiral staircas who had decid to go for a stroll at one oclock in the morn and stop siriu from tell him how to get past a dragon it wa ron dress in hi maroon paisley pajama ron stop dead face harri across the room and look around who were you talk to he said what that got to do with you harri snarl what are you do down here at

dragon and about everyth siriu had said while they took anoth long walk around the lake alarm as she wa by siriuss warn about karkaroff hermion still thought that the dragon were the more press problem let just tri and keep you aliv until tuesday even she said desper and then we can worri about karkaroff they walk three time around the lake tri all the way to think of a simpl spell that would subdu a dragon noth whatsoev occur to them so they retir to the librari instead here harri pull down everi book he could find on dragon and both of them set to work search through the larg pile talon­clip by charm treat scale­rot thi is no good thi is for nutter like hagrid who want to keep them healthi dragon are extrem difficult to slay owe to the ancient magic that imbu their thick hide which none but the most power spell can penetr but siriu said a simpl one would do it let tri some simpl spellbook then said harri throw asid men who love dragon too much he return to the tabl with a pile of spellbook set them down and began to flick through each in turn hermion whisper nonstop at hi elbow well there are switch spell but what the point of switch it unless you swap it fang for wine­gum or someth that would make it less danger the troubl is like that book said not much is go to get through a dragon hide id say transfigur it but someth that big you realli havent got a hope i doubt even professor mcgonagal unless your suppos to put the spell on yourself mayb to give yourself extra power but theyr not simpl spell i mean we havent done ani of those in class i onli know about them becaus ive been do owl practic paper hermion harri said through grit teeth will you shut up for a bit pleas i m tri to concentr but all that happen when hermion fell silent wa that harri brain fill with a sort of blank buzz which didnt seem to allow room for concentr he stare hopelessli down the index of basic hex for the busi and vex instant scalp but dragon had no hair pepper breath that would probabl increas a dragon firepow horn tongu just what he need to give it an extra weapon oh no he back again whi cant he read on hi stupid ship said hermion irrit as viktor krum slouch in cast a

complet miss the point ­ harri didnt say anyth he like be back on speak term with ron too much to speak hi mind right now ­ but he somehow thought that hermion had gotten the point much better than ron had chapter twenty­four ­ rita skeeter scoop everybodi got up late on box day the gryffindor common room wa much quieter than it had been late mani yawn punctuat the lazi convers hermion hair wa bushi again she confess to harri that she had use liber amount of sleekeazi hair potion on it for the ball but it way too much bother to do everi day she said matter­of­factli scratch a pur crookshank behind the ear ron and hermion seem to have reach an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument they were be quit friendli to each other though oddli formal ron and harri wast no time in tell

question shout over all the wail but noth happen he even threw the egg across the room ­ though he hadnt realli expect that to help harri had not forgotten the hint that cedric had given him but hi less­than­ friendli feel toward cedric just now meant that he wa keen not to take hi help if he could avoid it in ani case it seem to him that if cedric had realli want to give harri a hand he would have been a lot more explicit he harri had told cedric exactli what wa come in the first task ­ and cedric idea of a fair exchang had been to tell harri to take a bath well he didnt need that sort of

swim back to the side and tread water stare at the egg highli enjoy though it wa to swim in hot and foami water with cloud of different­color steam waft all around him no stroke of brillianc came to him no sudden burst of understand harri stretch out hi arm lift the egg in hi wet hand and open it the wail screech sound fill the bathroom echo and reverber off the marbl wall but it sound just as incomprehens as ever if not more so with all the echo he snap it shut again worri that the sound would attract filch wonder whether that hadnt been cedric plan ­ and then make him jump so badli that he drop the egg which clatter away across the bathroom floor someon spoke id tri put it in the water if i were you harri had swallow a consider amount of bubbl in shock he stood up sputter and saw the

siriu smile grimli crouch own son wa caught with a group of death eater whod manag to talk their way out of azkaban appar they were tri to find voldemort and return him to power crouch son wa caught gasp hermion yep said siriu throw hi chicken bone to buckbeak fling himself back down on the ground besid the loaf of bread and tear it in half nasti littl shock for old barti id imagin should have spent a bit more time at home with hi famili shouldnt he ought to have left the offic earli onc in a while gotten to know hi own son he began to wolf down larg piec of bread wa hi son a death eater said harri no idea said siriu still stuf down bread i wa in azkaban myself when he wa brought in thi is mostli stuff ive found out sinc i got out the boy wa definit caught in the compani of peopl id bet my life were death eater ­ but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time just like the house­elf did crouch tri and get hi son off hermion whisper siriu let out a laugh that wa much more like a bark crouch let hi son off i thought you had the measur of him hermion anyth that threaten to tarnish hi reput had to go he had dedic hi whole life to becom minist of magic you saw him dismiss a devot house­ elf becaus she associ him with the dark mark again ­ doesnt that tell you what he like crouch fatherli affect stretch just far enough to give hi son a trial and by all account it wasnt much more than an excus for crouch to show how much he hate the boy then he sent him straight to azkaban he gave hi own son to the dementor ask harri quietli that right said siriu and he didnt look remot amus now i saw the dementor bring him in watch them through the bar in my cell door he cant have been more than nineteen they took him into a cell near mine he wa scream for hi mother by nightfal he went quiet after a few day though they all went quiet in the end except when they shriek in their sleep for a moment the deaden look in siriuss eye becam more pronounc than ever as though shutter had close behind them so he still in azkaban harri said no said siriu dulli no he not in there anymor he die about a year after they brought him in he die he wasnt the onli one said siriu bitterli most go mad in there and plenti stop eat in the end they lose the will to live you could alway tell when a death wa come becaus the dementor could sens it they got excit that boy look pretti sickli when he arriv crouch be an import ministri member he and hi wife were allow a deathb visit that wa the last time i saw barti crouch half carri hi wife past my cell she die herself appar shortli afterward grief wast away just like the boy crouch never came for hi son bodi the dementor buri him outsid the fortress i watch them do it siriu threw asid the bread he had just lift to hi mouth and instead pick up the flask of pumpkin juic and drain it so old crouch lost it all just when he thought he had it made he continu wipe hi mouth with the back of hi hand one moment a hero pois to becom minist of magicnext hi son dead hi wife dead the famili name dishonor and so ive heard sinc i escap a big drop in popular onc the boy had die peopl start feel a bit more sympathet toward the son and start ask how a nice young lad from a good famili had gone so badli astray the conclus wa that hi father never care much for him so corneliu fudg got the top job and crouch wa shunt sideway into the depart of intern magic cooper there wa a long silenc harri wa think of the way crouch eye had bulg as hed look down at hi disobedi house­elf back in the wood at the quidditch world cup thi then must have been whi crouch had overreact to winki be found beneath the dark mark it had brought back memori of hi son and the old scandal and hi fall from grace at the ministri moodi say crouch is obsess with catch dark wizard harri told siriu yeah ive heard it becom a bit of a mania with him said siriu nod if you ask me he still think he can bring back the old popular by catch one more death eater and he sneak up here to search snape offic s aid ron triumphantli look at hermion ye and that doesnt make sens at all said siriu yeah it doe said ron excitedli but siriu shook hi head listen if crouch want to investig snape whi hasnt he been come to judg the tournament it would be an ideal excus to make regular visit to hogwart and keep an eye on him so you think snape could be up to someth then ask harri but hermion broke in look i dont care what you say dumbledor trust snape ­ oh give it a rest hermion said ron impati i know dumbledor brilliant and everyth but that doesnt mean a realli clever dark wizard couldnt fool him ­ whi did snape save harri life in the first year then whi didnt he just let him die i dunno ­ mayb he thought dumbledor would kick him out­ what dyou think siriu harri said loudli and ron and hermion stop bicker to listen i think theyv both got a point said siriu look thought at ron and hermion ever sinc i found out snape wa teach here ive wonder whi dumbledor hire him snape alway been fascin by the dark art he wa famou for it at school slimi oili greasy­hair kid he wa siriu ad and harri and ron grin at each other snape knew more curs when he arriv at school than half the kid in seventh year and he wa part of a gang of slytherin who nearli all turn out to be death eater siriu held up hi finger and began tick off name rosier and wilk ­ they were both kill by auror the year befor voldemort fell the lestrang ­ theyr a marri coupl ­ theyr in azkaban averi ­ from what ive heard he worm hi way out of troubl by say hed been act under the imperiu curs ­ he still at larg but as far as i know snape wa never even accus of be a death eater ­ not that that mean much plenti of them were never caught and snape s certainli clever and cun enough to keep himself out of troubl snape know karkaroff pretti well but he want to keep that quiet said ron yeah you shouldv seen snape face when karkaroff turn up in potion yesterday said harri quickli karkaroff want to talk to snape he say snape been avoid him karkaroff look realli worri he show snape someth on hi arm but i couldnt see what it wa he show snape someth on hi arm said siriu look frankli bewild he ran hi finger distractedli through hi filthi hair then shrug again well ive no idea what that about but if karkaroff s genuin worri and he go to snape for answer siriu stare at the cave wall then made a grimac of frustrat there still the fact that dumbledor trust snape and i know dumbledor trust where a lot of other peopl wouldnt but i just cant see him let snape teach at hogwart if hed ever work for voldemort whi are moodi and crouch so keen to get into snape offic then said ron stubbornli well said siriu slowli i wouldnt put it past mad­ey to have search everi singl teacher offic when he got to hogwart he take hi defens against the dark art serious moodi im not sure he trust anyon at all and after the thing he seen it not surpris ill say thi for moodi though he never kill if he could help it alway brought peopl in aliv where possibl he wa tough but he never descend to the level of the death eater crouch though he a differ matter is he realli ill if he is whi did he make the effort to drag himself up to snape offic and if he not what he up to what wa he do at the world cup that wa so import he didnt turn up in the top box what he been do while he should
