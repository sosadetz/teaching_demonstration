whose scope and ubiquit author had left it mark on everi planet yet these children of muaddib are flesh and blood stilgar thought two simpl thrust of my knife would still their heart their water would return to the tribe hi wayward mind fell into turmoil at such a thought to kill muaddib children but the year had made him wise in introspect stilgar knew the origin of such a terribl thought it came from the left hand of the damn not from the right hand of the bless the ayat and burhan of life held few mysteri for him onc hed been proud to think of himself as fremen to think of the desert as a friend to name hi planet dune in hi thought and not arraki as it wa mark on all of the imperi star chart how simpl thing were when our messiah wa onli a dream he thought by find our mahdi we loos upon

would have been no muaddib these twin now through chani their mother and my kinswoman my blood flow in their vein i am there with muaddib and chani and all the other what have we done to our univers stilgar could not explain whi such thought came to him in the night and whi they made him feel so guilti he crouch within hi hood robe realiti wa not at all like the dream the friendli desert which onc had spread from pole to pole wa reduc to half it former size the mythic paradis of spread greeneri fill him with dismay it wa not like the dream and as hi planet chang he knew he had chang he had becom a far more subtl person than the onetim sietch chieftain he wa awar now of mani thing of statecraft and profound consequ in the smallest decis yet he felt thi knowledg and subtleti as a thin veneer cover an iron core of simpler more determinist awar and that older core call out to him plead with him for a return to cleaner valu the morn sound of the sietch began intrud upon hi thought peopl were begin to move about in the cavern he felt a breez against hi cheek peopl were go out through the doorseal into the predawn dark the breez spoke of careless as it spoke of the time warren

flood in a wadi until that event the word drown had not exist in the languag of dune but thi wa no longer dune thi wa arraki and it wa the morn of an event day he thought jessica mother of muaddib and grandmoth of these royal twin return to our planet today whi doe she end her selfimpos exil at thi time whi doe she leav the soft and secur of caladan for the danger of arraki and there were other worri would she sens stilgar doubt she wa a bene gesserit witch graduat of the sisterhood deepest train and a reverend mother in her own right such femal were acut and they were danger would she order him to fall upon hi own knife as the ummaprotector of lietkyn had been order would i obey her he wonder he could not answer that question but now he thought about lietkyn the planetologist who had first dream of transform the planetwid desert of dune into the humansupport green planet which it wa becom lietkyn had been chani father without him there would have been no dream no chani no royal twin the work of thi fragil chain dismay stilgar how have we met in thi place he ask himself how have we combin for what purpos is it my duti to end it all to shatter that great combin stilgar admit the terribl urg within him now he could make that choic deni love and famili to do what a naib must do on occas make a deadli decis for the good of the tribe by one view such a murder repres ultim betray and atroc to kill mere children yet they were not mere children they had eaten melang had share in the sietch orgi had probe the desert for sandtrout and play the other game of fremen children and they sat in the royal council children of such tender year yet wise enough to sit in the council they might be children in flesh but they were ancient in experi born with a total of genet memori a terrifi awar which set their aunt alia and themselv apart from all other live human mani time in mani night had stilgar found hi mind circl thi differ share by the twin and their aunt mani time had he been awaken from sleep by these torment come here to the twin bedchamb with hi dream unfinish now hi doubt came to focu failur to make a decis wa in itself a decis he knew thi these twin and their

plan had they allow for melang oh they knew about thi possibl but they fear it and call it abomin that wa the most dismay fact abomin they must possess reason for such a judgment and if they said alia wa an abomin then that must appli equal to the twin becaus chani too had been addict her bodi satur with spice and her gene had somehow complement those of muaddib stilgar thought move in ferment there could be no doubt these twin went beyond their father but in which direct the boy spoke of an abil to be hi father and had prove it even as an infant leto had reveal memori which onli muaddib

sisterhood to support her ducal mate but rumor said she had return to the bene gesserit way i could end all of these dream stilgar thought how simpl it would be and yet again he wonder at himself that he could contempl such a choic were muaddib twin respons for the realiti which obliter the dream of other no they were mere the len through which light pour to reveal new shape in the univers in torment hi mind revert to primari fremen belief and he thought god command come so seek not to hasten it god it is to show the way and some do swerv from it it wa the religion of muaddib which upset

wa vagu and fuzzi full of unexpect movement and chang humankind as a whole had to be enter into thi comput as a natur phenomenon and the whole process of precis analysi repres a chop off a remov from

victim inflict a poison with it bite the hous ferret will prevent that alia said one of them then irulan ask couldnt be done the hous ferret would reject an outsid kill it you know that i wa just

infin as express by life the latent cup of total immers in mentat awar which lay in wait for everi mentat it threw hi awar onto the univers like a net fall defin the shape within it he saw the twin crouch in dark while giant claw rake the air about them no he whisper what alia look at him as though surpris to find him still there he took hi hand from hi eye the garment that hous corrino sent he ask have they been sent on to the twin of cours irulan said theyr perfectli safe no one go to tri for the twin at sietch tabr alia said not with all of those stilgartrain guard around idaho stare at

that to the smuggler alia said ill put my depend on the hous ferret idaho shook hi head what could hous ferret do against claw the size of those he envis but alia wa right bribe in the right place one acquiesc guild navig and anyplac in the empti quarter becam a land port the guild would resist a front posit in ani attack on hous atreid but if the price were high enough well the guild could onli be thought of as someth like a geolog barrier which made attack difficult but not imposs they could alway protest that they were just a transport agenc how could they know to what use a particular cargo would be put alia broke the silenc with a pure fremen gestur a rais fist with thumb horizont she accompani the gestur with a tradit explet which meant i give typhoon conflict she obvious saw herself as the onli logic target for assassin and the gestur protest a univers full of undigest threat she wa say she would hurl the death wind at anyon who attack her idaho felt the hopeless of ani protest he saw that she no longer suspect him he wa go back to tabr and she expect a perfectli execut abduct of the ladi jessica he lift himself from the divan in an adrenalin surg of anger think if onli alia were the target if onli assassin could get to her for an instant he rest hi hand on hi own knife but it wa not in him to do thi far better though that she die a martyr than live to be discredit and bound into a sandi grave ye alia said misinterpret hi express as concern for her youd best hurri back to tabr and she thought how foolish of me to suspect duncan he mine not jessica it had been the demand from the tribe thatd upset her alia thought she wave an airi goodby to idaho as he left idaho left the council chamber feel hopeless not onli wa alia blind with her alien possess but she becam more insan with each crisi shed alreadi pass her danger point and wa doom but what could be done for the twin whom could he convinc stilgar and what could stilgar do that he wasnt alreadi do the ladi jessica then ye hed explor that possibl but she too might be far gone in plot with her sisterhood he carri few illus about that atreid concubin she might do anyth at the command of the bene gesserit even turn against her own grandchildren good govern never depend upon law but upon the person qualiti of those who govern the machineri of govern is alway subordin to the will of those who administ

sign of spring at castl caladan she did not like to direct her think in such a logic fashion one of the first lesson of the sisterhood had been to reserv an attitud of question distrust for anyth which came in the guis of logic but the member of the deleg had known that too how moist the air had been that morn jessica thought look around alia anteroom how fresh and moist here there wa a sweati damp to the air which evok a sens of uneasi in jessica and she thought ive revert to fremen way the air wa too moist in thi sietchaboveground what wa wrong with the master of the still paul would

ancient fremen time the water of concept the amniot fluid of the newborn wa save at birth distil into the first water fed to that child the tradit form requir a godmoth to serv the water say here is the water of thi concept even the young fremen still follow thi tradit with their own newborn the water of thi concept faradn found himself revolt by the idea of drink water distil from the amniot fluid which had born him and he thought about the surviv twin ghanima her mother dead when shed taken that strang water had she reflect later upon that odd link with her past probabl not shed been rais fremen what wa natur and accept to fremen had been natur and accept to her momentarili faradn regret the death of leto ii it would have been interest to discuss thi point with him perhap an opportun would come to discuss it with ghanima whi did idaho cut hi wrist the question persist everi time he glanc at the spi screen again doubt assail faradn he long for the abil to sink into the

fathomless were hi ghola eye abov all els the mentat must be a generalist not a specialist it is wise to have decis of great moment monitor by generalist expert and specialist lead you quickli into chao they are a sourc of useless nit pick the feroci quibbl over a comma the mentatgeneralist on the other hand should bring to decisionmak a healthi common sens he must not cut himself off from the broad sweep of what is happen in hi univers he must remain capabl of say there no real mysteri about thi at the moment thi is what we want now it may prove wrong later but well correct that when we come to it the mentatgeneralist must understand that anyth which we can identifi as our univers is mere part of larger phenomena but the expert look backward he look into the narrow standard of hi own specialti the generalist look outward he look for live principl know full well that such principl chang that they develop it is to the characterist of chang itself that the mentatgeneralist must look there can be no perman catalogu of such chang no handbook or manual you must look at it with as few preconcept as possibl ask yourself now what is thi thing do the mentat handbook it wa the day of the

sound of it chosen for that reason no doubt a small worm would be easier to transport he thought about the worm captur the hunter would dull it with a water mist use the tradit fremen method of take a worm for the orgytransform rite but thi worm would not be kill by immers thi one would go out on a guild heighlin to some hope buyer whose desert probabl would be too moist few offworld realiz the

into reach mani a fremen die of thirst had risk hi last few drop of water in thi gambl know that the sweet green syrup teas from a sandtrout might yield a small profit in energi but the sandtrout were mostli the game of children who caught them for the huanui and for play leto shudder at the thought of what that play meant to him now he felt one of the creatur slither across hi bare foot it hesit

place it over the first one contact ignit a frenzi squirm in the creatur their cilia lock and they becam a singl membran which enclos him to the elbow the sandtrout adjust to the live glove of

stiff ridg circl from jaw to forehead and leav hi ear expos now the vision must be test he got to hi feet turn to run back toward the hut and as he move found hi feet move too fast for him to balanc he plung into the sand roll and leap to hi feet the leap took him two meter off the sand and when he fell back tri to walk he again move too fast stop he command himself he fell into the pranabindu forc relax gather hi sens into the pool of conscious thi focus the inward rippl of the constantnow through which he experienc time and he allow the visionel to warm him the membran work precis as the

himself torn by a desir to flee but hi vision held him motionless fascin by thi prolong moment no one had ever befor stood thi close to the mouth of a live worm and surviv gentli leto move hi right foot met a sand ridg and react too quickli wa propel toward the worm mouth he came to a stop on hi knee still the worm did not move it sens onli the sandtrout and would not attack the deepsand vector of it own kind the worm would attack anoth worm in it territori and would come to expos spice onli a water barrier stop it and sandtrout encapsul water were a water barrier experiment leto move a hand toward that awesom mouth the worm drew back a full meter confid restor leto turn away from the worm and began teach hi muscl to live with their new power cautious he walk back toward the qanat the worm remain motionless behind him when leto wa beyond the water barrier he leap with joy went sail ten meter across the sand sprawl roll laugh light flare on the sand as the hut doorseal wa breach sabiha stood outlin in the yellow and purpl glow of the lamp stare out at him laugh leto ran back across the qanat stop in front of the worm turn and face her with hi arm outstretch look he call the

effortless when he put effort into run he race over the sand with the wind burn the expos circl of hi face at the canyon dead end instead of stop he leap up a full fifteen meter claw at the cliff scrabbl climb like an insect and came out on the crest abov the tanzerouft the desert stretch befor him a vast silveri undul in the moonlight leto manic exhilar reced he squat sens how light hi bodi felt exert had produc a slick film of perspir which a stillsuit would have absorb and rout into the transfer tissu which remov the salt even as he relax the film disappear now absorb by the membran faster than a stillsuit could have done it thought leto roll a length of the membran beneath hi lip pull it into hi mouth and drank the sweet hi mouth wa not mask though fremenwis he sens hi bodi

from atop the cliff but ignor them to concentr on the leap stride from dunetop to dunetop as he grew more accustom to amplifi muscl he found a sensuou joy that he had not anticip in thi distancegulp movement it wa a ballet on the desert defianc of the tanzerouft which no other had ever experienc when he judg that the ornithopt occup had overcom their shock enough to mount pursuit onc more he dove for the moonshadow face of a dune burrow into it the sand wa like heavi liquid to hi new strength but the temperatur mount danger when he move too fast he broke free on the far face of the dune found
