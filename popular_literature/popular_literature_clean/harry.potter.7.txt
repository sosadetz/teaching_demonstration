around the trunk for the rest but noth more remain of hi godfath last gift except powder glass which clung to the deepest layer of debri like glitter grit harri sat up and examin the jag piec on which he had cut himself see noth but hi own bright green eye reflect back at him then he place the fragment on top of that morn daili prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempt to stem the sudden upsurg of bitter memori the stab of regret and of long the discoveri of the broken mirror had occas by attack the rest of the rubbish in the trunk it took anoth hour to empti it complet throw away the useless item and sort the remaind in pile accord to whether or not he would need them from now on hi school and quidditch robe cauldron parchment quill and most of hi textbook were pile in a corner to be left behind he wonder what hi aunt and uncl would do with them burn them in the dead of night probabl as if they were evid of some dread crime hi muggl cloth invis cloak potionmak kit certain book the photograph album hagrid had onc given him a stack of letter and hi wand had been repack into an old rucksack in a front pocket were the maraud map and the locket with the note sign rab insid it the locket wa accord thi place of honor not becaus it wa valuabl in all usual sens it wa worthless but becaus of what it had cost to attain it thi left a sizabl stack of newspap sit on hi desk besid hi snowi owl hedwig one for each of the day harri had spent at privet drive thi summer he got up off the floor stretch and move across to hi desk hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through newspap throw them into the rubbish pile one by one the owl wa asleep or els fake she wa angri with harri about the limit amount of time she wa allow out of her cage at the moment as he near the bottom of the pile of newspap harri slow down search for one particular issu that he knew had arriv shortli after he had return to privet drive for the summer he rememb that there had been a small mention on the front about the resign of chariti burbag the muggl studi teacher at hogwart at last he found it turn to page ten he sank into hi desk chair and reread the articl he had been look for albu dumbledor rememb by elphia doge i met albu dumbledor at the age of eleven on our first day at hogwart our mutual attract wa undoubtedli due to the fact that we both felt ourselv to be outsid i had contract dragon pox shortli befor arriv at school and while i wa no longer contagi my pockmark visag and greenish hue did not encourag mani to approach me for hi part albu had arriv at hogwart under the burden of unwant notorieti scarc a year previous hi father perciv had been convict of a savag and wellpublic attack upon three young muggl albu never attempt to deni that hi father who wa to die in azkaban had commit thi crime on the contrari when i pluck up courag to ask him he assur me that he knew hi father to be guilti beyond that dumbledor refus to speak of the sad busi though mani attempt to make him do so some inde were dispos to prais hi father action and assum that albu too wa a mugglehat they could not have been more mistaken as anybodi who knew albu would attest he never reveal the remotest antimuggl tendenc inde hi determin support for muggl right gain him mani enemi in subsequ year in a matter of month howev albuss own fame had begun to eclips that of hi father by the end of hi first year he would never again be known as the son of a mugglehat but as noth more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school those of us who were privileg to be hi friend benefit from hi exampl not to mention hi help and encourag with which he wa alway gener he confess to me later in life that he knew even then that hi greatest pleasur lay in teach he not onli won everi prize of note that the school offer he wa soon in regular correspond with the most notabl magic name of the day includ nicola flamel the celebr alchemist bathilda bagshot the note historian and adalbert waffl the magic theoretician sever of hi paper found their way into learn public such as transfigur today challeng in charm and the practic potion dumbledor futur career seem like to be meteor and the onli question that remain wa when he would becom minist of magic though it wa often predict in later year that he wa on the point of take the job howev he never had ministeri ambit three year after we had start at hogwart albuss brother aberforth arriv at school they were not alik aberforth wa never bookish and unlik albu prefer to settl argument by duel rather than through reason discuss howev it is quit wrong to suggest as some have that the brother were not friend they rub along as comfort as two such differ boy could do in fair to aberforth it must be admit that live in albuss shadow can not have been an altogeth comfort experi be continu outshon wa an occup hazard of be hi friend and can not have been ani more pleasur as a brother when albu and i left hogwart we intend to take the thentradit tour of the world togeth visit and observ foreign wizard befor pursu our separ career howev tragedi interven on the veri eve of our trip albuss mother kendra die leav albu the head and sole breadwinn of the famili i postpon my departur long enough to pay my respect at kendra funer then left for what wa now to be a solitari journey with a younger brother and sister to care for and littl gold left to them there could no longer be ani question of albu accompani me that wa the period of our live when we had least contact i wrote to albu describ perhap insensit the wonder of my journey from narrow escap from chimaera in greec to the experi of the egyptian alchemist hi letter told me littl of hi daytoday life which i guess to be frustratingli dull for such a brilliant wizard immers in my own experi it wa with horror that i heard toward the end of my year travel that anoth tragedi had struck the dumbledor the death of hi sister ariana though ariana had been in poor health for a long time the blow come so soon after the loss of their mother had a profound effect on both of her brother all those closest to albu and i count myself one of that lucki number agre that ariana death and albuss feel of person respons for it though of cours he wa guiltless left their mark upon him forevermor i return home to find a young man who had experienc a much older person suffer albu wa more reserv than befor and much less lightheart to add to hi miseri the loss of ariana had led not to a renew close between albu and aberforth but to an estrang in time thi would lift in later year they reestablish if not a close relationship then certainli a cordial one howev he rare spoke of hi parent or of ariana from then on and hi friend learn not to mention them other quill will describ the triumph of the follow year dumbledor innumer contribut to the store of wizard knowledg includ hi discoveri of the twelv use of dragon blood will benefit gener to come as will the wisdom he display in the mani judgment while chief warlock of the wizengamot they say still that no wizard duel ever match that between dumbledor and grindelwald in those who wit it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watch these two extraordinari wizard to battl dumbledor triumph and it consequ for the wizard world are consid a turn point in magic histori to match the introduct of the intern statut of secreci or the downfal of hewhomustnotbenam albu dumbledor wa never proud or vain he could find someth to valu in anyon howev appar insignific or wretch and i believ that hi earli loss endow him with great human and sympathi i shall miss hi friendship more than i can say but my loss is noth compar to the wizard world that he wa the most inspir and best love of all hogwart headmast can not be in question he die as he live work alway for the greater good and to hi last hour as will to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he wa on the day i met him harri finish read but continu to gaze at the pictur accompani the obituari dumbledor wa wear hi familiar kindli smile but as he peer over the top of hi halfmoon spectacl he gave the impress even in newsprint of xray harri whose sad mingl with a sens of humili he had thought he knew dumbledor quit well but ever sinc read thi obituari he had been forc to recogn that he had bare known him at all never onc had he imagin dumbledor childhood or youth it wa as though he had sprung into be as harri had known him vener and silverhair and old the idea of a teenag dumbledor wa simpli odd like tri to imagin a stupid hermion or a friendli blastend skrewt he had never thought to ask dumbledor about hi past no doubt it would have felt strang impertin even but after all it had been common knowledg that dumbledor had taken part in that legendari duel with grindelwald and harri had not thought to ask dumbledor what that had been like nor about ani of hi other famou achiev no they had alway discuss harri harri past harri futur harri plan and it seem to harri now despit the fact that hi futur wa so danger and so uncertain that he had miss irreplac opportun when he had fail to ask dumbledor more about himself even though the onli person question he had ever ask hi headmast wa also the onli one he suspect that dumbledor had not answer honestli what do you see when you look in the mirror i i see myself hold a pair of thick woolen sock after sever minut thought harri tore the obituari out of the prophet fold it care and tuck it insid the first volum of practic defens magic and it use against the dark art then he threw the rest of the newspap onto the rubbish pile and turn to face the room it wa much tidier the onli thing left out of place were today daili prophet still lie on the bed and on top of it the piec of broken mirror harri move across the room slid the mirror fragment off today prophet and unfold the newspap he had mere glanc at the headlin when he had taken the rolledup paper from the deliveri owl earli that morn and thrown it asid after note that it said noth about voldemort harri wa sure that the ministri wa lean on the prophet to suppress news about voldemort it wa onli now therefor that he saw what he had miss across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headlin wa set over a pictur of dumbledor stride along look harri dumbledor the truth at last come next week the shock stori of the flaw geniu consid by mani to be the greatest wizard of hi gener stripe away the popular imag of seren silverbeard wisdom rita skeeter reveal the disturb childhood the lawless youth the lifelong feud and the guilti secret that dumbledor carri to hi grave whi wa the man tip to be the minist of magic content to remain a mere headmast what wa the real purpos of the secret organ known as the order of the phoenix how did dumbledor realli meet hi end the answer to these and mani more question are explor in the explos new biographi the life and lie of albu dumbledor by rita skeeter exclus interview by berri braithwait page insid harri rip open the paper and found page thirteen the articl wa top with a pictur show anoth familiar face a woman wear jewel glass with elabor curl blond hair her teeth bare in what wa clearli suppos to be a win smile wiggl her finger up at him do hi best to ignor thi nauseat imag harri read on in person rita skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famous feroci quillportrait might suggest greet me in the hallway of her cozi home she lead me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea a slice of pound cake and it goe without say a steam vat of freshest gossip well of cours dumbledor is a biograph dream say skeeter such a long full life im sure my book will be the first of veri veri mani skeeter wa certainli quick off the mark her ninehundredpag book wa complet in a mere four week after dumbledor mysteri death in june i ask her how she manag thi superfast feat oh when youv been a journalist as long as i have work to a deadlin is second natur i knew that the wizard world wa clamor for the full stori and i want to be the first to meet that need i mention the recent wide public remark of elphia doge special advisor to the wizengamot and longstand friend of albu dumbledor that skeeter book contain less fact than a chocol frog card skeeter throw back her head and laugh darl dodgi i rememb interview him a few year back about merpeopl right bless him complet gaga seem to think we were sit at the bottom of lake windermer kept tell me to watch out for trout and yet elphia doge accus of inaccuraci have been echo in mani place doe skeeter realli feel that four short week have been enough to gain a full pictur of dumbledor long and extraordinari life oh my dear beam skeeter rap me affection across the knuckl you know as well as i do how much inform can be gener by a fat bag of galleon a refus to hear the word no and a nice sharp quickquot quill peopl were queu to dish the dirt on dumbledor anyway not everyon thought he wa so wonder you know he trod on an aw lot of import toe but old dodgi doge can get off hi high hippogriff becaus ive had access to a sourc most journalist would swap their wand for one who ha never spoken in public befor and who wa close to dumbledor dure the most turbul and disturb phase of hi youth the advanc public for skeeter biographi ha certainli suggest that there will be shock in store for those who believ dumbledor to have led a blameless life what were the biggest surpris she uncov i ask now come off it betti im not give away all the highlight befor anybodi bought the book laugh skeeter but i can promis that anybodi who still think dumbledor wa white as hi beard is in for a rude awaken let just say that nobodi hear him rage against youknowwho would have dream that he dabbl in the dark art himself in hi youth and for a wizard who spent hi later year plead for toler he wasnt exactli broadmind when he wa younger ye albu dumbledor had an extrem murki past not to mention that veri fishi famili which he work so hard to keep hush up i ask whether skeeter is refer to dumbledor brother aberforth whose convict by the wizengamot for misus of magic caus a minor scandal fifteen year ago oh aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap laugh skeeter no no im talk about much wors than a brother with a fond for fiddl about with goat wors even than the mugglemaim father dumbledor couldnt keep either of them quiet anyway they were both charg by the wizengamot no it the mother and the sister that intrigu me and a littl dig uncov a posit nest of nasti but as i say youll have to wait for chapter nine to twelv for full detail all i can say now is it no wonder dumbledor never talk about how hi nose got broken famili skeleton notwithstand doe skeeter deni the brillianc that led to dumbledor mani magic discoveri he had brain she conced although mani now question whether he could realli take full credit for all of hi suppos achiev as i reveal in chapter sixteen ivor dillonsbi claim he had alreadi discov eight use of dragon blood when dumbledor borrow hi paper but the import of some of dumbledor achiev can not i ventur be deni what of hi famou defeat of grindelwald oh now im glad you mention grindelwald say skeeter with such a tantal smile im afraid those who go dewyey over dumbledor spectacular victori must brace themselv for a bombshel or perhap a dungbomb veri dirti busi inde all ill say is dont be so sure that there realli wa a spectacular duel of legend after theyv read my book peopl may be forc to conclud that grindelwald simpli conjur a white handkerchief from the end of hi wand and came quietli skeeter refus to give ani more away on thi intrigu subject so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedli fascin her reader more than ani other oh ye say skeeter nod briskli i devot an entir chapter to the whole potterdumbledor relationship it been call unhealthi even sinist again your reader will have to buy my book for the whole stori but there is no question that dumbledor took an unnatur interest in potter from the word go whether that wa realli in the boy best interest

mr weasley detach harri from the other by ask him to help identifi a lone man sock that she thought might have come out of hi rucksack onc she had him corner in the tini sculleri off the kitchen she start ron and hermion seem to think that the three of you are drop out of hogwart she began in a light casual tone oh said harri well yeah we are the mangl turn of it own accord in a corner wring out

prepar for the wed that they hardli had ani time to think the kindest explan of thi behavior would have been that mr weasley want to distract them all from thought of madey and the terror of their recent journey after two day of nonstop cutleri clean of colormatch favor ribbon and flower of degnom the garden and help mr weasley cook vast batch of canapé howev harri start to suspect her of a differ motiv all the job she hand out seem to keep him ron and hermion away from one anoth he had not had a chanc to speak to the two of them alon sinc the first night when he had told them about voldemort tortur ollivand i think mum think that if she can stop the three of you get togeth and plan shell be abl to delay you leav ginni told harri in an underton as they laid the tabl for dinner on the third night of hi stay and then what doe she think go to happen harri mutter someon els might kill off voldemort while she hold us here make volauv he had spoken without think and saw ginni face whiten so it true she said that what your tri to do i not i wa joke said harri evas they stare at each other and there wa someth more than shock in ginni express suddenli harri becam awar that thi wa the first time that he had been alon with her sinc those stolen hour in seclud corner of the hogwart ground he wa sure she wa rememb them too both of them jump as the door open and mr weasley kingsley and bill walk in they were often join by other order member for dinner now becaus the burrow had replac number twelv grimmauld place as the headquart mr weasley had explain that after the death of dumbledor their secretkeep each of the peopl to whom dumbledor had confid grimmauld place locat had becom a secretkeep in turn and as there are around twenti of us that greatli dilut the power of the fideliu charm twenti time as mani opportun for the death eater to get the secret out of somebodi we cant expect it to hold much longer but sure snape will have told the death eater the address by now ask harri well madey set up a coupl of curs against snape in case he turn up there again we hope theyll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind hi tongu if he tri to talk about the place but we cant be sure it would have been insan to keep use the place as headquart now that it protect ha becom so shaki the kitchen wa so crowd that even it wa difficult to maneuv knive and fork harri found himself cram besid ginni the unsaid thing that had just pass between them made him wish they had been separ by a few more peopl he wa tri so hard to avoid brush her arm he could bare cut hi chicken no news about madey harri ask bill noth repli bill they had not been abl to hold a funer for moodi becaus bill and lupin had fail to recov hi bodi it had been difficult to know where he might have fallen given the dark and the confus of the battl the daili prophet hasnt said a word about him die or about find the bodi bill went on but that doesnt mean much it keep a lot quiet these day and they still havent call a hear about all the underag magic i use escap the death eater harri call across the tabl to mr weasley who shook hi head becaus they know i had no choic or becaus they dont want me to

that theyr convinc theyr realli call wendel and monica wilkin and that their life ambit is to move to australia which they have now done that to make it more difficult for voldemort to track them down and interrog them about me or you becaus unfortun ive told them quit a bit about you assum i surviv our hunt for the horcrux ill find mum and dad and lift the enchant if i dont well i think ive cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happi wendel and monica wilkin dont know that theyv got a daughter you see hermion eye were swim with tear again ron got back off the bed put hi arm around her

the low ceil a hatch open right over their head and a ladder slid down to their feet a horribl halfsuck halfmoan sound came out of the squar hole along with an unpleas smell like open drain that your ghoul isnt it ask harri who had never actual met the creatur that sometim disrupt the nightli silenc yeah it is said ron climb the ladder come and have a look at him harri follow ron up the few short step into the tini attic space hi head and shoulder were in the room befor he caught sight of the creatur curl up a few feet from him fast asleep in the gloom with it larg mouth wide open but it it look do ghoul normal wear pajama no said ron nor have they usual got red hair or that number of pustul harri contempl the thing slightli revolt it wa human in shape and size and wa wear what now that harri eye becam use to the dark wa clearli an old pair of ron pajama he wa also sure that ghoul were gener rather slimi and bald rather than distinctli hairi and cover in angri purpl blister he me see said ron no said harri i dont ill explain it back in my room the smell get to me said ron they climb back down the ladder which ron return to the ceil and rejoin hermion who wa still sort book onc weve left the ghoul go to come and live down here in my room said ron i think he realli look forward to it well it hard to tell becaus all he can do is moan and drool but he nod a lot when you mention it anyway he go to be me with spattergroit good eh harri mere look hi confus it is said ron clearli frustrat that harri had not grasp the brillianc of the plan look when we three dont turn up at hogwart again everyon go to think hermion and i must be with you right which mean the death eater will go straight for our famili to see if theyv got inform on where you are but hope itll look like ive gone away with mum and dad a lot of muggleborn are talk about go into hide at the moment said hermion we cant hide my whole famili itll look too fishi and they cant all leav their job said ron so were go to put out the stori that im serious ill with spattergroit which is whi i cant go back to school if anyon come call to investig mum or dad can show them the ghoul in my bed cover in pustul spattergroit realli contagi so theyr not go to want to go near him it wont matter that he cant say anyth either becaus appar you cant onc the fungu ha spread to your uvula and your mum and dad are in on thi plan ask harri dad is he help fred and georg transform the ghoul mum well youv seen what she like she wont accept were go till were gone there wa silenc in the room broken onli by gentl thud as hermion continu to throw book onto one pile or the other ron sat watch her and harri look from one to the other unabl to say anyth the measur they had taken to protect their famili made him realiz more than anyth els could have done that they realli were go to come with him and that they knew exactli how danger that would be he want to tell them what that meant to him but he simpli could not find word import enough through the silenc came the muffl sound of mr weasley shout from four floor below ginni probabl left a speck of dust on a poxi napkin ring said ron i dunno whi the delacour have got to come two day befor the wed fleur sister a bridesmaid she need to be here for the rehears and she too young to come on her own said hermion as she pore indecis over break with a banshe well guest arent go to help mum stress level said ron what we realli need to decid said hermion toss defens magic theori into the bin without a second glanc and pick up an apprais of magic educ in europ is where were go after we leav here i know you said you want to go to godric hollow first harri and i understand whi but well shouldnt we make the horcrux our prioriti if we knew where ani of the horcrux were id agre with you said harri who did not believ that hermion realli understood hi desir to return to godric hollow hi parent grave were onli part of the attract he had a strong though inexplic feel that the place held answer for him perhap it wa simpli becaus it wa there that he had surviv voldemort kill curs now that he wa face the challeng of repeat the feat harri wa drawn to the place where it had happen want to understand dont you think there a possibl that voldemort keep a watch on godric hollow hermion ask he might expect you to go back and visit your parent grave onc your free to go wherev you like thi had not occur to harri while he struggl to find a counterargu ron spoke up evid follow hi own train of thought thi rab person he said you know the one who stole the real locket hermion nod he said in hi note he wa go to destroy it didnt he harri drag hi rucksack toward him and pull out the fake horcrux in which rab note wa still fold i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as i can harri read out well what if he did finish it off said ron or she interpos hermion whichev said ron itd be one less for us to do ye but were still go to have to tri and trace the real locket arent we said hermion to find out whether or not it destroy and onc we get hold of it how do you destroy a horcrux ask ron well said hermion ive been research that how ask harri i didnt think there were ani book on horcrux in the librari there werent said hermion who had turn pink dumbledor remov them all but he he didnt destroy them ron sat up straight wideey how in the name of merlin pant have you manag to get your hand on those horcrux book it it wasnt steal said hermion look from harri to ron with a kind of desper they were still librari book even if dumbledor had taken them off the shelv anyway if he realli didnt want anyon to get at them im sure he would have made it much harder to get to the point said ron well it wa easi said hermion in a small voic i just did a summon charm you know accio and they zoom out of dumbledor studi window right into the girl dormitori but when did you do thi harri ask regard hermion with a mixtur of admir and incredul just after hi dumbledor funer said hermion in an even smaller voic right after we agre wed leav school and go and look for the horcrux when i went back upstair to get my thing it it just occur to me that the more we knew about them the better it would be and i wa alon in there so i tri and it work they flew straight in through the open window and i i pack them she swallow and then said imploringli i cant believ dumbledor would have been angri it not as though were go to use the inform to make a horcrux is it can you hear us complain said ron where are these book anyway hermion rummag for a moment and then extract from the pile a larg volum bound in fade black leather she look a littl nauseat and held it as gingerli as if it were someth recent dead thi is the one that give explicit instruct on how to make a horcrux secret of the darkest art it a horribl book realli aw full of evil magic i wonder when dumbledor remov it from the librari if he didnt do it until he wa headmast i bet voldemort got all the instruct he need from here whi did he have to ask slughorn how to make a horcrux then if hed alreadi read that ask ron he onli approach slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven said harri dumbledor wa sure riddl alreadi knew how to make a horcrux by the time he ask slughorn about them i think your right hermion that could easili have been where he got the inform and the more ive read about them said hermion the more horribl they seem and the less i can believ that he actual made six it warn in thi book how unstabl you make the rest of your soul by rip it and that just by make one horcrux harri rememb what dumbledor had said about voldemort move beyond usual evil isnt there ani way of put yourself back togeth ron ask ye said hermion with a hollow smile but it would be excruciatingli pain whi how do you do it ask harri remors said hermion youv got to realli feel what youv done there a footnot appar the pain of it can destroy you i cant see voldemort attempt it somehow can you no said ron befor harri could answer so doe it say how to destroy horcrux in that book ye said hermion now turn the fragil page as if examin rot entrail becaus it warn dark wizard how strong they have to make the enchant on them from all that ive read what harri did to riddl diari wa one of the few realli foolproof way of destroy a horcrux what stab it with a basilisk fang ask harri oh well lucki weve got such a larg suppli of basilisk fang then said ron i wa wonder what we were go to do with them it doesnt have to be a basilisk fang said hermion patient it ha to be someth so destruct that the horcrux cant repair itself basilisk venom onli ha one antidot and it incred rare phoenix tear said harri nod exactli said hermion our problem is that there are veri few substanc as destruct as basilisk venom and theyr all danger to carri around with you that a problem were go to have to solv though becaus rip smash or crush a horcrux wont do the trick youv got to put it beyond magic repair but even if we wreck the thing it live in said ron whi cant the bit of soul in it just go and live in someth els becaus a horcrux is

shadow he buri madey moodi eye and mark the spot by goug a small cross in the bark with hi wand it wa not much but harri felt that madey would have much prefer thi to be stuck on dolor umbridg door then he return to the tent to wait for the other to wake and discuss what they were go to do next harri and hermion felt that it wa best not to stay anywher too long and ron agre wit the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich hermion therefor remov the enchant she had place around the clear while harri and ron obliter all the mark and impress on the ground that might show they had camp there then they disappar to the outskirt of a small market town onc they had pitch the tent in the shelter of a small cops of tree and surround it with freshli cast

the stitch in hi side wouldnt come their express of constern and disappoint made harri feel asham it had been a nightmarish experi see the dementor glide out of the must in the distanc and realiz as the paralyz cold choke hi lung and a distant scream fill hi ear that he wa not go to be abl to protect himself it had taken all harri willpow to uproot himself from the spot and run leav the eyeless dementor to glide amongst the muggl who might not be abl to see them but would assuredli feel the despair they cast wherev they went so we still havent got ani food shut up ron snap hermion harri what

glanc at harri there no point stay where we know dementor are swoop around in the end they settl down for the night in a far flung field belong to a lone farm from which they had manag to obtain egg and bread it not steal is it ask hermion in a troubl voic as they devour scrambl egg on toast not if i left some money under the chicken coo ron roll hi eye and said with hi cheek bulg ermyne oo worri oo much elax and inde it wa much easier to relax when they were comfort well fed the argument about the dementor wa forgotten in laughter that night and harri felt cheer even hope as he took the first of the three night watch thi wa their first encount with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirit an empti one bicker and gloom harri wa least surpris by thi becaus be had suffer period of near starvat at the dursley hermion bore up reason well on those night when they manag to scaveng noth but berri or stale biscuit her temper perhap a littl shorter than usual and her silenc dour ron howev had alway been use to three delici meal a day courtesi of hi mother or of the hogwart houseelv and hunger made him both unreason and irasc whenev lack of food coincid with ron turn to wear the horcrux he becam downright unpleas so where next wa hi constant refrain he did not seem to have ani idea himself but expect harri and hermion to come up with plan while he sat and brood over the low food suppli accordingli harri and hermion spent fruitless hour tri to decid where they might find the other horcrux and how to destroy the one they alreadi got their convers becom increasingli repetit as they got no new inform as dumbledor had told harri that be believ voldemort had hidden the horcrux in place import to him they kept recit in a sort of dreari litani those locat they knew that voldemort had live or visit the orphanag where he had been born and rais hogwart where he had been educ borgin and burk where he had work after complet school then albania where he had spent hi year of exil these form the basi of their specul yeah let go to albania shouldnt take more than an afternoon to search an entir countri said ron sarcast there cant be anyth there hed alreadi made five of hi horcrux befor he went into exil and dumbledor wa certain the snake is the sixth said hermion we know the snake not in albania it usual with vol didnt i ask you to stop say that fine the snake is usual with youknowwhohappi not particularli i cant see him hide anyth at borgin and burk said harri who had made thi point mani time befor but said it again simpli to break the nasti silenc borgin and burk were expert at dark object they wouldv recogn a horcrux straightaway ron yawn pointedli repress a strong urg to throw someth at him harri plow on i still reckon he might have hidden someth at hogwart hermion sigh but dumbledor would have found it harri harri repeat the argument he kept bring out in favor of thi theori dumbledor said in front of me that he never assum he knew all of hogwart secret im tell you if there wa one place vol oi youknowwho then harri shout goad past endur if there wa one place that wa realli import to youknowwho it wa hogwart oh come on scof ron hi school yeah hi school it wa hi first real home the place that meant he wa special it meant everyth to him and even after he left thi is youknowwho were talk about right not you inquir ron he wa tug at the chain of the horcrux around hi neck harri wa visit by a desir to seiz it and throttl him you told us that youknowwho ask dumbledor to give him a job after he left said hermion that right said harri and dumbledor thought he onli want to come back to tri and find someth probabl anoth founder object to make into anoth horcrux yeah said harri but he didnt get the job did he said hermion so he never got the chanc to find a founder object there and hide it in the school okay then said harri defeat forget hogwart without ani other lead they travel into london and hidden beneath the invis cloak search for the orphanag in which voldemort had been rais hermion stole into a librari and discov from their record that the place had been demolish mani year befor they visit it site and found a tower block of offic we could tri dig in to foundat hermion suggest halfheartedli he wouldnt have hidden a horcrux here harri said he had known it all along the orphanag had been the place voldemort had been determin to escap he would never have hidden a part of hi soul there dumbledor had shown harri that voldemort sought grandeur or mystiqu in hi hide place thi dismal gray corner of london wa as far

slowmot game of passtheparcel where they dread the music stop becaus the reward wa twelv hour of increas fear and anxieti harri scare kept prickl it happen most often he notic when he wa wear the horcrux sometim he could not stop himself react to the pain what what did you see demand ron whenev he notic harri winc a face mutter harri everi time the same face the thief who stole from gregorovitch and ron would turn away make no effort to hide hi disappoint harri knew that ron wa hope to bear news of hi famili or the rest of the order of the phoenix but after all he harri wa not a televis aerial he could onli see what voldemort wa think at the time not tune in to whatev took hi fanci appar voldemort wa dwell endlessli on the unknown youth with the gleeful face whose name and whereabout harri felt sure voldemort knew no better than he did as harri scar continu to burn and the merri blondhair boy swam tantalizingli in hi memori he learn to suppress ani sign of pain or discomfort for the other two show noth but impati at the mention of the thief he could not entir blame them when they were so desper for a lean on the horcrux as the day stretch into week harri began

on what now felt like a pointless and rambl journey becaus they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due cours ton wa make no effort to hide hi bad mood and harri wa start to fear that hermion too wa disappoint by hi poor leadership in desper he tri to think of further horcrux locat but the onli one that continu to occur to him wa hogwart and as neither of the other thought thi

examin it by wandlight he wa wait for the moment when ron label dot would reappear in the corridor of hogwart prove that he had return to the comfort castl protect by hi statu of pureblood howev ron did not appear on the map and after a while harri found himself take it out simpli to stare at ginni name in the girl dormitori wonder whether the intens with which he gaze at it might break into her sleep that she would somehow know he wa think about her hope that she wa all right by day hey devot themselv to tri to determin the possibl locat of gryffindor sword but the more they talk about the place in which dumbledor might have hidden it the more desper and farfetch their specul becam cudgel hi brain though he might harri could not rememb dumbledor ever mention a place in which he might hide someth there were moment when he did not know whether he wa angrier with ron or with dumbledor we thought you knew what you were do we thought dumbledor had told you what to do we thought you had a real plan he could not hide it from himself ron had been right dumbledor had left him with virtual noth they had discov one horcrux but they had no mean of destroy it the other were as unattain as they had ever been hopeless threaten to engulf him he wa stagger now to think of hi own presumpt in accept hi friend offer to accompani him on thi meander pointless journey he knew noth he had no idea and he wa constantli pain on the alert for ani indic that hermion too wa about to tell him that she had had enough that she wa leav they were spend mani even in near silenc and hermion took to bring out phinea nigelluss portrait and prop it up in a chair as though he might fill part of the gape hole left by ron departur despit hi previou assert that he would never visit them again phinea nigellu did not seem abl to resist the chanc to find out more about what harri wa up to and consent to reappear blindfold everi few day of so harri wa even glad to see him becaus he wa compani albeit of a snide and taunt kind they relish ani news about what wa happen at hogwart though phinea nigellu wa not an ideal inform he vener snape the first slytherin headmast sinc he himself had control the school and they had to be care not to critic or ask impertin question about snape or phinea nigellu would instantli leav hi paint howev he did let drop certain snippet snape seem to be face a constant low level of mutini from a hard core of student ginni had been ban from go into hogsmead snape had reinstat umbridg old decre forbid gather of three or more student or ani unoffici student societi from all of these thing harri deduc that ginni and probabl nevil and luna along with her had been do their best to continu dumbledor armi thi scant news made harri want to see ginni so badli it felt like a stomachach but it also made him think of ron again and of dumbledor and of hogwart itself which he miss nearli as much as hi exgirlfriend inde as phinea niggellu talk about snape crackdown harri experienc a split second of mad when he imagin simpli go back to school to join the destabil of snape regim be fed and have a soft bad and other peopl be in charg seem the most wonder prospect in the world at thi moment but then he rememb that he wa undesir number one that there wa a tenthousand galleon price on hi head and that to walk into hogwart these day wa just as danger as walk into the ministri of magic inde phinea nigellu inadvert emphas thi fact my slip in lead question about harri and hermion whereabout hermion shove him back insid the bead bag everi time he did thi and phinea nigellu invari refus to reappear for sever day after these unceremoni goodby the weather grew colder and colder they did not dare remain in ani area too long so rather than stay in the south of england where a hard ground frost wa the worst of their worri they continu to meander up and down the countri brave a mountainsid where sleet pound the tent a wide flat marsh where the tent wa flood with chill water and a tini island in the middl of a scottish loch where snow half buri the tent in the night they had alreadi spot christma tree twinkl from sever sit room window befor there came an even when harri resolv to suggest again what seem to him the onli unexplor avenu left to them they had just eaten an unusu good meal hermion had been to a supermarket under the invis cloak scrupul drop the money into an open till as she left and harri thought that she might be more persuad than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti bolognes and tin pear he had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hour break from wear the horcrux which wa hang over the end of the bunk besid him hermion hmm she wa curl up in one of the sag armchair with the tale of beedl the bard he could not imagin how much more she could get out of the book which wa not after all veri long but evid she wa still deciph someth in it becaus spellman syllabari lay open on the arm of the chair harri clear hi throat he felt exactli as he had done on the occas sever year previous when he had ask professor mcgonagal whether he could go into hogsmead despit the fact that he had not persuad the dursley to sign hi permiss slip hermion ive been think and harri could you help me with someth appar she had not been listen to him she lean forward and held out the tale of beedl the bard look at that symbol she said point to the top of a page abov what harri assum wa the titl of the stori be unabl to read rune he could not be sure there wa a pictur of what look like a triangular eye it pupil cross with a vertic line i never took ancient rune hermion i know that but it isnt a rune and it not in the syllabari either all along i thought it wa a pictur of an eye but i dont think it is it been ink in look somebodi drawn it there it isnt realli part of the book think have you ever seen it befor no no wait a moment harri look closer isnt it the same symbol luna dad wa wear round hi neck well that what i thought too then it grindelwald mark she stare at him openmouth what krum told me he recount the stori that viktor krum had told him at the wed hermion look astonish grindelwald mark she look from harri to the weird symbol and back again ive never heard that grindelwald had a mark there no mention of it in anyth ive ever read about him well like i say krum reckon that symbol wa carv on a wall at durmstrang and grindelwald put it there she fell back into the old armchair frown that veri odd if it a symbol of dark magic what it do in a book of children stori yeah it is weird said harri and youd think scrimgeour would have recogn it he wa minist he ought to have been expert on dark stuff i know perhap he thought it wa an eye just like i did all the other stori have littl pictur over the titl she did not speak but continu to pore over the strang mark harri tri again hermion hmm ive been think i i want to go to godric hollow she look up at him but her eye were unfocus and he wa sure she wa still think about the mysteri mark on the book ye she said ye ive been wonder that too i realli think well have to did you hear me right he ask of cours i did you want to go to godric hollow i agre i think we should i mean i cant think of anywher els it could be either itll be danger but the more i think about it the more like it seem it there er what there ask harri at that she look just as bewild as he felt well the sword harri dumbledor must have known youd want to go back there and i mean godric hollow is godric gryffindor birthplac realli gryffindor came from godric hollow harri did you ever even open a histori of magic erm he said smile for what felt like the first time in month the muscl in hi face felt oddli stiff i mightv open it you know when i bought it just the onc well as the villag is name after him id have thought you might have made the connect said hermion she sound much more like her old self than she had done of late harri half expect her to announc that she wa off to the librari there a bit about the villag in a histori of magic wait she open the bead bag and rummag for a while final extract her copi of their old school textbook a histori of magic by bathilda bagshot which she thumb through until find the page she want upon the signatur of the intern statut of secreci in wizard went into hide for good it wa natur perhap that they form their own small commun within a commun mani small villag and hamlet attract sever magic famili who band togeth for mutual support and protect the villag of tinworsh in cornwal upper flagley in yorkshir and otteri st catchpol on the south coast of england were notabl home to knot of wizard famili who live alongsid toler and sometim confund muggl most celebr of these halfmag dwell place is perhap godric hollow the west countri villag where the great wizard godric gryffindor wa born and where bowman wright wizard smith forg the first golden snitch the graveyard is full of the name of ancient magic famili and thi account no doubt for the stori of haunt that have dog the littl church besid it for mani centuri you and your parent arent mention hermion said close the book becaus professor bagshot doesnt cover anyth later than the end of the nineteenth centuri but you see godric hollow godric gryffindor gryffindor sword dont you think dumbledor would have expect you to make the connect oh yeah harri did not want to admit that he had not been think about the sword at all when he suggest they go to godric hollow for him the lore of the villag lay in hi parent grave the hous where he had narrowli escap death and in the person of bathilda bagshot rememb what muriel said he ask eventu who you know he hesit he did not want to say ron name ginni greataunt at the wed the one who said you had skinni ankl oh said hermion it wa a sticki moment harri knew that she had sens ron name in the of he rush on she said bathilda bagshot still live in godric hollow bathilda bagshot murmur hermion run her index finger over bathilda emboss name on the front cover of a histori of magic well i suppos she gasp so dramat that harri insid turn over he drew hi wand look around at the entranc half expect to see a hand forc it way through the entranc flap but there wa noth there what he said half angri half reliev what did you do that for i thought youd seen a death eater unzip the tent at least harri what if bathilda got the sword what if dumbledor entrust it to her harri consid thi possibl bathilda would be an extrem old woman by now and accord to muriel she wa gaga wa it like that dumbledor would have hidden the sword of gryffindor with her if so harri felt that dumbledor had left a great deal to chanc dumbledor had never reveal that he had replac the sword with a fake nor had he so much as mention a friendship with bathilda now howev wa not the moment to cast doubt on hermion theori not when she wa so surprisingli will to fall in with harri dearest wish yeah he might have done so are we go to go to godric hollow ye but well have to think it through care harri she wa sit up now and harri could tell that the prospect of have a plan again had lift her mood as much as hi well need to practic disappar togeth under the invis cloak for a start and perhap disillusion charm would be sensibl too unless you think we should go the whole hog and use polyjuic potion in that case well need to collect hair from somebodi i actual think wed better do that harri the thicker our disguis the better harri let her talk nod and agre whenev there wa a paus but hi mind had left the convers for the first time sinc he had discov that the sword in gringott wa a fake he felt excit he wa about to go home about to return to the place where he had had a famili it wa in godric hollow that but for voldemort he would have grown up and spent everi school holiday he could have invit friend to hi hous he might even have had brother and sister it would have been hi mother who had made hi seventeenth birthday cake the life he had lost had hardli ever seem so real to him as at thi moment when he knew he wa about to see the place where it had been taken from him after hermion had gone to bed that night harri quietli extract hi rucksack from hermion bead bag and from insid it the photograph album hagrid had given him so long ago for the first time in month he perus the old pictur of hi parent smile and wave up at him from the imag which were all he had left of them now harri would gladli have set out for godric hollow the follow day but hermion had other idea convinc as she wa that voldemort would expect harri to return to the scene of hi parent death she wa determin that they would set off onli after they had ensur that they had the best disguis possibl it wa therefor a full week later onc they had surreptiti obtain hair from innoc muggl who were christma shop and had practic appar and disappar while underneath the invis cloak togeth that hermion agre to make the journey they were to appar to the villag under cover of dark so it wa late afternoon when they final swallow polyjuic potion harri transform into a bald middleag muggl man hermion into hi small and rather mousi wife the bead bag contain all of their possess apart from the horcrux which harri wa wear around hi neck wa tuck into an insid pocket of hermion buttonedup coat harri lower the invis cloak over them then they turn into the suffoc dark onc again heart beat in hi throat harri open hi eye they were stand hand in hand in a snowi lane under a dark blue sky in which the night first star were alreadi glimmer feebli cottag stood on either side of the narrow road christma decor twinkl in their window a short way ahead of them a glow of golden streetlight indic the center of the villag all thi snow hermion whisper beneath the cloak whi didnt we think of snow after all our precaut well leav print well just have to get rid of them you go in front ill do it harri did not want to enter the villag like a pantomim hors tri to keep themselv conceal while magic cover their trace let take off the cloak said harri and when she look frighten oh come on we dont look like us and there no one around he stow the cloak under hi jacket and they made their way forward unhamp the ici air sting their face as they pass more cottag ani one of them might have been the one in which jame and lili had onc live or where bathilda live now harri gaze at the front door their snowburden roof and their front porch wonder whether he rememb ani of them know deep insid that it wa imposs that he had been littl more than a year old when he had left thi place forev he wa not even sure whether he would be abl to see the cottag at all he did not know what happen when the subject of a fideliu charm die then the littl lane along which they were walk curv to the left and the heart of the villag a small squar wa reveal to them strung all around with color light there wa what look like a war memori in the middl partli obscur by a windblown christma tree there were sever shop a post offic a pub and a littl church whose stainedglass window were glow jewelbright across the squar the snow here had becom impact it wa hard and slipperi where peopl had trodden on it all day villag were crisscross in front of them their figur briefli illumin by streetlamp they heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door open and close then they heard a carol start up insid the littl church harri i think it christma eve said hermion is it he had lost track of the date they had not seen a newspap for week im sure it is said hermion her eye upon the church they theyll be in there wont they your mum and dad i can see the graveyard behind it harri felt a thrill of someth that wa beyond excit more like fear now that he wa so near he wonder whether he want to see after all perhap hermion knew how he wa feel becaus she reach for hi hand and took the lead for the first time pull him forward halfway across the squar howev she stop dead harri look she wa point at the war memori as they had pass it it had transform instead of an obelisk cover in name there wa a statu of three peopl a man with untidi hair and glass a woman with long hair and a kind pretti face and a babi boy sit in hi mother arm snow lay upon all their head like fluffi white cap harri drew closer gaze up into hi parent face he had never imagin that there would be a statu how strang it wa to see himself repres in stone a happi babi without a scar on hi forehead cmon said harri when he had look hi fill and they turn again toward the church as they cross the road he glanc over hi shoulder the statu had turn back into the war memori the sing grew louder as they approach the church it made harri throat constrict it remind him so forc of hogwart of peev bellow rude version of carol from insid suit of armor of the great hall twelv christma tree of dumbledor wear a bonnet he had won in a cracker of ron in a handknit sweater there wa a kiss gate at the entranc to the graveyard hermion push it open as quietli as possibl and they edg through it on either side of the slipperi path to the church door the snow lay deep and untouch they move off through the snow carv deep trench behind them as they walk around the build keep to the shadow beneath the brilliant window behind the church row upon row of snowi tombston protrud from a blanket of pale blue that wa fleck with dazzl red gold and green wherev the reflect from the stain glass hit the snow keep hi hand close tightli on the wand in hi jacket pocket harri move toward the nearest grave look at thi it an abbott could be some longlost relat of hannah keep your voic down hermion beg him they wade deeper and deeper into the graveyard goug dark track into the snow behind them stoop to peer at the word on old headston everi now and then squint into the surround dark to make absolut sure that they were unaccompani harri here hermion wa two row of tombston away he had to wade back to her hi heart posit bang in hi chest is it no but look she point to the dark stone harri stoop down and saw upon the frozen lichenspot granit the word kendra dumbledor and a short way down her date of birth and death and her daughter ariana there wa also a quotat where your treasur is there will your heart be also so rita skeeter and muriel had got some of their fact right the dumbledor famili had inde live here and part of it had die here see the grave wa wors than hear about it harri could not help think that he and dumbledor both had deep root in thi graveyard and that dumbledor ought to have told him so yet he had never thought to share the connect they could have visit the place togeth for a moment harri imagin come here with dumbledor of what a bond that would have been of how much it would have meant to him but it seem that to dumbledor the fact that their famili lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimport coincid irrelev perhap to the job he want harri to do hermion wa look at harri and he wa glad that hi face wa hidden in shadow he read the word on the tombston again where your treasur is there will your heart be also he did not understand what these word meant sure dumbledor had chosen them as the eldest member of the famili onc hi mother had die are you sure he never mention hermion began no said harri curtli then let keep look and he turn away wish he had not seen the stone he did not want hi excit trepid taint with resent here cri hermion again a few moment later from out of the dark oh no sorri i thought it said potter she wa rub at a crumbl mossi stone gaze down at it a littl frown on her face harri come back a moment he did not want to be sidetrack again and onli grudgingli made hi way back through the snow toward her what look at thi the grave wa extrem old weather so that harri could hardli make out the name hermion show him the symbol beneath it harri that the mark in the book he peer at the place she indic the stone wa so worn that it wa hard to make out what wa engrav there though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearli illeg name yeah it could be hermion lit her wand and point it at the name on the headston it say ig ignotu i think im go to keep look for my parent all right harri told her a slight edg to hi voic and he set off again leav her crouch besid the old grave everi now and then he recogn a surnam that like abbott he had met at hogwart sometim there were sever gener of the same wizard famili repres in the graveyard harri could tell from the date that it had either die out or the current member had move away from godric hollow deeper and deeper amongst the grave he went and everi time he reach a new headston he felt a littl lurch of apprehens and anticip the dark and the silenc seem to becom all of a sudden much deeper harri look around worri think of dementor then realiz that the carol had finish that the chatter and flurri of churchgoer were fade away as they made their way back into the squar somebodi insid the church had just turn off the light then hermion voic came out of the black for the third time sharp and clear from a few yard away harri theyr here right here and he knew by her tone that it wa hi mother and father thi time he move toward her feel as if someth heavi were press on hi chest the same sensat he had had right after dumbledor had die a grief that had actual weigh on hi heart and lung the headston wa onli two row behind kendra and ariana it wa made of white marbl just like dumbledor tomb and thi made it easi to read as it seem to shine in the dark harri did not need to kneel or even approach veri close to it to make out the word engrav upon it jame potter lili potter born march born januari die octob die octob the last enemi that shall be destroy is death harri read the word slowli as though he would have onli one chanc to take in their mean and he read the last of them aloud the last enemi that shall be defeat is death a horribl thought came to him and with a kind of panic isnt that a death eater idea whi is that there it doesnt mean defeat death in the way the death eater mean it harri said hermion her voic gentl it mean you know live beyond death live after death but they were not live thought harri they were gone the empti word could not disguis the fact that hi parent molder remain lay beneath snow and stone indiffer unknow and tear came befor he could stop them boil hot then instantli freez on hi face and what wa the point in wipe them off or pretend he let them fall hi lip press hard togeth look down at the thick snow hide from hi eye the place where the last of lili and jame lay bone now sure or dust not know or care that their live son stood so near hi heart still beat aliv becaus of their sacrific and close to wish at thi moment that he wa sleep under the snow with them hermion had taken hi hand again and wa grip it tightli he could not look at her but return the pressur now take deep sharp gulp of the night air tri to steadi himself tri to regain control he should have brought someth o give them and he had not thought of it and everi plant in the graveyard wa leafless and frozen but hermion rais her wand move it in a circl through the air and a wreath of christma rose blossom befor them harri caught it and laid it on hi parent grave as soon as he stood up he want to leav he did not think he could stand anoth moment there he put hi arm around hermion shoulder and she put her around hi waist and they turn in silenc and walk away through the snow past dumbledor mother and sister back toward the dark church and the outofsight kiss gate chapter seventeen bathilda secret harri stop what wrong they had onli just reach the grave of the unknown abbott there someon there someon watch us i can tell there over by the bush they stood quit still hold on to each other gaze at the dens black boundari of the graveyard harri could not see

back repeatedli as they made their way out of the graveyard harri who did not feel as sanguin as he had pretend when reassur hermion wa glad to reach the gate and the slipperi pavement they pull the invis cloak back over themselv the pub wa fuller than befor mani voic insid it were now sing the carol that they had heard as they approach the church for a moment harri consid suggest they take refug insid it but befor he could say anyth hermion murmur let go thi way and pull him down the dark street lead out of the villag in the opposit direct from which they had enter harri could make out the point where the cottag end and the lane turn into open countri again they walk as quickli as they dare past more window sparkl with multicolor light the outlin of christma tree dark through the curtain how are we go to find bathilda hous ask hermion who wa shiver a littl and kept glanc back over her shoulder harri what do you think harri she tug at thi arm but harri wa not pay attent he wa

durmstrang but i do not complain becaus if you had not been expel we would never have met albu astonish and appal though hi mani admir will be thi letter constitut the statut of secreci and establish wizard rule over muggl what a blow for those who have alway portray dumbledor as the muggleborn greatest champion how hollow those speech promot muggl right seem in the light of thi damn new evid how despic doe albu dumbledor appear busi plot hi rise to power when he should have been mourn hi mother and care for hi sister no doubt those determin to keep dumbledor on hi crumbl pedest will bleat that he did not after all put hi plan into action that he must have suffer a chang of heart that he came to hi sens howev the truth seem altogeth more shock bare two month into their great new friendship dumbledor and grindelwald part never to see each other again until they met for their legendari duel for more see chapter what caus thi abrupt ruptur had dumbledor come to hi sens had he told grindelwald he want no more part in hi plan ala no it wa poor littl ariana die i think that did it say bathilda it came as an aw shock gellert wa there in the hous when it happen and he came back to my hous all of a dither told me he want to go home the next day terribl distress you know so i arrang a portkey and that wa the last i saw of him albu wa besid himself at ariana death it wa so dread for those two brother they had lost everybodi except for each other no wonder temper ran a littl high aberforth blame albu you know as peopl will under these dread circumst but aberforth alway

have stay for the funer he would have been a comfort to albu at least thi dread coffinsid brawl known onli to those few who attend ariana dumbledor funer rais sever question whi exactli did aberforth dumbledor blame albu for hi sister death wa it as batti pretend a mere effus of grief or could there have been some more concret reason for hi furi grindelwald expel from durmstrang for the nearfat attack upon fellow student fled the countri hour after the girl death and albu out of shame or fear never saw him again not until forc to do so by the plea of the wizard world neither dumbledor nor grindelwald ever seem to have refer to thi brief boyhood friendship in later life howev there can be no doubt that dumbledor delay for some five year of turmoil fatal and disappear hi attack upon gellert grindelwald wa it linger affect for the man or fear of exposur as hi onc best friend that caus dumbledor to hesit wa it onli reluctantli that dumbledor set out to captur the man he wa onc so delight he had met and how did the mysteri ariana die wa she the inadvert victim of some dark rite did she stumbl across someth she ought not to have done as the two young men sat practic for their

she tug the book out of harri hand look a littl alarm by hi express and close it without look at it as though hide someth indec harri but he shook hi head some inner certainti had crash down insid him it wa exactli as he had felt after ron left he had trust dumbledor believ him the embodi of good and wisdom all wa ash how much more could he lose ron dumbledor the phoenix wand harri she seem to have heard hi thought listen to me it it doesnt make a veri nice read yeah you could say that but dont forget harri thi is rita skeeter write you did read that letter to grindelwald didnt you ye i i did she hesit look upset cradl her tea in her cold hand i think that the worst bit i know bathilda thought it wa all just talk but for the greater good becam grindelwald slogan hi justif for all the atroc he commit later and from that it look like dumbledor gave him the idea they say for the greater good wa even carv over the entranc to nurmengard what nurmengard the prison grindelwald had built to hold hi oppon he end up in there himself onc dumbledor had caught him anyway it it an aw thought that dumbledor idea help grindelwald rise to power but on the other hand even rita cant pretend that they knew each other for more than a few month one summer when they were both realli young and i thought youd say that said harri he did not want to let hi anger spill out at her but it wa hard to keep hi voic steadi i thought youd say they were young they were the same age as we are now and here we are risk our live to fight the dark art and there he wa in a huddl with hi new best friend plot their rise to power over the muggl hi temper would not remain in check much longer he stood up and walk around tri to work some of it off im not tri to defend what dumbledor wrote said hermion all

simpl as that mayb he did believ these thing when he wa seventeen but the whole of the rest of hi life wa devot to fight the dark art dumbledor wa the one who stop grindelwald the one who alway vote for muggl protect and muggl born right who fought youknowwho from the start and who die tri to bring him down rita book lay on the ground between them so that the face of albu dumbledor smile dole at both harri im sorri but i think the real reason your so angri is that dumbledor never told you ani of thi himself mayb i am harri bellow and he flung hi arm over hi head hardli know whether he wa tri

behind an oak it wa a silver white doe moonbright and dazzl pick her way over the ground still silent and leav no hoofprint in the fine powder of snow she step toward him her beauti head with it wide longlash eye held high harri stare at the creatur fill with wonder not at her strang but her inexplic familiar he felt that he had been wait for her to come but that he had forgotten until thi moment that they had arrang to meet hi impuls to shout for hermion which had been so strong a moment ago had gone he knew he would have stake hi life on it that she had come for him and him alon they gaze at

crunch beneath hi feet but the doe made no nois as she pass through the tree for she wa noth but light deeper and deeper into the forest she led him and harri walk quickli sure that when she stop she would allow him to approach her properli and then she would speak and the voic would tell him what he need to know at last she came to a halt she turn her beauti head toward him onc more and he broke into a run a question burn in him but as he open hi lip to ask it she vanish though the dark had swallow her whole her burnish imag wa still imprint on hi retina it obscur hi vision brighten when he lower hi eyelid disori him now fear came her presenc had meant safeti lumo he whisper and the wandtip ignit the imprint of the doe fade away with everi blink of hi eye as he stood there listen to the sound of the forest to distant crackl of twig soft swish of snow wa he about to be attack had she entic him into an ambush wa he imagin that somebodi stood beyond the reach of the wandlight watch him he held the wand higher nobodi ran out at him no flash of green light burst from behind a tree whi then had she led him to thi spot someth gleam in the light of the wand and harri spun about but all that wa there wa a small frozen pool it black crack surfac glitter as he rais hi wand higher to examin it he move forward rather cautious and look down the ice reflect hi distort shadow and the beam of wandlight but deep below the thick misti gray carapac someth els glint a great silver cross hi heart skip into hi mouth he drop to hi knee at the pool edg and angl the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possibl a glint of deep redit wa a sword with glitter rubi in it hiltth sword of gryffindor wa lie at the bottom of the forest pool bare breath he stare down at it how wa thi possibl how could it have come to be lie in a forest pool thi close to the place where they were camp had some unknown magic drawn hermion to thi spot or wa the doe which he had taken to be a patronu some kind of guardian of the pool or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arriv precis becaus they were here in which case where wa the person who want to pass it to harri again he direct the wand at the surround tree and bush search for a human outlin for the glint of an eye but he could not see anyon there all the same a littl more fear leaven hi exhilar as he return hi attent to the sword repos upon the bottom of the frozen pool he point the wand at the silveri shape and murmur accio sword it did not stir he had not expect it to if it had been that easi the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up not in the depth of a frozen pool he set off around the circl of ice think hard about the last time the sword had deliv itself to him he had been in terribl danger then and had ask for help help he murmur but the sword remain upon the pool bottom indiffer motionless what wa it harri ask himself walk again that dumbledor had told him the

he said the deathli hallow but there no mention of the word deathli hallow in the stori said hermion well of cours not said xenophiliu maddeningli smug that is a children tale told to amus rather than to instruct those of us who understand these matter howev recogn that the ancient stori refer to three object or hallow which if unit will make the possessor master of death there wa a short silenc in which xenophiliu glanc out of the window alreadi the sun wa low in the sky luna ought to have enough plimpi soon he said quietli when you say master of death said ron master said xenophiliu wave an airi hand conqueror vanquish whichev term you prefer but then do you mean said hermion slowli and harri could tell that she wa tri to keep ani trace of skeptic out of her voic that you believ these object these hallow realli exist xenophiliu rais hi eyebrow again well of cours but said hermion and harri could hear her restraint start to crack mr lovegood how can you possibl believ luna ha told

hermion could retort you think that exist too oh well in that case there is endless evid said xenophiliu the elder wand is the hallow that is most easili trace becaus of the way in which it pass from hand to hand which is what ask harri which is that the possessor of the wand must captur it from it previou owner if he is to be truli master of it said xenophiliu sure you have heard of the way the wand came to egbert the egregi after hi slaughter of emer the evil of how godelot die in hi own cellar after hi son hereward took the wand from him of the dread loxia who took the wand from baraaba deveril whom he had kill the bloodi trail of the elder wand is splatter across the page of wizard histori harri glanc at hermion she wa frown at xenophiliu but she did not contradict him so where do

her feet look exasper and angri harri your tri to fit everyth into the hallow stori fit everyth in he repeat hermion it fit of it own accord i know the sign of the deathli hallow wa on that stone gaunt said he wa descend from the peverel a minut ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properli where you reckon the ring is now ron ask harri what did dumbledor do with it after he broke it open but harri imagin wa race ahead far beyond ron and hermion three object or hallow which if unit will make the possessor master of deathmasterconquerorvanquisherth last enemi that shall be destroy is death and he saw himself possessor of the hallow face voldemort whose horcrux were no matchneith can live while the other surviveswa thi the answer hallow versu horcrux wa there a way after all to ensur that he wa the one who triumph if he were the master of the deathli hallow would he be safe harri but he scarc heard hermion he had pull out hi invis cloak and wa run it through hi finger the cloth suppl as water light as air he had never seen anyth to equal it in hi nearli seven year in the wizard world the cloak wa exactli what xenophiliu had describ a cloak that realli and truli render the wearer complet invis and endur etern give constant and impenetr conceal no matter what spell are cast at it and then with a gasp he rememb dumbledor had my cloak the night my parent die hi voic shook and he could feel the color in hi face but he did not care my mum told siriu that dumbledor borrow the cloak thi is whi he want to examin it becaus he thought it wa the third hallow ignotu

busi undo the pouch around hi neck hi finger shake hard read it he told her push hi mother letter into her hand read it dumbledor had the cloak hermion whi els would he want it he didnt need a cloak he could perform a disillusion charm so power that he made himself complet invis without one someth fell to the floor and roll glitter under a chair he had dislodg the snitch when he pull out the letter he stoop to pick it up and then the newli tap spring of fabul discoveri threw him anoth gift and shock and wonder erupt insid him so that he shout out it in here he left me the ring it in the snitch you you reckon he could not understand whi ron look taken aback it wa so obviou so clear to harri everyth fit everythinghi cloak wa the third hallow and when he discov how to open the snitch he would have the second and then all he need to do wa find the first hallow the elder wand and then but it wa as though a curtain fell on a lit stage all hi excit all hi hope and happi were extinguish at a stroke and he stood alon in the dark and the gloriou spell wa broken that what he after the chang in hi voic made ron and hermion look even more scare youknowwho after the elder wand he turn hi back on their strain incredul face he knew it wa the truth it all made sens voldemort wa not seek a new wand he wa seek an old wand a veri old wand inde harri walk to the entranc of the tent forget

sought them done anyth to possess them three object that made the possessor master of death if he had known about the deathli hallow he might not have need horcrux in the first place didnt the simpl fact that he had taken a hallow and turn it into a horcrux demonstr that he did not know thi last great wizard secret which meant that voldemort sought the elder wand without realiz it full power without understand that it wa one of threefor the wand wa the hallow that could not be hidden whose exist wa best knownth bloodi trail of the elder wand is splatter across the page of wizard histori harri watch the cloudi sky curv of smokegray and silver slide over the face of the white moon he felt lighthead with amaz at hi discoveri he turn back into the tent it wa a shock to see ron and

but i onli said that to tri and persuad you to come to the lovegood cri hermion in exasper i didnt realli believ it harri took no notic dumbledor usual let me find out stuff for myself he let me tri my strength take risk thi feel like the kind of thing hed do harri thi isnt a game thi isnt practic thi is the real thing and dumbledor left you veri clear instruct find and destroy the horcrux that symbol doesnt mean anyth forget the deathli hallow we cant afford to get sidetrack harri wa bare listen to her he wa turn the snitch over and over in hi hand half expect it to break open to reveal the

what wa the close whi couldnt he have the stone now if onli he had the stone he could ask dumbledor these question in personand harri murmur word to the snitch in the dark tri everyth even parseltongu but the golden ball would not open and the wand the elder wand where wa that hidden where wa voldemort search now harri wish hi scar would burn and show him voldemort thought becaus for the first time ever he and voldemort were unit in want the veri same thinghermion would not like that idea of coursebut then she did not believexenophiliu had been right in a waylimit narrow closemind the truth wa that she wa scare of the idea of the deathli hallow especi of the resurrect stoneand harri press hi mouth again to the snitch kiss it nearli swallow it but the cold medal did not yield it wa nearli dawn when he rememb luna alon in a cell in azkaban surround by dementor and he suddenli felt asham of himself he had forgotten all about her in hi feverish contempl of the hallow if onli they could rescu her but dementor in those number would be virtual unassail now he came to think about it he had not tri cast a patronu with the blackthorn wandh must tri that in the morn if onli there wa a way of get a better wand and desir for the elder wand the deathstick unbeat invinc swallow him onc more they pack up the tent next morn and move on through a dreari shower of rain the downpour pursu them

though a flame had been lit insid him that noth not hermion flat disbelief nor ron persist doubt could extinguish and yet the fiercer the long for the hallow burn insid him the less joy it made him he blame ron and hermion their determin indiffer wa as bad as the relentless rain for dampen hi spirit but neither could erod hi certainti which remain absolut harri belief in and long for the hallow consum him so much that he felt isol from the other two and their obsess with the horcrux obsess said hermion in a low fierc voic when harri wa careless enough to use the word one even after hermion had told him off for hi lack of interest in locat more horcrux were not the one with an obsess harri were the one tri to do what dumbledor want us to do but he wa impervi to the veil critic dumbledor

he knew he wa certain that there wa hardli ani time left in which to beat voldemort to hi goal or els to attempt to thwart him he felt a flutter of panic yet he had made hi decis when he chose to speak to griphook first feign a calm he did not feel he grope in the pouch around hi neck and took out the two halv of hi broken wand mr ollivand i need some help anyth anyth said the wandmak weakli can you mend thi is it possibl ollivand held out a trembl hand and harri place the two bare connect halv in hi palm holli and phoenix feather said ollivand in a tremul voic eleven inch nice and suppl ye said harri can you no whisper ollivand i am sorri veri sorri but a wand that ha suffer thi degre of damag can not be repair by ani mean that i know of harri had been brace to hear it but it wa a blow nevertheless he took the wand halv back and replac them in the pouch around hi neck ollivand stare at the place where the shatter wand had vanish and did not look away until harri had taken from hi pocket the two wand he had brought from the malfoy can you identifi these harri ask the wandmak took the first of the wand and held it close to hi fade eye roll it between hi knobbleknuckl finger flex it slightli walnut and dragon heartstr he said twelveandthreequart inch unyield thi wand belong to bellatrix lestrang and thi one ollivand perform the same examin hawthorn and unicorn hair ten inch precis reason springi thi wa the wand of draco malfoy wa repeat harri isnt it still hi perhap not if you took it i did then it may be your of cours the manner of take matter much also depend upon the wand itself in gener howev where a wand ha been won it allegi will chang there wa a silenc in the room except for the distant rush of the sea you talk about wand like theyv got feel said harri like they can think for themselv the wand choos the wizard said ollivand that much ha alway been clear to those of us who have studi wandlor a person can still use a wand that hasnt chosen them though ask harri oh ye if you are ani wizard at all you will be abl to channel your magic through almost ani instrument the best result howev must alway come where there is the strongest affin between wizard and wand these connect are complex an initi attract and then a mutual quest for experi the wand learn from the wizard the wizard from the wand the sea gush forward and backward it wa a mourn sound i took thi wand from draco malfoy by forc said harri can i use it safe i think so subtl law govern wand ownership but the conquer wand will usual bend it will to it new master so i should use thi one said ron pull wormtail wand out of hi pocket and hand it to ollivand chestnut and dragon heartstr nineandaquart inch brittl i wa forc to make thi shortli after my kidnap for peter pettigrew ye if you won it it is more like to do your bid and do it well than anoth wand and thi hold true for all wand doe it ask harri i think so repli ollivand hi protuber eye upon harri face you ask deep question mr potter wandlor is a complex and mysteri branch of magic so it isnt necessari to kill the previou owner to take the possess of a wand ask harri ollivand swallow necessari no i should not say that it is necessari to kill there are legend though said harri and as hi heart rate quicken the pain in hi scar becam more intens he wa sure that voldemort ha decid to put hi idea into action legend about a wand or wand that have been pass from hand to hand by murder ollivand turn pale against the snowi pillow he wa light gray and hi eye were enorm bloodshot and bulg with what look like fear onli one wand i think he whisper and youknowwho is interest in it isnt he ask harri i how croak ollivand and he look appealingli at ron and hermion for help how do you know thi he want you to tell him how to overcom the connect between our wand said harri ollivand look terrifi he tortur me you must understand that the cruciatu curs i i had no choic but to tell him what i knew what i guess i understand said harri you told him about the twin core you said he just had to borrow anoth wizard wand ollivand look horrifi transfix by the amount that harri knew he nod slowli but it didnt work harri went on mine still beat the borrow wand do you know whi that is ollivand shook hi head slowli as he had just nod i had never heard of such a thing your wand perform someth uniqu that night the connect of the twin core is incred rare yet whi your wand would have snap the borrow wand i do not know we were talk about the other wand the wand that chang hand by murder when youknowwho realiz my wand had done someth strang he came back and ask about that other wand didnt he how do you know thi harri did not answer ye he ask whisper ollivand he want to know everyth i could tell him about the wand various known as the deathstick the wand of destini or the elder wand harri glanc sideway at hermion she look flaggergast the dark lord said ollivand in hush and frighten tone had alway been happi with the wand i made him ye and phoenix feather thirteenandahalf inch until he discov the connect of the twin core now he seek anoth more power wand as the onli way to conquer your but hell know soon if he doesnt alreadi that mine broken beyond repair said harri quietli no said hermion sound frighten he cant know that harri how could he priori incantatem said harri we left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the malfoy hermion if they examin them properli make them recreat the spell theyv cast late theyd see that your broke mine theyll see that you tri and fail to mend it and theyll realiz that ive been use the blackthorn one ever sinc the littl color she had regain sinc their arriv had drain from her face ron gave harri a reproach look and said let not worri about that now but mr ollivand interven the dark lord no longer seek the elder wand onli for your destruct mr potter he is determin to possess it becaus he believ it will make him truli invulner and will it the owner of the elder wand must alway fear attack said ollivand but the idea of the dark lord in possess of the deathstick is i must admit formid harri wa suddenli remind of how unsur when they first met of how much he like ollivand even now have been tortur and imprison by voldemort the idea of the dark wizard in possess of thi wand seem to enthral him as much as it repuls him you you realli think thi wand exist then mr ollivand ask hermion oh ye said ollivand ye it is perfectli possibl to trace the wand cours through histori there are gap of cours and long one where it vanish from view temporarili lost or hidden but alway it resurfac it ha certain identifi characterist that those who are learn in wandlor recogn there are written account some of them obscur that i and other wandmak have made it our busi to studi they have the ring of authent so you you dont think it can be a fairi tale or a myth hermion ask hope no said ollivand whether it need to pass by murder i do not know it histori is bloodi but that may be simpli due to the fact that it is such a desir object and arous such passion in wizard immens power danger in the wrong hand and an object of incred fascin to all of us who studi the power of wand mr ollivand said harri you told youknowwho that gregorovitch had the elder wand didnt you ollivand turn if possibl even paler he look ghostli as he gulp but how how do you never mind how i know it said harri close hi eye momentarili as hi scar burn and he saw for mere second a vision of the main street in hogsmead still dark becaus it wa so much farther north you told youknowwho that gregorovitch had the wand it wa a rumor whisper ollivand a rumor year and year ago long befor you were born i believ gregorovitch himself start it you can see how good it would be for busi that he wa studi and duplic the qualiti of the elder wand ye i can see that said harri he stood up mr ollivand one last thing and then well let you get some rest what do you know about the deathli hallow the the what ask the wandmak look utterli bewild the deathli hallow im afraid i dont know what your talk about is thi still someth to do with wand harri look into the sunken face and believ that ollivand wa not act he did not know about the hallow thank you said harri thank you veri much well leav you to get some rest now ollivand look stricken he wa tortur me he gasp the cruciatu curs you have no idea i do said harri i realli do pleas get some rest thank you for tell me all of thi he led ron and hermion down the staircas harri caught glimps of bill fleur luna and dean sit at the tabl in the kitchen cup of tea in front of them they all look up at harri as he appear in the doorway but he mere nod to them and continu into the garden ron and hermion behind him the reddish mound of earth that cover dobbi lay ahead and harri walk back to it as the pain in hi head built more and more power it wa a huge effort now to close down the vision that were forc themselv upon him but he knew that he would have to resist onli a littl longer he would yield veri soon becaus he need to know that hi theori wa right he must make onli one more short effort so that he could explain to ron and hermion gregorovitch had the elder wand a long time ago he said i saw youknowwho tri to find him when he track him down he found that gregorovitch didnt have it anymor it wa stolen from him by grindelwald how grindelwald found out that gregorovitch had it i dont know but if gregorovitch wa stupid enough to spread the rumor it cant have been that difficult voldemort wa at the gate of hogwart harri could see him stand there and see too the lamp bob in the predawn come closer and closer and grindelwald use the elder wand to becom power and at the height of hi power when dumbledor knew he wa the onli one who could stop him he duel grindelwald and beat him and he took the elder wand dumbledor had the elder wand said ron but then where is it now at hogwart said harri fight to remain with them in the clifftop garden but then let go said ron urgent harri let go and get it befor he doe it too late for that said harri he could not help himself but clutch hi head tri to help it resist he know where it is he there now harri ron said furious how long have you known thi whi have we been wast time whi did you talk to griphook first we could have gone we could still go no said harri and he sank to hi knee in the grass hermion right dumbledor didnt want me to have it he didnt want me to take it he want me to get the horcrux the unbeat wand harri moan ron im not suppos to im suppos to get the horcrux and now everyth wa cool and dark the sun wa bare visibl over the horizon as he glide alongsid snape up through the ground toward the lake i shall join you in the castl shortli he said in hi high cold voic leav me now snape bow and set off back up the path hi black cloak billow behind him harri walk slowli wait for snape figur to disappear it would not do for snape or inde anyon els to see where he wa go but there were no light in the castl window and he could conceal himself and in a second he had cast upon himself a disillusion charm that hid him even from hi own eye and he walk on around the edg of the lake take in the outlin of the belov castl hi first kingdom hi birthright and here it wa besid the lake reflect in the dark water the white marbl tomb an unnecessari blot on the familiar landscap he felt again that rush of control euphoria that headi sens of purpos in destruct he rais the old yew wand how fit that thi would be it last great act the tomb split open from head to foot the shroud figur wa as long as thin as it had been in life he rais the wand again the wrap fell open the face wa transluc pale sunken yet almost perfectli preserv they had left hi spectacl on the crook nose he felt amus deris dumbledor hand were fold upon hi chest and there it lay clutch beneath them buri with him had the old fool imagin that marbl or death would protect the wand had he thought that the dark lord would be scare to violat hi tomb the spiderlik hand swoop and pull the wand from dumbledor grasp and as he took it a shower of spark flew from it tip sparkl over the corps of it last owner readi to serv a new master at last chapter twentyf shell cottag bill and fleur cottag stood alon on a cliff overlook the sea it wall embed with shell and whitewash it wa a lone and beauti place wherev harri went insid the tini cottag or it garden he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea like the breath of some great slumber creatur he spent much of the next few day make excus to escap the crowd cottag crave the clifftop view of open sky and wide empti sea and the feel of cold salti wind on hi face the enorm of hi decis not to race voldemort to the wand still scare harri he could not rememb ever befor choos not to act he wa full of doubt doubt that ron could not help voic whenev they were togeth what if dumbledor want us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand what if work out what the symbol meant made you worthi to get the hallow harri if that realli is the elder wand how the hell are we suppos to finish off youknowwho harri had no answer there were moment when he wonder whether it had been outright mad not to tri to prevent voldemort break open the tomb he could not even explain satisfactorili whi he had decid against it everi time he tri to reconstruct the intern argument that had led to hi decis they sound feebler to him the odd thing wa that hermion support made him feel just as confus as ron doubt now forc to accept that the elder wand wa real she maintain that it wa an evil object and that the way voldemort had taken possess of it wa repel not to be consid you could never have done that harri she said again and again you couldnt have broken into dumbledor grave but the idea of dumbledor corps frighten harri much less than the possibl that he might have misunderstood the live dumbledor intent he felt that he wa still grope in the dark he had chosen hi path but kept look back wonder whether he had misread the sign whether he should not have taken the other way from time to time anger at dumbledor crash over him again power as the wave slam themselv against the cliff beneath the cottag anger that dumbledor had not explain befor he die but is he dead said ron three day after they had arriv at the cottag harri had been stare out over the wall that separ the cottag garden from the cliff when ron and hermion had found him he wish they had not have no wish to join in with their argument ye he is ron pleas dont start that again look at the fact hermion said ron speak across harri who continu to gaze at the horizon the solv doe the sword the eye harri saw in the mirror harri admit he could have imagin the eye dont you harri i could have said harri without look at her but you dont thing you did do you ask ron no i dont said harri there you go said ron quickli befor hermion could carri on if it wasnt dumbledor explain how dobbi knew we were in the cellar hermion i cant but can you explain how dumbledor sent him to us if he lie in a tomb at hogwart i dunno it couldv been hi ghost dumbledor wouldnt come back as a ghost said harri there wa littl about dumbledor he wa sure of now but he knew that much he would have gone on what dyou mean gone on ask ron but befor harri could say ani more a

again harri wa sure that the goblin would accept noth but the sword even if they had someth as valuabl to offer him yet the sword wa their one indispens weapon against the horcrux he close hi eye for a moment or two and listen to the rush of the sea the idea that gryffindor might have stolen the sword wa unpleas to him he had alway been proud to be a gryffindor gryffindor had been the champion of muggleborn the wizard who had clash with the purebloodlov slytherin mayb he lie harri said open hi eye again griphook mayb gryffindor didnt take the sword how do we know the goblin version of histori

said so we begin it wa like plan to break into the ministri all over again they settl to work in the smallest bedroom which wa kept accord to griphook prefer in semidark i have visit the lestrang vault onli onc griphook told them on the occas i wa told to place insid it the fals sword it is one of the most ancient chamber the oldest wizard famili store their treasur at the deepest level where the vault are largest and best protect they remain shut in the cupboardlik room for hour at a time slowli the day stretch into week there wa problem after problem to overcom not least of which wa that their store of polyjuic potion wa greatli deplet there realli onli enough left for one of us said hermion tilt the thick mudlik potion against the lamplight thatll be enough said harri who wa examin griphook handdrawn map of the deepest passageway the other inhabit of shell cottag could hardli fail to notic that someth wa go on now that harri ron and hermion onli emerg for mealtim nobodi ask question although harri often felt bill eye on the three of them at the tabl thought concern the longer they spent togeth the more harri realiz that he did not much like the goblin griphook wa unexpectedli bloodthirsti laugh at the idea of pain in lesser creatur and seem to relish the possibl that they might have to hurt other wizard to reach the lestrang vault harri could tell that hi distast wa share by the other two but they did not discuss it they need griphook the goblin ate onli grudgingli with the rest of them even after hi leg had mend he continu to request tray of food in hi room like the stillfrail ollivand until bill follow an angri outburst from fleur went upstair to tell him that the arrang could not continu thereaft griphook join them at the overcrowd tabl although he refus to eat the same food insist instead on lump of raw meat root and variou fungi harri felt respons it wa after all he who had insist that the goblin remain at shell cottag so that he could question him hi fault that the whole weasley famili had been driven into hide that bill fred georg and mr weasley could no longer work im sorri he told fleur one blusteri april even as he help

tell you that said harri sorri bill the kitchen door open behind them fleur wa tri to bring through more empti goblet wait bill told her just a moment she back out and he close the door again then i have to say thi bill went on if you have struck ani kind of bargain with griphook and most particularli if that bargain involv treasur you must be except care goblin notion of ownership payment and repay are not the same as human one harri felt a slight squirm of discomfort as though a small snake had stir insid him what do you mean he ask we are talk about a differ breed of be said bill deal between wizard and goblin have been fraught for centuri but youll know all that from histori of magic there ha been fault on both side i would never claim that wizard have been innoc howev there is a belief among some goblin and those at gringott are perhap most prone to it that wizard can not be trust in matter of gold and treasur that they have no respect for goblin ownership i respect harri began but bill shook hi head you dont understand harri nobodi could understand unless they have live with goblin to a goblin the right and true master of ani object is the maker not the purchas all goblin made object are in goblin eye right their but it wa bought then they would consid it rent by the one who had paid the money they have howev great difficulti with the idea of goblinmad object pass from wizard to wizard you saw griphook face when the tiara pass under hi eye he disapprov i believ he think as do the fiercest of hi kind that it ought to have been return to the goblin onc the origin purchas die they consid our habit of keep goblinmad object pass them from wizard to wizard without further payment littl more than theft harri had an omin feel now he wonder whether bill guess more than he wa let on all i am say said bill set hi hand on the door back into the sit room is to be veri care what you promis goblin harri it would be less danger to break into gringott than to reneg on a promis to a goblin right said harri as bill open the door yeah thank ill bear that in mind as he follow bill back to the other a wri thought came to him born no doubt of the wine he had drunk he seem set on to becom just as reckless a godfath to teddi lupin as siriu black had been to him chapter twentysix gringott their plan were made their prepar complet in the smallest bedroom a singl long coars black hair pluck from the sweater hermion had been wear at malfoy manor lay curl in a small glass phial on the mantelpiec and youll be use her actual wand said harri nod toward the walnut wand so i reckon youll be pretti convinc hermion look frighten that the wand might sting or bit her as she pick it up i hate that thing she said in a low voic i realli hate it it feel all wrong it doesnt work properli for me it like a bit of her harri could not help but rememb how hermion ha dismiss hi loath of the blackthorn wand insist that he wa imagin thing when it did not work as well as hi own tell him to simpli practic he chose not to repeat her own advic back to her howev the eve of their attempt assault on gringott felt like the wrong moment to antagon her itll probabl help you get in charact though said ron think what that wand done but that my point said hermion thi is the wand that tortur nevil mum and dad and who know how mani other peopl thi is the wand that kill siriu harri had not thought of that he look down at the wand and wa visit by a brutal urg to snap it to slice it in half with gryffindor sword which wa prop against the wall besid him i miss my wand hermion said miser i wish mr ollivand could have made me anoth one too mr ollivand had sent luna a new wand that morn she wa out on the back lawn at that moment test it capabl in the late afternoon sun dean who had lost hi wand to the snatcher wa watch rather gloomili harri look down at the hawthorn wand that had onc belong to draco malfoy he had been surpris but pleas to discov that it work for him at least as well as hermion had done rememb what ollivand had told them of the secret work of wand harri thought he knew what hermion problem wa she had not won the walnut wand allegi by take it person from bellatrix the door of the bedroom open and griphook enter harri reach instinct for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him but regret hi action at onc he could tell that the goblin had notic seek to gloss over the sticki moment he said weve just been check the lastminut stuff griphook weve told bill and fleur were leav tomorrow and weve told them not to get up to see us off they had been firm on thi point becaus hermion would need to transform in bellatrix befor they left and the less that bill and fleur knew or suspect about what they were about to do the better they had also explain that they would not be return as they had lost perkin old tent on the night that the snatcher caught them bill had lent them anoth one it wa now pack insid the bead bag which harri wa impress to learn hermion had protect from the snatcher by the simpl expedi of stuf it down her sock though he would miss bill fleur luna and dean not to mention the home comfort they had enjoy over the last

griphook how are we go to get out again ron ask as they hurri on foot into the dark after the goblin bogrod pant in their wake like an old dog let worri about that when we have to said harri he wa tri to listen he thought he could hear someth clank and move around nearbi griphook how much farther not far harri potter not far and they turn a corner and saw the thing for which harri had been prepar but which still brought all of them to a halt a gigant dragon wa tether to the ground in front of them bar access to four or five of the deepest vault in the place the beast scale had turn pale and flaki dure it long incarcer under the ground it eye were milkili pink both rear leg bore heavi cuff from which chain led to enorm peg driven deep into the rocki floor it great spike wing fold close to it bodi would have fill the chamber if it spread them and when it turn it ugli head toward them it roar with a nois that made the rock trembl open it mouth and spat a jet of fire that sent them run back up the passageway it is partial blind pant griphook but even more savag for that howev we have the mean to control it it ha learn what to expect when the clanker come give them to me ron pass the

seem to feel him he stretch out an arm hermion hoist herself up ron climb on behind them and a second later the dragon becam awar that it wa unteth with a roar it rear harri dug in hi knee clutch as tightli as he could to the jag scale as the wing open knock the shriek goblin asid like skittl and it soar into the air harri ron and hermion flat on it back scrape against the ceil as it dive toward the passag open while the pursu goblin hurl dagger that glanc off it flank well never get out it too big hermion scream but the dragon open it mouth and belch flame again blast the tunnel whose floor and ceil crack and crumbl by sheer forc the dragon claw and fought it way through harri eye were shut tight against the heat and dust deafen by the crash of rock and the dragon roar he could onli cling to it back expect to be shaken off at ani moment then he heard hermion yell defodio she wa help the dragon enlarg the passageway carv out the ceil as it struggl upward toward the fresher air away from the shriek and clank goblin harri and ron copi her blast the ceil apart with more goug spell they pass the underground lake and the great crawl snarl beast seem to sens freedom and space ahead of it and behind them the passag wa full of the dragon thrash spike tail of great lump of rock gigant fractur stalactit and the clank of the goblin seem to be grow more muffl while ahead the dragon fire kept their progress clear and then at last by the combin forc of their spell and the dragon brute strength they had blast their way out of the passag into the marbl hallway goblin and

hermion still cling to it back it forc it way through the metal door leav them buckl and hang from their hing as it stagger into diagon alley and launch itself into the sky chapter twentyseven the final hide place there wa no mean of steer the dragon could not see where it wa go and harri knew that if it turn sharpli or roll in midair they would find it imposs to cling onto it broad back nevertheless as they climb higher and higher london unfurl below them like a grayandgreen map harri overwhelm feel wa of gratitud for an escap that had seem imposs crouch low over the beast neck he clung tight to the metal scale and the cool breez wa sooth on hi burn and blister skin the dragon wing beat the air like the sail of a windmil behind him whether from delight or fear he could not tell ron kept swear at the top of hi voic and hermion seem to be sob after five minut or so harri lost some of hi immedi dread that the dragon wa go to throw them off for it seem intent on noth but get as far away from it underground prison as possibl but the question of how and when they were to dismount remain rather frighten he had no idea how long dragon could fli without land nor how thi particular dragon which could bare see would locat a good place to put down he glanc around constantli imagin that he could feel hi seat prickl how long would it be befor voldemort knew that they had broken into the lestrang vault how soon would the goblin of gringott notifi bellatrix how quickli would they realiz what had been taken and then when they discov that the golden cup wa miss voldemort would know at last that they were hunt horcrux the dragon seem to crave cooler and fresher air it climb steadili until they were fli through wisp of chilli cloud and harri could no longer make out the littl color dot which were car pour in and out of the capit on and on they flew over countrysid parcel out in patch of green and brown over road and river wind through the landscap like strip of matt and glossi ribbon what do you reckon it look for ron yell as they flew farther and farther north no idea harri bellow back hi hand were numb with cold but he did not date attempt to shift hi grip he had been wonder for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them if the dragon head for open seal he wa cold and numb not to mention desper hungri and thirsti when he wonder had the beast itself last eaten sure it would need susten befor long and what if at that point it realiz it had three highli edibl human sit on it back the sun slip lower in the sky which wa turn indigo and still the dragon flew citi and town glide out of sight beneath them it enorm shadow slide over the earth like a giant dark cloud everi part of harri ach with the effort of hold on to the dragon back is it my imagin shout ron after a consider stretch of silenc or are we lose height harri look down and saw deep green mountain and lake copperi in the sunset the landscap seem to grow larger and more detail as he squint over the side of the dragon and he wonder whether it had divin the presenc of fresh water by the flash of reflect sunlight lower and lower the dragon flew in great spiral circl hone in it seem upon one of the smaller lake i say we jump when it get low enough harri call back to the other straight into the water befor it realiz were here they agre hermion a littl faintli and now harri could see the dragon wide yellow underbelli rippl in the surfac of the water now he slither over the side of the dragon and plummet feetfirst toward the surfac of the lake the drop wa greater than he had estim and he hit the water hard plung like a stone into a freez green reedfil world he kick toward the surfac and emerg pant to see enorm rippl eman in circl from the place where ron and hermion had fallen the dragon did not seem to have notic anyth it wa alreadi fifti feet away swoop low over the lake to scoop up water in it scar snout as ron and hermion emerg splutter and gasp from the depth of the lake the dragon flew on it wing beat hard and land at last on a distant bank harri ron and hermion struck out for the opposit shore the lake did not seem to be deep soon it wa more a question of fight their way through reed and mud than swim and at last they flop sodden pant and exhaust onto slipperi grass hermion collaps cough and shudder though harri could have happili lain down and slept he stagger to hi feet drew out hi wand and start cast the usual protect spell around them when he had finish he join the other it wa the first time that he had seen them properli sinc escap from the vault both had angri red burn all over their face and arm and their cloth wa sing away in place they were winc as they dab essenc of dittani onto their mani injuri hermion hand harri the bottl then pull out three bottl of pumpkin juic she had brought from shell cottag and clean dri robe for all of them they chang and then gulp down the juic well on the upsid said ron final who wa sit watch the skin on hi hand regrow we got the horcrux on the downsid no sword said harri through grit teeth as he drip dittani through the sing hole in hi jean onto the angri burn beneath no sword repeat ron that doublecross littl scab harri pull the horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them glint in the sun it drew their eye as they swig their bottl of juic at least we cant wear it thi time thatd look a bit weird hang around our neck said ron wipe hi mouth on the back of hi hand hermion look across the lake to the far bank where the dragon wa still drink whatll happen to it do you think she ask will it be alright you sound like hagrid said ron it a dragon hermion it can look after itself it us we need to worri about what do you mean well i dont know how to break thi to you said ron but i think they might have notic we broke into gringott all three of them start to laugh and onc start it wa difficult to stop harri rib ach he felt lighthead with hunger but he lay back on the grass beneath the redden sky and laugh until hi throat wa raw what are we go to do though said hermion final hiccup herself back to serious hell know wont he youknowwho will know we know about hi horcrux mayb theyll be too scare to tell him said ron hope mayb theyll cover up the sky the smell of the lake water the sound of ron voic were extinguish pain cleav harri head like a sword stroke he wa stand in a dimli lit room and a semicircl of wizard face him and on the floor at hi feet knelt a small quak figur what did you say to me hi voic wa high and cold but furi and fear burn insid him the one thing that he had dread but it could not be true he could not see how the goblin wa trembl unabl to meet the red eye high abov hi say it again murmur voldemort say it again mmi lord stammer the goblin it black eye wide with terror mmi lord we ttri to ststop them imimpostor my lord broke broke into the into the lestrang vault impostor what impostor i thought gringott had way of reveal impostor who were they it wa it wa the ppotter bboy and the ttwo accomplic and they took he said hi voic rise a terribl fear grip him tell me what did they take a a ssmall golden ccup mmi lord the scream of rage of denial left him as if it were a stranger he wa craze frenzi it could not be true it wa imposs nobodi had known how wa it possibl that the boy could have discov hi secret the elder wand slash through the air and green light erupt through the room the kneel goblin roll over dead the watch wizard scatter befor him terrifi bellatrix and luciu malfoy threw other behind them in their race for the door and again and again hi wand fell and those who were left were slain all of them for bring him thi news for hear about the golden cup alon amongst the dead he stomp up and down and they pass befor him in vision hi treasur hi safeguard hi anchor to immort the diari wa destroy and the cup wa stolen what if what if the boy knew about the other could he know had he alreadi act had he trace more of them wa dumbledor at the root of thi dumbledor who had alway suspect him dumbledor dead on hi order dumbledor whose wand wa hi now yet who reach out from the ignomini of death through the boy the boy but sure if the boy had destroy ani of hi horcrux he lord voldemort would have known would have felt it he the greatest wizard of them all he the most power he the killer of dumbledor and of how mani other worthless nameless men how could lord voldemort not have known if he himself most import and preciou had been attack mutil true he had not felt it when the diari had been destroy but he had thought that wa becaus he had no bodi to fell be less than ghost no sure the rest were safe the other horcrux must be intact but he must know he must be sure he pace the room kick asid the goblin corps as he pass and the pictur blur and burn in hi boil brain the lake the shack and hogwart a modicum of calm cool hi rage now how could the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the gaunt shack no one had ever known him to be relat to the gaunt he had hidden the connect the kill had never been trace to him the ring sure wa safe and how could the boy or anybodi els know about the cave or penetr it protect the idea of the locket be stolen wa absurd as for the school he alon knew where in hogwart he had stow the horcrux becaus he alon had plume the deepest secret of that place and there wa still nagini who must remain close now no longer sent to do hi bid under hi protect but to be sure to be utterli sure he must return to each of hi hide place he must redoubl protect around each of hi horcrux a job like the quest for the elder wand that he must undertak alon which should he visit first which wa in most danger an old uneas flicker insid him dumbledor had known hi middl name dumbledor might have made the connect with the gaunt their abandon home wa perhap the least secur of hi hide place it wa there that he would go first the lake sure imposs though wa there a slight possibl that dumbledor might have known some of hi past misde through the orphanag and hogwart but he knew the hi horcrux there wa safe it would be imposs for potter to enter hogsmead without detect let alon the school nevertheless it would be prudent to alert snape to the fact that the boy might tri to reenter the castl to tell snape whi the boy might return would be foolish of cours it had been a grave mistak to trust bellatrix and malfoy didnt their stupid and careless prove how unwis it wa ever to trust he would visit the gaunt shack first then and take nagini with him he would not be part from the snake anymor and he strode from the room through the hall and out into the dark garden where the fountain play he call the snake in parseltongu and it slither out to join him like a long shadow harri eye flew open as he wrench himself back to the present he wa lie on the bank of the lake in the set sun and ron and hermion were look down at him judg by their worri look and by the continu pound of hi scar hi sudden excurs into voldemort mind had not pass unnot he struggl up shiver vagu surpris that he wa still wet to hi skin and saw the cup lie innoc in the grass befor him and the lake deep blue shot with gold in the fall sun he know hi own voic sound strang and low after voldemort high scream he know and he go to check where the other are and the last one he wa alreadi on hi feet is at hogwart i knew it i knew it what ron wa gape at him hermion sat up look worri but what did you see how do you know i saw him find out about the cup i i wa in hi head he harri rememb the kill he serious angri and scare too he cant understand how we knew and now he go to check the other are safe the ring first he thing the hogwart one is safest becaus snape there becaus itll be so hard not to be seen get in i think hell check that one last but he could still be there within hour did you see where in hogwart

enorm wing echo across the black water the dragon had drunk it fill and risen into the air they paus in their prepar to watch it climb higher and higher now black against the rapidli darken sky until it vanish over a nearbi mountain then hermion walk forward and took her place between the other two harri pull the cloak down as far as it would go and togeth they turn on the spot into the crush dark

becaus i have thing to discuss with him inform i must give him befor it is too late inform repeat snape you trust himyou do not trust me it is not a question of trust i have as we both know limit time it is essenti that i give the boy enough inform for him to do what he need to do and whi may i not have the same inform i prefer not to put all of my secret in one basket particularli not a basket that spend so much time dangl on the arm of lord voldemort which i do on your order and you do it extrem well do not think that i underestim the constant danger in which you place yourself severu to give voldemort what appear to be valuabl inform while withhold the essenti is a job i would entrust to nobodi but you yet you confid much more in a boy who is incap of occlum whose magic is mediocr and who ha a direct connect into the dark lord mind voldemort fear that connect said dumbledor not so long ago he had one small tast of what truli share harri mind mean to him it wa pain such as he ha never experienc he will not tri to possess harri again i am sure of it not in that way i dont understand lord voldemort soul maim as it is can not bear close contact with a soul like harri like a tongu on frozen steel like flesh in flame soul we were talk of mind in the case of harri and lord voldemort to speak of one is to speak of the other dumbledor glanc around to make sure that they were alon they were close by the forbidden forest now but there wa no sign of anyon near them after you have kill me severu you refus to tell me everyth yet you expect that small servic of me snarl snape

how could he have the strength to do what must be done but what must he do that is between harri and me now listen close severu there will come a time after my death do not argu do not interrupt there will come a time when lord voldemort will seem to fear for the life of hi snake for nagini snape look astonish precis if there come a time when lord voldemort stop send that snake forth to do hi bid but keep it safe besid him under magic protect then i think it will be safe to tell harri tell him what dumbledor took a deep breath and close hi eye tell him that on the night lord voldemort tri to kill him when lili cast her own life between them as a shield the kill curs rebound upon lord voldemort and a fragment of voldemort soul wa blast apart from the whole and latch itself onto the onli live soul left in that collaps build part of lord voldemort live insid harri and it is that which give him the power of speech with snake and a connect with lord voldemort mind that he ha never understood and while that fragment of soul unmiss by voldemort remain attach to and protect by harri lord voldemort can not die harri seem to be watch the two men from one end of a long tunnel they were so far away from him their voic echo strang in hi ear so the boyth boy must die ask snape quit calmli and voldemort himself must do it severu that is essenti anoth long silenc then snape said i thoughtal those yearsthat we were protect him for her for lili we have protect him becaus it ha been essenti to teach him to rais him to let him tri hi strength said dumbledor hi eye still tight shut meanwhil the connect between them grow ever stronger a parasit growth sometim i have thought he suspect it himself if i know him he will have arrang matter so that when he doe set out to meet hi death

turn back to snape and hi eye were full of tear after all thi time alway said snape and the scene shift now harri saw snape talk to the portrait of dumbledor behind hi desk you will have to give voldemort the correct date of harri departur from hi aunt and uncl said dumbledor not to do so will rais suspicion when voldemort believ you so well inform howev you must plant the idea of decoy that

those time he had thought that it wa about to happen and escap he had never realli thought of the thing itself hi will to live had alway been so much stronger than hi fear of death yet it did not occur to him now to tri to escap to outrun voldemort it wa over he knew it and all that wa left wa the thing itself die if he could onli have die on that summer night when he had left number four privet drive for the last time when the nobl phoenix feather wand had save him if he could onli have die like hedwig so quickli he would not have known it had happen or if he could have launch himself in front of a wand to save someon he love he envi even hi parent death now thi coldblood walk to hi own destruct would requir a differ kind of braveri he felt hi finger trembl slightli and made an effort to control them although no one could see him the portrait on the wall were all empti slowli veri slowli he sat up and as he did so he felt more aliv and more awar of hi own live bodi than ever befor whi had he never appreci what a miracl he wa brain and nerv and bound heart it would all be gone or at least he would be gone from it hi breath came slow and deep and hi mouth and throat were complet dri but so were hi eye dumbledor betray wa almost noth of cours there had been a bigger plan harri had simpli been too foolish to see it he realiz that now he had never question hi own assumpt that dumbledor want him aliv now he saw that hi life span had alway been determin by how long it took to elimin all the horcrux dumbledor had pass the job of destroy them to him and obedi he had continu to chip away at the bond tie not onli voldemort but himself to life how neat how eleg not to wast ani more live but to give the danger task to the boy who had alreadi been mark for slaughter and whose death would not be a calam but anoth blow against voldemort and dumbledor had known that harri would not duck out that he would keep go to the end even though it wa hi end becaus he had taken troubl to get to know him hadnt he dumbledor knew as voldemort knew that harri would not let anyon els die for him now that he had discov it wa in hi power to stop it the imag of fred lupin and tonk lie dead in the great hall forc their way back into hi mind eye and for a moment he could hardli breath death wa impati but dumbledor had overestim him he had fail the snake surviv one horcrux remain to bind voldemort to the earth even after harri had been kill true that would mean an easier job for somebodi he wonder who would do it ron and hermion would know what need to be done of cours that would have been whi dumbledor want him to confid in two other so that if he fulfil hi true destini a littl earli they could carri on like rain on a cold window these thought patter against the hard surfac of the incontrovert truth which wa that he must die i must die it must end ron and hermion seem a long way away in a faroff countri he felt as though he had part from them long ago there would be no goodby and no explan he wa determin of that thi wa a journey they could not take togeth and the attempt they would make to stop him would wast valuabl time he look down at the batter gold watch he had receiv on hi seventeenth birthday nearli half of the hour allot by voldemort for hi surrend had elaps he stood up hi heart wa leap against hi rib like a frantic bird perhap it knew it had littl time left perhap it wa determin to fulfil a lifetim beat befor the end he did not look back as he close the offic door the castl wa empti he felt ghostli stride through it alon as if he had alreadi die the portrait peopl were still miss from their frame the whole place wa eerili still as if all it remain lifeblood were concentr in the great hall where the dead and the mourner were cram

dead but he could not see ani of the peopl he love no hint of hermion ron ginni or ani of the other weasley no luna he felt he would have given all the time remain to him for just one last look at

and narcissa whose eye were sunken and full of apprehens everi eye wa fix upon voldemort who stood with hi head bow and hi white hand fold over the elder wand in front of him he might have been pray or els count silent in hi mind and harri stand still on the edg of the scene though absurdli of a child count in a game of hideandseek behind hi head still swirl and coil the great snake nagini float in her glitter charm cage like a monstrou halo when dolohov and yaxley rejoin the circl voldemort look up no sign of him my lord said dolohov voldemort express did not chang the red eye seem to burn in the firelight slowli he drew the elder wand between hi long finger my lord bellatrix had spoken she sat closest to voldemort dishevel her face a littl bloodi but otherwis unharm voldemort rais hi

stuf it beneath hi robe with hi wand he did not want to be tempt to fight i wa it seem mistaken said voldemort you werent harri said it as loudli as he could with all the forc he could muster he did not want to sound afraid the resurrect stone slip from between hi numb finger and out of the corner of hi eye he saw hi parent siriu and lupin vanish as he step forward into the firelight at that moment he felt that nobodi matter but voldemort it wa just the two of them the illus wa gone as soon as it had come the giant roar as the death eater rose togeth and there were mani cri gasp even laughter voldemort had frozen where he stood but hi red eye had found harri and he stare as harri move toward him with noth but the fire between them then a voic yell harri no he turn hagrid wa bound and truss tie to a tree nearbi hi massiv bodi shook the branch overhead as he struggl desper no no harri whatr yeh quiet shout rowl and with a flick of hi wand hagrid wa silenc bellatrix who had leapt to her feet wa look eagerli from voldemort to harri her breast heav the onli thing that move were the flame and the snake coil and uncoil in the glitter cage behind voldemort head harri could feel hi wand against hi chest but he made no attempt to draw it he knew that the snake wa too well protect knew that if he manag to point the wand at nagini fifti curs would hit him first and still voldemort and harri look at each other and now voldemort tilt hi head a littl to the side consid the boy stand befor him and a singularli mirthless smile curl the lipless mouth harri potter he said veri softli hi voic might have been part of the spit fire the boy who live none of the death eater move they were wait everyth wa wait hagrid wa struggl and bellatrix wa pant and harri thought inexplic of ginni and her blaze look and the feel of her lip on hi voldemort had rais hi wand hi head wa still tilt to one side like a curiou child wonder what would happen if he proceed harri look back into the red eye and want it to happen now quickli while he could still stand befor he lost control befor he betray fear he saw the mouth move and a flash of green light and everyth wa gone chapter thirtyf king cross he lay facedown listen to the silenc he wa perfectli alon nobodi wa watch nobodi els wa there he wa not perfectli sure that he wa there himself a long time later or mayb no time at all it came to him that he must exist must be more than disembodi thought becaus he wa lie definit lie on some surfac therefor he had a sens of touch and the thing against which he lay exist too almost as soon as he had reach thi conclus harri becam consciou that he wa nake convinc as he wa of hi total solitud thi did not concern him but it did intrigu him slightli he wonder whether as he could feel he would be abl to see in open them he discov that he had eye he lay in a bright mist though it wa not like mist he had ever experienc befor hi surround were not hidden by cloudi vapor rather the cloudi vapor had not yet form into surround the floor on which he lay seem to be white neither warm nor cold but simpli there a flat blank someth on which to be he sat up hi bodi appear unscath he touch hi face he wa not wear glass anymor then a nois reach him through the unform nothing that surround him the small soft thump of someth that flap flail and struggl it wa a piti nois yet also slightli indec he had the uncomfort feel that he wa eavesdrop on someth furtiv shame for the first time he wish he were cloth bare had the wish form in hi head than robe appear a short distanc away he took them and pull them on they were soft clean and warm it wa extraordinari how they had appear just like that the moment he had want them he stood up look around wa he in some great room of requir the longer he look the more there wa to see a great dome glass roof glitter high abov him in sunlight perhap it wa a palac all wa hush and still except for those odd thump and whimper nois come from somewher close by in the mist harri turn slowli on the spot and hi surround seem to invent themselv befor hi eye a wideopen space bright and clean a hall larger by far than the great hall with that clear dome glass ceil it wa quit empti he wa the onli person there except for he recoil he had spot the thing that wa make the nois it had the form of a small nake child curl on the ground it skin raw and rough flayedlook and it lay shudder under a seat where it had been left unwant stuf out of sight struggl for breath he wa afraid of it small and fragil and wound though it wa he did not want to approach it nevertheless he drew slowli nearer readi to jump back at ani moment soon he stood near enough to touch it yet he could not bring himself to do it he felt like a coward he ought to comfort it but it repuls him you can not help he spun around albu dumbledor wa walk toward him sprightli and upright wear sweep robe of midnight blue harri he spread hi arm wide and hi hand were both whole and white and undamag you wonder boy you brave brave man let us walk stun harri follow as dumbledor strode away from where the flay child lay whimper lead him to two seat that harri had not previous notic set some distanc away under that high sparkl ceil dumbledor sat down in one of them and harri fell into the other stare at hi old headmast face dumbledor long silver hair and beard the piercingli blue eye behind halfmoon spectacl the crook nose everyth wa as he had rememb it and yet but your dead said harri oh ye said dumbledor matteroffactli then im dead too ah said dumbledor smile still more broadli that is the question isnt it on the whole dear boy i think not they look at each other the old man still beam not repeat harri not said dumbledor but harri rais hi hand instinct toward the lightn scar it did not seem to be there but i should have die i didnt defend myself i meant to let him kill me and that said dumbledor will i think have made all the differ happi seem to radiat from dumbledor like light like fire harri had never seen the man so utterli so palpabl content explain said harri but you alreadi know said dumbledor he twiddl hi thumb togeth i let him kill me said harri didnt i you did said dumbledor nod go on so the part of hi soul that wa in me dumbledor nod still more enthusiast urg harri onward a broad smile of encourag on hi face ha it gone oh ye said dumbledor ye he destroy it your soul is whole and complet your own harri but then harri trembl over hi shoulder to where the small maim creatur trembl under the chair what is that professor someth that is beyond either of our help said dumbledor but if voldemort use the kill curs harri start again and nobodi die for me thi time how can i be aliv i think you know said dumbledor think back rememb what he did in hi ignor in hi greed and hi cruelti harri thought he let hi gaze drift over hi surround if it wa inde a palac in which they sat it wa an odd one with chair set in littl row and bit of rail here and there and still he and dumbledor and the stunt creatur under the chair were the onli be there then the answer rose to hi lip easili without effort he took my blood said harri precis said dumbledor he took your blood and rebuilt hi live bodi with it your blood in hi vein harri lili protect insid both of you he thether you to life while he live i live while he live but i thought i thought it wa the other way around i thought we both had to die or is it the same thing he wa distract by the whimper and thump of the agon creatur behind them and glanc back at it yet again are you sure we cant do anyth there is no help possibl then explain more said harri and dumbledor smile you were the seventh horcrux harri the horcrux he never meant to make he had render hi soul so unstabl that it broke apart when he commit those act of unspeak evil the murder of your parent the attempt kill of a child but what escap from that room wa even less than he knew he left more than hi bodi behind he left part of himself latch to you the wouldb victim who had surviv and hi knowledg remain woefulli incomplet harri that which voldemort doe not valu he take no troubl to comprehend of houseelv and children tale of love loyalti and innoc voldemort know and understand noth noth that they all have a power beyond hi own a power beyond the reach of ani magic is a truth he ha never grasp he took your blood believ it would strengthen him he took into hi bodi a tini part of the enchant your mother laid upon you when she die for you hi bodi keep her sacrafic aliv and while that enchant surviv so do you and so doe voldemort one last hope for himself dumbledor smile at harri and harri stare at him and you knew thi you knew all along i guess but my guess have usual been good said dumbledor happili and they sat in silenc for what seem like a long time while the creatur behind them continu to whimper and trembl there more said harri there more to it whi did my wand break the wand he borrow as to that i can not be sure have a guess then said harri and dumbledor laugh what you must understand harri is that you and lord voldemort have journey togeth into realm of magic hitherto unknown and untest but here is what i think happen and it is unpreced and no wandmak could i think ever have predict or explain it to voldemort without mean to as you now know lord voldemort doubl the bond between you when he return to a human form a part of hi soul wa still attach to your and think to strengthen himself he took a part of your mother sacrafic into himself if he could onli have understood the precis and terribl power of that sacrific he would not perhap have dare to touch your blood but then if he had been abl to understand he could not be lord voldemort and might never have murder at all have ensur thi twofold connect have wrap your destini togeth more secur than ever two wizard were join in histori voldemort proceed to attack you with a wand that share a core with your and now someth veri strang happen as we know the core react in a way that lord voldemort who never knew that your wand wa a twin of hi had ever expect he wa more afraid than you were that night harri you had accept even embrac the possibl of death someth lord voldemort ha never been abl to do your courag won your wand overpow hi and in do so someth happen between those wand someth that echo the relationship between their master i believ that your wand imbib some of the power and qualiti of voldemort wand that night which is to say that it contain a littl of voldemort himself so your wand recogn him when he pursu you recogn a man who wa both kin and mortal enemi and it regurgit some of hi own magic against him magic much more power than anyth luciuss wand had ever perform your wand now contain the power of your enorm courag and of voldemort own deadli skill what chanc did that poor stick of luciu malfoy stand but if my wand wa so power how come hermion wa abl to break it ask harri my dear boy it remark effect were direct onli at voldemort who had tamper so illadvisedli with the deepest law of magic onli toward him wa that wand abnorm power otherwis it wa a wand like ani other though a good one i am sure dumbledor finish kindli harri sat in thought for a long time or perhap second it wa veri hard to be sure of thing like time here he kill me with your wand he fail to kill you with my wand dumbledor correct harri i think we can agre that you are not dead though of cours he ad as if fear he had been discourt i do not minim your suffer which i am sure were sever i feel great at the moment though said harri look down at hi clean unblemish hand where are we exactli well i wa go to ask you that said dumbledor look around where would you say that we are until dumbledor had ask harri had not known now howev he found that he had an answer readi to give it look he said slowli like king cross station except a lo cleaner and empti and there are no train as far as i can see king cross station dumbledor wa chuckl immoder good graciou realli well where do you think we are ask harri a littl defens my dear boy i have no idea thi is as they say your parti harri had no idea what thi meant dumbledor wa be infuri he glare at him then rememb a much more press question than that of their current locat the deathli hallow he said and he wa glad to see that the word wipe the smile from dumbledor face ah ye he said he even look a littl worri well for the first time sinc harri had met dumbledor he look less than an old man much less he look fleetingli like a small boy caught in wrongdo can you forgiv me he said can you forgiv me for not trust you for not tell you harri i onli fear that you would fail as i had fail i onli dread that you would make my mistak i crave your pardon harri i have known for some time now that you are the better man what are you talk about ask harri startl by dumbledor tone by the sudden tear in hi eye the hallow the hallow murmur dumbledor a desper man dream but theyr real real and danger and a lure for fool said dumbledor and i wa such a fool but you know dont you i have no secret from you anymor you know what do i know dumbledor turn hi whole bodi to face harri and tear still sparkl in the brilliantli blue eye master of death harri master of death wa i better ultim than voldemort of cours you were said harri of cours how can you ask that you never kill if you could avoid it true true said dumbledor and he wa like a child seek reassur yet i too sought a way to conquer death harri not the way he did said harri after all hi anger at dumbledor how odd it wa to sit here beneath the high vault ceil and defend dumbledor from himself hallow not horcrux hallow murmur dumbledor not horcrux precis there wa a paus the creatur behind them whimper but harri no longer look around grindelwald wa look for them too he ask dumbledor close hi eye for a moment and nod it wa the thing abov all that drew us togeth he said quietli two clever arrog boy with a share obsess he want to come to godric hollow as i am sure you have guess becaus of the grave of ignotu peverel he want to explor the place the third brother had die so it true ask harri all of it the peverel brother were the three brother of the tale said dumbledor nod oh ye i think so whether they met death on a lone road i think it more like that the peverel brother were simpli gift danger wizard who succeed in creat those power object the stori of them be death own hallow seem to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creation the cloak as you know now travel down through the age father to son mother to daughter right down to ignotuss last live descend who wa born as ignotu wa in the villag of godric hollow dumbledor smile at harri me you you have guess i know whi the cloak wa in my possess on the night your parent die jame had show it to me just a few day previous it explain much of hi undetect wrongdo at school i could hardli believ what i wa see i ask to borrow it to examin it i had long sinc given up my dream of unit the hallow but i could not resist could not help take a closer look it wa a cloak the like of which i had never seen immens old perfect in everi respect and then your father die and i had two hallow at last all to myself hi tone wa unbear bitter the cloak wouldnt have help them surviv though harri said quickli voldemort knew where my mum and dad were the cloak couldnt have made them curseproof true sigh dumbledor true harri wait but dumbledor did not speak so he prompt him so youd given up look for the hallow when you saw the cloak oh ye said dumbledor faintli it seem that he forc himself to meet harri eye you know what happen you know you can not despis me more than i despis myself but i dont despis you then you should said dumbledor he drew a deep breath you know the secret of my sister ill health what those muggl did what she becam you know how my poor father sought reveng and paid the price die in azkaban you know how my mother gave up her own life to care for ariana i resent it harri dumbledor state it baldli coldli he wa look now over the top of harri head into the distanc i wa gift i wa brilliant i want to escap i want to shine i want glori do not misunderstand me he said and pain cross the face so that he look ancient again i love them i love my parent i love my brother and my sister but i wa selfish harri more selfish than you who are a remark selfless person could possibl imagin so that when my mother die and i wa left the respons of a damag sister and a wayward brother i return to my villag in anger and bitter trap and wast i thought and then of cours he came dumbledor look directli into harri eye again grindelwald you can not imagin how hi idea caught me harri inflam me muggl forc into subservi we wizard triumphant grindelwald and i the gloriou young leader of the revolut oh i had a few scrupl i assuag my conscienc with empti word it would all be for the greater good and ani harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefit for wizard did i know in my heart of heart what gellert grindelwald wa i think i did but i close my eye if the plan we were make came to fruition all my dream would come true and at the heart of our scheme the deathli hallow how they fascin him how they fascin both of us the unbeat wand the weapon that would lead us to power the resurrect stone to him though i pretend not to know it it meant an armi of inferi to me i confess it meant the return of my parent and the lift of all respons from my shoulder and the cloak somehow we never discuss the cloak much harri both of us could conceal ourselv well enough without the cloak the true magic of which of cours is that it can be use to protect and shield other as well as it owner i thought that if we ever found it it might be use in hide ariana but our interest in the cloak wa mainli that it complet the trio for the legend said that the man who had unit all three object would then be truli master of death which we took to mean invinc invinc master of death grindelwald and dumbledor two month of insan of cruel dream and neglect of the onli two member of my famili left to me and then you know what happen realiti return in the form of my rough unlett and infinit more admir brother i did not want to hear the truth he shout at me i did not want to hear that i could not set forth and seek hallow with a fragil and unstabl sister in tow the argument becam a fight grindelwald lost control that which i had alway sens in him though i pretend not to now sprang into terribl be and ariana after all my mother care and caution lay dead upon the floor dumbledor gave a littl gasp and began to cri in earnest harri reach out and wa glad to find that he could touch him he grip hi arm tightli and dumbledor gradual regain control well grindelwald fled as anyon but i could have predict he vanish with hi plan for seiz power and hi scheme for muggl tortur and hi dream of the deathli hallow dream in which i had encourag him and help him he ran while i wa left to buri my sister and learn to live with my guilt and my terribl grief the price of my shame year pass there were rumor about him they said he had procur a wand of immens power i meanwhil wa offer the post of minist of magic not onc but sever time natur i refus i had learn that i wa not to be trust with power but youd have been better much better than fudg or scimgeour burst out harri would i ask dumbledor heavili i am not so sure i had proven as a veri young man that power wa my weak and my temptat it is a curiou thing harri but perhap those who are best suit to power are those who have never sought it those who like you have leadership thrust upon them and take up the mantl becaus they must and find to their own surpris that they wear it well i wa safer at hogwart i think i wa a good teacher you were the best you are veri kind harri but while i busi myself with the train of young wizard grindelwald wa rais an armi they say he fear me and perhap he did but less i think than i fear him oh not death said dumbledor in answer to harri question look not what he could do to me magic i knew that we were evenli match perhap that i wa a shade more skill it wa the truth i fear you see i never knew which of us in that last horrif fight had actual cast the curs that kill my sister you may call me cowardli you would be right harri i dread beyond all thing the knowledg that it had been i who brought about her death not mere through my arrog and stupid but that i actual struck the blow that snuf out her life i think he knew it i think he knew what frighten me i delay meet him until final it would have been too shame to resist ani longer peopl were die and he seem unstopp and i had to do what i could well you know what happen next i won the duel i won the wand anoth silenc harri did not ask whether dumbledor had ever found out who struck ariana dead he did not want to know and even less did he want dumbledor to have to tell him at last he knew what dumbledor would have seen when he look in the mirror of eris and whi dumbledor had been so understand of the fascin it had exercis over harri they sat in silenc for a long time and the whipmer of the creatur behind them bare disturb harri anymor at last he said grindelwald tri to stop voldemort go after the wand he lie you know pretend he had never had it dumbledor nod look down at hi lap tear still glitter on the crook nose they say he show remors in later year alon in hi cell at nurmengard i hope that is true i would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done perhap that lie to voldemort wa hi attempt to make amend to prevent voldemort from take the hallow or mayb from break into your tomb suggest harri and dumbledor dab hi eye after anoth short paus harri said you tri to use the resurrect stone dumbledor nod when i discov it after all those year buri in the abandon home of the gaunt the hallow i had crave most of all though in my youth i had want it for veri differ reason i lost my head harri i quit forgot that i wa not a horcrux that the ring wa sure to carri a curs i pick it up and i put it on and for a second i imagin that i wa about to see ariana and my mother and my father and to tell them how veri veri sorri i wa i wa such a fool harri after all those year i had learn noth i wa unworthi to unit the deathli hallow i had prove it time and again and here wa final proof whi said harri it wa natur you want to see them again what wrong with that mayb a man in a million could unit the hallow harri i wa fit onli to possess the meanest of them the least extraordinari i wa fit to own the elder wand and not boast of it and not to kill with it i wa permit to tame and use it becaus i took it not for gain but to save other from it but the cloak i took out of vain curious and so it could never have work for me as it work for you it true owner the stone i would have use in an attempt to drag back those who are at peac rather than enabl my selfsacrafic as you did you are the worthi possessor of the hallow dumbledor pat harri hand and harri look up at the old man and smile he could not help himself how coul dhe remain angri with dumbledor now whi did you have to make it so difficult dumbledor smile wa tremul i am afraid i count on miss granger to slow you up harri i wa afraid that your hot head might domin your good heart i wa scare that if present outright with the fact about those tempt object you might seiz the hallow as i did at the wrong time for the wrong reason if you laid hand on them i want you to possess them safe you are the true master of death becaus the true master doe not seek to run away from death he accept that he must die and understand that there are far far wors thing in the live world than die and voldemort never knew about the hallow i do not think so becaus he did not recogn the resurrect stone he turn into a horcrux but even if he had known about them harri i doubt that he woul dhave been interest in ani except the first he would not think that he need the cloak and as for the stone whom would he want to bring back from the dead he fear the dead he doe not love but you expect him to go after the wand i have been sure that he would tri ever sinc your wand beat voldemort in the graveyard of littl hangleton at first he wa afraid that you had conquer him by superior skill onc he had kidnap ollivand howev he discov the exist of the twin core he thought that explain everyth yet the borrow wand did no better against your so voldemort instead of ask himself what qualiti it wa in you that had made your wand so strong what gift you possess that he did not natur set out to find the one wand that they said would beat ani other for him the elder wand ha becom an obsess to rival hi obsess with you he believ that the elder wand remov hi last weak and make him truli invinc poor severu if you plan your death with snape you meant him to end up with the elder wand didnt you i admit that wa my intent said dumbledor but it did not work as i intend did it no said harri that bit didnt work out the creatur behind them jerk and moan and harri and dumbledor sate without talk for the longest time yet the realiz of what would happen next settl gradual over harri in the long minut like softli fall snow ive got to go back havent i that is up to you ive got a choic oh ye dumbledor smile at him we are in king cross you say i think that if you decid not to go back you would be abl to let say board a train and where would it take me on said dumbledor simpli silenc again voldemort got the elder wand true voldemort ha the elder wand but you want me to go back i think said dumbledor that if you choos to return there is a chanc that he may be finish for good i can not promis it but i know thi harri that you have less to fear from return here than he doe harri glanc again at the raw look thing that trembl and choke in the shadow beneath the distant chair do not piti the dead harri piti the live and abov all those who live without love by return you may ensur that fewer soul are maim fewer famili are torn apart if that seem to you a worthi goal they we saw goodby for the present harri nod and sigh leav thi place would not be nearli as hard as walk into the forest had been but it wa warm and light and peac here and he knew that he wa head back to pain and the fear of more loss he stood up and dumbledor did the same and they look for a long moment into each other face tell me one last

triumph and jubil at hi death but instead hurri footstep whisper and solicit murmur fill the air my lord my lord it wa bellatrix voic and she spoke as if to a lover harri did not dare open hi eye but allow hi other sens to explor hi predica he knew that hi wand wa still stow beneath hi robe becaus he could feel it press between hi chest and the ground a slight cushion effect in the area of hi
