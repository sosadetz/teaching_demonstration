heavi layer of dust cover the wooden tabl and bench a spider had spun an enorm web in one corner but even the web wa desert on a broken hearthston lay the char remnant of a longdead fire near the hearth a number of larg cookpot dri and empti now had been overturn earthen bowl and tall jar shatter into fragment were strewn about the floor through the hole in the roof the leav of more than one autumn had fallen nearli buri a stool whose leg had broken into splinter the hut wa silent the nois of the forest did not enter taran stood uneasili while princ rhun fumbl with hi gear gurgi fascin by so mani strang odd and end lost no time in poke through them suddenli he cri out in surpris look look he call hold up a sheaf of tatter parchment taran knelt besid gurgi and examin the rag bundl the fold mice he realiz had discov the packet long befor mani of the sheet had been gnaw away other were rain sodden and blot the few undamag page were cover with cramp write onli at the bottom of the pile did taran find page in good repair these had been care bound in leather to make a small tome and their surfac wa clear and unmark princ rhun who still had not got around to buckl on hi sword came to peer over taran shoulder i say he cri what have you there i cant guess what it is but it look interest and isnt that a handsom littl book i shouldnt mind have it to put down thing im suppos to rememb to do princ rhun taran said hand the undamag volum to the princ of mona who thrust it into hi jacket believ me if there anyth that might ever help you do anyth your welcom to it he went back to puzzl over the parchment between the mice and the weather he went on there not much to make out of thi scrawl there seem to be no begin or end but as far as i can tell these are recip for potion potion cri fflewddur great belin that someth weve littl use for taran nevertheless continu to scan and sort the page wait i think ive found the name of whoever wrote them glew it look like and the potion as it say here are to hi voic falter and he turn anxious to fflewddur to make yourself grow bigger what can thi mean how that ask the bard bigger are you sure you havent read it wrong he took the page from taran hand and examin them care himself when he had finish he gave a low whistl in my wander said fflewddur ive manag to learn a number of thing not least of which is dont meddl i fear that exactli what thi fellow glew did inde what he sought wa a potion to make himself bigger and stronger if those are glew boot over there he ad point to the corner he sure need one for he must have been a littl fellow half hidden by leav a pair of wellworn boot lay on their side they were hardli larg enough to fit a child and seem to taran piti in their small and empti he must have been painstak fflewddur went on ill say that much for him he describ everyth he did and set down all hi recip quit care and method as for hi ingredi the bard said make a sour face i should rather not think about them i say princ rhun eagerli interrupt perhap we should tri them ourselv it would be interest to see what happen no no gurgi shout gurgi want no tast of nasti lotion and potion nor do i said fflewddur and neither did glew for the matter of that he had no wish to drink hi concoct until he had some hope theyd work for which i cant blame him in the least he went about it veri cleverli as i gather from what he written down here continu the bard he went out and trap a mountain cat a small one i should think sinc glew himself wa such a small person he brought her back put her in a cage and fed her hi potion as fast as he could cook them up poor creatur said taran inde agre the bard i shouldnt have like to be in her place yet he must have grown fond enough of her to give her a name here he written it down llyan apart from feed her those dread mess i expect he didnt treat her badli she might even have been compani for him live alon as he did at last it happen fflewddur went on you can see by hi write how excit glew must have been llyan began to grow glee mention he wa oblig to make a new cage for her and still anoth how pleas he must have been i can easili imagin the littl fellow chuckl and brew away for all he wa worth fflewddur turn to the last page and so it end he said where the mice have eaten the parchment theyv done away with glew last recip as for glew and llyan theyv vanish along with it taran wa silent look at the empti boot and overturn cookpot glew certainli is gone he said thought but i have a feel he didnt go far how that ask the bard oh i take your mean he said shudder ye it doe look rather shall i say sudden as i see glew he wa a neat and orderli sort he would hardli go off leav hi hut as it is now without hi boot at that poor littl fellow he sigh it onli prove the danger of meddl for all hi pain glew must have got himself gobbl up and if you ask me the wisest thing for us is to leav immedi taran nod and rose to hi feet as he did terrifi whinni and the sound of gallop hoov fill the air the hors he cri race to the door befor he could reach it the door burst from it hing taran clutch at hi sword and stumbl back into the hut as a huge shape
