ad on second thought im afraid anyth we might put down their chimney well they could veri like put someth wors up besid they dont have a chimney so we shall have to forget that idea gurgi meantim had return with a huge armload of straw from the chicken roost and the companion grate began heap it on the clay floor while gurgi went off again to fetch anoth load taran look dubious at the straggli

and the companion hurri after him the agit gurgi led them into the wattleanddaub build then slunk back terrifi he point to the far corner there in the midst of the straw stood a cauldron it wa squat and black and half as tall as a man it ugli mouth gape wide enough to hold a human bodi the rim of the cauldron wa crook and batter it side dent and scar on it lip and on the curv of it belli lay dark brown fleck and stain which taran knew were not rust a long thick handl wa brace by a heavi bar two heavi ring like the link of a great chain were set in either side though of iron the cauldron seem aliv grim and brood with ancient evil the empti mouth caught the chill breez and a hush mutter rose from the cauldron depth like the lost voic of the torment dead it is the black crochan taran whisper in fear and awe he well understood gurgi terror for the veri sight of the cauldron wa enough to make him feel an ici hand clutch hi heart he turn away hardli dare to look at it ani longer fflewddur face wa pale eilonwi put a hand to her mouth in the corner gurgi shiver piti though he himself had found it he gave no joyou yelp of triumph instead he sank deeper into the straw and tri to make himself as small as possibl ye well i suppos it is inde repli fflewddur swallow hard on the other hand he ad hope perhap it is not they did say they had a number of other cauldron and kettl lie about i mean we shouldnt want to make a mistak it is the crochan taran said i have dream of it and even if i had not i would know it still for i can sens the evil in it i too murmur eilonwi it is full of
