left the castl and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field held never been insid the stadium befor hundr of seat were rais in stand around the field so that the spectat were high enough to see what wa go on at either end of the field were three golden pole with hoop on the end they remind harri of the littl plastic stick muggl children blew bubbl through except that they were fifti feet high too eager to fli again to wait for wood harri mount hi broomstick and kick off from the ground what a feel he swoop in and out of the goal post and then sped up and down the field the nimbu two thousand turn wherev he want at hi lightest touch hey potter come down oliv wood had arriv fie wa carri a larg wooden crate under hi arm harri land next to him veri nice said wood hi eye glint i see what mcgonagal meant you realli are a natur im just go to teach you the rule thi even then youll be join team practic three time a week he open the crate insid were four differents ball right said wood now quidditch is easi enough to understand even if it not too easi to play there are seven player on each side three of them are call chaser three chaser harri repeat as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball thi ball call the quaffl said wood the chaser throw the quaffl to each other and tri and get it through one of the hoop to score a goal ten point everi time the quaffl goe through one of the hoop follow me the chaser throw the quaffl and put it through the hoop to score harri recit so that sort of like basketbal on broomstick with six hoop isnt it what basketbal said wood curious never mind said harri quickli now there anoth player on each side who call the keeper im keeper for gryffindor i have to fli around our hoop and stop the other team from score three chaser one keeper said harri who wa determin to rememb it all and they play with the quaffl okay got that so what are they for he point at the three ball left insid the box ill show you now said wood take thi he hand harri a small club a bit like a short basebal bat im go to show you what the bludger do wood said these two are the bludger he show harri two ident ball jet black and slightli smaller than the red quaffl harri notic that they seem to be strain to escap the strap hold them insid the box stand back wood warn harri he bent down and freed one of the bludger at onc the black ball rose high in the air and then pelt straight at harri face harri swung at it with the bat to stop it from break hi nose and sent it zigzag away into the air it zoom around their head and then shot at wood who dive on top of it and manag to pin it to the ground see wood pant forc the struggl bludger back into the crate and strap it down safe the bludger rocket around tri to knock player off their broom that whi you have two beater on each team the weasley twin are our it their job to protect their side from the bludger and tri and knock them toward the other team so think youv got all that three chaser tri and score with the quaffl the keeper guard the goal post the beater keep the bludger away from their team harri reel off veri good said wood er have the bludger ever kill anyon harri ask hope he sound offhand never at hogwart weve had a coupl of broken jaw but noth wors than that now the last member of the team is the seeker that you and you dont have to worri about the quaffl or the bludger unless they crack my head open dont worri the weasley are more than a match for the bludger i mean theyr like a pair of human bludger themselv wood reach into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball compar with the quaffl and the bludger it wa tini about the size of a larg walnut it wa bright gold and had littl flutter silver wing thi said wood is the golden snitch and it the most import ball of the lot it veri hard to catch becaus it so fast and difficult to see it the seeker job to catch it youv got to weav in and out of the chaser beater bludger and quaffl to get it befor the other team seeker becaus whichev seeker catch the snitch win hi team an extra hundr and fifti point so they nearli alway win that whi seeker get foul so much a game of quidditch onli end when the snitch is caught so it can go on for age i think the record is three month they had to keep bring on substitut so the player could get some sleep well that it ani question harri shook hi head he understood what he had to do all right it wa do it that wa go to be the problem we wont practic with the snitch yet said wood care shut it back insid the crate it too dark we might lose it let tri you out with a few of these he pull a bag of ordinari golf ball out of hi pocket and a few minut later he and harri were up in the air wood throw the golf ball as hard as he could in everi direct for harri to catch harri didnt miss a singl one and wood wa delight after half an hour night had realli fallen and they couldnt carri on that quidditch cupll have our name on it

they plung off into the tree leav ronan and bane behind them harri didnt have a clue what wa go on whi bane so angri he ask what wa that thing you save me from anyway firenz slow to a walk warn harri to keep hi head bow in case of lowhang branch but did not answer harri question they made their way through the tree in silenc for so long that harri thought firenz didnt want to talk to him anymor they were pass through a particularli dens patch of tree howev when firenz suddenli stop harri potter do you know what unicorn blood is use for no said harri startl by the odd question weve onli use the horn and tail hair in potion that is becaus it is a monstrou thing to slay a unicorn said firenz onli one who ha noth to lose and everyth to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you aliv even if you are an inch from death but at a terribl price you have slain someth pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a halflif a curs life from the moment the blood touch your lip harri stare at the back of firenz head which wa dappl silver in the moonlight but whod be that desper he wonder aloud if your go to be curs forev death better isnt it it is firenz agre unless all you need is to stay aliv long enough to drink someth els someth that will bring you back to full strength and power someth that will mean you can never die mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at thi veri moment the sorcer stone of cours the elixir of life but i dont understand who can you think of nobodi who ha wait mani year to return to power who ha clung to life await their chanc it wa as though an iron fist had clench suddenli around harri heart over the rustl of the tree he seem to hear onc more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he

safe now harri slid off hi back good luck harri potter said firenz the planet have been read wrongli befor now even by centaur i hope thi is one of those time he turn and canter back into the depth of the forest leav harri shiver behind him ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room wait for them to return he shout someth about quidditch foul when harri roughli shook him awak in a matter of second though he wa wideey as harri began to tell him and hermion what had happen in the forest harri couldnt sit down he pace up and down in front of the fire he wa still shake snape want the stone for voldemort and voldemort wait in the forest and all thi time we thought snape just want to get rich stop say the name said ron in a terrifi whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them harri wasnt listen firenz save me but he shouldnt have done so bane wa furiou he wa talk about interf with what the planet say is go to happen they must show that voldemort come back bane think firenz should have let voldemort kill me i suppos that written in the star as well will you stop say the name ron hiss so all ive got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harri went on feverishli then

of with dumbledor around youknowwho wont touch you anyway who say the centaur are right it sound like fortunetel to me and professor mcgonagal say that a veri imprecis branch of magic the sky had turn light befor they stop talk they went to bed exhaust their throat sore but the night surpris werent over when harri pull back hi sheet he found hi invis cloak fold neatli underneath them there wa a note pin to it just in case chapter sixteen through the trapdoor in year to come harri would never quit rememb how he had manag to get through hi exam when he half expect voldemort to come burst

ever sinc hi trip into the forest nevil thought harri had a bad case of exam nerv becaus harri couldnt sleep but the truth wa that harri kept be woken by hi old nightmar except that it wa now wors than ever becaus there wa a hood figur drip blood in it mayb it wa becaus they hadnt seen what harri had seen in the forest or becaus they didnt have scar burn on their forehead but ron and hermion
