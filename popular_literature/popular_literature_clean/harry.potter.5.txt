day when the idiot who ran the paper final realiz that voldemort wa back it would be headlin news and that wa the onli kind harri care about if he wa lucki there would also be owl carri letter from hi best friend ron and hermion though ani expect hed had that their letter would bring him news had long sinc been dash we cant say much about youknowwhat obvious weve been told not to say anyth import in case our letter go astray were quit busi but i cant give you detail here there a fair amount go on well tell you everyth when we see you but when were they go to see him nobodi seem too bother with a precis date hermion had scribbl i expect well be see you quit soon insid hi birthday card but how soon wa soon as far as harri could tell from the vagu hint in their letter hermion and ron were in the same place presum at ron parent hous he could hardli bear to think of the pair of them have fun at the burrow when he wa stuck in privet drive in fact he wa so angri with them he had thrown away unopen the two box of honeyduk chocol theyd sent him for hi birthday hed regret it later after the wilt salad aunt petunia had provid for dinner that night and what were ron and hermion busi with whi wasnt he harri busi hadnt he prove himself capabl of handl much more than them had they all forgotten what he had done hadnt it been he who had enter that graveyard and watch cedric be murder and been tie to that tombston and nearli kill dont think about that harri told himself sternli for the hundredth time that summer it wa bad enough that he kept revisit the graveyard in hi nightmar without dwell on it in hi wake moment too he turn a corner into magnolia crescent halfway along he pass the narrow alleyway down the side of a garag where he had first clap eye on hi godfath siriu at least seem to understand how harri wa feel admittedli hi letter were just as empti of proper news as ron and hermion but at least they contain word of caution and consol instead of tantal hint i know thi must be frustrat for you keep your nose clean and everyth will be okay be care and dont do anyth rash well thought harri as he cross magnolia crescent turn into magnolia road and head toward the darken play park he had by and larg done as siriu advis he had at least resist the temptat to tie hi trunk to hi broomstick and set off for the burrow by himself in fact harri thought hi behavior had been veri good consid how frustrat and angri he felt at be stuck in privet drive so long reduc to hide in flowerb in the hope of hear someth that might point to what lord voldemort wa do nevertheless it wa quit gall to be told not to be rash by a man who had serv twelv year in the wizard prison azkaban escap attempt to commit the murder he had been convict for in the first place then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff harri vault over the lock park gate and set off across the parch grass the park wa as empti as the surround street when he reach the swing he sank on to the onli one that dudley and hi friend had not yet manag to break coil one arm around the chain and stare moodili at the ground he would not be abl to hide in the dursley flowerb again tomorrow he would have to think of some fresh way of listen to the news in the meantim he had noth to look forward to but anoth restless disturb night becaus even when he escap the nightmar about cedric he had unsettl dream about long dark corridor all finish in dead end and lock door which he suppos had someth to do with the trap feel he had when he wa awak often the old scar on hi forehead prickl uncomfort but he did not fool himself that ron or hermion or siriu would find that veri interest ani more in the past hi scar hurt had warn that voldemort wa get stronger again but now that voldemort wa back they would probabl remind him that it regular irrit wa onli to be expect noth to worri about old news the injustic of it all well up insid him so that he want to yell with furi if it hadnt been for him nobodi would even have known voldemort wa back and hi reward wa to be stuck in littl whing for four solid week complet cut off from the magic world reduc to squat among die begonia so that he could hear about waterski budgerigar how could dumbledor have forgotten him so easili whi had ron and hermion got togeth without invit him along too how much longer wa he suppos to endur siriu tell him to sit tight and be a good boy or resist the temptat to write to the stupid daili prophet and point out that voldemort had return these furiou thought whirl around in harri head and hi insid writh with anger

bear wit and the veri last person he want alert to hi return the moment he got back wa dumbledor said lupin and you made sure dumbledor knew at onc how ha that help harri ask are you kid said bill incredul dumbledor wa the onli one youknowwho wa ever scare of thank to you dumbledor wa abl to recal the order of the phoenix about an hour after voldemort return said siriu so what the order been do said harri look around at them all work as hard as we can to make sure voldemort cant carri out hi plan said siriu how dyou know what hi plan are harri ask quickli dumbledor got a shrewd idea said lupin and dumbledor shrewd idea normal turn out to be accur so what doe dumbledor reckon he plan well firstli he want to build up hi armi again said siriu in the old day he had huge number at hi command witch and wizard hed bulli or bewitch into follow him hi faith death eater a great varieti of dark creatur you heard him plan to recruit the giant well theyll be just one of the group he after he certainli not go to tri and take on the ministri of magic with onli a dozen death eater so your tri to stop him get more follow were do our best said lupin how well the main thing is to tri and convinc as mani peopl as possibl that youknowwho realli ha return to put them on their guard said bill it prove tricki though whi becaus of the ministri attitud said tonk you saw corneliu fudg after youknow who came back harri well he hasnt shift hi posit at all he absolut refus to believ it happen but whi said harri desper whi he be so stupid if dumbledor ah well youv put your finger on the problem said mr weasley with a wri smile dumbledor fudg is frighten of him you see said tonk sadli frighten of dumbledor said harri incredul frighten of what he up to said mr weasley fudg think dumbledor plot to overthrow him he think dumbledor want to be minist for magic but dumbledor doesnt want of cours he doesnt said mr weasley he never want the minist job even though a lot of peopl want him to take it when millic bagnold retir fudg came to power instead but he never quit forgotten how much popular support dumbledor had even though dumbledor never appli for the job deep down fudg know dumbledor much clever than he is a much more power wizard and in the earli day of hi ministri he wa forev ask dumbledor for help and advic said lupin but it seem he becom fond of power and much more confid he love be minist for magic and he manag to convinc himself that he the clever one and dumbledor simpli stir up troubl for the sake of it how can he think that said harri angrili how can he think dumbledor would just make it all up that id make it all up becaus accept that voldemort back would mean troubl like the ministri hasnt had to cope with for nearli fourteen year said siriu bitterli fudg just cant bring himself to face it it so much more comfort to convinc himself dumbledor lie to destabil him you see the problem said lupin while the ministri insist there is noth to fear from voldemort it hard to convinc peopl he back especi as they realli dont want to believ it in the first place what more the ministri lean heavili on the daili prophet not to report ani of what theyr call dumbledor rumormong so most of the wizard commun are complet unawar ani thing happen and that make them easi target for the death eater if theyr use the imperiu curs but your tell peopl arent you said harri look around at mr weasley siriu bill mundungu lupin and tonk your let peopl know he back they all smile humorlessli well as everyon think im a mad massmurder and the ministri put a ten thousand galleon price on my head i can hardli stroll up the street and start hand out leaflet can i said siriu restlessli and im not a veri popular dinner guest with most of the commun said lupin it an occup hazard of be a werewolf tonk and arthur would lose their job at the ministri if they start shoot their mouth off said siriu and it veri import for us to have spi insid the ministri becaus you can bet voldemort will have them weve manag to convinc a coupl of peopl though said mr weasley tonk here for one she too young to have been in the order of the phoenix last time and have auror on our side is a huge advantag kingsley shacklebolt been a real asset too he in charg of the hunt for siriu so he been feed the ministri inform that siriu is in tibet but if none of you are put the news out that voldemort back harri began who said none of us are put the news out said siriu whi dyou think dumbledor in such troubl what dyou mean harri ask theyr tri to discredit him said lupin didnt you see the daili prophet last week they report that hed been vote out of the chairmanship of the intern confeder of wizard becaus he get old and lose hi grip but it not true he wa vote out by ministri wizard after he made a speech announc voldemort return theyv demot him from chief warlock on the wizengamot that the wizard high court and theyr talk about take away hi order of merlin first class too but dumbledor say he doesnt care what they do as long as they dont take him off the chocol frog card said bill grin it no laugh matter said mr weasley sharpli if he carri on defi the ministri like thi he could end up in azkaban and the last thing we want is to have dumbledor lock up while youknowwho know dumbledor out there and wise to what he up to he go to go cautious if dumbledor out of the way well youknowwho will have a clear field but if voldemort tri to recruit more death eater it bound to get out that he come back isnt it ask harri desper voldemort doesnt march up to peopl hous and bang on their front door harri said siriu he trick jinx and blackmail them he wellpract at oper in secret in ani case gather follow is onli one thing he interest in he got other plan too plan he can put

a few other member of the wizengamot laugh with her it could not have been plainer that not one of them wa realli amus if it is true that the dementor are take order onli from the ministri of magic

particular dementor may have been outsid ministri control there are no dementor outsid ministri control snap fudg who had turn brick red dumbledor inclin hi head in a littl bow then undoubtedli the

hiss hermion ye that from youknowwho finish nevil hannah abbott eye were as round as galleon and that not to mention said cho harri eye snap across to her she wa look at him smile hi stomach did anoth somersault all the task he had to get through in the triwizard tournament last year get past dragon and merpeopl and acromantula and thing there wa a murmur of impress agreement around the tabl harri insid were squirm he wa tri to arrang hi face so that he did not look too pleas with himself the fact that cho had just prais him made it much much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them look he said and everyon fell silent at onc i i dont want to sound like im tri to be modest or anyth but i had a lot of help with all that stuff not with the dragon you didnt said michael corner at onc that wa a serious cool bit of fli yeah well said harri feel it would be churlish to disagre and nobodi help you get rid of those dementor thi summer said susan bone no said harri no okay i know i did bit of it without help but the point im tri to make is are you tri to weasel out of show us ani of thi stuff said zacharia smith here an idea said ron loudli befor harri could speak whi dont you shut your mouth perhap the word weasel had affect ron particularli strongli in ani case he wa now look at zacharia as though he would like noth better than to thump him zacharia flush well weve all turn up to learn from him and now he tell us he cant realli do ani of it he said that not what he said snarl fred would you like us to clean out your ear for you enquir georg pull a long and lethal look metal instrument from insid one of the zonko bag or ani part of your bodi realli were not fussi where we stick thi said fred ye well said hermion hastili move on the point is are we agre we want to take lesson from harri there wa a murmur of gener agreement zacharia fold hi arm and said noth though perhap thi wa becaus he wa too busi keep an eye on the instrument in fred hand right said hermion look reliev that someth had at last been settl well then the next question is how often we do it i realli dont think there ani point in meet less than onc a week hang on said angelina we need to make sure thi doesnt clash with our quidditch practic no said cho nor with our nor our ad zacharia smith im sure we can find a night that suit everyon aid hermion slightli impati but you know thi is rather import were talk about learn to defend ourselv against vvoldemort death eater well said bark erni macmillan who harri had been expect to speak long befor thi person i think thi is realli import possibl more import than anyth els well do thi year even with our owl come up he look around impress as though wait for peopl to cri sure not when nobodi spoke he went on i person am at a loss to see whi the ministri ha foist such a useless teacher on us at thi critic period obvious they are in denial about the return of youknow who but to give us a teacher who is tri to activ prevent us from use defens spell we think the reason umbridg doesnt want us train in defens against the dark art said hermion is that she got some some mad idea that dumbledor could use the student in the school as a kind of privat armi she think hed mobil us against the ministri nearli everybodi look stun at thi news everybodi except luna lovegood who pipe up well that make sens after all corneliu fudg ha got hi own privat armi what said harri complet thrown by thi unexpect piec of inform ye he got an armi of heliopath said luna so lemnli no he hasnt snap hermion ye he ha said luna what are heliopath ask nevil look blank theyr spirit of fire said luna her protuber eye widen so that she look madder than ever great tall flame creatur that gallop across the ground burn everyth in front of they dont exist nevil said hermion tartli oh ye they do said luna angrili im sorri but where the proof of that snap hermion there are plenti of eyewit account just becaus your so narrowmind you need to have everyth shove under your nose befor you hem hem said ginni in such a good imit of professor umbridg that sever peopl look around in alarm and then laugh werent we tri to decid how often were go to meet and have defens lesson ye said hermion at onc ye we were your right ginni well onc a week sound cool said lee jordan as long as began angelina ye ye we know about the quidditch said hermion in a tens voic well the other thing to decid is where were go to meet thi wa rather more difficult the whole group fell silent librari suggest kati bell after a few moment i cant see madam pinc be too chuf with us do jinx in the librari said harri mayb an unus classroom said dean yeah said ron mcgonagal might let us have her she did when harri wa practic for the triwizard but harri wa pretti certain that mcgonagal would not be so accommod thi time for all that hermion had said about studi and homework group be allow he had the distinct feel that thi one might be consid a lot more rebelli right well well tri to find somewher said hermion well send a messag round to everybodi when weve got a time and a place for the first meet she rummag in her bag and produc parchment and a quill then hesit rather as though she wa steel herself to say someth i i think everybodi should write their name down just so we know who wa here but i also think she took a deep breath that we all ought to agre not to shout about what were do so if you sign your agre not to tell umbridg or anybodi els what were up to fred reach out for the parchment and cheer wrote hi signatur but harri notic at onc that sever peopl look less than happi at the prospect of put their name on the list er said zacharia slowli not take the parchment that georg wa tri to pass to him well im sure erni will tell me when the meet is but erni wa look rather hesit about sign too hermion rais her eyebrow at him i well we are prefect erni burst out and if thi list wa found well i mean to say you said yourself if umbridg find out you just said thi group wa the most import thing youd do thi year harri remind him i ye said erni ye i do believ that it s just erni do you realli think id leav that list lie

befor ad her own name when the last person zacharia had sign hermion took the parchment back and slip it care into her bag there wa an odd feel in the group now it wa as though they had just sign some

final it wa just her harri and ron who were left yeah it wa said ron enthusiast as they slip out of the door and watch it melt back into stone behind them did you see me disarm hermion harri onli onc said hermion stung i got you load more than you got me i did not onli get you onc i got you at least three time well if your count the one where you trip over your own feet and knock the wand out of my hand they argu all the way back to the common room but harri wa not listen to them he had one eye on the maraud map but he wa also think of cho say he made her nervou chapter nineteen the lion and the serpent harri felt as though he were carri some kind of talisman insid hi chest over the follow two week a glow secret that support him through umbridg class and even made it possibl for him to smile blandli as he look into her horribl bulg eye he and the da were resist her under her veri nose do the veri thing she and the ministri most fear and whenev he wa suppos to be read wilbert slinkhard book dure her lesson he dwell instead on satisfi memori of their most recent meet rememb how nevil had success disarm hermion how colin creevey had master the impedi jinx after three meet hard effort how parvati patil had produc such a good reductor curs that she had reduc the tabl carri all the sneakoscop to dust he wa find it almost imposs to fix a regular night of the week for the da meet as they had to accommod three separ team quidditch practic which were often rearrang due to bad weather condit but harri wa not sorri about thi he had a feel that it wa probabl better to keep the time of their meet unpredict if anyon wa watch them it would be hard to make out a pattern hermion soon devis a veri clever method of commun the time and date of the next meet to all the member in case they need to chang it at short notic becaus it would look suspici if peopl from differ hous were seen cross the great hall to talk to each other too often she gave each of the member of the da a fake galleon ron becam veri excit when he first saw the basket and wa convinc she wa actual give out gold you see the numer around the edg of the coin hermion said hold one up for examin at the end of their fourth meet the coin gleam fat and yellow in the light from the torch on real galleon that just a serial number refer to the goblin who cast the coin on these fake coin though the number will chang to reflect the time and date of the next meet the coin will grow hot when the date chang so if your carri them in a pocket youll be abl to feel them we take one each and when harri set the date of the next meet hell chang the number on hi coin and becaus ive put a protean charm on them theyll all chang to mimic hi a blank silenc greet hermion word she look around at all the face upturn to her rather disconcert well i thought it wa a good idea she said uncertainli i mean even if umbridg ask us to turn out our pocket there noth fishi about carri a galleon is there but well if you dont want to use them you can do a protean charm said terri boot ye said hermion but that that newt standard that is he said weakli oh said hermion tri to look modest oh well ye i suppos it is how come your not in ravenclaw he demand stare at hermion with someth close to wonder with brain like your well the sort hat did serious consid put me in ravenclaw dure my sort said hermion brightli but it decid on gryffindor in the end so doe that mean were use the galleon there wa a murmur of assent and everybodi move forward to collect one from the basket harri look sideway at hermion you know what these remind me of no what that the death eater scar voldemort touch one of them and all their scar burn and they know theyv got to join him well ye said hermion quietli that is where i got the idea but youll notic i decid to engrav the date on bit of metal rather than on our member skin yeah i prefer your way said harri grin as he slip hi galleon into hi pocket i suppos the onli danger with these is that we might accident spend them fat chanc said ron who wa examin hi own fake galleon with a slightli mourn air i havent got ani real galleon to confus it with as the first quidditch match of the season gryffindor versu slytherin drew nearer their da meet were put on hold becaus angelina insist on almost daili practic the fact that the quidditch cup had not been held for so long ad consider to the interest and excit surround the forthcom game the ravenclaw and hufflepuff were take a live interest in the outcom for they of cours would be play both team over the come year and the head of hous of the compet team though they attempt to disguis it under a decent pretenc of sportsmanship were determin to see their own side victori harri realiz how much professor mcgonagal care about beat slytherin when she abstain from give them homework in the week lead up to the match i think youv got enough to be get on with at the moment she said loftili nobodi could quit believ their ear until she look directli at harri and ron and said grimli ive becom accustom to see the quidditch cup in my studi boy and i realli dont want to have to hand it over to professor snape so use the extra time to practic wont you snape wa no less obvious partisan he had book the quidditch pitch for slytherin practic so often that the gryffindor had difficulti get on it to play he wa also turn a deaf ear to the mani report of slytherin attempt to hex gryffindor player in the corridor when alicia spinnet turn up in the hospit wing with her eyebrow grow so thick and fast they obscur her vision and obstruct her mouth snape insist that she must have attempt a hairthicken charm on herself and refus to listen to the fourteen eyewit who insist they had seen the slytherin keeper mile bletchley hit her from behind with a jinx while she work in the librari harri felt optimist about gryffindor chanc they had after all never lost to malfoy team admittedli ron wa still not perform to wood standard but he wa work extrem hard to improv hi greatest weak wa a tendenc to lose confid after hed made a blunder if he let in one goal he becam fluster and wa therefor like to miss more on the other hand harri had seen ron make some truli spectacular save when he wa on form dure one memor practic he had hung onehand from hi broom and kick the quaffl so hard away from the goal hoop that it soar the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end the rest of the team felt thi save compar favor with one made recent by barri ryan the irish intern keeper against poland top chaser ladislaw zamojski even fred had said that ron might yet make him and georg proud and that they were serious consid admit he wa relat to them someth they assur him they had been tri to deni for four year the onli thing realli worri harri wa how much ron wa allow the tactic of the slytherin team to upset him befor they even got on to the pitch harri of cours had endur their snide comment for over four year so whisper of hey potti i heard warrington sworn to knock you off your broom on saturday far from chill hi blood made him laugh warrington aim so pathet id be more worri if he wa aim for the person next to me he retort which made ron and hermion laugh and wipe the smirk off pansi parkinson face but ron had never endur a relentless campaign of insult jeer and intimid when slytherin some of them seventhyear and consider larger than he wa mutter as they pass in the corridor got your bed book in the hospit wing weasley he didnt laugh but turn a delic shade of green when draco malfoy imit ron drop the quaffl which he did whenev they came within sight of each other ron ear glow red and hi hand shook so badli that he wa like to drop whatev he wa hold at the time too octob

her offic he hurtl back upstair and arriv out of breath onli a few minut late sorri professor he pant as he close the door i forgot no matter potter she said briskli but as she spoke somebodi els snif from the corner harri look round professor umbridg wa sit there a clipboard on her knee a fussi littl piefril around her neck and a small horribl smug smile on her face sit down potter said professor mcgonagal ters her hand shook slightli as she shuffl the mani pamphlet litter her desk harri sat down with hi back to umbridg and did hi best to pretend he could not hear the scratch of her quill on her clipboard well potter thi meet is to talk over ani career idea you might have and to help you decid which subject you should continu into the sixth and seventh year said professor mcgonagal have you had ani thought about what you would like to do after you leav hogwart er said harri he wa find the scratch nois from behind him veri distract ye professor mcgonagal prompt harri well i thought of mayb be an auror harri mumbl youd need top grade for that said professor mcgonagal extract a small dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and open it they ask for a minimum of five newt and noth under exce expect grade i see then you would be requir to undergo a stringent seri of charact and aptitud test at the auror offic it a difficult career path potter they onli take the best in fact i dont think anybodi ha been taken on in the last three year at thi moment professor umbridg gave a veri tini cough as though she wa tri to see how quietli she could do it professor mcgonagal ignor her youll want to know which subject you ought to take i suppos she went on talk a littl louder than befor ye said harri defens against the dark art i suppos natur said professor mcgonagal crispli i would also advis professor umbridg gave anoth cough a littl more audibl thi time professor mcgonagal close her eye for a moment open them again and continu as though noth had happen i would also advis transfigur becaus auror frequent need to transfigur or untransfigur in their work and i ought to tell you now potter that i do not accept student into my newt class unless they have achiev exce expect or higher at ordinari wizard level id say your averag accept at the moment so youll need to put in some good hard work befor the exam to stand a chanc of continu then you ought to do charm alway use and potion ye potter potion she ad with the merest flicker of a smile poison and antidot are essenti studi for auror and i must tell you that professor snape absolut refus to take student who get anyth other than outstand in their owl so professor umbridg gave her most pronounc cough yet may i offer you a cough drop dolor professor mcgonagal ask curtli without look at professor umbridg oh no thank you veri much said umbridg with that simper laugh harri hate so much i just wonder whether i could make the teensiest interrupt minerva i daresay youll find you can said professor mcgonagal through tightli grit teeth i wa just wonder whether mr potter ha quit the tempera for an auror said professor umbridg sweetli were you said professor mcgonagal haughtili well potter she continu as though there had been no interrupt if you are seriou in thi ambit i would advis you to concentr hard on bring your transfigur and potion up to scratch i see professor flitwick ha grade you between accept and exce expect for the last two year so your charmwork seem satisfactori as for defens against the dark art your mark have been gener high professor lupin in particular thought you are you quit sure you wouldnt like a cough drop dolor oh no need thank you minerva simper professor umbridg who had just cough her loudest yet i wa just concern that you might not have harri most recent defens against the dark art mark in front of you im quit sure i slip in a note what thi thing said professor mcgonagal in a tone of revuls as she pull a sheet of pink parchment from between the leav of harri folder she glanc down it her eyebrow slightli rais then place it back into the folder without comment ye as i wa say potter professor lupin thought you show a pronounc aptitud for the subject and obvious for an auror did you not understand my note minerva ask professor umbridg in honey tone quit forget to cough of cours i understood it said professor mcgonagal her teeth clench so tightli the word came out a littl muffl well then i am confus im afraid i dont quit understand how you can give mr potter fals hope that fals hope repeat professor mcgonagal still refus to look round at professor umbridg he ha achiev high mark in all hi defens against the dark art test im terribl sorri to have to contradict you minerva but as you will see from my note harri ha been achiev veri poor result in hi class with me i should have made my mean plainer said professor mcgonagal turn at last to look umbridg directli in the eye he ha achiev high mark in all defens against the dark art test set by a compet teacher professor umbridg smile vanish as suddenli as a light bulb blow she sat back in her chair turn a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbl veri fast inde her bulg eye roll from side to side professor mcgonagal turn back to harri her thin nostril flare her eye burn ani question potter ye said harri what sort of charact and aptitud test do the ministri do on you if you get enough newt well youll need to demonstr the abil to react well to pressur and so forth said professor mcgonagal persever and dedic becaus auror train take a further three year not to mention veri high skill in practic defens it will mean a lot more studi even after youv left school so unless your prepar to i think youll also find said umbridg her voic veri cold now that the ministri look into the record of those appli to be auror their crimin record unless your prepar to take even more exam after hogwart you should realli look at anoth which mean that thi boy ha as much chanc of becom an auror as dumbledor ha of ever return to thi school a veri good chanc then said professor mcgonagal potter ha a crimin record said umbridg loudli potter ha been clear of all charg said mcgonagal even more loudli professor umbridg stood up she wa so short that thi did not make a great deal of differ but her fussi simper demeanour had given place to a hard furi that made her broad flabbi face look oddli sinist potter ha no chanc whatsoev of becom an auror professor mcgonagal got to her feet too and in her case thi wa a much more impress move she tower over professor umbridg potter she said in ring tone i will assist you to becom an auror if it is the last thing i do if i have to coach you nightli i will make sure you achiev the requir result the minist for magic will never employ harri potter

eyebrow and beard upon the line goug deepli into hi face i guess fifteen year ago said dumbledor when i saw the scar on your forehead what it might mean i guess that it might be the sign of a connect forg between you and voldemort youv told me thi befor professor said harri bluntli he did not care about be rude he did not care about anyth veri much ani more ye said dumbledor apologet ye but you see it is necessari to start with your scar for it becam appar shortli after you rejoin the magic world that i wa correct and that your scar wa give you warn when voldemort wa close to you or els feel power emot i know said harri wearili and thi abil of your to detect voldemort presenc even when he is disguis and to know what he is feel when hi emot are rous ha becom more and more pronounc sinc voldemort return to hi own bodi and hi full power harri did not bother to nod he knew all of thi alreadi more recent said dumbledor i becam concern that voldemort might realiz that thi connect between you exist sure enough there came a time when you enter so far into hi mind and thought that he sens your presenc i am speak of cours of the night when you wit the attack on mr weasley yeah snape told me harri mutter professor snape harri dumbledor correct him quietli but did you not wonder whi it wa not i who explain thi to you whi i did not teach you occlum whi i had not so much as look at you for month harri look up he could see now that dumbledor look sad and tire yeah harri mumbl yeah i wonder you see dumbledor continu i believ it could not be long befor voldemort attempt to forc hi way into your mind to manipul and misdirect your thought and i wa not eager to give him more incent to do so i wa sure that if he realiz that our relationship wa or had ever been closer than that of headmast and pupil he would seiz hi chanc to use you as a mean to spi on me i fear the use to which he would put you the possibl that he might tri and possess you harri i believ i wa right to think that voldemort would have made use of you in such a way on those rare occas when we had close contact i thought i saw a shadow of him stir behind your eye harri rememb the feel that a dormant snake had risen in him readi to strike in those moment when he and dumbledor had made eyecontact voldemort aim in possess you as he demonstr tonight would not have been my destruct it would have been your he hope when he possess you briefli a short while ago that i would sacrific you in the hope of kill him so you see i have been tri in distanc myself from you to protect you harri an old man mistak he sigh deepli harri wa let the word wash over him he would have been so interest to know all thi a few month ago but now it wa meaningless compar to the gape chasm insid him that wa the loss of siriu none of it matter siriu told me you felt voldemort awak insid you the veri night that you had the vision of arthur weasley attack i knew at onc that my worst fear were correct voldemort had realiz he could use you in an attempt to arm you against voldemort assault on your mind i arrang occlum lesson with professor snape he paus harri watch the sunlight which wa slide slowli across the polish surfac of dumbledor desk illumin a silver ink pot and a handsom scarlet quill harri could tell that the portrait all around them were awak and listen raptli to dumbledor explan he could hear the occasion rustl of robe the slight clear of a throat phinea nigellu had still not return professor snape discov dumbledor resum that you had been dream about the door to the depart of mysteri for month voldemort of cours had been obsess with the possibl of hear the propheci ever sinc he regain hi bodi and as he dwell on the door so did you though you did not know what it meant and then you saw rockwood who work in the depart of mysteri befor hi arrest tell voldemort what we had known all along that the propheci held in the ministri of magic are heavili protect onli the peopl to whom they refer can lift them from the shelv without suffer mad in thi case either voldemort himself would have to enter the ministri of magic and risk reveal himself at last or els you would have to take it for him it becam a matter of even greater urgenc that you should master occlum but i didnt mutter harri he said it aloud to tri and eas the dead weight of guilt insid him a confess must sure reliev some of the terribl pressur squeez hi heart i didnt practic i didnt bother i couldv stop myself have those dream hermion kept tell me to do it if i had hed never have been abl to show me where to go and siriu wouldnt siriu wouldnt someth wa erupt insid harri head a need to justifi himself to explain i tri to check hed realli taken siriu i went to umbridg offic i spoke to kreacher in the fire and he said siriu wasnt there he said hed gone kreacher lie said dumbledor calmli you are not hi master he could lie to you without even need to punish himself kreacher intend you to go to the ministri of magic he he sent me on purpos oh ye kreacher i am afraid ha been serv more than one master for month how said harri blankli he hasnt been out of grimmauld place for year kreacher seiz hi opportun shortli befor christma said dumbledor when siriu appar shout at him to get out he took siriu at hi word and interpret thi as an order to leav the hous he went to the onli black famili member for whom he had ani respect left black cousin narcissa sister of bellatrix and wife of luciu malfoy how do you know all thi harri said hi heart wa beat veri fast he felt sick he rememb worri about kreacher odd absenc over christma rememb him turn up again in the attic kreacher told me last night said dumbledor you see when you gave professor snape that cryptic warn he realiz that you had had a vision of siriu trap in the bowel of the depart of mysteri he like you attempt to contact siriu at onc i should explain that member of the order of the phoenix have more reliabl method of commun than the fire in dolor umbridg offic professor snape found that siriu wa aliv and safe in grimmauld place when howev you did not return from your trip into the forest with dolor umbridg professor snape grew worri that you still believ siriu to be a captiv of lord voldemort he alert certain order member at onc dumbledor heav a great sigh and continu alastor moodi nymphadora tonk kingsley shacklebolt and remu lupin were at headquart when he made contact all agre to go to your aid at onc professor snape request that siriu remain behind as he need somebodi to remain at headquart to tell me what had happen for i wa due there at ani moment in the meantim he professor snape intend to search the forest for you but siriu did not wish to remain behind while the other went to search for you he deleg to kreacher the task of tell me what had happen and so it wa that when i arriv in grimmauld place shortli after they had all left for the ministri it wa the elf who told me laugh fit to burst where siriu had gone he wa laugh said harri in a hollow voic oh ye said dumbledor you see kreacher wa not abl to betray us total he is not secret keeper for the order he could not give the malfoy our whereabout or tell them ani of the order confidenti plan that he had been forbidden to reveal he wa bound by the enchant of hi kind which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from hi master siriu but he gave narcissa inform of the sort that is veri valuabl to voldemort yet must have seem much too trivial for siriu to think of ban him from repeat it like what said harri like the fact that the person siriu care most about in the world wa you said dumbledor quietli like the fact that you were come to regard siriu as a mixtur of father and brother voldemort knew alreadi of cours that siriu wa in the order and that you knew where he wa but kreacher inform made him realiz that the one person for whom you would go to ani length to rescu wa siriu black harri lip were cold and numb so when i ask kreacher if siriu wa there last night the malfoy undoubtedli on voldemort instruct had told him he must find a way of keep siriu out of the way onc you had seen the vision of siriu be tortur then if you decid to check whether siriu wa at home or not kreacher would be abl to pretend he wa not kreacher injur buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday and at the moment when you made your appear in the fire siriu wa upstair tend to him there seem to be veri littl air in harri lung hi breath wa quick and shallow and kreacher told you all thi and laugh he croak he did not wish to tell me said dumbledor but i am a suffici accomplish legilimen myself to know when i am be lie to and i persuad him to tell me the full stori befor i left for the depart of mysteri and whisper harri hi hand curl in cold fist on hi knee and hermion kept tell us to be nice to him she wa quit right harri said dumbledor i warn siriu when we adopt twelv grimmauld place as our headquart that kreacher must be treat with kind and respect i also told him that kreacher could be danger to us i do not think sinu took me veri serious or that he ever saw kreacher as a be with feel as acut as a human dont you blame dont you talk about siriu like harri breath wa constrict he could not get the word out properli but the rage that had subsid briefli flare in him again he would not let dumbledor critic siriu kreacher a lie foul he deserv kreacher is what he ha been made by wizard harri said dumbledor ye he is to be piti hi exist ha been as miser as your friend dobbi he wa forc to do siriuss bid becaus siriu wa the last of the famili to which he wa enslav but he felt no true loyalti to him and whatev kreacher fault it must be admit that siriu did noth to make kreacher lot easier dont talk about siriu like that harri yell he wa on hi feet again furiou readi to fli at dumbledor who had plainli not understood siriu at all how brave he wa how much he had suffer what about snape harri spat your not talk about him are you when i told him voldemort had siriu he just sneer at me as usual harri you know professor snape had no choic but to pretend not to take you serious in front of dolor umbridg said dumbledor steadili but as i have explain he inform the order as soon as possibl about what you had said it wa he who deduc where you had gone when you did not return from the forest it wa he too who gave professor umbridg fake veritaserum when she wa attempt to forc you to tell her siriuss whereabout harri disregard thi he felt a savag pleasur in blame snape it seem to be eas hi own sens of dread

servant unworthi of much interest or notic indiffer and neglect often do much more damag than outright dislik the fountain we destroy tonight told a lie we wizard have mistreat and abus our fellow for too long and we are now reap our reward so siriu deserv what he got did he harri yell i did not say that nor will you ever hear me say it dumbledor repli quietli siriu wa not a cruel man he wa kind to

should have told you five year ago harri pleas sit down i am go to tell you everyth i ask onli a littl patienc you will have your chanc to rage at me to do whatev you like when i have finish i will not stop you harri glare at him for a moment then flung himself back into the chair opposit dumbledor and wait dumbledor stare for a moment at the sunlit ground outsid the window then look back at harri and said five year ago you arriv at hogwart harri safe and whole as i had plan and intend well not quit whole you had suffer i knew you would when i left you on your aunt and uncl doorstep i knew i wa condemn you to ten dark and difficult year he paus harri said noth you might ask and with good reason whi it had to be so whi could some wizard famili not have taken you in mani would have done so more than gladli would have been honor and delight to rais you as a son my answer is that my prioriti wa to keep you aliv you were in more danger than perhap anyon but i realiz voldemort had been vanquish hour befor but hi support and mani of them are almost as terribl as he were still at larg angri desper and violent and i had to make my decis too with regard to the year ahead did i believ that voldemort wa gone for ever no i knew not whether it would be ten twenti or fifti year befor he return but i wa sure he would do so and i wa sure too know him as i have done that he would not rest until he kill you i knew that voldemort knowledg of magic is perhap more extens than ani wizard aliv i knew that even my most complex and power protect spell and charm were unlik to be invinc if he ever return to full power but i knew too where voldemort wa weak and so i made my decis you would be protect by an ancient magic of which he know which he despis and which he ha alway therefor underestim to hi cost i am speak of cours of the fact that your mother die to save you she gave you a linger protect he never expect a protect that flow in your vein to thi day i put my trust therefor in your mother blood i deliv you to her sister her onli remain rel she doesnt love me said harri at onc she doesnt give a damn but she took you dumbledor cut across him she may have taken you grudgingli furious unwillingli bitterli yet still she took you and in do so she seal the charm i place upon you your mother sacrific made the bond of blood the strongest shield i could give you i still dont while you can still call home the place where your mother blood dwell there you can not be touch or harm by voldemort he shed her blood but it live on in you and her sister her blood becam your refug you need return there onli onc a year but as long as you can still call it home while you are there he can not hurt you your aunt know thi i explain what i had done in the letter i left with you on her doorstep she know that allow you houseroom may well have kept you aliv for the past fifteen year wait said harri wait a moment he sat up straighter in hi chair stare at dumbledor you sent that howler you told her to rememb it wa your voic i thought said dumbledor inclin hi head slightli that she might need remind of the pact she had seal by take you i suspect the dementor attack might have awoken her to the danger of have you as a surrog son it did said harri quietli well my uncl more than her he want to chuck me out but after the howler came she she said i had to stay he stare at the floor for a moment then said but what thi got to do with he could not say siriuss name five year ago then continu dumbledor as though he had not paus in hi stori you arriv at hogwart neither as happi nor as wellnourish as i would have like perhap yet aliv and healthi you were not a pamper littl princ but as normal a boy as i could have hope under the circumst thu far my plan wa work well and then well you will rememb the event of your first year at hogwart quit as clearli as i do you rose magnific to the challeng that face you and sooner much sooner than i had anticip you found yourself face to face with voldemort you surviv again you did more you delay hi return to full power and strength you fought a man fight i wa prouder of you than i can say yet there wa a flaw in thi wonder plan of mine said dumbledor an obviou flaw that i knew even then might be the undo of it all and yet know how import it wa that my plan should succeed i told myself that i would not permit thi flaw to ruin it i alon could prevent thi so i alon must be strong and here wa my first test as you lay in the hospit wing weak from your struggl with voldemort i dont understand what your say said harri dont you rememb ask me as you lay in the hospit wing whi voldemort had tri to kill you when you were a babi harri nod ought i to have told you then harri stare into the blue eye and said noth but hi heart wa race again you do not see the flaw in the plan yet no perhap not well as you know i decid not to answer you eleven i told myself wa much too young to know i had never intend to tell you when you were eleven the knowledg would be too much at such a young age i should have recogn the danger sign then i should have ask myself whi i did not feel more disturb that you had alreadi ask me the question to which i knew one day i must give a terribl answer i should have recogn that i wa too happi to think that i did not have to do it on that particular day you were too young much too young and so we enter your second year at hogwart and onc again you met challeng even grown wizard have never face onc again you acquit yourself beyond my wildest dream you did not ask me again howev whi voldemort had left that mark on you we discuss your scar oh ye we came veri veri close to the subject whi did i not tell you everyth well it seem to me that twelv wa after all hardli better than eleven to receiv such inform i allow you to leav my presenc bloodstain exhaust but exhilar and if i felt a twing of uneas that i ought perhap to have told you then it wa swiftli silenc you were still so young you see and i could not find it in myself to spoil that night of triumph do you see harri do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now i had fallen into the trap i had foreseen that i had told myself i could avoid that i must avoid i dont i care about you too much said dumbledor simpli i care more for your happi than your know the truth more for your peac of mind than my plan more for your life than the live that might be lost if the plan fail in other word i act exactli as voldemort expect we fool who love to act is there a defens i defi anyon who ha watch you as i have and i have watch you more close than you can have imagin not to want to save you more pain than you had alreadi suffer what did i care if number of nameless and faceless peopl and creatur were slaughter in the vagu futur if in the here and now you were aliv and well and happi i never dream that i would have such a person on my hand we enter your third year i watch from afar as you struggl to repel dementor as you found siriu learn what he wa and rescu him wa i to tell you then at the moment when you had triumphantli snatch your godfath from the jaw of the ministri but now at the age of thirteen my excus were run out young you might be but you had prove you were except my conscienc wa uneasi harri i knew the time must come soon but you came out of the maze last year have watch cedric diggori die have escap death so narrowli yourself and i did not tell you though i knew now voldemort had return i must do it soon and now tonight i know you have long been readi for the knowledg i have kept from you for so long becaus you have prove that i should have place the burden upon you befor thi my onli defens is thi i have watch you struggl under more burden than ani student who as ever pass through thi school and i could not bring myself to add anoth the greatest one of all harri wait but dumbledor did not speak i still dont understand voldemort tri to kill you when you were a child becaus of a propheci made shortli befor your birth he knew the propheci had been made though he did not know it full content he set out to kill you when you were still a babi believ he wa fulfil the term of the propheci he discov to hi cost that he wa mistaken when the curs intend to kill you backfir and so sinc hi return to hi bodi and particularli sinc your extraordinari escap from him last year he ha been determin to hear that propheci in it entireti thi is the weapon he ha been seek so assidu sinc hi return the knowledg of how to destroy you the sun had risen fulli now dumbledor offic wa bath in it the glass case in which the sword of godric gryffindor resid gleam white and opaqu the fragment of the instrument harri had thrown to the floor glisten like raindrop and behind him the babi fawk made soft chirrup nois in hi nest of ash the propheci smash harri said blankli i wa pull nevil up those bench in the the room where the archway wa and i rip hi robe and it fell the thing that smash wa mere the record of the propheci kept by the depart of mysteri but the propheci wa made to somebodi and that person ha the mean of recal it perfectli who heard it ask harri though he thought he knew the answer alreadi i did said dumbledor on a cold wet night sixteen year ago in a room abov the bar at the hog head inn i had gone there to see an applic for the post of divin teacher though it wa against my inclin to allow the subject of divin to continu at all the applic howev wa the greatgreatgranddaught of a veri famou veri gift seer and i thought it common polit to meet her i wa disappoint it seem to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself i told her courteous i hope that i did not think she would be suitabl for the post i turn to leav dumbledor got to hi feet and walk past harri to the black cabinet that stood besid fawkess perch he bent down slid back a catch and took from insid it the shallow stone basin carv with rune around the edg in which harri had seen hi father torment snape dumbledor walk back to the desk place the pensiev upon it and rais hi wand to hi own templ from it he withdrew silveri gossamerfin strand of thought cling to the wand and deposit them into the basin he sat back down behind hi desk and watch hi thought swirl and drift insid the pensiev for a moment then with a sigh he rais hi wand and prod the silveri substanc with it tip a figur rose out of it drape in shawl her eye magnifi to enorm size behind her glass and she revolv slowli her feet in the basin but when sibyl trelawney spoke it wa not in her usual ether mystic voic but in the harsh hoars tone harri had heard her use onc befor the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approach born to those who have thrice defi him born as the seventh month die and the dark lord will mark him as hi equal but he will have power the dark lord know not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other surviv the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month die the slowli revolv professor trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanish the silenc within the offic wa absolut neither dumbledor nor harri nor ani of the portrait made a sound even fawk had fallen silent professor dumbledor harri said veri quietli for dumbledor still stare at the pensiev seem complet lost in thought it did that mean what did that mean it meant said dumbledor that the person who ha the onli chanc of conquer lord voldemort for good wa born at the end of juli nearli sixteen year ago thi boy would be born to parent who had alreadi defi voldemort three time harri felt as though someth wa close in on him hi breath seem difficult again it mean me dumbledor survey him for a moment through hi glass the odd thing harri he said softli is that it may not have meant you at all sibyl propheci could have appli to two wizard boy both born at the end of juli that year both of whom had parent in the order of the phoenix both set of parent have narrowli escap voldemort three time one of cours wa you the other wa nevil longbottom but then but then whi wa it my name on the propheci and not nevil the offici record wa relabel after voldemort attack on you as a child said dumbledor it seem plain to the keeper of the hall of propheci that voldemort could onli have tri to kill you becaus he knew you to be the one to whom sibyl wa refer then it might not be me said harri i am afraid said dumbledor slowli look as though everi word cost him a great effort that there is no doubt that it is you but you said nevil wa born at the end of juli too and hi mum and dad you are forget the next part of the propheci the final identifi featur of the boy who could vanquish voldemort voldemort himself would mark him as hi equal and so he did harri he chose you not nevil he gave you the scar that ha prove both bless and curs but he might have chosen wrong said harri he might have mark the wrong person he chose the boy he thought most like to be a danger to him said dumbledor and notic thi harri he chose not the pureblood which accord to hi creed is the onli kind of wizard worth be or know but the halfblood like himself he saw himself in you befor he had ever seen you and in mark you with that scar he did not kill you as he intend but gave you power and a futur which have fit you to escap him not onc but four time so far someth that neither your parent nor nevil parent ever achiev whi did he do it then said harri who felt numb and cold whi did he tri and kill me as a babi he should have wait to see whether nevil or i look more danger when we were older and tri to kill whoever it wa then that might inde have been the more practic cours said dumbledor except that voldemort inform about the propheci wa incomplet the hog head inn which sibyl chose for it cheap ha long attract shall we say a more interest clientel than the three broomstick as you and your friend found out to your cost and i to mine that night it is a place where it is never safe to assum you are not be overheard of cours i had not dream when i set out to meet sibyl trelawney that i would hear anyth worth overhear my our one stroke of good fortun wa that the eavesdropp wa detect onli a short way into the propheci and thrown from the build so he onli heard he heard onli the begin the part foretel the birth of a boy in juli to parent who had thrice defi voldemort consequ he could not warn hi master that to attack you would be to risk transfer power to you and mark you as hi equal so voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attack you that it might be wise to wait to learn more he did not know that you would have power the dark lord know not but i dont said harri in a strangl voic i havent ani power he hasnt got i couldnt fight the way he did tonight i cant possess peopl or or kill them there is a room in the depart of mysteri interrupt dumbledor that is kept lock at all time it contain a forc that is at onc more wonder and more terribl than death than human intellig than the forc of natur it is also perhap the most mysteri of the mani subject for studi that resid there it is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantiti and which voldemort ha not at all that power took you to save siriu tonight that power also save you from possess by voldemort becaus he could not bear to resid in a bodi so full of the forc he detest in the end it matter not that you could not close your mind it wa your heart that save you harri close hi eye if he had not gone to save siriu siriu would not have die more to stave off the moment when he would have to think of siriu again harri ask without care much about the answer the end of the propheci it wa someth about neither can live while the other surviv said dumbledor so said harri dredg up the word from what felt like a deep well of despair insid him so doe that mean that that one of us ha got to kill the other one in the end ye said dumbledor for a long time neither of them spoke somewher far beyond the offic wall harri could hear the sound of voic student head down to the great hall for an earli breakfast perhap it seem imposs that there could be peopl in the world who still desir food who laugh who neither knew nor care that siriu black wa gone forev siriu seem a million mile away alreadi even now a part of harri still believ that if he had onli pull back that veil he would have found siriu look back at him greet him perhap with hi laugh like a bark i feel i owe you anoth explan harri said dumbledor hesitantli you may perhap have wonder whi i never chose you as a prefect i must confess that i rather thought you had enough respons to be go on with harri look up at him and saw a tear trickl down dumbledor face into hi long silver beard chapter thirtyeight the second war begin hewhomustnotbenam return in a brief statement on friday night minist for magic corneliu fudg confirm that hewhomustnotbenam ha return
