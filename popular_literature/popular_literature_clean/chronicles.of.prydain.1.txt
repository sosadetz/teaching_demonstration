if thi one follow the same direct as the one abov it doesnt have half as mani galleri come off it and besid it a lot more comfort eilonwi took the glow sphere from taran hand and step forward into the new passageway still doubt taran follow chapter the barrow as eilonwi had said the passageway wa more comfort for they could walk side by side without crouch and scuttl like rabbit in a warren unlik those of the upper galleri the wall were line with huge flat stone the ceil wa form of even larger stone whose weight wa support by upright slab set at interv along the squar corridor the air too smell slightli better musti as if it had lain unstir for age but without the choke close of the tunnel none of thi comfort taran greatli eilonwi herself admit she had never explor the passag her blith confid did not convinc him she had the slightest notion of where she wa go nevertheless the girl hurri along her sandal tap and echo the golden light of the baubl cast it ray through shadow that hung like cobweb they pass a few side galleri which eilonwi ignor well go straight to the end of thi one she announc there bound to be someth there taran had begun wish himself back in the chamber we shouldnt have come thi far he said with a frown we should have stay and found some way to climb out now you dont even know how long it will be befor thi passag stop we might go on tramp for day someth els troubl him after all their progress it seem the passageway should now follow an upward direct the tunnel suppos to bring us out about ground taran said but we havent stop go down we arent come out at all were onli go deeper and deeper eilonwi paid no attent to hi remark but she wa soon oblig to within anoth few pace the corridor stop abruptli seal by a wall of boulder that is what i fear cri taran dismay we have gone to the end of your tunnel that you knew so much about and thi is what we find now we can onli go back were lost all our time and were no better off than when we start he turn away while the girl stood look curious at the barrier i cant understand said eilonwi whi anyon would go to the troubl of build a tunnel and not have it go ani place it must have been a terribl amount of work for whoever it wa to dig it all and set in the rock whi do you suppos i dont know and i wish youd stop wonder about thing that cant make ani differ to us im go back taran said i dont know how im go to climb onto that shelf but i can certainli do it a lot more easili than dig through a wall well said eilonwi it is veri strang and all im sure i dont know where we are i knew wed end up be lost i could have told you that i didnt say i wa lost the girl protest i onli said i didnt know where i wa there a big differ when your lost you realli dont know where you are when you just dont

nevertheless approach the next branch galleri he slow hi step and peer briefli into the gloom go ahead eilonwi urg let tri thi one it seem as good as ani hush taran bent hi head and listen intent from a distanc came a faint whisper and rustl there someth well by all mean let find out what said eilonwi prod taran in the back go ahead will you taran took a few cautiou step the passag here wa lower and seem to slope still further down with eilonwi besid him he continu gingerli set each foot care rememb the sudden sicken fall that had brought him there in the first place the whisper becam a high keen a wail of torment it wa as though voic had been spun out like thread twist taut readi to snap an ici current wove through the air carri along with it hollow sigh and a swell of dull mutter there were other sound too rasp and shriek like sword point drag over stone taran felt hi hand trembl he hesit a moment and gestur for eilonwi to stay behind him give me the light he whisper and wait for me here do you think it ghost eilonwi ask i dont have ani bean to spit at them and that about the onli thing that will realli do for a ghost but you know i dont think it ghost at all ive never heard one though i suppos they could sound like that if they want to but i dont see whi they should bother no i think it wind make all those nois wind how could there be wait taran said you may be right at that there might be an open close hi ear to the horrifi sound and prefer to think of them as draught of air rather than spectral voic taran quicken hi pace eilonwi pay no attent to hi order to wait strode along with him they soon arriv at the end of the passag onc more fallen stone block their way but thi time there wa a narrow jag gap from it the wail grew louder and taran felt a cold ribbon of air on hi face he thrust the light into the open but even the golden ray could not pierc the curtain of shadow taran slid cautious past the barrier eilonwi follow they enter a lowceiling chamber and as they did the light flicker under the weight of the dark at first taran could make out onli indistinct shape touch with a feebl green glow the voic scream in trembl rage despit the chill wind taran forehead wa clammi he rais the light and took anoth step forward the shape grew clearer now he distinguish outlin of shield hang from the wall and pile of sword and spear hi foot struck someth he bent to look and sprang back again stifl a cri it wa the wither corps of a man a warrior fulli arm anoth lay besid him and anoth in a circl of ancient dead guard a high stone slab on which a shadowi figur lay at full length eilonwi paid scant attent to the warrior have found someth more interest to her im sure achren hasnt ani idea all thi is here she whisper point to heap of otterskin robe and great earthen jar overflow with jewel weapon glisten amid stack of helmet woven basket held brooch collarpiec and chain shed have haul it out long ago she love jewelri you know though it doesnt becom her one bit

belt the claw hand still grasp the jewel hilt of a sword as if readi to unsheath it taran recoil in fear and horror the skull seem to grimac in defianc dare a stranger to despoil the royal treasur as taran turn a gust of wind caught at hi face i think there is a passag he call there in the far wall he ran in the direct of the ghostli cri close to the ground a tunnel open he could smell fresh air and hi lung drank deepli hurri he urg taran snatch a sword from a warrior boni hand and scrambl into the tunnel the tunnel wa the narrowest they had encount flat on hi belli taran squeez and fought hi way over the loos stone behind him he heard eilonwi gasp and struggl then a new sound began a distant boom and throb the earth shudder as the pound increas suddenli the passageway convuls the hidden root of tree sprang up the ground split beneath taran heav and crumbl in anoth instant he wa flung out at the bottom of a rocki slope a great crash resound deep within the hill spiral castl high abov

turf while taran recount hi search for hen wen and what gwydion had told him of the horn king and the rise of the cantrev gurgi have finish hi meal sidl over and squat on a hillock to listen there is no doubt in my mind taran went on the son of don must have news of the upris befor the horn king strike if he triumph arawn will have prydain by the throat i have seen with my own eye what that mean he felt ill at eas speak as if he himself were a war leader in a council hall but soon the word began to come easier perhap he thought becaus he wa speak for gwydion i see your plan fflewddur interrupt you shall keep on look for your pig and you want me to warn the warrior of don splendid i shall start off immedi and if the host of the horn king overtak me the bard slash and thrust at the air they shall know the valor of a fflam taran shook hi head no i shall journey to caer dathyl myself i do not question your valor he said to the bard but the danger is too great i ask no one els to face it in my stead when do you intend to seek your pig ask fflewddur my own quest said taran look at the bard must be given up if it is possibl after the first task is done i mean to return to it until then i serv onli gwydion it wa i who cost him hi life and it is justic for me to do what i believ he would have done as i grasp the situat said the bard i think your take too much blame on yourself you had no way of know gwydion wasnt in the dungeon it chang noth taran answer i have made my decis fflewddur wa about to protest but the firm of taran word silenc the bard after a moment he ask what is your boon then it is twofold said taran first tell me how i may reach caer dathyl as quickli as possibl second i beg you to conduct thi girl safe to her own peopl befor fflewddur could

certain assist pigkeep i wont even mention hi name think otherwis hell be even more mistaken everyon start talk at onc stop it cri taran at the top of hi voic veri well he said after the other grew quiet you he said to eilonwi could be tie up and set on melyngar but he ad rais hi hand befor the girl could interrupt that will not be done not becaus of all the commot you rais but becaus i realiz now it is best the bard look surpris taran continu there is greater safeti in greater number whatev happen there will be more chanc for one of us to reach caer dathyl i believ we should all stay togeth and faith gurgi too shout gurgi he will follow too mani wick enemi are smirk and lurk to jab him with pointi spear if he agre taran said fflewddur shall act as guid but i warn you he ad glanc at gurgi and eilonwi noth must hinder our task ordinarili said fflewddur i prefer to be in charg of thi type of expedit myself but he went on as taran wa about to protest sinc you are act for lord

harp string broke at onc and the other strain so tautli they look on the verg of snap while taran saddl melyngar the bard set ruefulli to work repair hi harp chapter flight through the hill at first taran offer to let eilonwi ride melyngar but the girl refus i can walk as well as ani of you she cri so angrili that taran made no more of it he had learn to be wari of the girl sharp tongu it wa agre that the white mare would carri the weapon taken from spiral castl except the sword dyrnwyn of which eilonwi had appoint herself guardian scratch in the dirt with hi dagger point fflewddur fflam show taran the path he intend to follow the host of the horn king will sure stay in the valley of ystrad it the easiest way for an armi on the march spiral castl wa here he ad with an angri jab to mark the spot west of the river ystrad now the shortest road would be straight north over these hill that is the one we must take said taran tri hard to make sens of fflewddur crisscross line wouldnt recommend it my friend we should be pass a littl too near annuvin arawn stronghold are close to spiral castl and i suggest we keep clear of them no what i believ we should do is thi stay on the high ground of the western bank of the ystrad we can go quit directli sinc we neednt follow the valley itself that way we can avoid both annuvin and the horn king the four of us can move faster than heavili arm warrior we shall come out well ahead of them not too far from caer dathyl from there we make a dash for it and our task is done fflewddur straighten up beam with satisfact there you have it he said wipe the dirt from hi dagger a brilliant strategi my own war leader couldnt have arrang it better ye said taran hi head still muddl with the bard talk of high ground and western bank that sound veri

dream he had come to learn wa easi and at caer dallben no live depend on hi judgment he long for gwydion strength and guidanc hi own strength he fear wa not equal to hi task he turn onc for a last look in the direct of spiral castl gwydion burial mound over the hill crest stark against the cloud rose two figur on horseback taran shout and gestur for hi companion to take cover in the wood melyngar gallop forward in anoth moment they were all crouch in a thicket the horsemen follow along the crest too far away for taran to see their face clearli but from their rigid postur he could guess at the livid featur and dull eye of the cauldronborn how long have they been behind us ask fflewddur have they seen us taran look cautious through the screen of leav he point toward the slope there is your answer he said from the crest the pale cauldron warrior had turn their hors toward the meadow and were steadili pick their way down the hill hurri order taran we must outrun them the group did not return to the meadow but struck out across the wood the appear of the cauldronborn now forc them to abandon the path fflewddur had chosen but the bard hope they might throw the warrior off the track and circl back again to higher ground stay close to one anoth they move at a dog trot not dare to stop even for water the forest offer a measur of protect from the sun but after a time the pace began to tell on them onli gurgi did not seem fatigu or uncomfort he lope steadili along and the swarm of midg and sting insect could not penetr hi mat hair eilonwi who proudli insist she enjoy run clung to melyngar stirrup taran could not be sure how close the warrior were he knew the cauldronborn could hardli fail to track them by sound if noth els for they no longer attempt to move

first hesit light of day appear even gurgi had begun to stumbl with fatigu and could bare put one hairi foot in front of the other eilonwi had fallen into a slumber so deep that taran fear she wa ill her hair lay bedraggl and damp upon her forehead her face wa pallid with the bard help taran lift her from the saddl and prop her against a mossi bank when he ventur to unbuckl the cumbersom sword eilonwi open one eye made an irrit face and pull the blade away from him with more determin than he had expect you never understand thing the first time eilonwi murmur her grip firm on the weapon but i imagin assist pigkeep are all alik i told you befor your not to have it and now ill tell you for the second time or is it the third or fourth i must have lost count so say she wrap her arm around the scabbard and drop back to sleep we must rest here taran said to the bard if onli a littl while at the moment groan fflewddur who had stretch out full length with hi toe and nose point straight into the air i dont care who catch me id welcom arawn himself and ask whether he had ani breakfast with him the cauldronborn might have lost track of us dure the night taran said hope but without great convict i wish i knew how far weve left them behind if weve left them behind at all gurgi brighten a littl clever gurgi will know he cri with seek and peek in anoth moment gurgi wa halfway up a

chanc to do it i shall help you i know all about forag in the wood do it constantli the harp tens and one string show sign of give way no he ad quickli i had better stay with eilonwi the truth is i cant tell a mushroom from a toadstool i wish i could it would make the life of a wander bard consider more fill with cloak in which to carri back whatev they might find taran and gurgi set off at a small stream taran halt to fill gwydion leather water flask gurgi snif hungrili ran ahead and disappear into a stand of rowan near the bank of the stream taran discov mushroom and gather them hurriedli bent on hi own search he paid littl heed to gurgi until he suddenli heard anguish yelp from behind the tree clutch hi preciou mushroom taran hasten to see what had happen and came upon gurgi lie in the middl of the grove writh and whimper a honeycomb besid him at first taran thought gurgi had got himself stung by bee then he saw the creatur wa in more seriou troubl while gurgi had climb for the honey a dead branch had snap under hi weight hi twist leg wa pin to the ground with the heavi wood on top of it taran heav the branch away the pant gurgi shook hi head poor gurgi leg is broken

arawn grasp still taran could not bring himself to draw hi sword you and eilonwi can ride melyngar taran said lift gurgi to hi feet and put one of the creatur hairi arm about hi shoulder come on now one step at a time taran wa exhaust when they reach eilonwi and the bard the girl had recov notic and wa chatter even faster than befor while gurgi lay silent on the grass taran divid the honeycomb

taran said softli but you travel as one of us and you will need all your strength keep your share it is your by right and you have more than earn it he put hi hand gentli on gurgi shoulder the wet wolfhound odor did not seem as objection as befor chapter the wolv for a time dure the day taran believ they had at last outdistanc the cauldronborn but late that afternoon the warrior reappear from behind a distant fring of tree against the wester sun the long shadow of the horsemen reach across the hill slope toward the flatland where the small troop struggl onward we must stand against them sooner or later taran said wipe hi forehead let it be now there can be no victori over the cauldronborn but with luck we can hold them off a littl while if eilonwi and gurgi can escap there is still a chanc gurgi drape over melyngar saddl immedi set up a great outcri no no faith gurgi stay with mighti lord who spare hi poor tender head happi grate gurgi will fight too with slash and gash we appreci

the sun glint on their drawn sword taran seiz the girl by the waist and tri to pull her away he receiv a sharp kick in the shin must you alway interfer with everyth eilonwi ask indignantli befor taran could reach for her again she held an arrow toward the sun and murmur a strang phrase she nock the arrow and loos it in the direct of the cauldronborn the shaft arch upward and almost disappear against the bright ray openmouth taran watch while the shaft began it descent as the arrow plummet to earth long silveri streamer sprang from it feather in an instant a huge spiderweb glitter in the air and drift slowli toward the horsemen fflewddur who had run up just then stop in amaz great belin he exclaim what that it look like decor for a feast the web slowli settl over the cauldronborn but the pallid warrior paid it no heed they spur their mount onward the strand of the web broke and melt away eilonwi clap a hand to her mouth it didnt work she cri almost in tear the way achren doe it she make it into a big sticki rope oh it all gone wrong i tri to listen behind the door when she wa practic but ive miss someth import she stamp her foot and turn away take her from here taran call to the bard he unsheath hi sword and face the cauldronborn within moment they would be upon him but even as he brace himself for their onslaught he saw the horsemen falter the cauldronborn rein up suddenli then without a gestur turn their hors and rode silent back toward the hill it work it work after all cri the astonish fflewddur eilonwi shook her head no she said with discourag someth turn them away but im afraid it wasnt my spell she unstrung the bow and pick up the arrow she had drop i think i know what it wa taran said they are return to arawn gwydion told me they could not stay long from annuvin their power must have been wane ever sinc we left spiral castl and they reach the limit of their strength right here i hope they dont have enough left to get back to annuvin eilonwi said i hope they fall into piec or shrivel up like bat i doubt that they will taran said watch the horsemen slowli disappear over the ridg they must know how long they can stay and how far they can go and still return to their master he gave eilonwi an admir glanc it doesnt matter theyr gone and that wa one of the most amaz thing ive ever seen gwydion had a mesh of grass that burst into flame but ive

and were amus themselv by tumbl down it at taran approach they stop for a moment rais their head to look at him as though sorri he wa unabl to join them and return to their game a fish broke water in a twinkl of silver scale the rippl widen until the last of them lap gentli at the shore medwyn taran saw had garden of both flower and veget behind the cottag to hi surpris taran found himself yearn

cage which are now their prison hous in annuvin the tortur he inflict on the gwythaint were shame and unspeak now they serv him out of terror thu would he strive to corrupt everi anim in prydain no less than the race of men that is one of the reason i remain in thi valley here arawn can not harm them even so were he to becom ruler of thi land i doubt i could help them all those who fell into hi clutch would be count fortun if they perish quickli taran nod i understand more and more whi i must warn the son of don as for gurgi i wonder if it wouldnt be safer for him to stay here safer ask medwyn ye certainli but you would hurt him grievous were you to turn him away now gurgi misfortun is that he is neither one thing nor the other at the moment he ha lost the wisdom of anim and ha not gain the learn of men therefor both shun him were he to do someth purpos it would mean much to him i doubt he will delay your journey for he will be abl to walk as well as you by tomorrow easili i urg you to take him he may even find hi own way of serv you neither refus to give help when it is need medwyn continu nor refus to accept it when it is offer gwythyr son of greidawl learn that from a lame ant you know a lame ant taran shook hi head dallben ha taught me much about ant but noth of a lame one it is a long histori medwyn said and perhap you will hear all of it anoth time for the moment you

chief giant at the time what the task were doe not concern us now except that they were veri nigh imposs and kilhuch could not have accomplish them without the aid of hi companion one of the task wa to gather nine bushel of flax seed though there wa scarc that much in all the land for the sake of hi friend gwythyr son of greidawl undertook to do thi while he wa walk over the hill wonder how he might accomplish it he heard a grievou wail from an anthil a fire had start around it and the ant were in danger of their live gwythyr ye im quit sure it wa gwythyr drew hi sword and beat out the fire in gratitud the ant comb everi field until they had collect the nine bushel yet the chief giant a picki and disagre sort claim the measur wa not complet one flax seed wa miss and must be deliv befor nightfal gwythyr had no idea where he could find anoth flax seed but at last just as the sun had begun to set up hobbl a lame ant carri a heavi burden it wa the singl flax seed and so the last measur wa fill i have studi the race of men medwyn continu i have seen that alon you stand as weak reed by a lake you must learn to help yourselv that is true but you must also learn to help one anoth are you not all of you lame ant taran wa silent medwyn put hi hand into the lake and stir the water after a moment a vener salmon rippl up medwyn stroke the jaw of the huge fish what place is thi taran final ask in a hush voic are you inde medwyn you speak of the race of men as if you were not one of them thi is a place of peac medwyn said and therefor not suitabl for men at least not yet until it is i hold thi valley for creatur of the forest and the water in their mortal danger they come to me if they have the strength to do so and in their pain and grief do you not believ that anim know grief and fear and pain the world of men is not an easi one for them dallben said taran taught me that when the black water flood prydain age ago nevvid nav neivion built a ship and carri with him two of everi live creatur the water drain away the ship came to rest no man know where but the anim who came safe again into the world rememb and their young have never forgotten and here taran said point toward the hillsid i see a ship far from water gwydion call you medwyn but i ask i am medwyn answer the whitebeard man for all that my name may concern you that is not import now my own concern is for hen wen you have seen noth of her then medwyn shook hi head what lord gwydion said is true of all place in prydain she would have come here first especi if she sens her life in danger but there ha been no sign no rumor yet she would find her way sooner or later unless taran felt a chill rippl at hi heart unless she ha been kill he murmur do you think that ha happen i do not know medwyn answer though i fear it may be so chapter the black lake that night medwyn prepar a feast for the travel the disord left by the breakfast bear had been clear away the cottag wa snug and neat though even smaller than caer dallben taran could see that medwyn wa inde unus to entertain human visitor for hi tabl wa bare long enough to seat them all and for chair he had been oblig to make do with bench and milk stool medwyn sat at the head of the tabl the fawn had gone to sleep but the wolv crouch at hi feet and grin happili on the back of hi chair perch a gigant goldenplum eagl watch everi movement with sharp unblink eye fflewddur though still apprehens did not allow hi fear to affect hi appetit he ate enough for three without show the least sign of becom full but when he ask for anoth portion

and the chanc to rest taran wa silent throughout the meal and continu so when he retir to hi nest of straw until now he had never imagin hen wen might not be aliv he had spoken again with medwyn but the old man could give him no assur wake taran left the byre and stood outsid look at the sky in the clear air the star were bluewhit closer than he had ever seen them he tri to turn hi thought from

medwyn ask a restless night is no way to begin a journey it is a journey i am eager to end taran said there are time when i fear i shall not see caer dallben again it is not given to men to know the end of their journey medwyn answer it may be that you will never return to the place dearest to you but how can that matter if what you must do is here and now i think said taran longingli that if i

lord have been kind to happi jolli gurgi taran notic medwyn had not onli heal the creatur leg he had also given him a bath and a good comb gurgi look onli half as twiggi and leafi as usual in addit as he saddl melyngar taran found that medwyn had pack the saddlebag with food and had includ warm cloak for all of them the old man call the travel around him and seat himself on the ground the armi of the horn king are by now a day march ahead of you he said but if you follow the path i shall reveal and move quickli you may regain the time you have lost it is even possibl for you to reach caer dathyl a day perhap two befor them howev i warn you the mountain way are not easi if you prefer i shall set you on a path toward the valley of ystrad onc again then we would be follow the horn king taran said there would be less chanc of overtak him and much danger too do not think the mountain are not danger medwyn said though it is danger of a differ sort a fflam thrive on danger cri the bard let it be the mountain or the home king host i fear neither not to ani great extent he ad quickli we shall risk the mountain taran said for onc eilonwi interrupt youv decid the right thing the mountain certainli arent go to throw spear at us no matter how danger they are i realli think your improv listen care then medwyn order as he spoke hi hand move deftli in the soft earth befor him mold a tini model of the hill which taran found easier to follow than fflewddur map scratch when he finish and the travel gear and weapon were secur on melyngar back medwyn led the group from the valley as close as taran observ each step of the way he knew the path to medwyn valley would be lost to him as soon as the ancient man left them in a littl while medwyn stop your path now lie to the north he said and here we shall part and you taran of caer dallben whether you have chosen wise you will learn from your own heart perhap we shall meet again and you will tell me until then farewel befor taran could turn and thank medwyn the white beard man disappear as if the hill had swallow him up and the travel stood by themselv on a rocki windswept plateau well said fflewddur hitch up the harp behind him i somehow feel that if we meet ani more wolv theyll know were friend of medwyn the first day march wa less difficult than taran had fear thi time he led the way for the bard admit after a number of harp string had snap that he had not been abl to keep all medwyn direct in hi head they climb steadili until long after the sun had turn westward and though the ground wa rough and broken the path medwyn had indic lay dearli befor them mountain stream whose water ran cold and clear made wind line of sparkl silver as they danc down the slope into the distant valley land the air wa brace yet with a cold edg which made the travel grate for the cloak medwyn had given them at a long cleft protect from the wind taran signal a halt they had made excel progress dure the day far more than he had expect and he saw no reason to exhaust themselv by forc a march dure the night tether melyngar to one of the stunt tree that grew in the height the travel made camp sinc there wa no further danger from the cauldronborn and the host of the horn king move far below and to the west of the group taran deem it safe to build a fire medwyn provis need no cook but the blaze warm and cheer them as the night shadow drift from the peak eilonwi lit her golden sphere and set it in the crevic of a fault rock gurgi who had not utter a singl moan or groan dure thi part of the journey perch on a boulder and began scratch himself luxuri although after medwyn wash and comb it wa more through habit than anyth els the bard as lean as ever despit the huge amount he had eaten repair hi harp string youv been carri that harp ever sinc i met you eilonwi said and youv never onc play it that like tell somebodi you want to talk to them and when they get readi to listen you dont say anyth youd hardli expect me to go strum out air while those cauldron warrior were follow us fflewddur said somehow i didnt think it would be appropri but a fflam is alway oblig so if youd realli care to hear me play he ad look both delight and embarrass he cradl the instrument in one arm and almost befor hi finger touch the string a gentl melodi as beauti as the curv of the harp itself lift like a voic sing without word to taran ear the melodi had it own word weav a suppl thread among the rise note home home they sang and beyond the word themselv so fleet he could not be quit sure of them were the field and orchard of caer dallben the gold afternoon of autumn and the crisp winter morn with pink sunlight on the snow then the harp fell silent fflewddur sat with hi head bent close to the string a curiou express on hi long face well that wa a surpris said the bard at last i had plan someth a littl more live the sort of thing my war leader alway enjoy to put us in a bold frame of mind you understand the truth of the matter is he admit with a slight tone of discourag i dont realli know what go to come out of it next my finger go along but sometim i think thi harp play of itself perhap fflewddur continu that whi taliesin thought he wa do me a favor when he gave it to me becaus when i went up to the council of bard for my examin i had an old pot one of the minstrel had left behind and i couldnt do more than plunk out a few chant howev a fflam never look a gift hors in the mouth or in thi case i should say harp it wa a sad tune eilonwi said but the odd thing about it is you dont mind the sad it like feel better after youv had a good cri it made me think of the sea again though i havent been there sinc i wa a littl girl at thi taran snort but eilonwi paid no attent to him the wave break against the cliff and churn into foam and farther out as far as you can see there are the white crest the white hors of llyr they call them but theyr realli onli wave wait their turn to roll in strang said the bard person i wa think of my own castl it small and drafti but i would like to see it again a person can have enough wander you know it made me think i might even settl down again and tri to be a respect sort of king caer dallben is closer to my heart taran said when i left i never gave it too much thought now i think of it a great deal gurgi who had been listen silent set up a long howl ye ye soon great warrior will all be back in their hall tell their tale with laugh and chaf then it will be the fear forest again for poor gurgi to put down hi tender head in snooz and snore gurgi taran said i promis to bring you to caer dallben if i ever get there myself and if you like it and dallben agre you can stay there as long as you want what joy gurgi cri honest toil gurgi extend thank and best wish oh ye fond obedi gurgi will work hard for now obedi gurgi had better sleep taran advis and so should we all medwyn ha put us well on our way and it cant take much longer well start again at daybreak dure the night howev a gale rose and by morn a drench rain beat into the cleft instead of slacken the wind gain in forc and scream over the rock it beat like a fist against the travel shelter then pri with search finger as if to seiz and dash them into the valley they set out nevertheless hold their cloak befor their face to make matter wors the path broke off entir and sheer cliff loom ahead of them the rain stop after the travel had all been soak to the skin but now the rock were slipperi and treacher even the surefoot melyngar stumbl onc and for a breathless moment taran fear she would be lost the mountain swung a halfcircl around a lake black and sullen below threaten cloud taran halt on an outcrop of stone and point toward the hill at the far side of the lake accord to what medwyn told us he said to the bard we should make for that notch all the way over there but i see no purpos in follow the mountain when we can cut almost straight across the lake shore is flat at least while here it get practic imposs to climb fflewddur rub hi point nose even count the time it would take us to go down and come up again i think we should save sever hour ye i definit believ it worth tri medwyn didnt say a word about cross valley eilonwi put in he didnt say anyth about cliff like these answer taran they seem noth to him he live here a long time for us it someth els again if you dont listen to what somebodi tell you eilonwi remark it like put your finger in your ear and jump down a well for an assist pigkeep who done veri littl travel you suddenli know all about it who found the way out of the barrow taran retort it decid we cross the valley the descent wa labori but onc they had reach level ground taran felt all the more convinc they would save time hold melyngar bridl he led the group along the narrow shore the lake reach close to the base of the hill oblig taran to splash through the shallow the lake he realiz wa not black in reflect of the sky the water itself wa dark flat and as grim and heavi as iron the bottom too wa as treacher as the rock abov despit hi care taran lurch and nearli got a duck when he turn to warn the other to hi surpris he saw gurgi in water up to hi waist and head toward the center of the lake fflewddur and eilonwi were also splash farther and farther from land dont go through the water taran call keep to the shore wish we could the bard shout back but were stuck somehow there a terribl strong pull a moment later taran understood what the bard meant an unexpect swell knock him off hi feet and even as he put out hi hand to break hi fall the black lake suck him down besid him melyngar thrash her leg and whinni the sky spun overhead he wa pull along like a twig in a torrent eilonwi shot past him he tri to regain hi foot and catch her it wa too late he skim and bob over the surfac the far shore would stop them taran thought struggl to keep hi head abov the wave a roar fill hi ear the middl of the
