dune messiah frank herbert excerpt from the death cell interview with bronso of ix q what led you to take your particular approach to a histori of muaddib a whi should i answer your question q becaus i will preserv your word a ahhh the ultim appeal to a historian q will you cooper then a whi not but youll never understand what inspir my analysi of histori never you priest have too much at stake to q tri me a tri you well again whi not i wa caught by the shallow of the common view of thi planet which aris from it popular name dune not arraki notic but dune histori is obsess by dune as desert as birthplac of the fremen such histori concentr on the custom which grew out of water scarciti and the fact that fremen led seminomad live in stillsuit which recov most of their bodi moistur q are these thing not true then a they are surfac truth as well ignor what lie beneath that surfac as as tri to understand my birthplanet ix without explor how we deriv our name from the fact that we are the ninth planet of our sun no no it is not enough to see dune as a place of savag storm it is not enough to talk about the threat pose by the gigant sandworm q but such thing are crucial to the arrakeen charact a crucial of cours but they produc a oneview planet in the same way that dune is a onecrop planet becaus it is the sole and exclus sourc of the spice melang q ye let us hear you expand on the sacr spice a sacr as with all thing sacr it give with one hand and take with the other it extend life and allow the adept to forese hi futur but it tie him to a cruel addict and mark hi eye as your are mark total blue without ani white your eye your organ of sight becom one thing without contrast a singl view q such heresi brought you to thi cell a i wa brought to thi cell by your priest as with all priest you learn earli to call the truth heresi q you are here becaus you dare to say that paul atreid lost someth essenti to hi human befor he could becom muaddib a not to speak of hi lose hi father here in the harkonnen war nor the death of duncan idaho who sacrif himself that paul and the ladi jessica could escap q your cynic is duli note a cynic that no doubt is a greater crime than heresi but you see im not realli a cynic im just an observ and comment i saw true nobil in paul as he fled into the desert with hi pregnant mother of cours she wa a great asset as well as a burden q the flaw in your historian is that youll never leav well enough alon you see true nobil in the holi muaddib but you must append a cynic footnot it no wonder that the bene gesserit also denounc you a you priest do well to make common caus with the bene gesserit sisterhood they too surviv by conceal what they do but they can not conceal the fact that the ladi jessica wa a bene gesserittrain adept you know she train her son in the sisterhood way my crime wa to discuss thi as a phenomenon to expound upon their mental art and their genet program you dont want attent call to the fact that muaddib wa the sisterhood hope for captiv messiah that he wa their kwisatz haderach befor he wa your prophet q if i had ani doubt about your death sentenc you have dispel them a i can onli die onc q there are death and there are death a bewar lest you make a martyr of me i do not think muaddib tell me doe muaddib know what you do in these dungeon q we do not troubl the holi famili with trivia a laughter and for thi paul atreid fought hi way to a nich among the fremen for thi he learn to control and ride the sandworm it wa a mistak to answer your question q but i will keep my promis to preserv your word a will you realli then listen to me care you fremen degener you priest with no god except yourself you have much to answer for it wa a fremen ritual which gave paul hi first massiv dose of melang therebi open him to vision of hi futur it wa a fremen ritual by which that same melang awaken the unborn alia in the ladi jessica womb have you consid what it meant for alia to be born into thi univers fulli cognit possess of all her mother memori and knowledg no rape could be more terrifi q without the sacr melang muaddib would not have becom leader of all fremen without her holi experi alia would not be alia a without your blind fremen cruelti you would not be a priest ahhh i know you fremen you think muaddib is your becaus he mate with chani becaus he adopt fremen custom but he wa an atreid first and he wa train by a bene gesserit adept he possess disciplin total unknown to you you thought he brought you new organ and a new mission he promis to transform your desert planet into a waterrich paradis and while he dazzl you with such vision he took your virgin q such heresi doe not chang the fact that the ecolog transform of dune proce apac a and i commit the heresi of trace the root of that transform of explor the consequ that battl out there on the plain of arrakeen may have taught the univers that fremen could defeat imperi sardaukar but what els did it teach when the stellar empir of the corrino famili becam a fremen empir under muaddib what els did the empir becom your jihad onli took twelv year but what a lesson it taught now the empir understand the sham of muaddib marriag to the princess irulan q you dare accus muaddib of sham a though you kill me for it it not heresi the princess becam hi consort not hi mate chani hi littl fremen darl she hi mate everyon know thi irulan wa the key to a throne noth more q it easi to see whi those who conspir against muaddib use your analysi of histori as their ralli argument a ill not persuad you i know that but the argument of the conspiraci came befor my analysi twelv year of muaddib jihad creat the argument that what unit the ancient power group and ignit the conspiraci against muaddib such a rich store of myth enfold paul muaddib the mentat emperor and hi sister alia it is difficult to see the real person behind these veil but there were after all a man born paul atreid and a woman born alia their flesh wa subject to space and time and even though their oracular power place them beyond the usual limit of time and space they came from human stock they experienc real event which left real trace upon a real univers to understand them it must be seen that their catastroph wa the catastroph of all mankind thi work is dedic then not to muaddib or hi sister but to their heir to all of us dedic in the muaddib concord as copi from the tabla memorium of the mahdi spirit cult muaddib imperi reign gener more historian than ani other era in human histori most of them argu a particular viewpoint jealou and sectarian but it say someth about the peculiar impact of thi man that he arous such passion on so mani divers world of cours he contain the ingredi of histori ideal and ideal thi man born paul atreid in an ancient great famili receiv the deep pranabindu train from the ladi jessica hi bene gesserit mother and had through thi a superb control over muscl and nerv but more than that he wa a mentat an intellect whose capac surpass those of the religi proscrib mechan comput use by the ancient abov all els muaddib wa the kwisatz haderach which the sisterhood breed program had sought across thousand of gener the kwisatz haderach then the one who could be mani place at onc thi prophet thi man through whom the bene gesserit hope to control human destini thi man becam emperor muaddib and execut a marriag of conveni with a daughter of the padishah emperor he had defeat think on the paradox the failur implicit in thi moment for you sure have read other histori and know the surfac fact muaddib wild fremen did inde overwhelm the padishah shaddam iv they toppl the sardaukar legion the alli forc of the great hous the harkonnen armi and the mercenari bought with money vote in the landsraad he brought the space guild to it knee and place hi own sister alia on the religi throne the bene gesserit had thought their own he did all these thing and more muaddib qizar missionari carri their religi war across space in a jihad whose major impetu endur onli twelv standard year but in that time religi coloni brought all but a fraction of the human univers under one rule he did thi becaus captur of arraki that planet known more often as dune gave him a monopoli over the ultim coin of the realm the geriatr spice melang the poison that gave life here wa anoth ingredi of ideal histori a materi whose psychic chemistri unravel time without melang the sisterhood reverend mother could not perform their feat of observ and human control without melang the guild steersmen could not navig across space without melang billion upon billion of imperi citizen would die of addict withdraw without melang paulmuaddib could not prophesi we know thi moment of suprem power contain failur there can be onli one answer that complet accur and total predict is lethal other histori say muaddib wa defeat by obviou plotter the guild the sisterhood and the scientif amoralist of the bene tleilex with their facedanc disguis other histori point out the spi in muaddib household they make much of the dune tarot which cloud muaddib power of propheci some show how muaddib wa made to accept the servic of a ghola the flesh brought back from the dead and train to destroy him but certainli they must know thi ghola wa duncan idaho the atreid lieuten who perish save the life of the young paul yet they delin the qizar cabal guid by korba the panegyrist they take us step by step through korba plan to make a martyr of muaddib and place the blame on chani the fremen concubin how can ani of thi explain the fact as histori ha reveal them they can not onli through the lethal natur of propheci can we understand the failur of such enorm and farse power hope other historian will learn someth from thi revel analysi of histori muaddib by bronso of ix there exist no separ between god and men one blend softli casual into the other proverb of muaddib despit the murder natur of the plot he hope to devis the thought of scytal the tleilaxu face dancer return again and again to rueful compass i shall regret caus death and miseri to muaddib he told himself he kept thi benign care hidden from hi fellow conspir such feel told him though that he found it easier to identifi with the victim than with the attack a thing characterist of the tleilaxu scytal stood in bemus silenc somewhat apart from the other the argument about psychic poison had been go on for some time now it wa energet and vehement but polit in that blindli compuls way adept of the great
