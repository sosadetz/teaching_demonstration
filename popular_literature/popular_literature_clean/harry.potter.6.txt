our robe on harri wa so busi stare at malfoy he did not notic goyl reach up for hi trunk as he swung it down it hit harri hard on the side of the head he let out an involuntari gasp of pain and malfoy look up at the luggag rack frown harri wa not afraid of malfoy but he still did not much like the idea of be discov hide under hi invis cloak by a group of unfriendli slytherin eye still water and head still throb he drew hi wand care not to disarrang the cloak and wait breath held to hi relief malfoy seem to decid that he had imagin the nois he pull on hi robe like the other lock hi trunk and as the train slow to a jerki crawl fasten a thick new travel cloak round hi neck harri could see the corridor fill up again and hope that hermion and ron would take hi thing out onto the platform for him he wa stuck where he wa until the compart had quit empti at last with a final lurch the train came to a complet halt goyl threw the door open and muscl hi way out into a crowd of second year punch them asid crabb and zabini follow you go on malfoy told pansi who wa wait for him with her hand held out as though hope he would hold it i just want to check someth pansi left now harri and malfoy were alon in the compart peopl were file past descend onto the dark platform malfoy move over to the compart door and let down the blind so that peopl in the corridor beyond could not peer in he then bent down over hi trunk and open it again harri peer down over the edg of the luggag rack hi heart pump a littl faster what had malfoy want to hide from pansi wa he about to see the mysteri broken object it wa so import to mend petrificu totalu without warn malfoy point hi wand at harri who wa instantli paralyz as though in slow motion he toppl out of the luggag rack and fell with an agon floorshak crash at malfoy feet the invis cloak trap beneath him hi whole bodi reveal with hi leg still curl absurdli into the cramp kneel posit he couldnt move a muscl he could onli gaze up at malfoy who smile broadli i thought so he said jubilantli i heard goyl trunk hit you and i thought i saw someth white flash through the air after zabini came back hi eye linger for a moment upon harri trainer you didnt hear anyth i care about potter but while ive got you here and he stamp hard on harri face harri felt hi nose break blood spurt everywher that from my father now let see malfoy drag the cloak out from under harri immobil bodi and threw it over him i dont reckon theyll find you till the train back in london he said quietli see you around potter or not and take care to tread on harri finger malfoy left the compart chapter victori snape harri could not move a muscl he lay there beneath the invis cloak feel the blood from hi nose flow hot and wet over hi face listen to the voic and footstep in the corridor beyond hi immedi thought wa that someon would sure check the compart befor the train depart again but at onc came the dispirit realiz that even if somebodi look into the compart he would be neither seen nor heard hi best hope wa that somebodi els would walk in and step on him harri had never hate malfoy more than as he lay there like an absurd turtl on it back blood drip sickeningli into hi open mouth what a stupid situat to have land himself in and now the last few footstep were die away everyon wa shuffl along the dark platform outsid he could hear the scrape of trunk and loud babbl of talk ron and hermion would think that he had left the train without them onc they arriv at hogwart and took their place in the great hall look up and down the gryffindor tabl a few time and final realiz that he wa not there he no doubt would be halfway back to london he tri to make a sound even a grunt but it wa imposs then he rememb that some wizard like dumbledor could perform spell without speak so he tri to summon hi wand which had fallen out of hi hand by say the word accio wand over and over again in hi head but noth happen he thought he could hear the rustl of the tree that surround the lake and the faroff hoot of an owl but no hint of a search be made or even he despis himself slightli for hope it panick voic wonder where harri potter had gone a feel of hopeless spread through him as he imagin the convoy of thestraldrawn carriag trundl up to the school and the muffl yell of laughter issu from whichev carriag malfoy wa ride in where he could be recount hi attack on harri to crabb goyl zabini and pansi parkinson the train lurch caus harri to roll over onto hi side now he wa stare at the dusti undersid of the seat instead of the ceil the floor began to vibrat as the engin roar into life the express wa leav and nobodi knew he wa still on it then he felt hi invis cloak fli off him and a voic overhead said wotcher harri there wa a flash of red light and harri bodi unfroz he wa abl to push himself into a more dignifi sit posit hastili wipe the blood off hi bruis race with the back of hi hand and rais hi head to look up at tonk who wa

notic you hadnt left the train and i knew you had that cloak i thought you might be hide for some reason when i saw the blind were drawn down on that compart i thought id check but what are you do here anyway harri ask im station in hogsmead now to give the school extra protect said tonk is it just you who station up here or no proudfoot savag and dawlish are here too dawlish that auror dumbledor attack last year that right they trudg up the dark desert lane follow the freshli made carriag track harri look sideway at tonk under hi cloak last year she had been inquisit to the point of be a littl annoy at time she had laugh easili she had made joke now she seem older and much more seriou and purpos wa thi all the effect of what had happen at the ministri he reflect uncomfort that hermion would have suggest he say someth consol about siriu to her that it hadnt been her fault at all but he couldnt bring himself to do it he wa far from blame her for siriuss death it wa no more her fault than anyon els and much less than hi but he did not like talk about siriu if he could avoid it and so they tramp on through the cold night in silenc tonkss long cloak whisper on the ground behind them have alway travel there by carriag harri had never befor appreci just how far hogwart wa from hogsmead station with great relief he final saw the tall pillar on either side of the gate each top with a wing boar he wa cold he wa hungri and he wa quit keen to leav thi new gloomi tonk behind but when he put out a hand to push open the gate he found them chain shut alohomora he said confid point hi wand at the padlock but noth happen that wont work on these said tonk dumbledor bewitch them himself harri look around i could climb a wall he suggest no you couldnt said tonk flatli antiintrud jinx on all of them secur been tighten a hundredfold thi summer well then said harri start to feel annoy at her lack of help i suppos ill just have to sleep out here and wait for morn someon come down for you said tonk look a lantern wa bob at the distant foot of the castl harri wa so pleas to see it he felt he could even endur filch wheezi critic of hi tardi and rant about how hi timekeep would improv with the regular applic of thumbscrew it wa not until the glow yellow light wa ten feet away from them and had pull off hi invis cloak so that he could be seen that he recogn with a rush of pure loath the uplit hook nose and long black greasi hair of severu snape well well well sneer snape take out hi wand and tap the padlock onc so that the chain snake backward and the gate creak open nice of you to turn up potter although you have evid decid that the wear of school robe would detract from your appear i couldnt chang i didnt have my harri began but snape cut across him there is no need to wait nymphadora potter is quit ah safe in my hand i meant hagrid to get the messag said tonk frown hagrid wa late for the startofterm feast just like potter here so i took it instead and incident said snape stand back to allow harri to pass him i wa interest to see your new patronu he shut the gate in her face with a loud clang and tap the chain with hi wand again so that they slither clink back into place i think you were better off with the old one said snape the malic in hi voic unmistak the new one look weak as snape swung the lantern about harri saw fleetingli a look of shock and anger on tonkss face then she wa cover in dark onc more good night harri call to her over hi shoulder as he began the walk up to the school with snape thank for everyth see you harri snape did not speak for a minut or so harri felt as though hi bodi wa gener wave of hatr so power that it seem incred that snape could not feel them burn him he had loath snape from their first encount but snape had place himself forev and irrevoc beyond the possibl of harri forgiv by hi attitud toward siriu whatev dumbledor said harri had had time to think over the summer and had conclud that snape snide remark to siriu about remain safe hidden while the rest of the order of the phoenix were off fight voldemort had probabl been a power factor in siriu rush off to the ministri the night that he had die harri clung to thi notion becaus it enabl him to blame snape which felt satisfi and also becaus he knew that if anyon wa not sorri that siriu wa dead it wa the man now stride next to him in the dark fifti point from gryffindor for late i think said snape and let me see anoth twenti for your muggl attir you know i dont believ ani hous ha ever been in neg figur thi earli in the term we havent even start pud you might have set a record potter the furi and hatr bubbl insid harri seem to blaze whitehot but he would rather have been immobil all the way back to london than tell snape whi he wa late i suppos you want to make an entranc did you snape continu and with no fli car avail you decid that burst into the great hall halfway through the feast ought to creat a dramat effect still harri remain silent though he thought hi chest might explod he knew that snape had come to fetch him for thi for the few minut when he could needl and torment harri without anyon els listen they reach the castl step at last and as the great oaken front door swung open into the vast flag entranc hall a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkl plate and glass greet them through the door stand open into the great hail harri wonder whether he could slip hi invis cloak back on therebi gain hi seat at the long gryffindor tabl which inconveni wa the farthest from the entranc hall without be notic as though he had read harri mind howev snape said no cloak you can walk in so that everyon see you which is what you want im sure harri turn on the spot and march straight through the open door anyth to get away from snape the great hall with it four long hous tabl and it staff tabl set at the top of the room wa decor as usual with float candl that made the plate below glitter and

now twilit offic what happen to the girl in the cottag said harri at onc as dumbledor lit extra lamp with a flick of hi wand merop or whatev her name wa oh she surviv said dumbledor reseat himself behind hi desk and indic that harri should sit down too ogden appar back to the ministri and return with reinforc within fifteen minut morfin and hi father attempt to fight but both were overpow remov from the cottag and subsequ convict by the wizengamot morfin who alreadi had a record of muggl attack wa sentenc to three year in azkaban marvolo who had injur sever ministri employe in addit to ogden receiv six month marvolo harri repeat wonderingli that right said dumbledor smile in approv i am glad to see your keep up that old man wa voldemort grandfath ye said dumbledor marvolo hi son morfin and hi daughter merop were the last of the gaunt a veri ancient wizard famili note for a vein of instabl and violenc that flourish through the gener due to their habit of marri their own cousin lack of sens coupl with a great like for grandeur meant that the famili gold wa squander sever gener befor marvolo wa born he as you saw wa left in squalor and poverti with a veri nasti temper a fantast amount of arrog and pride and a coupl of famili heirloom that he treasur just as much as hi son and rather more than hi daughter so merop said harri lean forward in hi chair and stare at dumbledor so merop wa sir doe that mean she wa voldemort mother it doe said dumbledor and it so happen that we also had a glimps of voldemort father i wonder whether you notic the muggl morfin attack the man on the hors veri good inde said dumbledor beam ye that wa tom riddl senior the handsom muggl who use to go ride past the gaunt cottag and for whom merop gaunt cherish a secret burn passion and they end up marri harri said in disbelief unabl to imagin two peopl less like to fall in love i think you are forget said dumbledor that merop wa a witch i do not believ that her magic power appear to their best advantag when she wa be terror by her father onc marvolo and morfin were safe in azkaban onc she wa alon and free for the first time in her life then i am sure she wa abl to give full rein to her abil and to plot her escap from the desper life she had led for eighteen year can you not think of ani measur merop could have taken to make tom riddl forget hi muggl companion and fall in love with her instead the imperiu curs harri suggest or a love potion veri good person i am inclin to think that she use a love potion i am sure it would have seem more romant to her and i do not think it would have been veri difficult some hot day when riddl wa ride alon to persuad him to take a drink of water in ani case within a few month of the scene we have just wit the villag of littl hangleton enjoy a tremend scandal you can imagin the gossip it caus when the squir son ran off with the tramp daughter merop but the villag shock wa noth to marvolo he return from azkaban expect to find hi daughter duti await hi return with a hot meal readi on hi tabl instead he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewel explain what she had done from all that i have been abl to discov he never mention her name or exist from that time forth the shock of her desert may have contribut to hi earli death or perhap he had simpli never learn to feed himself azkaban had greatli weaken marvolo and he did not live to see morfin return to the cottag and merop she she die didnt she wasnt voldemort brought up in an orphanag ye inde said dumbledor we must do a certain amount of guess here although i do not think it is difficult to deduc what happen you see within a few month of their runaway marriag tom riddl reappear at the manor hous in littl hangleton without hi wife the rumor flew around the neighborhood that he wa talk of be hoodwink and taken in what he meant i am sure is that he had been under an enchant that had now lift though i daresay he did not dare use those precis word for fear of be thought insan when they heard what he wa say howev the villag guess that merop had lie to tom riddl pretend that she wa go to have hi babi and that he had marri her for thi reason but she did have hi babi but not until a year after they were marri tom riddl left her while she wa still pregnant what went wrong ask harri whi did the love potion stop work again thi is guesswork said dumbledor but i believ that merop who wa deepli in love with her husband could not bear to continu enslav him by magic mean i believ that she made the choic to stop give him the potion perhap besot as she wa she had convinc herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return perhap she thought he would stay for the babi sake if so she wa wrong on both count he left her never saw her again and never troubl to discov what becam of hi son the sky outsid wa inki black and the lamp in dumbledor offic seem to glow more brightli than befor i think that will do for tonight harri said dumbledor after a moment or two ye sir said harri he got to hi feet but did not leav sir is it import to know all thi about voldemort past veri import i think said dumbledor and it it got someth to do with the

from him and hi dad thi is what he wa buy that day when we follow him he rememb it and he went back for it i i dunno harri said ron hesitantli load of peopl go to borgin and burk and didnt that girl say kati got it in the girl bathroom she said she came back from the bathroom with it she didnt necessarili get it in the bathroom itself mcgonagal said ron warningli harri look up sure enough professor mcgonagal wa hurri down the stone step through swirl sleet to meet them hagrid say you four saw what happen to kati bell upstair to my offic at onc pleas what that your hold potter it the thing she touch said harri good lord said professor mcgonagal look alarm as she took the necklac from harri no no filch theyr with me she ad hastili as filch came shuffl eagerli across the entranc hall hold hi secreci sensor aloft take thi necklac to professor snape at onc but be sure not to touch it keep it wrap in the scarf harri and the other follow professor mcgonagal upstair and into her offic the sleetspatt window were rattl in their frame and the room wa chilli despit the fire crackl in the grate professor mcgonagal close the door and swept around her desk to face harri ron hermion and the still sob leann well she said sharpli what happen haltingli and with mani paus while she attempt to control her cri leann told professor mcgonagal how kati had gone to the bathroom in the three broomstick and return hold the unmark packag how kati had seem a littl odd and how they had argu about the advis of agre to deliv unknown object the argument culmin in the tussl over the parcel which tore open at thi point leann wa so overcom there wa no get anoth word out of her all right said professor mcgonagal not unkindli go up to the hospit wing pleas leann and get madam pomfrey to give you someth for shock when she had left the room professor mcgonagal turn back to harri ron and hermion what happen when kati touch the necklac she rose up in the air said harri befor either ron or hermion could speak and then began to scream and collaps professor can i see professor dumbledor pleas the headmast is away until monday potter said professor mcgonagal look surpris away harri repeat angrili ye potter away said professor mcgonagal tartli but anyth you have to say about thi horribl busi can be said to me im sure for a split second harri hesit professor mcgonagal did not invit confid dumbledor though in mani way more intimid still seem less like to scorn a theori howev wild thi wa a lifeanddeath matter though and no moment to worri about be laugh at i think draco malfoy gave kati that necklac professor on one side of him ron rub hi nose in appar embarrass on the other hermion shuffl her feet as though quit keen to put a bit of distanc between herself and harri that is a veri seriou accus potter said professor mcgonagal after a shock paus do you have ani proof no said harri but and he told her about follow malfoy to borgin and burk and the convers they had overheard between him and mr borgin when he had finish speak professor mcgonagal look slightli confus malfoy took someth to borgin and burk for repair no professor he just want borgin to tell him how to mend someth he didnt have it with him but that not the point the thing is that he bought someth at the same time and i think it wa that necklac you saw malfoy leav the shop with a similar packag no professor he told borgin to keep it in the shop for him but harri hermion interrupt borgin ask him if he want to take it with him and malfoy said no becaus he didnt want to touch it obvious said harri angrili what he actual said wa how would i look carri that down the street said hermion well he would look a bit of a prat carri a necklac interject ron oh ron said hermion despairingli it would be all wrap up so he wouldnt have to touch it and quit easi to hide insid a cloak so nobodi would see it i think whatev he reserv at borgin and burk wa noisi or bulki someth he knew would draw attent to him if he carri it down the street and in ani case she press on loudli befor harri could interrupt i ask borgin about the necklac dont you rememb when i went in to tri and find out what malfoy had ask him to keep i saw it there and borgin just told me the price he didnt say it wa alreadi sold or anyth well you were be realli obviou he realiz what you were up to within about five second of cours he wasnt go to tell you anyway malfoy couldv sent off for it sinc that enough said professor mcgonagal as hermion open her mouth to retort look furiou potter i appreci you tell me thi but we can not point the finger of blame at mr malfoy pure becaus he visit the shop where thi necklac might have been purchas the same is probabl true of hundr of peopl that what i said mutter ron and in ani case we have put stringent secur measur in place thi year i do not believ that necklac can possibl have enter thi school without our knowledg but and what is more said professor mcgonagal with an air of aw final mr malfoy wa not in hogsmead today harri gape at her deflat how do you know professor becaus he wa do detent with me he ha now fail to complet hi transfigur homework twice in a row so thank you for tell me your suspicion potter she said as she march past them but i need to go up to the hospit wing now to check on kati bell good day to you all she held open her offic door they had no choic but to file past her without anoth word harri wa angri with the other two for side with mcgonagal nevertheless he felt compel to join in onc they start discuss what had happen so who do you reckon kati wa suppos to give the necklac to ask ron as they climb the stair to the common room good onli know said hermion but whoever it wa ha had a narrow escap no one could have open that packag without touch the necklac it couldv been meant for load of peopl said harri dumbledor the death eater would love to get rid of him he must be one of their top target or slughorn dumbledor reckon voldemort realli want him and they cant be pleas that he side with dumbledor or or you said hermion look troubl couldnt have been said harri or kati wouldv just turn around in the lane and given it to me wouldnt she i wa behind her all the way out of the three broomstick it would have made much more sens to deliv the parcel outsid hogwart what with filch search everyon who goe in and out i wonder whi malfoy told her to take it into the castl harri malfoy wasnt in hogsmead said hermion actual stamp her foot in frustrat he must have use an accomplic then said harri crabb or goyl or come to think of it anoth death eater hell have load better croni than crabb and goyl now he join up ron and hermion exchang look that plainli said there no point argu with him dilligrout said hermion firmli as they reach the fat ladi the portrait swung open to admit them to the common room it wa quit full and smell of damp cloth mani peopl seem to have return from hogsmead earli becaus of the bad weather there wa no buzz of fear or specul howev clearli the news of kati fate had not yet spread it wasnt a veri slick attack realli when you stop and think about it said ron casual turf a first year out of one of the good armchair by the fire so that he could sit down the curs didnt even make it into the castl not what youd call foolproof your right said hermion prod ron out of the chair with her foot and offer it to the first year again it wasnt veri well thoughtout at all but sinc when ha malfoy been one of the world great thinker ask harri neither ron nor hermion answer him chapter the secret riddl kati wa remov to st mungo hospit for magic maladi and injuri the follow day by which time the news that she had been curs had spread all over the school though the detail were confus and nobodi other than harri ron hermion and leann seem to know that kati herself had not been the intend target oh and malfoy know of cours said harri to ron and hermion who continu their new polici of feign deaf whenev harri mention hi malfoyisadeatheat theori harri had wonder whether dumbledor would return from wherev he had been in time for monday night lesson but have had no word to the contrari he present himself outsid dumbledor offic at eight oclock knock and wa told to enter there sat dumbledor look unusu tire hi hand wa as black and burn as ever but he smile when he gestur to harri to sit down the pensiev wa sit on the desk again cast silveri speck of light over the ceil you have had a busi time while i have been away dumbledor said i believ you wit kati accid ye sir how is she still veri unwel although she wa rel lucki she appear to have brush the necklac with the smallest possibl amount of skin there wa a tini hole in her glove had she put it on had she even held it in her unglov hand she would have die perhap instantli luckili professor snape wa abl to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curs whi him ask harri quickli whi not madam pomfrey impertin said a soft voic from one of

who might have had a hand in kati accid said dumbledor but what concern me now harri is our lesson harri felt slightli resent at thi if their lesson were so veri import whi had there been such a long gap between the first and second howev he said no more about draco malfoy but watch as dumbledor pour the fresh memori into the pensiev and began swirl the stone basin onc more between hi longfing hand you will rememb i am sure that we left the tale of lord voldemort begin at the point where the handsom muggl tom riddl had abandon hi witch wife merop and return to hi famili home in littl hangleton merop wa left alon in london expect the babi who would one day becom lord voldemort how do you know she wa in london sir becaus of the evid of one caractacu burk said dumbledor who by an odd coincid help found the veri shop whenc came the necklac we have just been discuss he swill the content of the pensiev as harri had seen him swill them befor much as a gold prospector sift for gold up out of the swirl silveri mass rose a littl old man revolv slowli in the pensiev silver as a ghost but much more solid with a thatch of hair that complet cover hi eye ye we acquir it in curiou circumst it wa brought in by a young witch just befor christma oh mani year ago now she said she need the gold badli well that much wa obviou cover in rag and pretti far along go to have a babi see she said the locket had been slytherin well we hear that sort of stori all the time oh thi wa merlin thi wa hi favorit teapot but when i look at it it had hi mark all right and a few simpl spell were enough to tell me the truth of cours that made it near enough priceless she didnt seem to have ani idea how much it wa worth happi to get ten galleon for it best bargain we ever made dumbledor gave the pensiev an extravigor shake and caractacu burk descend back into the swirl mass of memori from whenc he had come he onli gave her ten galleon said harri indignantli caractacu burk wa not fame for hi generos said dumbledor so we know that near the end of her pregnanc merop wa alon in london and in desper need of gold desper enough to sell her one and onli valuabl possess the locket that wa one of marvolo treasur famili heirloom but she could do magic said harri impati she could have got food and everyth for herself by magic couldnt she ah said dumbledor perhap she could but it is my beliefi am guess again but i am sure i am right that when her husband abandon her merop stop use magic i do not think that she want to be a witch ani longer of cours it is also possibl that her unrequit love and the attend despair sap her of her power that can happen in ani case as you are about to see merop refus to rais her wand even to save her own life she wouldnt even stay aliv for her son dumbledor rais hi eyebrow could you possibl be feel sorri for lord voldemort no said harri quickli but she had a choic didnt she not like my mother your mother had a choic too said dumbledor gentli ye merop riddl chose

trophi room on the list of prefect in the old school record even in the book of wizard histori final he wa forc to accept that hi father had never set foot in hogwart i believ that it wa then that he drop the name forev assum the ident of lord voldemort and began hi investig into hi previous despis mother famili the woman whom you will rememb he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumb to the shame human weak of death all he had to go upon wa the singl name marvolo which he knew from those who ran the orphanag had been hi mother father name final after painstak research through old book of wizard famili he discov the exist of slytherin surviv line in the summer of hi sixteenth year he left the orphanag to which he return annual and set off to find hi gaunt rel and now harri if

wa so signific about it admittedli the fog and the fact that nobodi seem to have notic it wa odd but other than that noth seem to have happen except that voldemort had ask a question and fail to get an answer as you might have notic said dumbledor reseat himself behind hi desk that memori ha been tamper with tamper with repeat harri sit back down too certainli said dumbledor professor slughorn ha meddl with hi own recollect but whi would he do that becaus i think he is asham of what he rememb said dumbledor he ha tri to rework the memori to show himself in a better light obliter those part which he doe not wish me to see it is as you will have notic veri crude done and that is all to the good for it show that the true memori is still there beneath the alter and so for the first time i am give you homework harri it will be your job to persuad professor slughorn to divulg the real memori which will undoubtedli be our most crucial piec of inform of all harri stare at him but sure sir he said keep hi voic as respect as possibl you dont need me you could use legilim or veritaserum professor slughorn is an extrem abl wizard who will be expect both said dumbledor he is much more accomplish at occlum than poor morfin gaunt and i would be astonish if he ha not carri an antidot to veritaserum with him ever sinc i coerc him into give me thi travesti of a recollect no i think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from professor slughorn by forc and might do much more harm than good i do not wish him to leav hogwart howev he ha hi weak like the rest of us and i believ that you are the one person who might be abl to penetr hi defens it is most import that we secur the true memori harri how import we will onli know when we have seen the real thing so good luck

trelawney still isnt happi firenz is teach then harri ask no said dumbledor divin is turn out to be much more troubl than i could have foreseen never have studi the subject myself i can not ask firenz to return to the forest where he is now an outcast nor can i ask sybil trelawney to leav between ourselv she ha no idea of the danger she would be in outsid the castl she doe not know and i think it would be unwis to enlighten her that she made the propheci about you and voldemort you see dumbledor heav a deep sigh then said but never mind my staf problem we have much more import matter to discuss firstli have you manag the task i set you at the end of our previou lesson ah said harri brought up short what with apparit lesson and quidditch and ron be poison and get hi skull crack and hi determin to find out what draco malfoy wa up to harri had almost forgotten about the memori dumbledor had ask him to extract from professor slughorn well i ask professor slughorn about it at the end of potion sir but er he wouldnt give it to me there wa a littl silenc i see said dumbledor eventu peer at harri over the top of hi halfmoon spectacl and give harri the usual sensat that he wa be xray and you feel that you have exert your veri best effort in thi matter do you that you have exercis all of your consider ingenu that you have left no depth of cun unplumb in your quest to retriev the memori well harri stall at a loss for what to say next hi singl attempt to get hold of the memori suddenli seem embarrassingli feebl well the day ron swallow love potion by mistak i took him to professor slughorn i thought mayb if i got professor slughorn in a good enough mood and did that work ask dumbledor well no sir becaus ron got poison which natur made you forget all about tri to retriev the memori i would have expect noth els while your best friend wa in danger onc it becam clear that mr weasley wa go to make a full recoveri howev i would have hope that you return to the task i set you i thought i made it clear to you how veri import that memori is inde i did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memori of all and that we will be wast our time without it a hot prickli feel of shame spread from the top of harri head all the way down hi bodi dumbledor had not rais hi voic he did not even sound angri but harri would have prefer him to yell thi cold disappoint wa wors than anyth sir he said a littl desper it isnt that i wasnt bother or anyth ive just had other other thing other thing on your mind dumbledor finish the sentenc for him i see silenc fell between them again the most uncomfort silenc harri had ever experienc with dumbledor it seem to go on and on punctuat onli by the littl grunt snore of the portrait of armando dippet over dumbledor head harri felt strang diminish as though he had shrunk a littl sinc he had enter the room when he could stand it no longer he said professor dumbledor im realli sorri i should have done more i should have realiz you wouldnt have ask me to do it if it wasnt realli import thank you for say that harri said dumbledor quietli may i hope then that you will give thi matter higher prioriti from now on there will be littl point in our meet after tonight unless we have that memori ill do it sir ill get it from him he said earnestli then we shall say no more about it just now said dumbledor more kindli but continu with our stori where we left off you rememb where that wa ye sir said harri quickli voldemort kill hi father and hi grandpar and made it look as though hi uncl morfin did it then he went back to hogwart and he ask he ask professor slughorn about horcrux he mumbl shamefacedli veri good said dumbledor now you will rememb i hope that i told you at the veri outset of these meet of our that we would be enter the realm of guesswork and specul ye sir thu far as i hope you agre i have shown you reason firm sourc of fact for my deduct as to what voldemort did until the age of seventeen harri nod but now harri said dumbledor now thing becom murkier and stranger if it wa difficult to find evid about the boy riddl it ha been almost imposs to find anyon prepar to reminisc about the man voldemort in fact i doubt whether there is a soul aliv apart from himself who could give us a full account of hi life sinc he left hogwart howev i have two last memori that i would like to share with you dumbledor indic the two littl crystal bottl gleam besid the pensiev i shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclus i have drawn from them seem like the idea that dumbledor valu hi opinion thi highli made harri feel even more deepli asham that he had fail in the task of retriev the horcrux memori and he shift guiltili in hi seat as dumbledor rais the first of the two bottl to the light and examin it i hope you are not tire of dive into other peopl memori for they are curiou recollect these two he said thi first one came from a veri old houseelf by the name of hokey befor we see what hokey wit i must quickli recount how lord voldemort left hogwart he reach the seventh year of hi school with as you might have expect top grade in everi examin he had taken all around him hi classmat were decid which job they were to pursu onc they had left hogwart nearli everybodi expect spectacular thing from tom riddl prefect head boy winner of the award for special servic to the school i know that sever teacher professor slughorn amongst them suggest that he join the ministri of magic offer to set up appoint put him in touch with use contact he refus all offer the next thing the staff knew voldemort wa work at borgin and burk at borgin and burk harri repeat stun at borgin and burk repeat dumbledor calmli i think you will see what attract the place held for him when we have enter hokey memori but thi wa not voldemort first choic of job hardli anyon knew of it at the time i wa one of the few in whom the then headmast confid but voldemort first approach professor dippet and ask whether he could remain at hogwart as a teacher he want to stay here whi ask harri more amaz still i believ he had sever reason though he confid none of them to professor dippet said dumbledor firstli and veri importantli voldemort wa i believ more attach to thi school than he ha ever been to a person hogwart wa where he had been happiest the first and onli place he had felt at home harri felt slightli uncomfort at these word for thi wa exactli how he felt about hogwart too secondli the castl is a stronghold of ancient magic undoubtedli voldemort had penetr mani more of it secret than most of the student who pass through the place but he may have felt that there were still mysteri to unravel store of magic to tap and thirdli as a teacher he would have had great power and influenc over young witch and wizard perhap he had gain the idea from professor slughorn the teacher with whom he wa on best term who had demonstr how influenti a role a teacher can play i do not imagin for an instant that voldemort envisag spend the rest of hi life at hogwart but i do think that he saw it as a use recruit ground and a place where he might begin to build himself an armi but he didnt get the job sir no he did not professor dippet told him that he wa too young at eighteen but invit him to reappli in a few year if he still wish to teach how did you feel about that sir ask harri hesitantli deepli uneasi said dumbledor i had advis armando against the appoint i did not give the reason i have given you for professor dippet wa veri fond of voldemort and convinc of hi honesti but i did not want lord voldemort back at thi school and especi not in a posit of power which job did he want sir what subject did he want to teach somehow harri knew the answer even befor dumbledor gave it defens against the dark art it wa be taught at the time by an old professor by the name of galatea merrythought who had been at hogwart for nearli fifti year so voldemort went off to borgin and burk and all the staff who had admir him said what a wast it wa a brilliant young wizard like that work in a shop howev voldemort wa no mere assist polit and handsom and clever he wa soon given particular job of the type that onli exist in a place like borgin and burk which special as you know harri in object with unusu and power properti voldemort wa sent to persuad peopl to part with their treasur for sale by the partner and he wa by all account unusu gift at do thi ill bet he wa said harri unabl to contain himself well quit said dumbledor with a faint

no way said harri angrili i see we are of one mind said dumbledor certainli then are mani similar between thi death and that of the riddl in both case somebodi els took the blame someon who had a clear memori of have caus the death hokey confess she rememb put someth in her mistresss cocoa that turn out not to be sugar but a lethal and littleknown poison said dumbledor it wa conclud that she had not meant to do it but be old and confus voldemort modifi her memori just like he did with morfin ye that is my conclus too said dumbledor and just as with morfin the ministri wa predispos to suspect hokey becaus she wa a houseelf said harri he had rare felt more in sympathi with the societi hermion had set up spew precis said dumbledor she wa old she admit to have tamper with the drink and nobodi at the ministri bother to inquir further as in the case of morfin by the time i trace her and manag to extract thi memori her life wa almost over but her memori of cours prove noth except that voldemort knew of the exist of the cup and the locket by the time hokey wa convict hepzibah famili had realiz that two of her greatest treasur were miss it took them a while to be sure of thi for she had mani hide place have alway guard her collect most jealous but befor they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone the assist who had work at borgin and burk the young

as the other laugh again harri notic that he wa by no mean the eldest of the group of boy but that they all seem to look to him as their leader i dont know that polit would suit me sir he said when the laughter had die away i dont have the right kind of background for one thing a coupl of the boy around him smirk at each other harri wa sure they were enjoy a privat joke undoubtedli about what they knew or suspect regard their gang leader famou ancestor nonsens said slughorn briskli couldnt be plainer you come from decent wizard stock abil like your no youll go far tom ive never been wrong about a student yet the small golden clock stand upon slughorn desk chime eleven oclock behind him and he look around good graciou is it that time alreadi youd better get go boy or well all be in troubl lestrang i want your essay by in morrow or it detent same goe for you averi one by one the boy file out of the room slughorn heav himself out of hi armchair and carri hi empti glass over to hi desk a movement behind him made him look around riddl wa still stand there look shar p tom you dont want to be caught out of bed out of hour and you a prefect sir i want to ask you someth ask away then mboy ask away sir i wonder what you know about about horcrux slughorn stare at him hi thick ringer absentmindedli claw the stem of hi wine glass project for defens against the dark art is it but harri could tell that slughorn knew perfectli well that thi wa not schoolwork not exactli sir said riddl i came across the term while read and i didnt fulli understand it no well youd be hardpush to find a book at hogwart thatll give you detail on horcrux tom that veri dark stuff veri dark inde said slughorn but you obvious know all about them sir i mean a wizard like you sorri i mean if you cant tell me obvious i just knew if anyon could tell me you could so i just thought id – it wa veri well done thought harri the hesit the casual tone the care flatteri none of it overdon he harri had had too much experi of tri to wheedl inform out of reluct peopl not to recogn a master at work he could tell that riddl want the inform veri veri much perhap had been work toward thi moment for week well said slughorn not look at riddl but fiddl with the ribbon on top of hi box of crystal pineappl well it cant hurt to give you an overview of cours just so that you understand t he term a horcrux is the word use for an object in which a person ha conceal part of their soul i dont quit understand how that work though sir said riddl hi voic wa care control but harri could sens hi excit well you split your soul you see said slughorn and hide part of it in an object outsid the bodi then even if one bodi is attack or destroy one can not die for part of the soul remain earthbound and undamag but of cours exist in such a form slughorn face crumpl and harri found himself rememb word he had heard nearli two year befor i wa rip from my bodi i wa less than spirit less than the meanest ghost but still i wa aliv few would want it tom veri few death would be prefer but riddl hunger wa now appar hi express wa greedi he could no longer hide hi long how do you split your soul well said slughorn uncomfort you must understand that the soul is suppos to remain intact and whole split n it i an act of violat it is against natur but how do you do it by an act of evil the suprem act of evil by commit murder kill rip the soul apart the wizard intent upon creat a horcrux would use the damag to hi advantag he would encas the torn portion encas but how there is a spell do not ask me i dont know said slughoin shake hi head like an old eleph bother by mosquito do i look as though i have tri it do i look like a killer no sir of cours not said riddl quickli im sorri i didnt mean to offend not at all not at all not offend said slughorn gruffli it is natur to feel some curios about these thing wizard of a certain calib have alway been drawn to that aspect of magic ye sir said riddl what i dont understand though just out of curios i mean would one horcrux be much use can you onli split your soul onc wouldnt it be better make you stronger to have your soul in more piec i mean for instanc isnt seven the most power magic number wouldnt seven merlin beard tom yelp slughorn seven isnt it bad enough to think of kill one person and in ani case bad enough to divid the soul but to rip it into seven piec slughorn look deepli troubl now he wa gaze at riddl as though he had never seen him plainli befor and harri could tell that he wa regret enter into the convers at all of cours he mutter thi is all hypothet what were discuss isnt it all academ ye sir of cours said riddl quickli but all the same tom keep it quiet what ive told that to say what weve discuss peopl wouldnt like to think weve been chat about horcrux it a ban subject at hogwart you know dumbledor particularli fierc about it i wont say a word sir said riddl and he left but not befor harri had glimps hi face which wa full of that same wild happi it had worn when he had first found out that he wa a wizard the sort of happi that did not enhanc hi handsom featur but made them somehow less human thank you harri said dumbledor quietli let us go when harri land back on the offic floor dumbledor wa alreadi sit down behind hi desk harri sat too and wait for dumbledor to speak i have been hope for thi piec of evid for a veri long time said dumbledor at last it confirm the theori on which i have been work it tell me that i am right and also how veri far there is still to go harri suddenli notic that everi singl one of the old headmast and headmistress in the portrait around the wall wa awak and listen in on their convers a corpul red nose wizard had actual taken out an ear trumpet well harri said dumbledor i am sure you understood the signific of what we just heard at the same age as you are now give or take a few month tom riddl wa do all he could to find out how to make himself immort you think he succeed then sir ask harri he made a horcrux and that whi he didnt die when he attack me he had a horcrux hidden somewher a bit of hi soul wa safe a bit or more said dumbledor you heard voldemort what he particularli want from horac wa an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who creat more than one horcrux what would happen to the wizard so determin to evad death that he would be prepar to murder mani time rip hi soul repeatedli so as to store it in mani separ conceal horcruxc no book would have given him that inform as far as i know as far i am sure as voldemort knew no wizard had ever done more than tear hi soul in two dumbledor paus for a moment marshal hi thought and then said four year ago i receiv what i consid certain proof that voldemort had split hi soul where ask harri how you hand it to me harri said dumbledor the diari riddl diari the one give instruct on how to reopen the chamber of secret i dont understand sir said harri well although i did not see the riddl who came out of the diari what you describ to me wa a phenomenon i had never wit a mere memori start to act and think for itself a mere memori sap the life out of the girl into whose hand it had fallen no someth much more sinist had live insid that book a fragment of soul i wa almost sure of it the diari had been a horcrux but thi rais as mani question as it answer what intrigu and alarm me most wa that that diari had been intend as a weapon as much as a safeguard still dont understand said harri well it work as a horcrux is suppos to work in other word the fragment of soul conceal insid it wa kept safe and had undoubtedli play it part in prevent the death of it owner but there could be no doubt that riddl realli want that diari read want the piec of hi soul to inhabit or possess somebodi els so that slytherin monster would be unleash again well he didnt want hi hard work to be wast said harri he want peopl to know he wa slytherin heir becaus he couldnt take credit at the time quit correct said dumbledor nod but dont you see harri that if he intend the diari to be pass to or plant on some futur hogwart student he wa be remark blase about that preciou fragment of hi soul conceal within it the point of a horcrux is as professor slughorn explain to keep part of the self hidden and safe not to fling it into somebodi els path and run the risk that they might destroy it as inde happen that particular fragment of soul is no more you saw to that the careless way in which voldemort regard thi horcrux seem most omin to me it suggest that he must have made or had been plan to make more horcrux so that the loss of hi first would not be so detriment i did not wish to believ it but noth els seem to make sens then you told me two year later that on the night that voldemort return to hi bodi he made a most illumin and alarm statement to hi death eater i who have gone further than anybodi along the path that lead to immort that wa what you told me he said further than anybodi and i thought i knew what that meant though the death eater did not he wa refer to hi horcrux horcrux in the plural harri which i dont believ ani other wizard ha ever had yet it fit lord voldomort ha seem to grow less human with the pass year and the transform he had undergon seem to me to be onli explain if hi soul wa mutil beyond the realm of what we might call usual evil so he made himself imposs to kill by murder other peopl said harri whi couldnt he make a sorcer stone or steal one if he wa so interest in immort well we know that he tri to do just that five year ago sn « l dumbledor but there are sever reason whi i think a sorcer stone would appeal less than horcrux to lord voldemort while the elixir of life doe inde extend life it must lie drunk regularli for all etern if the drinker is to maintain the immort therefor voldemort would be entir depend on the elixir and if it ran out or wa contamin or if the stone wa stolen he would die just like ani other man voldemort like to oper alon rememb i believ that he would have found the thought of be depend even on the elixir intoler of cours he wa prepar to drink it if it would take him out of the horribl partlif to which he wa condemn after attack you but onli to regain a bodi thereaft i am convinc he intend to continu to reli on hi horcrux he would need noth more if onli he could regain a human form he wa alreadi immort you see or as close to immort as ani man can be but now harri arm with thi inform the crucial memori you have succeed in procur for us we are closer to the secret of finish lord voldemort than anyon ha ever been befor you heard him harri wouldnt it be better make you stronger to have your soul in more piec isnt seven the most power magic number isnt seven the most power magic number ye i think the idea of a sevenpart soul would greatli appeal to lord voldemort he made seven horcrux said harri horrorstruck while sever of the portrait on the wall made similar nois of shock mid outrag but they could be anywher in the world hidden buri or invis i am glad to see you appreci the magnitud of the problem said dumbledor calmli but firstli no harri not seven horcrux six the seventh part of hi soul howev maim resid insid hi regener bodi that wa the part of him that live a spectral exist for so mani year dure hi exil without that he ha no self at all that seventh piec of soul will be the last that anybodi wish to kill voldemort must attack the piec that live in hi bodi but the six horcrux then said harri a littl desper how are we suppos to find them you are forget you have alreadi destroy one of them and i have destroy anoth you have said harri eagerli ye inde said dumbledor and he rais hi blacken burnedlook hand the ring harri marvolo ring and a terribl curs there wa upon it too had it not been forgiv me the lack of seemli modesti for my own prodigi skill and for professor snape time action when i return to hogwart desper injur i might not have live to tell the tale howev a wither hand doe not seem an unreason exchang for a seventh of voldemort soul the ring is no longer a horcrux but how did you find it well as you now know for mani year i have made it my busi to discov as much as i can about voldemort past life i have travel wide visit those place he onc knew i stumbl across the ring hidden in the ruin of the gaunt hous it seem that onc voldemort had succeed in seal a piec of hi soul in side it he did not want to wear it anymor he hid it protect by mani power enchant in the shack where hi ancestor had onc live morfin have been cart off to azkaban of cours never guess that i might one day take the troubl to visit the ruin or that i might be keep an eye open for trace of magic conceal howev we should not congratul ourselv too heartili you destroy the diari and i the ring but if we are right in our theori of a sevenpart soul four horcrux remain and they could be anyth said harri they could be oh in tin can or i dunno empti potion bottl you are think of portkey harri which must be ordinari object easi to overlook but would lord voldemort use tin can or old potion bottl to guard hi own preciou soul you are forget what i have show you lord voldemort like to collect trophi and he prefer object with a power magic histori hi pride hi belief in hi own superior hi determin to carv for himself a startl place in magic histori these thing suggest to me that voldemort would have chosen hi horcruxr with some care favor object worthi of the honor the diari wasnt that special the diari as you have said yourself wa proof that he wa the hire of slytherin i am sure that voldemort consid it of stupend import so the other horcrux said harri do you think you know what they are sir i can onli guess said dumbledor for the reason i have alreadi given i believ that lord voldemort would prefer object that in themselv have a certain grandeur i have therefor trawl back through voldemort past to see if i can find evid that such artifact have disappear around him the locket said harri loudli hufflepuff cup ye said dumbledor smile i would be prepar to bet perhap not my other hand but a coupl of finger that they becam horcrux three and four the remain two assum again that he creat a total of six are more of a problem but i will hazard a guess that have secur object from hufflepuff and slytherin he set out to track down object own by gryffindor or ravenclaw four object from the four founder would i am sure have exert a power pull over voldemort imagin i can not answer for whether he ever manag to find anyth of ravenclaw i am confid howev that the onli known relic of gryffindor remain safe dumbledor point hi blacken finger to the wall behind him where a rubyencrust sword repos within a glass case do you think that whi he realli want to come back to hogwart sir said harri to tri and find someth from one of the other founder my thought precis said dumbledor but unfortun that doe not advanc us much further for he wa turn away or so i believ without the chanc to search the school i am forc to conclud that he never fulfil hi ambit of collect four founder object he definit had two he may have found three that is the best we can do for now even if he got someth of ravenclaw or of gryffindor that leav a sixth horcrux said harri count on hi finger unless he got both i dont think so said dumbledor i think i know what the sixth horcrux is i wonder what you will say when i confess that i have been curiou for a while about the behavior of the snake nagini the snake said harri startl you can use anim as horcrux well it is inadvis to do so said dumbledor becaus to confid a part of your soul to someth that can think and move for itself is obvious a veri riski busi howev if my calcul are correct voldemort wa still at least one horcrux short of hi goal of six when he enter your parent hous with the intent of kill you he seem to have reserv the process of make horcrux for particularli signific death you would certainli have been that he believ that in kill you he wa destroy the danger the propheci had outlin he believ he wa make himself invinc i am sure that he wa intend to make hi final horcrux with your death as we know he fail after an interv of some year howev he use nagini to kill an old muggl man and it might then have occur to him to turn her into hi last horcrux she underlin the slytherin connect which enhanc lord voldemort mystiqu i think he is perhap as fond of her as he can be of anyth he certainli like to keep her close and he seem to have an unusu amount of control over her even for a parselmouth so said harri the diari gone the ring gone the cup the locket and the snake are still intact and you think there might be a horcrux that wa onc ravenclaw or gryffindor an admir succinct and accur summari ye said dumbledor bow hi head so are you still look for them sir is that where youv been go when youv been leav the school correct said dumbledor i have been look for a veri long time i think perhap i may be close to find anoth one there are hope sign and if you do said harri quickli can i come with you and help get rid of it dumbledor look at harri veri intent for a moment befor say ye i think so i can said harri thoroughli taken aback oh ye said dumbledor smile slightli i think you have earn that right harri felt hi heart lift it wa veri good not to hear word of caution and protect for onc the headmast and headmistress around the wall seem less impress by dumbledor decis harri saw a few of them shake their head and phinea nigellu actual snort doe voldemort know when a horcrux is destroy sir can he feel it harri ask ignor the portrait a veri interest question harri i believ not i believ that voldemort is now so immers in evil and these crucial part of himself have been detach for so long he doe not feel as we do perhap at the point of death he might be awar of hi loss but he wa not awar for instanc that the diari had been destroy until he forc the truth out of luciu malfoy when voldemort discov that the diari had been mutil and rob of all it power i am told that hi anger wa terribl to behold but i thought he meant luciu malfoy to smuggl it into hogwart ye he did year ago when he wa sure he would be abl to creat more horcrux but still luciu wa suppos to wait for voldemort sayso and he never receiv it for voldemort vanish shortli after give him the diari no doubt he thought that luciu would not dare do anyth with the horcrux other than guard it care but he wa count too much upon luciuss fear of a master who had been gone for year and whom luciu believ dead of cours luciu did not know what the diari realli wa i understand that voldemort had told him the diari would caus the chamber of secret to reopen becaus it wa cleverli enchant had luciu known he held a portion of hi master soul in hi hand he would undoubtedli have treat it with more rever but instead he went ahead and carri out the old plan for hi own end by plant the diari upon arthur weasley daughter he hope to discredit arthur and get rid of a highli incrimin magic object in one stroke ah poor luciu what with voldemort furi about the fact that he threw away the horcrux for hi own gain and the fiasco at the ministri last year i would not be surpris if he is not secretli glad to be safe in azkaban at the moment harri sat in thought for a moment then ask so if all of hi horcrux are destroy voldemort couldb kill ye i think so said dumbledor without hi horcrux voldemort will be a mortal man with a maim and diminish soul never forget though that while hi soul may be damag beyond repair hi brain and hi magic power remain intact it will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like voldemort even without hi horcrux but i havent got uncommon skill and power said harri befor he could stop himself ye you have said dumbledor firmli you have a power that voldemort ha never had you can i know said harri impati i can love it wa onli with difficulti that he stop himself ad big deal ye harri you can love said dumbledor who look as though he knew perfectli well what harri had just refrain from say which given everyth that ha happen to you is a great and remark thing you are still too young to understand how unusu you are harri so when the propheci say that ill have power the dark lord know not it just mean love ask harri feel a littl let down ye just love said dumbledor but harri never forget that what the propheci say is onli signific becaus voldemort made it so i told you thi at the end of last year voldemort singl you out as the person who would be most danger to him and in do so he made you the person who would be most danger to him but it come to the same no it doesnt said dumbledor sound impati now point at harri with hi black wither hand he said you are set too much store by the propheci but splutter harri but you said the propheci mean if voldemort had never heard of the propheci would it have been fulfil would it have meant anyth of cours not ho you think everi propheci in the hall of propheci ha been fulfil but said harri bewild but last year you said one of us would have to kill the other harri harri onli becaus voldemort made a grave error and act on professor trelawney word if voldemort had never murder your father would he have impart in you a furiou desir for reveng of cours not if he had not forc your mother to die for you would he have given you a magic protect he could not penetr of cours not harri dont you see voldemort himself creat hi worst enemi just as tyrant everywher do have you ani idea how much tyrant fear the peopl they oppress all of them realiz that one day amongst their mani victim there is sure to be one who rise against them and strike back voldemort is no differ alway he wa on the lookout for the one who would challeng him he heard the propheci and he leapt into action with the result that he not onli handpick the man most like to finish him he hand him uniqu deadli weapon but it is essenti that you understand thi said dumbledor stand up and stride about the room hi glitter robe swoosh in hi wake harri had never seen him so agit by attempt to kill you voldemort himself singl out the remark person who sit here in front of me and gave him the tool for the job it is voldemort fault that you were abl to see into hi thought hi ambit that you even understand the snakelik languag in which he give order and yet harri despit your privileg insight into voldemort world which incident is a gift ani death eater would kill to have you have never been seduc by the dark art never even for a second shown the slightest desir to becom one of voldemort follow of cours i havent said harri indignantli he kill my mum and dad you are protect in short by your abil to love said dumbledor loudli the onli protect that can possibl work against the lure of power like voldemort in spite of all the temptat you have endur all the suffer you remain pure of heart just as pure as you were at the age of eleven when you stare into a mirror that reflect your heart desir and it show you onli the way to thwart lord voldemort and not immort or rich harri have you ani idea how few wizard could have seen what you saw in that mirror voldemort should have known then what he wa deal with but he did not but he know it now you have flit into lord voldemort mind without damag to yourself but he can not possess you without endur mortal agoni as he discov in the ministri i do not think he understand whi harri but then he wa in such a hurri to mutil hi own soul he never paus to understand the incompar power of a soul that is untarnish and whole but sir said harri make valiant effort not to sound argument it all come to the same thing doesnt it ive got to tri and kill him or got to said dumbledor of cours youv got to but not becaus of the propheci becaus you yourself will never rest until youv tri we both know it imagin pleas just for a moment that you had never heard that propheci how would you feel about voldemort now think harri watch dumbledor stride up and down in front ol him and thought he thought of hi mother hi father and sinu he thought of cedric diggori he thought of all the terribl deed he knew lord voldemort had done a flame seem to leap insid hi chest sear hi throat id want him finish said harri quietli and id want to do it of cours you would cri dumbledor you see the propheci doe not mean you have to do anyth but the propheci caus lord voldemort to mark you as hi equal in other word you are free to choos your way quit free to turn your back on the propheci but voldemort continu to set store by the propheci he will continu to hunt you which make it certain realli that that one of us is go to end up kill the other said harri ye but he understood at last what dumbledor had been tri to tell him it wa he thought the differ between be drag into the arena to face a battl to the death and walk into the arena with your head held high some peopl perhap would say that there wa littl to choos between the two way but dumbledor knew and so do i thought harri with a rush of fierc pride and so did my parent that there wa all the differ in the

broomstick the pub appear to be complet empti it will not be necessari for us to enter mutter dumbledor glanc around as long as nobodi see us go now place your hand upon my arm harri there is no need to grip too hard i am mere guid you on the count of three one two three harri turn at onc there wa that horribl sensat that he wa be squeez through a thick rubber tube he could not draw breath everi part of him wa be compress almost past endur and then just when he thought he must suffoc the invis band seem to burst open and he wa stand in cool dark breath in lung of fresh salti air chapter the cave harri could smell salt and hear rush wave a light chilli breez ruffl hi hair as he look out at moonlit sea and starstrewn sky he wa stand upon a high outcrop of dark rock water foam and churn below him he glanc over hi shoulder a tower cliff stood behind them a sheer drop black and faceless a few larg chunk of rock such as the one upon which harri and dumbledor were stand look as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past it wa a bleak harsh view the sea and the rock unreliev by ani tree or sweep of grass or sand what do you think ask dumbledor he might have been ask harri opinion on whether it wa a good site for a picnic they brought the kid from the orphanag here ask harri who could not imagin a less cozi spot for a day trip not here precis said dumbledor there is a villag of sort about halfway along the cliff behind us i believ the orphan were taken there for a littl sea air and a view of the wave no i think it wa onli ever tom riddl and hi youth victim who visit thi spot no muggl could reach thi rock unless they were uncommonli good mountain and boat can not approach the cliff the water around them are too danger i imagin that riddl climb down magic would have serv better than rope and he brought two small children with him probabl for the pleasur of terror them i think the journey alon would have done it dont you harri look up at the cliff again and felt goos bump but hi final destin and our lie a littl farther on come dumbledor beckon harri to the veri edg of the rock where a seri of jag nich made foothold lead down to boulder that lay halfsubmerg in water and closer to the cliff it wa a treacher descent and dumbledor hamper slightli by hi wither hand move slowli the lower rock were slipperi with seawat harri could feel fleck of cold salt spray hit hi face lumo said dumbledor as he reach the boulder closest to the cliff face a thousand fleck of golden light sparkl upon the dark surfac of the water a few feet below where he crouch the black wall of rock besid him wa illumin too you see said dumbledor quietli hold hi wand a littl higher harri saw a fissur in the cliff into which dark water wa swirl you will not object to get a littl wet no said harri then take off your invis cloak there is no need for it now and let us take the plung and with the sudden agil of a much younger man dumbledor slid from the boulder land in the sea and began to swim with a perfect breaststrok toward the dark slit in the rock face hi lit wand held in hi teeth harri pull off hi cloak stuf it into hi pocket and follow the water wa ici harri waterlog cloth billow around him and weigh him down take deep breath that fill hi nostril with the tang of salt and seawe he struck out for the shimmer shrink light now move deeper into the cliff the fissur soon open into a dark tunnel that harri could tell would be fill with water at high tide the slimi wall were bare three feet apart and glimmer like wet tar in the pass light of dumbledor wand a littl way in the passageway curv to the left and harri saw that it extend far into the cliff he continu to swim in dumbledor wake the tip of hi benumb finger brush the rough wet rock then he saw dumbledor rise out of the water ahead hi silver hair and dark robe gleam when harri reach the spot he found step that led into a larg cave he clamber up them water stream from hi soak cloth and emerg shiver uncontrol into the still and freez air dumbledor wa stand in the middl of the cave hi wand held high as he turn slowli on the spot examin the wall and ceil ye thi is the place said dumbledor how can you tell harri spoke in a whisper it ha known magic said dumbledor simpli harri could not tell whether the shiver he wa experienc were due to hi spinedeep cold or to the same awar of enchant he watch as dumbledor continu to revolv on the spot evid concentr on thing harri could not see thi is mere the antechamb the entranc hall said dumbledor after a moment or two we need to penetr the inner place now it is lord voldemort obstacl that stand in our way rather than those natur made dumbledor approach the wall of the cave and caress it with hi blacken fingertip murmur word in a strang tongu that harri did not understand twice dumbledor walk right around the cave touch as much of the rough rock as he could occasion paus run hi finger backward and forward over a particular spot until final he stop hi hand press flat against the wall here he said we go on through here the entranc is conceal harri did not ask how dumbledor knew he had never seen a wizard work thing out like thi simpli by look and touch but harri had long sinc learn that bang and smoke were more often the mark of ineptitud than expertis dumbledor step back from the cave wall and point hi wand at the rock for a moment an arch outlin appear there blaze white as though there wa a power light behind the crack youv ddone it said harri through chatter teeth but befor the word had left hi lip the outlin had gone leav the rock as bare and solid as ever dumbledor look around harri im so sorri i forgot he said he now point hi wand at harri and at onc harri cloth were as warm and dri as if they had been hang in front of a blaze fire thank you said harri grate but dumbledor had alreadi turn hi attent back to the solid cave wall he did not tri ani more magic but simpli stood there stare at it intent as though someth extrem interest wa written on it harri stay quit still he did not want to break dumbledor concentr then after two solid minut dumbledor said quietli oh sure not so crude what is it professor i rather think said dumbledor put hi uninjur hand insid hi robe and draw out a short silver knife of the kind harri use to chop potion ingredi that we are requir to make payment to pass payment said harri youv got to give the door someth ye said dumbledor blood if i am not much mistaken blood i said it wa crude said dumbledor who sound disdain even disappoint as though voldemort had fallen short of higher standard dumbledor expect the idea as i am sure you will have gather is that your enemi must weaken him or herself to enter onc again lord voldemort fail to grasp that there are much more terribl thing than physic injuri yeah but still if you can avoid it said harri who had experienc enough pain not to be keen for more sometim howev it is unavoid said dumbledor shake back the sleev of hi robe and expos the forearm of hi injur hand professor protest harri hurri forward as dumbledor rais hi knife ill do it im he did not know what he wa go to say younger fitter but dumbledor mere smile there wa a flash of silver and a spurt of scarlet the rock face wa pepper with dark glisten drop you are veri kind harri said dumbledor now pass the tip of hi wand over the deep cut he had made in hi own arm so that it heal instantli just as snape had heal malfoy wound but your blood is worth more than mine ah that seem to have done the trick doesnt it the blaze silver outlin of an arch had appear in the wall onc more and thi time it did not fade away the bloodspatt rock within it simpli vanish leav an open into what seem total dark after me i think said dumbledor and he walk through the archway with harri on hi heel light hi own wand hastili as he went an eeri sight met their eye they were stand on the edg of a great black lake so vast that harri could not make out the distant bank in a cavern so high that the ceil too wa out of sight a misti greenish light shone far away in what look like the middl of the lake it wa reflect in the complet still water below the greenish glow and the light from the two wand were the onli thing that broke the otherwis velveti black though their ray did not penetr as far as harri would have expect the dark wa somehow denser than normal dark let us walk said dumbledor quietli be veri care not to step into the water stay close to me he set off around the edg of the lake and harri follow close behind him their footstep made echo slap sound on the narrow rim of rock that surround the water on and on they walk but the view did not vari on one side of them the rough cavern wall on the other the boundless expans of smooth glassi black in the veri middl of which wa that mysteri greenish glow harri found the place and the silenc oppress unnerv professor he said final do you think the horcrux is here oh ye said dumbledor ye im sure it is the question is how do we get to it we couldnt we couldnt just tri a summon charm harri said sure that it wa a stupid suggest but he wa much keener than he wa prepar to admit on get out of thi place as soon as possibl certainli we could said dumbledor stop so suddenli that harri almost walk into him whi dont you do it me oh okay harri had not expect thi but clear hi throat and said loudli wand aloft accio horcrux with a nois like an explos someth veri larg and pale erupt out of the dark water some twenti feet away befor harri could see what it wa it had vanish again with a crash splash that made great deep rippl on the mirror surfac harri leapt backward in shock and hit the wall hi heart wa still thunder as he turn to dumbledor what wa that someth i think that is readi to respond should we attempt to seiz the horcrux harri look back at the water the surfac of the lake wa onc more shine black glass the rippl had vanish unnatur fast harri heart howev wa still pound did you think that would happen sir i thought someth would happen if we made an obviou attempt to get our hand on the horcrux that wa a veri good idea harri much the simplest way of find out what we are face but we dont know what the thing wa said harri look at the sinisterli smooth water what the thing are you mean said dumbledor i doubt veri much that there is onli one of them shall we walk on professor ye harri do you think were go to have to go into the lake into it onli if we are veri unfortun you dont think the horcrux is at the bottom oh no i think the horcrux is in the middl and dumbledor point toward the misti green light in the center of the lake so were go to have to cross the lake to get to it ye i think so harri did not say anyth hi thought were all of water monster of giant serpent of demon kelpi and sprite aha said dumbledor and he stop again thi time harri realli did walk into him for a moment he toppl on the edg of the dark water and dumbledor uninjur hand close tightli around hi upper arm pull him back so sorri harri i should have given warn stand back against the wall pleas i think i have found the place harri had no idea what dumbledor meant thi patch of dark bank wa exactli like everi other bit as far as he could tell but dumbledor seem to have detect someth special about it thi time he wa run hi hand not over the rocki wall but t hrough the thin air as though expect to find and grip someth invis oho said dumbledor happili second later hi hand had close in midair upon someth harri could not see dumbledor move closer to the water harri watch nervous as the tip of dumbledor buckl shoe found the utmost edg of the rock rim keep hi hand clench in midair dumbledor rais hi wand with the other and tap hi fist with the point immedi a thick copperi green chain appear out of thin air extend from the depth of the water into dumbledor clench hand dumbledor tap the chain which began to slide through hi fist like a snake coil itself on the ground with a clink sound that echo noisili off the rocki wall pull someth from the depth of the black water harri gasp as the ghostli prow of a tini boat broke the surfac glow as green as the chain and float with bare a rippl toward the place on the bank where harri and dumbledor stood how did you know that wa there harri ask in astonish magic alway leav trace said dumbledor as the boat hit the bank with a gentl bump sometim veri distinct trace i taught tom riddl i know hi style is is thi boat safe oh ye i think so voldemort need to creat a mean to cross the lake without attract the wrath of those creatur he had place within it in case he ever want to visit or remov hi horcrux so the thing in the water wont do anyth to us if we cross in voldemort boat i think we must resign ourselv to the fact that they will at some point realiz we are not lord voldemort thu far howev we have done well they have allow us to rais the boat but whi have they let us ask harri who could not shake off the vision of tentacl rise out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank voldemort would have been reason confid that none but a veri great wizard would have been abl to find the boat said dumbledor i think he would have been prepar to risk what wa to hi mind the most unlik possibl that somebodi els would find it know that he had set other obstacl ahead that onli he would be abl to penetr we shall see whether he wa right harri look down into the boat it realli wa veri small it doesnt look like it wa built for two peopl will it hold both of us will we be too heavi togeth dumbledor chuckl voldemort will not have care about the weight but about the amount of magic power that cross hi lake i rather think an enchant will have been place upon thi boat so that onli one wizard at a time will be abl to sail in it but then i do not think you will count harri you are underag and unqualifi voldemort would never have expect a sixteenyearold to reach thi place i think it unlik that your power will regist compar to mine these word did noth to rais harri moral perhap dumbledor knew it for he ad voldemort mistak harri voldemort mistak age is foolish and forget when it underestim youth now you first thi time and be care not to touch the water dumbledor stood asid and harri climb care into the boat dumbledor step in too coil the chain onto the floor they were cram in togeth harri could not comfort sit but crouch hi knee jut over the edg of the boat which began to move at onc there wa no sound other than the silken rustl of the boat prow cleav the water it move without their help as though an invis rope wa pull it onward toward the light in the center soon they could no longer see the wall of the cavern they might have been at sea except that there were no wave harri look down and saw the reflect gold of hi wandlight sparkl and glitter on the black water as they pass the boat wa carv deep rippl upon the glassi surfac groov in the dark mirror and then harri saw it marbl white float inch below the surfac professor he said and hi startl voic echo loudli over the silent water harri i think i saw a hand in the water a human hand ye i am sure you did said dumbledor calmli harri stare down into the water look for the vanish hand and a sick feel rose in hi throat so that thing that jump out of the water but harri had hi answer befor dumbledor could repli the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and show him thi time a dead man lie faceup inch beneath the surfac hi open eye mist as though with cobweb hi hair and hi robe swirl around him like smoke there are bodi in here said harri and hi voic sound much higher than usual and most unlik hi own ye said dumbledor placidli but we do not need to worri about them at the moment at the moment harri repeat tear hi gaze from the water to look at dumbledor not while they are mere drift peac below us said dumbledor there is noth to be fear from a bodi harri ani more than there is anyth to be fear from the dark lord voldemort who of cours secretli fear both disagre but onc again he reveal hi own lack of wisdom it is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and dark noth more harri said noth he did not want to argu but he found the idea that there were bodi float around them and beneath them horribl and what wa more he did not believ that they were not danger but one of them jump he said tri to make hi voic as level and calm as dumbledor when i tri to summon the horcrux a bodi leapt out of the lake ye said dumbledor i am sure that onc we take the horcrux we shall find them less peaceabl howev like mani creatur that dwell in cold and dark they fear light and warmth which we shall therefor call to our aid should the need aris fire harri dumbledor ad with a smile in respons to harri bewild express oh right said harri quickli he turn hi head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat wa still inexor sail he could not pretend now that he wa not scare the great black lake teem with the dead it seem hour and hour ago that he had met professor trelawney that he had given ron and hermion felix felici he suddenli wish he had said a better goodby to them and he hadnt seen ginni at all nearli there said dumbledor cheer sure enough the greenish light seem to be grow larger at last and within minut the boat had come to a halt bump gentli into someth that harri could not see at first but when he rais hi illumin wand he saw that they had reach a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake care not to touch the water said dumbledor again as harri climb out of the boat the island wa no larger than dumbledor offic an expans of flat dark stone on which stood noth but the sourc of that greenish light which look much brighter when view close to harri squint at it at first he thought it wa a lamp of some kind but then he saw that the light wa come from a stone basin rather like the pensiev which wa set on top of a pedest dumbledor approach the basin and harri follow side by side they look down into it the basin wa full of an emerald liquid emit that phosphoresc glow what is it ask harri quietli i am not sure said dumbledor someth more worrisom than blood and bodi howev dumbledor push back the sleev of hi robe over hi blacken hand and stretch out the tip of hi burn finger toward the surfac of the potion sir no dont touch i can not touch said dumbledor smile faintli see i can not approach ani nearer than thi you tri stare harri put hi hand into the basin and attempt to touch the potion he met an invis barrier that prevent him come within an inch of it no matter how hard he push hi finger encount noth but what seem to be solid and flexibl air out of the way pleas harri said dumbledor he rais hi wand and made complic movement over the surfac of thepot murmur soundlessli noth happen except per hap that the potion glow a littl brighter harri remain silent while dumbledor work but after a while dumbledor withdrew hi wand and harri felt it wa safe to talk again you think the horcrux is in there sir oh ye dumbledor peer more close into the basin harri saw hi face reflect upsid down in the smooth surfac of the green potion but how to reach it thi potion can not be penetr by hand vanish part scoop up or siphon away nor can it be transfigur charm or otherwis made to chang it natur almost absentmindedli dumbledor rais hi wand again twirl it onc in midair and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjur out of nowher i can onli conclud that thi potion is suppos to be drunk what said harri no ye i think so onli by drink it can i empti the basin and see what lie in it depth but what if what if it kill you oh i doubt that it would work like that said dumbledor easili lord voldemort would not want to kill the person who reach thi island harri couldnt believ it wa thi more of dumbledor insan determin to see good in everyon sir said harri tri to keep hi voic reason sir thi is voldemort were im sorri harri i should have said he would not want to immedi kill the person who reach thi island dumbledor correct himself he would want to keep them aliv long enough to find out how they manag to penetr so far through hi defens and most importantli of all whi they were so intent upon empti the basin do not forget that lord voldemort believ that he alon know about hi horcrux harri made to speak again but thi time dumbledor rais hi hand for silenc frown slightli at the emerald liquid evid think hard undoubtedli he said final thi potion must act in a way that will prevent me take the horcrux it might paralyz me caus me to forget what i am here for creat so much pain i am distract or render me incap in some other way thi be the case harri it will be your job to make sure i keep drink even if you

back hi sleev onc more and rais the empti goblet you have my order whi cant i drink the potion instead ask harri desper becaus i am much older much clever and much less valuabl said dumbledor onc and for all harri do i have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drink couldnt do i have it but your word harri i all right but befor harri could make ani further protest dumbledor lower the crystal goblet into the potion for a split second harri hope that he would not be abl to touch the potion with the goblet but the crystal sank into the surfac as noth els had when the glass

harri who want everi detail of snape duplic and infami feverishli collect more reason to hate him to swear vengeanc i dont know exactli how it happen said professor mcgonagal distractedli it all so confus dumbledor had told us that he would be leav the school for a few hour and that we were to patrol the corridor just in case remu bill and nymphadora were to join us and so we patrol all seem

enter i do said harri and he explain briefli about the pair of vanish cabinet and the magic pathway they form so they got in through the room of requir almost against hi will he glanc from ron to hermion both of whom look devast i mess up harri said ron bleakli we did like you told us we check the maraud map and we couldnt see malfoy on it so we thought he must be in the room of requir so me ginni and nevil went to keep watch on it but malfoy got past us he came out of the room about an hour after we start keep watch said ginni he wa on hi own clutch that aw shrivel arm hi hand of glori said ron give light onli to the holder rememb anyway ginni went on he must have been check whether the coast wa clear to let the death eater out becaus the moment he saw us he threw someth into the air and it all went pitchblack peruvian instant dark powder said ron bitterli fred and georg im go to be have a word with them about who they let buy their product we tri everyth lumo incendio said ginni noth would penetr the dark all we could do wa grope our way out of the corridor again and meanwhil we could hear peopl rush past us obvious malfoy could see becaus of that hand thing and wa guid them but we didnt dare use ani curs or anyth in case we hit each other and by the time wed reach a corridor that wa light theyd gone luckili said lupin hoars ron ginni and nevil ran into us almost immedi and told us what had happen we found the death eater minut later head in the direct of the astronomi tower malfoy obvious hadnt expect more peopl to be on the watch he seem to have exhaust hi suppli of dark powder at ani rate a fight broke out they scatter and we gave chase one of them gibbon broke away and head up the tower stair to set off the mark ask harri he must have done ye they must have arrang that befor they left the room of requir said lupin but i dont think gibbon like the idea of wait up there alon for dumbledor becaus he came run back downstair to rejoin the fight and wa hit by a kill curs that just miss me so if ron wa watch the room of requir with ginni and nevil said harri turn to hermion were you outsid snape offic ye whisper hermion her eye sparkl with tear with luna we hung around for age outsid it and noth happen we didnt know what wa go on upstair ron had taken the mapit wa nearli midnight when professor flitwick came sprint down into the dungeon he wa shout about death eater in the castl i dont think he realli regist that luna and i were there at all he just burst hi way into snape offic and we heard him say that snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and snape came hurtl out of hi room and he saw us and and what harri urg her i wa so stupid harri said hermion in a highpitch whisper he said professor flitwick had collaps and that we should go and take care of him while he while he went to help fight the death eater she cover her face in shame and continu to talk into her finger so that her voic wa muffl we went into hi offic to see if we could help professor flitwick and found him unconsci on the floor and oh it so obviou now snape must have stupefi flitwick but we didnt realiz harri we didnt realiz we just let snape go it not your fault said lupin firmli hermion had you not obey snape and got out of the way he probabl would have kill you and luna so then he came upstair said harri who wa watch snape run up the marbl staircas in hi mind eye hi black robe billow behind him as ever pull hi wand from under hi cloak as he ascend and he found the place where you were all fight we were in troubl we were lose said tonk in a low voic gibbon wa down but the rest of the death eater seem readi to fight to the death nevil had been hurt bill had been savag by greyback it wa all dark curs fli everywher the malfoy boy had vanish he must have slip past up the stair then more of them ran after him but one of them block the stair behind them with some kind of curs nevil ran at it and got thrown up into the air none of us could break through said ron and that massiv death eater wa still fire off jinx all over the place they were bounc off the wall and bare miss us and then snape wa there said tonk and then he wasnt i saw him run toward us but that huge death eater jinx just miss me right afterward and i duck and lost track of thing said ginni i saw him run straight through the curs barrier as though it wasnt there said lupin i tri to follow him but wa thrown back just like nevil he must have known a spell we didnt whisper mcgonagal after all he wa the defens against the dark art teacher i just assum that he wa in a hurri to chase after the death eater whod escap up to the tower he wa said harri savag but to help them not to stop them and ill bet you had to have a dark mark to get through that barrier so what happen when he came back down well the big death eater had just fire off a hex that caus half the ceil to fall in and also broke the curs block the stair said lupin we all ran forward those of us who were still stand anyway and then snape and the boy emerg out of the dust obvious none of us attack them we just let them pass said tonk in a hollow voic we thought they were be chase by the death eater and next thing the other death eater and greyback were back and we were fight again i thought i heard snape shout someth but i dont know what he shout

further along the dark and wind path stretch ahead of him the path that he and dumbledor had set out upon togeth and which he now knew he would have to journey alon there might still be as mani as four horcrux out there somewher and each would need to be found and elimin befor there wa even a possibl that voldemort could be kill he kept recit their name to himself as though by list them he could bring them within reach the locket the cup the snake someth of gryffindor or ravenclaw the locket the cup the snake someth of gryffindor or ravenclaw thi mantra seem to puls through harri mind as he fell asleep at night and hi dream were thick with cup locket and mysteri object that he could not quit reach though dumbledor help offer harri a rope ladder that turn to snake the moment he began to climb he had shown hermion the note insid the locket the morn after dumbledor death and although she had not immedi recognis the initi as belong to some obscur wizard about whom she had been
