dream in which he had been wrap so long sinc the great ride began the dark world wa rush by and the wind sang loudli in hi ear he could see noth but the wheel star and away to hi right vast shadow against the sky where the mountain of the south march past sleepili he tri to reckon the time and stage of their journey but hi memori wa drowsi and uncertain there had been the first ride at terribl speed without a halt and then in the dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold and they had come to the silent town and the great empti hous on the hill and hardli had they reach it shelter when the wing shadow had pass over onc again and men wilt with fear but gandalf had spoken soft word to him and he had slept in a corner tire but uneasi dimli awar of come and go and of men talk and gandalf give order and then again ride ride in the night thi wa the second no the third night sinc he had look in the stone and with that hideou memori he woke fulli and shiver and the nois of the wind becam fill with menac voic a light kindl in the sky a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barrier pippin cower back afraid for a moment wonder into what dread countri gandalf wa bear him he rub hi eye and then he saw that it wa the moon rise abov the eastern shadow now almost at the full so the night wa not yet old and for hour the dark journey would go on he stir and spoke where are we gandalf he ask in the realm of gondor the wizard answer the land of anórien is still pass by there wa a silenc again for a while then what is that cri pippin suddenli clutch at gandalf cloak look fire red fire are there

fire on amon dîn and flame on eilenach and there they go speed west nardol erela minrimmon calenhad and the halifirien on the border of rohan but shadowfax paus in hi stride slow to a walk and then he lift up hi head and neigh and out of the dark the answer neigh of other hors came and present the thud of hoof wa heard and three rider swept up and pass like fli ghost in the moon and vanish into the west then shadowfax gather himself togeth and sprang away and the night flow over him like a roar wind pippin becam drowsi again and paid littl attent to gandalf tell him of the custom of gondor and how the lord of the citi had beacon built on the top of outli hill along both border of the great rang and maintain post at these point where fresh hors were alway in readi to bear hi errandrid to rohan in the north or to belfala in the south it is long sinc the beacon of the north were lit he said and in the ancient day of gondor they were not need for they had the seven stone pippin stir uneasili sleep again and do not be afraid said gandalf for you are not go like frodo to mordor but to mina tirith and there you will be as safe as you can be anywher in these day if gondor fall or the ring is taken then the shire will be no refug you do not comfort me said pippin but nonetheless sleep crept over him the last thing that he rememb befor he fell into deep dream wa a glimps of high white peak glimmer like float isl abov the cloud as they caught the light of the wester moon he wonder where frodo wa and if he wa alreadi in mordor or if he wa dead and he did not know that frodo from far away look on that same moon as it set beyond gondor ere the come of the day pippin woke to the sound of voic anoth day of hide and a night of journey had fleet by it wa twilight the cold dawn wa at hand again and chill grey mist were about them shadowfax stood steam with sweat but he held hi neck proudli and show no sign of weari mani tall men heavili cloak stood besid him and behind them in the mist loom a wall of stone partli ruinou it seem but alreadi befor the night wa pass the sound of hurri labour could be heard beat of hammer clink of trowel and the creak of wheel torch and flare glow dulli here and there in the fog gandalf wa speak to the men that bar hi way and as he listen pippin becam awar that he himself wa be discuss yea truli we know you mithrandir said the leader of the men and you know the password of the seven gate and are free to go forward but we do not know your companion what is he a dwarf out of the mountain in the north we wish for no stranger in the land at thi time unless they be mighti men of arm in whose faith and help we can trust i will vouch for him befor the seat of denethor said gandalf and as for valour that can not be comput by statur he ha pass through more battl and peril than you have ingold though you be twice hi height and he come now from the storm of isengard of which we bear tide and great weari is on him or i would wake him hi name is peregrin a veri valiant man man said ingold dubious and the other laugh man cri pippin now thoroughli rous man inde not i am a hobbit and no more valiant than i am a man save perhap now and again by necess do not let gandalf deceiv you mani a doer of great deed might say no more said ingold but what is a hobbit a halfl answer gandalf nay not the one that wa spoken of he ad see the wonder in the men face not he yet one of hi kindr ye and one who journey with him said pippin and boromir of your citi wa with us and he save me in the snow of the north and at the last he wa slain defend me from mani foe peac said gandalf the news of that grief should have been told first to the father it ha been guess alreadi said ingold for there have been strang portent here of late but pass on now quickli for the lord of mina tirith will be eager to see ani that bear the latest tide of hi son be he man or hobbit said pippin littl servic can i offer to your lord but what i can do i would do rememb boromir the brave fare you well said ingold and the men made way for shadow fax and he pass through a narrow gate in the wall may you bring good counsel to denethor in hi need and to us all mithrandir ingold cri but you come with tide of grief and danger as is your wont they say becaus i come seldom but when my help is need answer gandalf and as for counsel to you i would say that you are overl in repair the wall of the pelennor courag will now be your best defenc against the storm that is at hand – that and such hope as i bring for not all the tide that i bring are evil but leav your trowel and sharpen your sword the work will be finish ere even said ingold thi is the last portion of the wall to be put in defenc the least open to attack for it look toward our friend of rohan do you know aught of them will they answer the summon think you ye they will come but they have fought mani battl at your back thi road and no road look toward safeti ani longer be vigil but for gandalf stormcrow you would have seen a host of foe come out of anórien and no rider of rohan and you may yet fare you well and sleep not gandalf pass now into the wide land beyond the ramma echor so the men of gondor call the out wall that they had built with great labour after ithilien fell under the shadow of their enemi for ten leagu or more it ran from the mountain feet and so back again enclos in it fenc the field of the pelennor fair and fertil townland on the long slope and terrac fall to the deep level of the anduin at it furthest point from the great gate of the citi northeastward the wall wa four leagu distant and there from a frown bank it overlook the long flat besid the river and men had made it high and strong for at that point upon a wall causeway the road came in from the ford and bridg of osgiliath and pass through a guard gate between embattl tower at it nearest point the wall wa littl more than one leagu from the citi and that wa southeastward there anduin go in a wide knee about the hill of emyn arnen in south ithilien bent sharpli west and the outwal rose upon it veri brink and beneath it lay the quay and land of the harlond for craft that came upstream from the southern fief the townland were rich with wide tilth and mani orchard and homestead there were with oast and garner fold and byre and mani rill rippl through the green from the highland down to anduin yet the herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not mani and the most part of the peopl of gondor live in the seven circl of the citi or in the high vale of the mountainbord in lossarnach or further south in fair lebennin with it five swift stream there dwelt a hardi folk between the mountain and the sea they were reckon men of gondor yet their blood wa mingl and there were short and swarthi folk among them whose sire came more from the forgotten men who hous in the shadow of the hill in the dark year ere the come of the king but beyond in the great fief of belfala dwelt princ imrahil in hi castl of dol amroth by the sea and he wa of high blood and hi folk also tall men and proud with seagrey eye now after gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the sky and pippin rous himself and look up to hi left lay a sea of mist rise to a bleak shadow in the east but to hi right great mountain rear their head rang from the west to a steep and sudden end as if in the make of the land the river had burst through a great barrier carv out a mighti valley to be a land of battl and debat in time to come and there where the white mountain of ere nimrai came to their end he saw as gandalf had promis the dark mass of mount mindolluin the deep purpl shadow of it high glen and it tall face whiten in the rise day and upon it outthrust knee wa the guard citi with it seven wall of stone so strong and old that it seem to have been not build but carven by giant out of the bone of the earth even as pippin gaze in wonder the wall pass from loom grey to white blush faintli in the dawn and suddenli the sun climb over the eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that smote the face of the citi then pippin cri aloud for the tower of ecthelion stand high within the topmost wall shone out against the sky glimmer like a spike of pearl and silver tall and fair and shape and it pinnacl glitter as if it were wrought of crystal and white banner broke and flutter from the battlement in the morn breez and high and far he heard a clear ring as of silver trumpet so gandalf and peregrin rode to the great gate of the men of gondor at the rise of the sun and it iron door roll back befor them mithrandir mithrandir men cri now we know that the storm is inde nigh it is upon you said gandalf i have ridden on it wing let me pass i must come to your lord denethor while hi stewardship last whatev betid you have come to the end of the gondor that you have known let me pass then men fell back befor the command of hi voic and question him no further though they gaze in wonder at the hobbit that sat befor him and at the hors that bore him for the peopl of the citi use hors veri littl and they were seldom seen in their street save onli those ridden by the errandrid of their lord and they said sure that is one of the great steed of the king of rohan mayb the rohirrim will come soon to strengthen us but shadowfax walk proudli up the long wind road for the fashion of mina tirith wa such that it wa built on seven level each delv into the hill and about each wa set a wall and in each wall wa a gate but the gate were not set in a line the great gate in the citi wall wa at the east point of the circuit but the next face half south and the third half north and so to and fro upward so that the pave way that climb toward the citadel turn first thi way and then that across the face of the hill and each time that it pass the line of the great gate it went through an arch tunnel pierc a vast pier of rock whose huge outthrust bulk divid in two all the circl of the citi save the first for partli in the primev shape of the hill partli by the mighti craft and labour of old there stood up from the rear of the wide court behind the gate a tower bastion of stone it edg sharp as a shipkeel face east up it rose even to the level of the topmost circl and there wa crown by a battlement so that those in the citadel might like marin in a mountain ship look from it peak sheer down upon the gate seven hundr feet below the entranc to the citadel also look eastward but wa delv in the heart of the rock thenc a long lamplit slope ran up to the seventh gate thu men reach at last the high court and the place of the fountain befor the feet of the white tower tall and shape fifti fathom from it base to the pinnacl where the banner of the steward float a thousand feet abov the plain a strong citadel it wa inde and not to be taken by a host of enemi if there were ani within that could hold weapon unless some foe could come behind and scale the lower skirt of mindolluin and so come upon the narrow shoulder that join the hill of guard to the mountain mass but that shoulder which rose to the height of the fifth wall wa hedg with great rampart right up to the precipic that overhung it western end and in that space stood the hous and dome tomb of bygon king and lord for ever silent between the mountain and the tower pippin gaze in grow wonder at the great stone citi vaster and more splendid than anyth that he had dream of greater and stronger than isengard and far more beauti yet it wa in truth fall year by year into decay and alreadi it lack half the men that could have dwelt at eas there in everi street they pass some great hous or court over whose door and arch gate were carv mani fair letter of strang and ancient shape name pippin guess of great men and kindr that had onc dwelt there and yet now they were silent and no footstep rang on their wide pavement nor voic wa heard in their hall nor ani face look out from door or empti window at last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate and the warm sun that shone down beyond the river as frodo walk in the glade of ithilien glow here on the smooth wall and root pillar and the great arch with keyston carven in the like of a crown and kingli head gandalf dismount for no hors wa allow in the citadel and shadowfax suffer himself to be led away at the soft word of hi master the guard of the gate were robe in black and their helm were of strang shape highcrown with long cheekguard closefit to the face and abov the cheekguard were set the white wing of seabird but the helm gleam with a flame of silver for they were inde wrought of mithril heirloom from the glori of old day upon the black surcoat were embroid in white a tree blossom like snow beneath a silver crown and manypoint star thi wa the liveri of the heir of elendil and none wore it now in all gondor save the guard of the citadel befor the court of the fountain where the white tree onc had grown alreadi it seem that word of their come had gone befor them and at onc they were admit silent and without question quickli gandalf strode across the whitepav court a sweet fountain play there in the morn sun and a sward of bright green lay about it but in the midst droop over the pool stood a dead tree and the fall drop drip sadli from it barren and broken branch back into the clear water pippin glanc at it as he hurri after gandalf it look mourn he thought and he wonder whi the dead tree wa left in thi place where everyth els wa well tend seven star and seven stone and one white tree the word that gandalf had murmur came back into hi mind and then he found himself at the door of the great hall beneath the gleam tower and behind the wizard he pass the tall silent doorwarden and enter the cool echo shadow of the hous of stone they walk down a pave passag long and empti and as they went gandalf spoke softli to pippin be care of your word master peregrin thi is no time for hobbit pert théoden is a kindli old man denethor is of anoth sort proud and subtl a man of far greater lineag and power though he is not call a king but he will speak most to you and question you much sinc you can tell him of hi son boromir he love him greatli too much perhap and the more so becaus they were unlik but under cover of thi love he will think it easier to learn what he witch from you rather than from me do not tell him more than you need and leav quiet the matter of frodo errand i will deal with that in due time and say noth about aragorn either unless you must whi not what is wrong with strider pippin whisper he meant to come here didnt he and hell be arriv soon himself anyway mayb mayb said gandalf though if he come it is like to be in some way that no one expect not even denethor it will be better so at least he should come unherald by us gandalf halt befor a tall door of polish metal see master pippin there is no time to instruct you now in the histori of gondor though it might have been better if you had learn someth of it when you were still birdsnest and play truant in the wood of the shire do as i bid it is scarc wise when bring the news of the death of hi heir to a mighti lord to speak over much of the come of one who will if he come claim the kingship is that enough kingship said pippin amaz ye said gandalf if you have walk all these day with close ear and mind asleep wake up now he knock on the door the door open but no one could be seen to open it pippin look into a great hall it wa lit by deep window in the wide aisl at either side beyond the row of tall pillar that upheld the roof monolith of black marbl they rose to great capit carv in mani strang figur of beast and leav and far abov in shadow the wide vault gleam with dull gold inset with flow traceri of mani colour no hang nor stori web nor ani thing of woven stuff or of wood were to be seen in that long solemn hall but between the pillar there stood a silent compani of tall imag graven in cold stone suddenli pippin wa remind of the hewn rock of argonath and awe fell on him as he look down that avenu of king long dead at the far end upon a dai of mani step wa set a high throne under a canopi of marbl shape like a crown helm behind it wa carv upon the wall and set with gem an imag of a tree in flower but the throne wa empti at the foot of the dai upon the lowest step which wa broad and deep there wa a stone chair black and unadorn and on it sat an old man gaze at hi lap in hi hand wa a white rod with a golden knob he did not look up solemnli they pace the long floor toward him until they stood three pace from hi footstool then gandalf spoke hail lord and steward of mina tirith denethor son of ecthelion i am come with counsel and tide in thi dark hour then the old man look up pippin saw hi carven face with it proud bone and skin like ivori and the long curv nose between the dark deep eye and he wa remind not so much of boromir as of aragorn dark inde is the hour said the old man and at such time you are wont to come mithrandir but though all the sign forebod that the doom of gondor is draw nigh less now to me is that dark than my own dark it ha been told to me that you bring with you one who saw my son die is thi he it is said gandalf one of the twain the other is with théoden of rohan and may come hereaft halfl they are as you see yet thi is not he of whom the omen spoke yet a halfl still said denethor grimli and littl love do i bear the name sinc those accurs word came to troubl our counsel and drew away my son on the wild errand to hi death my boromir now we have need of you faramir should have gone in hi stead he would have gone said gandalf be not unjust in your grief boromir claim the errand and would not suffer ani other to have it he wa a master man and one to take what he desir i journey far with him and learn much of hi mood but you speak of hi death you have had news of that ere we came i have receiv thi said denethor and lay down hi rod he lift from hi lap the thing that he had been gaze at in each hand he held up one half of a great horn cloven through the middl a wildox horn bound with silver that is the horn that boromir alway wore cri pippin verili said denethor and in my turn i bore it and so did each eldest son of our hous far back into the vanish year befor the fail of the king sinc vorondil father of mardil hunt the wild kine of araw in the far field of rhûn i heard it blow dim upon the northern march thirteen day ago and the river brought it to me broken it will wind no more he paus and there wa a heavi silenc suddenli he turn hi black glanc upon pippin what say you to that halfl thirteen thirteen day falter pippin ye i think that would be so ye i stood besid him as he blew the horn but no help came onli more orc so said denethor look keenli at pippin face you were there tell me more whi did no help come and how did you escap and yet he did not so mighti a man as he wa and onli orc to withstand him pippin flush and forgot hi fear the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow he said and boromir wa pierc by mani when last i saw him he sank besid a tree and pluck a blackfeath shaft from hi side then i swoon and wa made captiv i saw him no more and know no more but i honour hi memori for he wa veri valiant he die to save us my kinsman meriadoc and myself waylaid in the wood by the soldieri of the dark lord and though he fell and fail my gratitud is none the less then pippin look the old man in the eye for pride stir strang within him still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voic littl servic no doubt will so great a lord of men think to find in a hobbit a halfl from the northern shire yet such as it is i will offer it in payment of my debt twitch asid hi grey cloak pippin drew forth hi small sword and laid it at denethor feet a pale smile like a gleam of cold sun on a winter even pass over the old man face but he bent hi head and held out hi hand lay the shard of the horn asid give me the weapon he said pippin lift it and present the hilt to him whenc came thi said denethor mani mani year lie on it sure thi is a blade wrought by our own kindr in the north in the deep past it came out of the mound that lie on the border of my countri said pippin but onli evil wight dwell there now and i will not willingli tell more of them i see that strang tale are woven about you said denethor and onc again it is shown that look may beli the man – or the halfl i accept your servic for you are not daunt by word and you have courteou speech strang though the sound of it may be to us in the south and we shall have need of all folk of courtesi be they great or small in the day to come swear to me now take the hilt said gandalf and speak after the lord if you are resolv on thi i am said pippin the old man laid the sword along hi lap and pippin put hi hand to the hilt and said slowli after denethor here do i swear fealti and servic to gondor and to the lord and steward of the realm to speak and to be silent to do and to let be to come and to go in need or plenti in peac or war in live or die from thi hour henceforth until my lord releas me or death take me or the world end so say i peregrin son of paladin of the shire of the halfl and thi do i hear denethor son of ecthelion lord of gondor steward of the high king and i will not forget it nor fail to reward that which is given fealti with love valour with honour oathbreak with vengeanc then pippin receiv back hi sword and put it in it sheath and now said denethor my first command to you speak and be not silent tell me your full tale and see that you recal all that you can of boromir my son sit now and begin as he spoke he struck a small silver gong that stood near hi footstool and at onc servant came forward pippin saw then that they had been stand in alcov on either side of the door unseen as he and gandalf enter bring wine and food and seat for the guest said denethor and see that none troubl us for one hour it is all that i have to spare for there is much els to heed he said to gandalf much of more import it may seem and yet to me less press but mayb we can speak again at the end of the day and earlier it is to be hope said gandalf for i have not ridden hither from isengard one hundr and fifti leagu with the speed of wind onli to bring you one small warrior howev courteou is it naught to you that théoden ha fought a great battl and that isengard is overthrown and that i have broken the staff of saruman it is much to me but i know alreadi suffici of these deed for my own counsel against the menac of the east he turn hi dark eye on gandalf and now pippin saw a like between the two and he felt the strain between them almost as if he saw a line of smoulder fire drawn from eye to eye that might suddenli burst into flame denethor look inde much more like a great wizard than gandalf did more kingli beauti and power and older yet by a sens other than sight pippin perceiv that gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom and a majesti that wa veil and he wa older far older how much older he wonder and then he thought how odd it wa that he had never thought about it befor treebeard had said someth about wizard but even then he had not thought of gandalf as one of them what wa gandalf in what far time and place did he come into the world and when would he leav it and then hi muse broke off and he saw that denethor and gandalf still look each other in the eye as if read the other mind but it wa denethor who first withdrew hi gaze yea he said for though the stone be lost they say still the lord of gondor have keener sight than lesser men and mani messag come to them but sit now then men came bear a chair and a low stool and one brought a salver with a silver flagon and cup and white cake pippin sat down but he could not take hi eye from the old lord wa it so or had he onli imagin it that as he spoke of the stone a sudden gleam of hi eye had glanc upon pippin face now tell me your tale my lieg said denethor half kindli half mockingli for the word of one whom my son so befriend will be welcom inde pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the pierc eye of the lord of gondor stab ever and anon by hi shrewd question and all the while consciou of gandalf at hi side watch and listen and so pippin felt hold in check a rise wrath and impati when the hour wa over and denethor again rang the gong pippin felt worn out it can not be more than nine oclock he thought i could now eat three breakfast on end lead the lord mithrandir to the hous prepar for him said denethor and hi companion may lodg with him for the present if he will but be it known that i have now sworn him to my servic and he shall be known as peregrin son of paladin and taught the lesser password send word to the captain that they shall wait on me here as soon as may be after the third hour ha rung and you my lord mithrandir shall come too as and when you will none shall hinder your come to me at ani time save onli in my brief hour of sleep let your wrath at an old man folli run off and then return to my comfort folli said gandalf nay my lord when you are a dotard you will die you can use even your grief as a cloak do you think that i do not understand your purpos in question for an hour one who know the least while i sit by if you understand it then be content return denethor pride would be folli that disdain help and counsel at need but you deal out such gift accord to your own design yet the lord of gondor is not to be made the tool of other men purpos howev worthi and to him there is no purpos higher in the world as it now stand than the good of gondor and the rule of gondor my lord is mine and no other man unless the king should come again unless the king should come again said gandalf well my lord steward it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event which few now look to see in that task you shall have all the aid that you are pleas to ask for but i will say thi the rule of no realm is mine neither of gondor nor ani other great or small but all worthi thing that are in peril as the world now stand those are my care and for my part i shall not wholli fail of my task though gondor should perish if anyth pass through thi night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in day to come for i also am a steward did you not know and with that he turn and strode from the hall with pippin run at hi side gandalf did not look at pippin or speak a word to him as they went their guid brought them from the door of the hall and then led them across the court of the fountain into a lane between tall build of stone after sever turn they came to a hous close to the wall of the citadel upon the north side not far from the shoulder that link the hill with the mountain within upon the first floor abov the street up a wide carven stair he show them to a fair room light and airi with goodli hang of dull gold sheen unfigur it wa spare furnish have but a small tabl two chair and a bench but at either side there were curtain alcov and wellclad bed within with vessel and basin for wash there were three high narrow window that look northward over the great curv of anduin still shroud in mist toward the emyn muil and rauro far away pippin had to climb on the bench to look out over the deep stone sill are you angri with me gandalf he said as their guid went out and close the door i did the best i could you did inde said gandalf laugh suddenli and he came and stood besid pippin put hi arm about the hobbit shoulder and gaze out of the window pippin glanc in some wonder at the face now close besid hi own for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merri yet in the wizard face he saw at first onli line of care and sorrow though as he look more intent he perceiv that under all there wa a great joy a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laugh were it to gush forth inde you did your best said the wizard and i hope that it may be long befor you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such terribl old men still the lord of gondor learn more from you than you may have guess pippin you could not hide the fact that boromir did not lead the compani from moria and that there wa one among you of high honour who wa come to mina tirith and that he had a famou sword men think much about the stori of old day in gondor and denethor ha given long thought to the rhyme and to the word isildur bane sinc boromir went away he is not as other men of thi time pippin and whatev be hi descent from father to son by some chanc the blood of westerness run nearli true in him as it doe in hi other son faramir and yet did not in boromir whom he love best he ha long sight he can perceiv if he bend hi will thither much of what is pass in the mind of men even of those that dwell far off it is difficult to deceiv him and danger to tri rememb that for you are now sworn to hi servic i do not know what put it into your head or your heart to do that but it wa well done i did not hinder it for gener deed should not be check by cold counsel it touch hi heart as well may i say it as pleas hi humour and at least you are free now to move about as you will in mina tirith – when you are not on duti for there is anoth side to it you are at hi command and he will not forget be wari still he fell silent and sigh well no need to brood on what tomorrow may bring for one thing tomorrow will be certain to bring wors than today for mani day to come and there is noth more that i can do to help it the board is set and the piec are move one piec that i greatli desir to find is faramir now the heir of denethor i do not think that he is in the citi but i have had no time to gather news i must go pippin i must go to thi lord council and learn what i can but the enemi ha the move and he is about to open hi full game and pawn are like to see as much of it as ani peregrin son of paladin soldier of gondor sharpen your blade gandalf went to the door and there he turn i am in hast pippin he said do me a favour when you go out even befor you rest if you are not too weari go and find shadowfax and see how he is hous these peopl are kindli to beast for they are a good and wise folk but they have less skill with hors than some with that gandalf went out and as he did so there came the note of a clear sweet bell ring in a tower of the citadel three stroke it rang like silver in the air and ceas the third hour from the rise of the sun after a minut pippin went to the door and down the stair and look about the street the sun wa now shine warm and bright and the tower and tall hous cast long clearcut shadow westward high in the blue air mount mindolluin lift it white helm and snowi cloak arm men went to and fro in the way of the citi as if go at the strike of the hour to chang of post and duti nine oclock wed call it in the shire said pippin aloud to himself just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring sunshin and how i should like breakfast do these peopl ever have it or is it over and when do they have dinner and where present he notic a man clad in black and white come along the narrow street from the centr of the citadel toward him pippin felt lone and made up hi mind to speak as the man pass but he had no need the man came straight up to him you are peregrin the halfl he said i am told that you have been sworn to the servic of the lord and of the citi welcom he held out hi hand and pippin took it i am name beregond son of baranor i have no duti thi morn and i have been sent to you to teach you the password and to tell you some of the mani thing that no doubt you will wish to know and for my part i would learn of you also for never befor have we seen a halfl in thi land and though we have heard rumour of them littl is said of them in ani tale that we know moreov you are a friend of mithrandir do you know him well well said pippin i have known of him all my short life as you might say and late i have travel far with him but there is much to read in that book and i can not claim to have seen more than a page or two yet perhap i know him as well as ani but a few aragorn wa the onli one of our compani i think who realli knew him aragorn said beregond who is he oh stammer pippin he wa a man who went about with us i think he is in rohan now you have been in rohan i hear there is much that i would ask you of that land also for we put much of what littl hope we have in it peopl but i am forget my errand which wa first to answer what you would ask what would you know master peregrin er well said pippin if i may ventur to say so rather a burn question in my mind at present is well what about breakfast and all that i mean what are the mealtim if you understand me and where is the diningroom if there is one and the inn i look but never a one could i see as we rode up though i had been born up by the hope of a draught of ale as soon as we came to the home of wise and courtli men beregond look at him grave an old campaign i see he said they say that men who go war afield look ever to the next hope of food and of drink though i am not a travel man myself then you have not yet eaten today well ye to speak in courtesi ye said pippin but no more than a cup of wine and a white cake or two by the kind of your lord but he rack me for it with an hour of question and that is hungri work beregond laugh at the tabl small men may do the greater deed we say but you have broken your fast as well as ani man in the citadel and with greater honour thi is a fortress and a tower of guard and is now in postur of war we rise ere the sun and take a morsel in the grey light and go to our duti at the open hour but do not despair he laugh again see the dismay in pippin face those who have had heavi duti take somewhat to refresh their strength in the midmorn then there is the nuncheon at noon or after as duti allow and men gather for the daymeal and such mirth as there still may be about the hour of sunset come we will walk a littl and then go find us some refresh and eat and drink on the battlement and survey the fair morn one moment said pippin blush greed or hunger by your courtesi put it out of my mind but gandalf mithrandir as you call him ask me to see to hi hors – shadowfax a great steed of rohan and the appl of the king eye i am told though he ha given him to mithrandir for hi servic i think hi new master love the beast better than he love mani men and if hi good will is of ani valu to thi citi you will treat shadowfax with all honour with greater kind than you have treat thi hobbit if it is possibl hobbit said beregond that is what we call ourselv said pippin i am glad to learn it said beregond for now i may say that strang accent do not mar fair speech and hobbit are a fairspoken folk but come you shall make me acquaint with thi good hors i love beast and we see them seldom in thi stoni citi for my peopl came from the mountainval and befor that from ithilien but fear not the visit shall be short a mere call of courtesi and we will go thenc to the butteri pippin found that shadowfax had been well hous and tend for in the sixth circl outsid the wall of the citadel there were some fair stabl where a few swift hors were kept hard by the lodg of the errandrid of the lord messeng alway readi to go at the urgent command of denethor or hi chief captain but now all the hors and the rider were out and away shadowfax whinni as pippin enter the stabl and turn hi head good morn said pippin gandalf will come as soon as he may he is busi but he send greet and i am to see that all is well with you and you rest i hope after your long labour shadowfax toss hi head and stamp but he allow beregond to handl hi head gentli and stroke hi great flank he look as if he were spoil for a race and not newli come from a great journey said beregond how strong and proud he is where is hi har it should be rich and fair none is rich and fair enough for him said pippin he will have none if he will consent to bear you bear you he doe and if not well no bit bridl whip or thong will tame him farewel shadowfax have patienc battl is come shadowfax lift up hi head and neigh so that the stabl shook and they cover their ear then they took their leav see that the manger wa well fill and now for our manger said beregond and he led pippin back to the citadel and so to a door in the north side of the great tower there they went down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamp there were hatch in the wall at the side and one of these wa open thi is the storehous and butteri of my compani of the guard said beregond greet targon he call through the hatch it is earli yet but here is a newcom that the lord ha taken into hi servic he ha ridden long and far with a tight belt and ha had sore labour thi morn and he is hungri give us what you have they got there bread and butter and chees and appl the last of the winter store wrinkl but sound and sweet and a leather flagon of newdrawn ale and wooden platter and cup they put all into a wicker basket and climb back into the sun and beregond brought pippin to a place at the east end of the great outthrust battlement where there wa an embrasur in the wall with a stone seat beneath the sill from there they could look out on the morn over the world they ate and drank and they talk now of gondor and it way and custom now of the shire and the strang countri that pippin had seen and ever as they talk beregond wa more amaz and look with greater wonder at the hobbit swing hi short leg as he sat on the seat or stand tipto upon it to peer over the sill at the land below i will not hide from you master peregrin said beregond that to us you look almost as one of our children a lad of nine summer or so and yet you have endur peril and seen marvel that few of our greybeard could boast of i thought it wa the whim of our lord to take him a nobl page after the manner of the king of old they say but i see that it is not so and you must pardon my foolish i do said pippin though you are not far wrong i am still littl more than a boy in the reckon of my own peopl and it will be four year yet befor i come of age as we say in the shire but do not bother about me come and look and tell me what i can see the sun wa now climb and the mist in the vale below had been drawn up the last of them were float away just overhead as wisp of white cloud born on the stiffen breez from the east that wa now flap and tug the flag and white standard of the citadel away down in the valleybottom five leagu or so as the eye leap the great river could now be seen grey and glitter come out of the northwest and bend in a mighti sweep south and west again till it wa lost to view in a haze and shimmer far beyond which lay the sea fifti leagu away pippin could see all the pelennor laid out befor him dot into the distanc with farmstead and littl wall barn and byre but nowher could he see ani kine or other beast mani road and track cross the green field and there wa much come and go wain move in line toward the great gate and other pass out now and again a horseman would ride up and leap from the saddl and hasten into the citi but most of the traffic went out along the chief highway and that turn south and then bend swifter than the river skirt the hill and pass soon from sight it wa wide and wellpav and along it eastern edg ran a broad green ridingtrack and beyond that a wall on the ride horsemen gallop to and fro but all the street seem to be choke with great cover wain go south but soon pippin saw that all wa in fact wellord the wain were move in three line one swifter drawn by hors anoth slower great waggon with fair hous of mani colour drawn by oxen and along the west rim of the road mani smaller cart haul by trudg men that is the road to the vale of tumladen and lossarnach and the mountainvillag and then on to lebennin said beregond there go the last of the wain that bear away to refug the age the children and the women that must go with them they must all be gone from the gate and the road clear for a leagu befor noon that wa the order it is a sad necess he sigh few mayb of those now sunder will meet again and there were alway too few children in thi citi but now there are nonesav some young lad that will not depart and may find some task to do my own son is one of them they fell silent for a while pippin gaze anxious eastward as if at ani moment he might see thousand of orc pour over the field what can i see there he ask point down to the middl of the great curv of the anduin is that anoth citi or what is it it wa a citi said beregond the chief citi of gondor of which thi wa onli a fortress for that is the ruin of osgiliath on either side of anduin which our enemi took and burn long ago yet we won it back in the day of the youth of denethor not to dwell in but to hold as an outpost and to rebuild the bridg for the passag of our arm and then came the fell rider out of mina morgul the black rider said pippin open hi eye and they were wide and dark with an old fear reawaken ye they were black said beregond and i see that you know someth of them though you have not spoken of them in ani of your tale i know of them said pippin softli but i will not speak of them now so near so near he broke off and lift hi eye abov the river and it seem to him that all he could see wa a vast and threaten shadow perhap it wa mountain loom on the verg of sight their jag edg soften by wellnigh twenti leagu of misti air perhap it wa but a cloudwal and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom but even as he look it seem to hi eye that the gloom wa grow and gather veri slowli slowli rise to smother the region of the sun so near to mordor said beregond quietli ye there it lie we seldom name it but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow sometim it seem fainter and more distant sometim nearer and darker it is grow and darken now and therefor our fear and disquiet grow too and the fell rider less than a year ago they won back the cross and mani of our best men were slain boromir it wa that drove the enemi at last back from thi western shore and we hold still the near half of osgiliath for a littl while but we await now a new onslaught there mayb the chief onslaught of the war that come when said pippin have you a guess for i saw the beacon last night and the errandrid and gandalf said that it wa a sign that war had begun he seem in a desper hurri but now everyth seem to have slow up again onli becaus everyth is now readi said beregond it is but the deep breath befor the plung but whi were the beacon lit last night it is overl to send for aid when you are alreadi besieg answer beregond but i do not know the counsel of the lord and hi captain they have mani way of gather news and the lord denethor is unlik other men he see far some say that as he sit alon in hi high chamber in the tower at night and bend hi thought thi way and that he can read somewhat of the futur and that he will at time search even the mind of the enemi wrestl with him and so it is that he is old worn befor hi time but howev that may be my lord faramir is abroad beyond the river on some peril errand and he may have sent tide but if you would know what i think set the beacon ablaz it wa the news that came yesterev out of lebennin there is a great fleet draw near to the mouth of anduin man by the corsair of umbar in the south they have long ceas to fear the might of gondor and they have alli them with the enemi and now make a heavi stroke in hi caus for thi attack will draw off much of the help that we look to have from lebennin and belfala where folk are hardi and numer all the more do our thought go north to rohan and the more glad are we for these tide of victori that you bring and yet – he paus and stood up and look round north east and south – the do at isengard should warn us that we are caught now in a great net and strategi thi is no longer a bicker at the ford raid from ithilien and from anórien ambush and pillag thi is a great war longplan and we are but one piec in it whatev pride may say thing move in the far east beyond the inland sea it is report and north in mirkwood and beyond and south in harad and now all realm shall be put to the test to stand or fall – under the shadow yet master peregrin we have thi honour ever we bear the brunt of the chief hatr of the dark lord for that hatr come down out of the depth of time and over the deep of the sea here will the hammerstrok fall hardest and for that reason mithrandir came hither in such hast for if we fall who shall stand and master peregrin do you see ani hope that we shall stand pippin did not answer he look at the great wall and the tower and brave banner and the sun in the high sky and then at the gather gloom in the east and he thought of the long finger of that shadow of the orc in the wood and the mountain the treason of isengard the bird of evil eye and the black rider even in the lane of the shire – and of the wing terror the nazgûl he shudder and hope seem to wither and even at that moment the sun for a second falter and wa obscur as though a dark wing had pass across it almost beyond hear he thought he caught high and far up in the heaven a cri faint but heartquel cruel and cold he blanch and cower against the wall what wa that ask beregond you also felt someth ye mutter pippin it is the sign of our fall and the shadow of doom a fell rider of the air ye the shadow of doom said beregond i fear that mina tirith shall fall night come the veri warmth of my blood seem stolen away for a time they sat togeth with bow head and did not speak then suddenli pippin look up and saw that the sun wa still shine and the banner still stream in the breez he shook himself it is pass he said no my heart will not yet despair gandalf fell and ha return and is with us we may stand if onli on one leg or at least be left still upon our knee rightli said cri beregond rise and stride to and fro nay though all thing must come utterli to an end in time gondor shall not perish yet not though the wall be taken by a reckless foe that will build a hill of carrion befor them there are still other fast and secret way of escap into the mountain hope and memori shall live still in some hidden valley where the grass is green all the same i wish it wa over for good or ill said pippin i am no warrior at all and dislik ani thought of battl but wait on the edg of one that i cant escap is worst of all what a long day it seem alreadi i should be happier if we were not oblig to stand and watch make no move strike nowher first no stroke would have been struck in rohan i think but for gandalf ah there you lay your finger on the sore that mani feel said beregond but thing may chang when faramir return he is bold more bold than mani deem for in these day men are slow to believ that a captain can be wise and learn in the scroll of lore and song as he is and yet a man of hardihood and swift judgement in the field but such is faramir less reckless and eager than boromir but not less resolut yet what inde can he do we can not assault the mountain of – of yonder realm our reach is shorten and we can not strike till some foe come within it then our hand must be heavi he smote the hilt of hi sword pippin look at him tall and proud and nobl as all the men that he had yet seen in that land and with a glitter in hi eye as he thought of the battl ala my own hand feel as light as a feather he thought but he said noth a pawn did gandalf say perhap but on the wrong chessboard so they talk until the sun reach it height and suddenli the noonbel were rung and there wa a stir in the citadel for all save the watchmen were go to their meal will you come with me said beregond you may join my mess for thi day i do not know to what compani you will be assign or the lord may hold you at hi own command but you will be welcom and it will be well to meet as mani men as you may while there is yet time i shall be glad to come said pippin i am lone to tell you the truth i left my best friend behind in rohan and i have had no one to talk to or jest with perhap i could realli join your compani are you the captain if so you could take me on or speak for me nay nay beregond laugh i am no captain neither offic nor rank nor lordship have i be but a plain man of arm of the third compani of the citadel yet master peregrin to be onli a man of arm of the guard of the tower of gondor is held worthi in the citi and such men have honour in the land then it is far beyond me said pippin take me back to our room and if gandalf is not there i will go where you like – as your guest gandalf wa not in the lodg and had sent no messag so pippin went with beregond and wa made known to the men of the third compani and it seem that beregond got as much honour from it as hi guest for pippin wa veri welcom there had alreadi been much talk in the citadel about mithrandir companion and hi long closet with the lord and rumour declar that a princ of the halfl had come out of the north to offer allegi to gondor and five thousand sword and some said that when the rider came from rohan each would bring behind him a halfl warrior small mayb but doughti though pippin had regret to destroy thi hope tale he could not be rid of hi new rank onli fit men thought to one befriend by boromir and honour by the lord denethor and they thank him for come among them and hung on hi word and stori of the outland and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish inde hi onli troubl wa to be wari accord to the counsel of gandalf and not to let hi tongu wag freeli after the manner of a hobbit among friend at length beregond rose farewel for thi time he said i have duti now till sundown as have all the other here i think but if you are lone as you say mayb you would like a merri guid about the citi my son would go with you gladli a good lad i may say if that pleas you go down to the lowest circl and ask for the old guesthous in the rath celerdain the lampwright street you will find him there with other lad that are remain in the citi there may be thing worth see down at the great gate ere the close he went out and soon after all the other follow the day wa still fine though it wa grow hazi and it wa hot for march even so far southward pippin felt sleepi but the lodg seem cheerless and he decid to go down and explor the citi he took a few morsel that he had save to shadowfax and they were gracious accept though the hors seem to have no lack then he walk on down mani wind way peopl stare much as he pass to hi face men were grave courteou salut him after the manner of gondor with bow head and hand upon the breast but behind him he heard mani call as those out of door cri to other within to come and see the princ of the halfl the companion of mithrandir mani use some other tongu than the common speech but it wa not long befor he learn at least what wa meant by ernil i pheriannath and knew that hi titl had gone down befor him into the citi he came at last by arch street and mani fair alley and pavement to the lowest and widest circl and there he wa direct to the lampwright street a broad way run toward the great gate in it he found the old guesthous a larg build of grey weather stone with two wing run back from the street and between them a narrow greensward behind which wa the manywindow hous front along it whole width by a pillar porch and a flight of step down on to the grass boy were play among the pillar the onli children that pippin had seen in mina tirith and he stop to look at them present one of them caught sight of him and with a shout he sprang across the grass and came into the street follow by sever other there he stood in front of pippin look him up and down greet said the lad where do you come from you are a stranger in the citi i wa said pippin but they say i have becom a man of gondor oh come said the lad then we are all men here but how old are you and what is your name i am ten year alreadi and shall soon be five feet i am taller than you but then my father is a guard one of the tallest what is your father which question shall i answer first said pippin my father farm the land round whitwel near tuckborough in the shire i am nearli twentynin so i pass you there though i am but four feet and not like to grow ani more save sideway twentynin said the lad and whistl whi you are quit old as old as my uncl iorla still he ad hope i wager i could stand you on your head or lay you on your back mayb you could if i let you said pippin with a laugh and mayb i could do the same to you we know some wrestl trick in my littl countri where let me tell you i am consid uncommonli larg and strong and i have never allow anyon to stand me on my head so if it came to a trial and noth els would serv i might have to kill you for when you are older you will learn that folk are not alway what they seem and though you may have taken me for a soft strangerlad and easi prey let me warn you i am not i am a halfl hard bold and wick pippin pull such a grim face that the boy step back a pace but at onc he return with clench fist and the light of battl in hi eye no pippin laugh dont believ what stranger say of themselv either i am not a fighter but it would be polit in ani case for the challeng to say who he is the boy drew himself up proudli i am bergil son of beregond of the guard he said so i thought said pippin for you look like your father i know him and he sent me to find you then whi did you not say so at onc said bergil and suddenli a look of dismay came over hi face do not tell me that he ha chang hi mind and will send me away with the maiden but no the last wain have gone hi messag is less bad than that if not good said pippin he say that if you would prefer it to stand me on my head you might show me round the citi for a while and cheer my loneli i can tell you some tale of far countri in return bergil clap hi hand and laugh with relief all is well he cri come then we were soon go to the gate to look on we will go now what is happen there the captain of the outland are expect up the south road ere sundown come with us and you will see bergil prove a good comrad the best compani pippin had had sinc he part from merri and soon they were laugh and talk gaili as they went about the street heedless of the mani glanc that men gave them befor long they found themselv in a throng go toward the great gate there pippin went up much in the esteem of bergil for when he spoke hi name and the password the guard salut him and let him pass through and what wa more he allow him to take hi companion with him that is good said bergil we boy are no longer allow to pass the gate without an elder now we shall see better beyond the gate there wa a crowd of men along the verg of the road and of the great pave space into which all the way to mina tirith ran all eye were turn southward and soon a murmur rose there is dust away there they are come pippin and bergil edg their way forward to the front of the crowd and wait horn sound at some distanc and the nois of cheer roll toward them like a gather wind then there wa a loud trumpetblast and all about them peopl were shout forlong forlong pippin heard men call what do they say he ask forlong ha come bergil answer old forlong the fat the lord of lossarnach that is where my grandsir live hurrah here he is good old forlong lead the line there came walk a big thicklimb hors and on it sat a man of wide shoulder and huge girth but old and greybeard yet mailclad and blackhelm and bear

forlong men shout true heart true friend forlong but when the men of lossarnach had pass they mutter so few two hundr what are they we hope for ten time the number that will be the new tide of the black fleet they are spare onli a tith of their strength still everi littl is a gain and so the compani came and were hail and cheer and pass through the gate men of the outland march to defend the citi of gondor in a dark hour but alway too few alway less than hope look for or need ask the men of ringló vale behind the son of their lord dervorin stride on foot three hundr from the upland of morthond the great blackroot vale tall duinhir with hi son duilin and derufin and five hundr bowmen from the anfala the langstrand far away a long line of men of mani sort hunter and herdsmen and men

full told no more would come their cri and the tramp of their feet pass into the citi and die away the onlook stood silent for a while dust hung in the air for the wind had die and the even wa heavi alreadi the close hour wa draw nigh and the red sun had gone behind mindolluin shadow came down on the citi pippin look up and it seem to him that the sky had grown ashengrey as if a vast dust and smoke hung abov them and light came dulli through it but in the west the die sun had set all the fume on fire and now mindolluin stood black against a burn smoulder fleck with ember so end a fair day in wrath he said forget of the lad at hi side so it will if i have not return befor the sundownbel said bergil come there goe the trumpet for the close of the gate hand in hand they went back into the citi the last to pass the gate befor it wa shut and as they reach the lampwright street all the bell in the tower toll solemnli light sprang in mani window and from the hous and ward of the men at arm along the wall there came the sound of song farewel for thi time said bergil take my greet to my father and thank him for the compani that he sent come again soon i beg almost i wish now that there wa no war for we might have had some merri time we might have journey to lossarnach to my grandsir hous it is good to be there in spring the wood and field are full of flower but mayb we will go thither

night close down swift and dark not a star prick the sky he wa late for the daymeal in the mess and beregond greet him gladli and sat him at hi side to hear news of hi son after the meal pippin stay a while and then took hi leav for a strang gloom wa on him and now he desir veri much to see gandalf again can you find your way said beregond at the door of the small hall on the north side of the citadel where they had sat it is a black night and all the blacker sinc order came that light are to be dim within the citi and none are to shine out from the wall and i can give you news of anoth order you will be summon to the lord denethor earli tomorrow i fear you will not be for the third compani still we may hope to meet again farewel and sleep in peac the lodg wa dark save for a littl lantern set on the tabl gandalf wa not there gloom settl still more heavili on pippin he climb on the bench and tri to peer out of a window but it wa like look into a pool of ink he got down and close the shutter and went to bed for a while he lay and listen for sound of gandalf return and then he fell into an uneasi sleep in the night he wa waken by a light and he saw that gandalf had come and wa pace to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcov there were candl on the tabl and roll of parchment he heard the wizard sigh and mutter when will faramir return hullo said pippin poke hi head round the curtain i thought you had forgotten all about me i am glad to see you back it ha been a long day but the night will be too short said gandalf i have come back here for i must have a littl peac alon you should sleep in a bed while you still may at the sunris i shall take you to the lord denethor again no when the summon come not at sunris the dark ha begun there will be no dawn chapter the pass of the grey compani gandalf wa gone and the thud hoof of shadowfax were lost in the night when merri came back to aragorn he had onli a light bundl for he had lost hi pack at parth galen and all he had wa a few use thing he had pick up among the wreckag of isengard hasufel wa alreadi saddl legola and gimli with their hors stood close by so four of the compani still remain said aragorn we will ride on togeth but we shall not go alon as i thought the king is now determin to set out at onc sinc the come of the wing shadow he desir to return to the hill under cover of night and then whither said legola i can not say yet aragorn answer as for the king he will go to the muster that he command at edora four night from now and there i think he will hear tide of war and the rider of rohan will go down to mina tirith but for myself and ani that will go with me i for one cri legola and gimli with him said the dwarf well for myself said aragorn it is dark befor me i must go down also to mina tirith but i do not yet see the road an hour long prepar approach dont leav me behind said merri i have not been of much use yet but i dont want to be laid asid like baggag to be call for when all is over i dont think the rider will want to be bother with me now though of cours the king did say that i wa to sit by him when he came to hi hous and tell him all about the shire ye said aragorn and your road lie with him i think merri but do not look for mirth at the end it will be long i fear ere théoden sit at eas again in meduseld mani hope will wither in thi bitter spring soon all were readi to depart twentyfour hors with gimli behind legola and merri in front of aragorn present they were ride swiftli through the night they had not long pass the mound at the ford of isen when a rider gallop up from the rear of their line my lord he said to the king there are horsemen behind us as we cross the ford i thought that i heard them now we are sure they are overtak us ride hard théoden at onc call a halt the rider turn about and seiz their spear aragorn dismount and set merri on the ground and draw hi sword he stood by the king stirrup éomer and hi esquir rode back to the rear merri felt more like unneed baggag than ever and he wonder if there wa a fight what he should do suppos the king small escort wa trap and overcom but he escap into the dark – alon in the wild field of rohan with no idea of where he wa in all the endless mile no good he thought he drew hi sword and tighten hi belt the sink moon wa obscur by a great sail cloud but suddenli it rode out clear again then they all heard the sound of hoof and at the same moment they saw dark shape come swiftli on the path from the ford the moonlight glint here and there on the point of spear the number of the pursuer could not be told but they seem no fewer than the king escort at the least when they were some fifti pace off éomer cri in a loud voic halt halt who ride in rohan the pursuer brought their steed to a sudden stand a silenc follow and then in the moonlight a horseman could be seen dismount and walk slowli forward hi hand show white as he held it up palm outward in token of peac but the king men grip their weapon at ten pace the man stop he wa tall a dark stand shadow then hi clear voic rang out rohan rohan did you say that is a glad word we seek that land in hast from long afar you

the north i am cri the man we seek one aragorn son of arathorn and we heard that he wa in rohan and you have found him also cri aragorn give hi rein to merri he ran forward and embrac the newcom halbarad he said of all joy thi is the least expect merri breath a sigh of relief he had thought that thi wa some last trick of saruman to waylay the king while he had onli a few men about him but it seem that there would be no need to die in théoden defenc not yet at ani rate he sheath hi sword all is well said aragorn turn back here are some of my own kin from the far land where i dwelt but whi

have seem to me too short to achiev my desir answer aragorn but great inde will be my hast ere i take that road that will soon be seen said elrohir but let us speak no more of these thing upon the

these newcom said gimli stout men and lordli they are and the rider of rohan look almost as boy besid them for they are grim men of face worn like weather rock for the most part even as aragorn himself and they are silent but even as aragorn they are courteou if they break their silenc said legola and have you mark the brethren elladan and elrohir less sombr is their gear than the other and they are fair and gallant as elvenlord and that is not to be wonder at in the son of elrond of rivendel whi have they come have you heard ask merri he had now dress and he flung hi grey cloak about hi

east and hi fair face wa troubl i do not think that ani would come he answer they have no need to ride to war war alreadi march on their own land for a while the three companion walk togeth speak of thi and that turn of the battl and they went down from the broken gate and pass the mound of the fallen on the greensward besid the road until they stood on helm dike and look into the coomb the death down alreadi stood there black and tall and stoni and the great trampl and score of the grass by the huorn could be plainli seen the dunlend and mani men of the garrison of the burg were at work on the dike or in the field and about the batter wall behind yet all seem strang quiet a weari valley rest after a great storm soon they turn back and went to the midday meal in the hall of the burg the

the rider were assembl on the green mani were alreadi mount it would be a great compani for the king wa leav onli a small garrison in the burg and all who could be spare were ride to the weapontak at edora a thousand spear had inde alreadi ridden away at night but still there would be some five hundr more to go with the king for the most part men from the field and dale of westfold a littl apart the ranger sat silent in an order compani arm with spear and bow and sword they were clad in cloak of dark grey and their hood were cast now over helm and head their hors were strong and of proud bear but roughhair and one stood there without a rider aragorn own hors that they had brought from the north roheryn wa hi name there wa no gleam of stone or gold nor ani fair thing in all their gear and har nor did their rider bear ani badg or token save onli that each cloak wa pin upon the left shoulder by a brooch of silver shape like a ray star the king mount hi hors snowman and merri sat besid him on hi poni stybba wa hi name present éomer came out from the gate and with him wa aragorn and halbarad bear the great staff closefurl in black and two tall men neither young nor old so much alik were they the son of elrond that few could tell them apart darkhair greyey and their face elvenfair clad alik in bright mail beneath cloak of silvergrey behind them walk legola and gimli but merri had eye onli for aragorn so startl wa the chang that he saw in him as if in one night mani year had fallen on hi head grim wa hi face greyhu and weari i am troubl in mind lord he said stand by the king hors i have heard strang word and i see new peril far off i have labour long in thought and now i fear that i must chang my purpos tell me théoden you ride now to dunharrow how long will it be ere you come there it is now a full hour past noon said éomer befor the night of the third day from now we should come to the hold the moon will then be one night past hi full and the muster that the king command will be held the day after more speed we can not make if the strength of rohan is to be gather aragorn wa silent for a moment three day he murmur and the muster of rohan will onli be begun but i see that it can not now be hasten he look up and it seem that he had made some decis hi face wa less troubl then by our leav lord i must take new counsel for myself and my kindr we must ride our own road and no longer in secret for me the time of stealth ha pass i will ride east by the swiftest way and i will take the path of the dead the path of the dead said théoden and trembl whi do you speak of them éomer turn and gaze at aragorn and it seem to merri that the face of the rider that sat within hear turn pale at the word if there be in truth such path said théoden their gate is in dunharrow but no live man may pass it ala aragorn my friend said éomer i had hope that we should ride to war togeth but if you seek the path of the dead then our part is come and it is littl like that we shall ever meet again under the sun that road i will take nonetheless said aragorn but i say to you éomer that in battl we may yet meet again though all the host of mordor should stand between you will do as you will my lord aragorn said théoden it is your doom mayb to tread strang path that other dare not thi part griev me and my strength is lessen by it but now i must take the mountainroad and delay no longer farewel farewel lord said aragorn ride unto great renown farewel merri i leav you in good hand better than we hope when we hunt the orc to fangorn legola and gimli will still hunt with me i hope but we shall not forget you goodby said merri he could find no more to say he felt veri small and he wa puzzl and depress by all these gloomi word more than ever he miss the unquench cheer of pippin the rider were readi and their hors were fidget he wish they would start arid get it over now théoden spoke to éomer and he lift up hi hand and cri aloud and with that word the rider set forth they rode over the dike and down the coomb and then turn swiftli eastward they took a path that skirt the foothil for a mile or so until bend south it pass back among the hill and disappear from view aragorn rode to the dike and watch till the king men were far down the coomb then he turn to halbarad there go three that i love and the smallest not the least he said he know not to what end he ride yet if he knew he still would go on a littl peopl but of great worth are the shirefolk said halbarad littl do they know of our long labour for the safekeep of their border and yet i grudg it not and now our fate are woven togeth said aragorn and yet ala here we must part well i must eat a littl and then we also must hasten away come legola and gimli i must speak with you as i eat togeth they went back into the burg yet for some time aragorn sat silent at the tabl in the hall and the other wait for him to speak come said legola at last speak and be comfort and shake off the shadow what ha happen sinc we came back to thi grim place in the grey morn a struggl somewhat grimmer for my part than the battl of the hornburg answer aragorn i have look in the stone of orthanc my friend you have look in that accurs stone of wizardri exclaim gimli with fear and astonish in hi face did you say aught to – him even gandalf fear that encount you forget to whom you speak said aragorn sternli and hi eye glint did i not openli proclaim my titl befor the door of edora what do you fear that i should say to him nay gimli he said in a softer voic and the grim left hi face and he look like one who ha labour in sleepless pain for mani night nay my friend i and the law master of the stone and i had both the right and the strength to use it or so i judg the right can not be doubt the strength wa enough – bare he drew a deep breath it wa a bitter struggl and the weari is slow to pass i spoke no word to him and in the end i wrench the stone to my own will that alon he will find hard to endur and he beheld me ye master gimli he saw me but in other guis than you see me here if that will aid him then i have done ill but i do not think so to know that i live and walk the earth wa a blow to hi heart i deem for he knew it not till now the eye in orthanc did not see through the armour of théoden but sauron ha not forgotten isildur and the sword of elendil now in the veri hour of hi great design the heir of isildur and the sword are reveal for i show the blade reforg to him he is not so mighti yet that he is abov fear nay doubt ever gnaw him but he wield great dominion nonetheless said gimli and now he will strike more swiftli the hasti stroke goe oft astray said aragorn we must press our enemi and no longer wait upon him for the move see my friend when i had master the stone i learn mani thing a grave peril i saw come unlookedfor upon gondor from the south that will draw off great strength from the defenc of mina tirith if it is not counter swiftli i deem that the citi will be lost ere ten day be gone then lost it must be said gimli for what help is there to send thither and how could it come there in time i have no help to send therefor i must go myself said aragorn but there is onli one way through the mountain that will bring me to the coastland befor all is lost that is the path of the dead the path of the dead said gimli it is a fell name and littl to the like to the men of rohan as i saw can the live use such a road and not perish and even if you pass that way what will so few avail to counter the stroke of mordor the live have never use that road sinc the come of the rohirrim said aragorn for it is close to them but in thi dark hour the heir of isildur may use it if he dare listen thi is the word that the son of elrond bring to me from their father in rivendel wisest in lore bid aragorn rememb the word of the seer and the path of the dead and what may be the word of the seer said legola thu spoke malbeth the seer in the day of arvedui last king at fornost said aragorn over the land there lie a long shadow westward reach wing of dark the tower trembl to the tomb of king doom approach the dead awaken for the hour is come for the oathbreak at the stone of erech they shall stand again and hear there a horn in the hill ring whose shall the horn be who shall call them from the prey twilight the forgotten peopl the heir of him to whom the oath they swore from the north shall he come need shall drive him he shall pass the door to the path of the dead dark way doubtless said gimli but no darker than these stave are to me if you would understand them better then i bid you come with me said aragorn for that way i now shall take but i do not go gladli onli need drive me therefor onli of your free will would i have you come for you will find both toil and great fear and mayb wors i will go with you even on the path of the dead and to whatev end they may lead said gimli i also will come said legola for i do not fear the dead i hope that the forgotten peopl will not have forgotten how to fight said gimli for otherwis i see not whi we should troubl them that we shall know if ever we come to erech said aragorn but the oath that they broke wa to fight against sauron and they must fight therefor if they are to fulfil it for at erech there stand yet a black stone that wa brought it wa said from númenor by isildur and it wa set upon a hill and upon it the king of the mountain swore allegi to him in the begin of the realm of gondor but when sauron return and grew in might again isildur summon the men of the mountain to fulfil their oath and they would not for they had worship sauron in the dark year then isildur said to their king thou shalt be the last king and if the west prove mightier than thi black master thi curs i lay upon thee and thi folk to rest never until your oath is fulfil for thi war will last through year uncount and you shall be summon onc again ere the end and they fled befor the wrath of isildur and did not dare to go forth to war on sauron part and they hid themselv in secret place in the mountain and had no deal with other men but slowli dwindl in the barren hill and the terror of the sleepless dead lie about the hill of erech and all place where that peopl linger but that way i must go sinc there are none live to help me he stood up come he cri and drew hi sword and it flash in the twilit hall of the burg to the stone of erech i seek the path of the dead come with me who will legola and gimli made no answer but they rose and follow aragorn from the hall on the green there wait still and silent the hood ranger legola and gimli mount aragorn sprang upon roheryn then halbarad lift a great horn and the blast of it echo in helm deep and with that they leapt away ride down the coomb like thunder while all the men that were left on dike or burg stare in amaz and while théoden went by slow path in the hill the grey compani pass swiftli over the plain and on the next day in the afternoon they came to edora and there they halt onli briefli ere they pass up the valley and so came to dunharrow as dark fell the ladi éowyn greet them and wa glad of their come for no mightier men had she seen than the dúnedain and the fair son of elrond but on aragorn most of all her eye rest and when they sat at supper with her they talk togeth and she heard of all that had pass sinc théoden rode away concern which onli hasti tide had yet reach her and when she heard of the battl in helm deep and the great slaughter of their foe and of the charg of théoden and hi knight then her eye shone but at last she said lord you are weari and shall now go to your bed with such eas as can be contriv in hast but tomorrow fairer hous shall be found for you but aragorn said nay ladi be not troubl for us if we may lie here tonight and break our fast tomorrow it will be enough for i ride on an errand most urgent and with the first light of morn we must go she smile on him and said then it wa kindli done lord to ride so mani mile out of your way to bring tide to éowyn and to speak with her in her exil inde no man would count such a journey wast said aragorn and yet ladi i could not have come hither if it were not that the road which i must take lead me to dunharrow and she answer as one that like not what is said then lord you are astray for out of harrowdal no road run east or south and you had best return as you came nay ladi said he i am not astray for i walk in thi land ere you were born to grace it there is a road out of thi valley and that road i shall take tomorrow i shall ride by the path of the dead then she stare at him as one that is stricken and her face blanch and for long she spoke no more while all sat silent but aragorn she said at last is it then your errand to seek death for that is all that you will find on that road they do not suffer the live to pass they may suffer me to pass said aragorn but at the least i will adventur it no other road will serv but thi is mad she said for here are men of renown and prowess whom you should not take into the shadow but should lead to war where men are need i beg you to remain and ride with my brother for then all our heart will be gladden and our hope be the brighter it is not mad ladi he answer for i go on a path appoint but those who follow me do so of their free will and if they wish now to remain and ride with the rohirrim they may do so but i shall take the path of the dead alon if need be then they said no more and they ate in silenc but her eye were ever upon aragorn and the other saw that she wa in great torment of mind at length they aros and took their leav of the ladi and thank her for her care and went to their rest but as aragorn came to the booth where he wa to lodg with legola and gimli and hi companion had gone in there came the ladi éowyn after him and call to him he turn and saw her as a glimmer in the night for she wa clad in white but her eye were on fire aragorn she said whi will you go on thi deadli road becaus i must he said onli so can i see ani hope of do my part in the war against sauron i do not choos path of peril éowyn were i to go where my heart dwell far in the north i would now be wander in the fair valley of rivendel for a while she wa silent as if ponder what thi might mean then suddenli she laid her hand on hi arm you are a stern lord and resolut she said and thu do men win renown she paus lord she said if you must go then let me ride in your follow for i am weari of skulk in the hill and wish to face peril and battl your duti is with your peopl he answer too often have i heard of duti she cri but am i not of the hous of eorl a shieldmaiden and not a drynurs i have wait on falter feet long enough sinc they falter no longer it seem may i not now spend my life as i will few may do that with honour he answer but as for you ladi did you not accept the charg to govern the peopl until their lord return if you had not been chosen then some marshal or captain would have been set in the same place and he could not ride away from hi charg were he weari of it or no shall i alway be chosen she said bitterli shall i alway be left behind when the rider depart to mind the hous while they win renown and find food and bed when they return a time may come soon said he when none will return then there will be need of valour without renown for none shall rememb the deed that are done in the last defenc of your home yet the deed will not be less valiant becaus they are unprais and she answer all your word are but to say you are a woman and your part is in the hous but when the men have die in battl and honour you have leav to be burn in the hous for the men will need it no more but i am of the hous of eorl and not a servingwoman i can ride and wield blade and i do not fear either pain or death what do you fear ladi he ask a cage she said to stay behind bar until use and old age accept them and all chanc of do great deed is gone beyond recal or desir and yet you counsel me not to adventur on the road that i had chosen becaus it is peril so may one counsel anoth she said yet i do not bid you flee from peril but to ride to battl where your sword may win renown and victori i would not see a thing that is high and excel cast away needlessli nor would i he said therefor i say to you ladi stay for you have no errand to the south neither have those other who go with thee they go onli becaus they would not be part from thee – becaus they love thee then she turn and vanish into the night when the light of day wa come into the sky but the sun wa not yet risen abov the high ridg in the east aragorn made readi to depart hi compani wa all mount and he wa about to leap into the saddl when the ladi éowyn came to bid them farewel she wa clad as a rider and girt with a sword in her hand she bore a cup and she set it to her lip and drank a littl wish them good speed and then she gave the cup to aragorn and he drank and he said farewel ladi of rohan i drink to the fortun of your hous and of you and of all your peopl say to your brother beyond the shadow we may meet again then it seem to gimli and legola who were nearbi that she wept and in one so stern and proud that seem the more grievou but she said aragorn wilt thou go i will he said then wilt thou not let me ride with thi compani as i have ask i will not ladi he said for that i could not grant without leav of the king and of your brother and they will not return until tomorrow but i count now everi hour inde everi minut farewel then she fell on her knee say i beg thee nay ladi he said and take her by the hand he rais her then he kiss her hand and sprang into the saddl and rode away and did not look back and onli those who knew him well and were near to him saw the pain that he bore but éowyn stood still as a figur carven in stone her hand clench at her side and she watch them until they pass into the shadow under the black dwimorberg the haunt mountain in which wa the gate of the dead when they were lost to view she turn stumbl as one that is blind and went back to her lodg but none of her folk saw thi part for they hid themselv in fear and would not come forth until the day wa up and the reckless stranger were gone and some said they are elvish wight let them go where they belong into the dark place and never return the time are evil enough the light wa still grey as they rode for the sun had not yet climb over the black ridg of the haunt mountain befor them a dread fell on them even as they pass between the line of ancient stone and so came to the dimholt there under the gloom of black tree that not even legola could long endur they found a hollow place open at the mountain root and right in their path stood a singl mighti stone like a finger of doom my blood run chill said gimli but the other were silent and hi voic fell dead on the dank firneedl at hi feet the hors would not pass the threaten stone until the rider dismount and led them about and so they came at last deep into the glen and there stood a sheer wall of rock and in the wall the dark door gape befor them like the mouth of night sign and figur were carv abov it wide arch too dim to read and fear flow from it like a grey vapour the compani halt and there wa not a heart among them that did not quail unless it were the heart of legola of the elv for whom the ghost of men have no terror thi is an evil door said halbarad and my death lie beyond it i will dare to pass it nonetheless but no hors will enter but we must go in and therefor the hors must go too said aragorn for if ever we come through thi dark mani leagu lie beyond and everi hour that is lost there will bring the triumph of sauron nearer follow me then aragorn led the way and such wa the strength of hi will in that hour that all the dúnedain and their hors follow him and inde the love that the hors of the ranger bore for their rider wa so great that they were will to face even the terror of the door if their master heart were steadi as they walk besid them but arod the hors of rohan refus the way and he stood sweat and trembl in a fear that wa grievou to see then legola laid hi hand on hi eye and sang some word that went soft in the gloom until he suffer himself to be led and legola pass in and there stood gimli the dwarf left all alon hi knee shook and he wa wroth with himself here is a thing unheard of he said an elf will go underground and a dwarf dare not with that he plung in but it seem to him that he drag hi feet like lead over the threshold and at onc a blind came upon him even upon gimli glóin son who had walk unafraid in mani deep place of the world aragorn had brought torch from dunharrow and now he went ahead bear one aloft and elladan with anoth went at the rear and gimli stumbl behind strove to overtak him he could see noth but the dim flame of the torch but if the compani halt there seem an endless whisper of voic all about him a murmur of word in no tongu that he had ever heard befor noth assail the compani nor withstood their passag and yet steadili fear grew on the dwarf as he went on most of all becaus he knew now that there could be no turn back all the path behind were throng by an unseen host that follow in the dark so time unreckon pass until gimli saw a sight that he wa ever afterward loth to recal the road wa wide as far as he could judg but now the compani came suddenli into a great empti space and there were no longer ani wall upon either side the dread wa so heavi on him that he could hardli walk away to the left someth glitter in the gloom as aragorn torch drew near then aragorn halt and went to look what it might be doe he feel no fear mutter the dwarf in ani other cave gimli glóin son would have been the first to run to the gleam of gold but not here let it lie nonetheless he drew near and saw aragorn kneel while elladan held aloft both torch befor him were the bone of a mighti man he had been clad in mail and still hi har lay there whole for the cavern air wa as dri as dust and hi hauberk wa gild hi belt wa of gold and garnet and rich with gold wa the helm upon hi boni head face downward on the floor he had fallen near the far wall of the cave as now could be seen and befor him stood a stoni door close fast hi fingerbon were still claw at the crack a notch and broken sword lay by him as if he had hewn at the rock in hi last despair aragorn did not touch him but after gaze silent for a while he rose and sigh hither shall the flower of simbelmynë come never unto world end he murmur nine mound and seven there are now green with grass and through all the long year he ha lain at the door that he could not unlock whither doe it lead whi would he pass none shall ever know for that is not my errand he cri turn back and speak to the whisper dark behind keep your hoard and your secret hidden in the accurs year speed onli we ask let us pass and then come i summon you to the stone of erech there wa no answer unless it were an utter silenc more dread than the whisper befor and then a chill blast came in which the torch flicker and went out and could not be rekindl of the time that follow one hour or mani gimli rememb littl the other press on but he wa ever hindmost pursu by a grope horror that seem alway just about to seiz him and a rumour came after him like the shadowsound of mani feet he stumbl on until he wa crawl like a beast on the ground and felt that he could endur no more he must either find an end and escap or run back in mad to meet the follow fear suddenli he heard the tinkl of water a sound hard and clear as a stone fall into a dream of dark shadow light grew and lo the compani pass through anoth gateway higharch and broad and a rill ran out besid them and beyond go steepli down wa a road between sheer cliff knifeedg against the sky far abov so deep and narrow wa that chasm that the sky wa dark and in it small star glint yet as gimli after learn it wa still two hour ere sunset of the day on which they had set out from dunharrow though for all that he could then tell it might have been twilight in some later year or in some other world the compani now mount again and gimli return to legola they rode in file and even came on and a deep blue dusk and still fear pursu them legola turn to speak to gimli look back and the dwarf saw befor hi face the glitter in the elf bright eye behind them rode elladan last of the compani but not the last of those that took the downward road the dead are follow said legola i see shape of men and of hors and pale banner like shred of cloud and spear like winterthicket on a misti night the dead are follow ye the dead ride behind they have been summon said elladan the compani came at last out of the ravin as suddenli as it they had issu from a crack in a wall and there lay the upland of a great vale befor them and the stream besid them went down with a cold voic over mani fall where in middleearth are we said gimli and elladan answer we have descend from the upris of the morthond the long chill river that flow at last to the sea that wash the wall of dol amroth you will not need to ask hereaft how come it name blackroot men call it the morthond vale made a great bay that beat up against the sheer southern face of the mountain it steep slope were grassgrown but all wa grey in that hour for the sun had gone and far below light twinkl in the home of men the vale wa rich and mani folk dwelt there then without turn aragorn cri aloud so that all could hear friend forget your weari ride now ride we must come to the stone of erech ere thi day pass and long still is the way so without look back they rode the mountainfield until they came to a bridg over the grow torrent and found a road that went down into the land light went out in hous and hamlet as they came and door were shut and folk that were afield cri in terror and ran wild like hunt deer ever there rose the same cri in the gather night the king of the dead the king of the dead is come upon us bell were ring far below and all men fled befor the face of aragorn but the grey compani in their hast rode like hunter until their hors were stumbl with weari and thu just ere midnight and in a dark as black as the cavern in the mountain they came at last to the hill of erech long had the terror of the dead lain upon that hill and upon the empti field about it for upon the top stood a black stone round as a great globe the height of a man though it half wa buri in the ground unearthli it look as though it had fallen from the sky as some believ but those who rememb still the lore of westerness told that it had been brought out of the ruin of númenor and there set by isildur at hi land none of the peopl of the valley dare to approach it nor would they dwell near for they said that it wa a trystingplac of the shadowmen and there they would gather in time of fear throng round the stone and whisper to that stone the compani came and halt in the dead of night then elrohir gave to aragorn a silver horn and he blew upon it and it seem to those that stood near that they heard a sound of answer horn as if it wa an echo in deep cave far away no other sound they heard and yet they were awar of a great host gather all about the hill on which they stood and a chill wind like the breath of ghost came down from the mountain but aragorn dismount and stand by the stone he cri in a great voic oathbreak whi have ye come and a voic wa heard out of the night that answer him as if from far away to fulfil our oath and have peac then aragorn said the hour is come at last now i go to pelargir upon anduin and ye shall come after me and when all thi land is clean of the servant of sauron i will hold the oath fulfil and ye shall have peac and depart for ever for i am elessar isildur heir of gondor and with that he bade halbarad unfurl the great standard which he had brought and behold it wa black and if there wa ani devic upon it it wa hidden in the dark then there wa silenc and not a whisper nor a sigh wa heard again all the long night the compani camp besid the stone but they slept littl becaus of the dread of the shadow that hedg them round but when the dawn came cold and pale aragorn rose at onc and he led the compani forth upon the journey of greatest hast and weari that ani among them had known save he alon and onli hi will held them to go on no other mortal men could have endur it none but the dúnedain of the north and with them gimli the dwarf and legola of the elv they pass tarlang neck and came into lamedon and the shadow host press behind and fear went on befor them until they came to calembel upon ciril and the sun went down like blood behind pinnath gelin away in the west behind them the township and the ford of ciril they found desert for mani men had gone away to war and all that were left fled to the hill at the rumour of the come of the king of the dead but the next day there came no dawn and the grey compani pass on into the dark of the storm of mordor and were lost to mortal sight but the dead follow them chapter the muster of rohan now all road were run togeth to the east to meet the come of war and the onset of the shadow and even as pippin stood at the great gate of the citi and saw the princ of dol amroth ride in with hi banner the king of rohan came down out of the hill day wa wane in the last ray of the sun the rider cast long point shadow that went on befor them dark had alreadi crept beneath the murmur firwood that cloth the steep mountainsid the king rode now slowli at the end of the day present the path turn round a huge bare shoulder of rock and plung into the gloom of softsigh tree down down they went in a long wind file when at last they came to the bottom of the gorg they found that even had fallen in the deep place the sun wa gone twilight lay upon the waterfal all day far below them a leap stream had run down from the high pass behind cleav it narrow way between pineclad wall and now through a stoni gate it flow out and pass into a wider vale the rider follow it and suddenli harrowdal lay befor them loud with the nois of water in the even there the white snowbourn join by the lesser stream went rush fume on the stone down to edora and the green hill and the plain away to the right at the head of the great dale the mighti starkhorn loom up abov it vast buttress swath in cloud but it jag peak cloth in everlast snow gleam far abov the world blueshadow upon the east redstain by the sunset in the west merri look out in wonder upon thi strang countri of which he had heard mani tale upon their long road it wa a skyless world in which hi eye through dim gulf of shadowi air saw onli evermount slope great wall of stone behind great wall and frown precipic wreath with mist he sat for a moment half dream listen to the nois of water the whisper of dark tree the crack of stone and the vast wait silenc that brood behind all sound he love mountain or he had love the thought of them march on the edg of stori brought from far away but now he wa born down by the insupport weight of middleearth he long to shut out the immens in a quiet room by a fire he wa veri tire for though they had ridden slowli they had ridden with veri littl rest hour after hour for nearli three weari day he had jog up and down over pass and through long dale and across mani stream sometim where the way wa broader he had ridden at the king side not notic that mani of the rider smile to see the two togeth the hobbit on hi littl shaggi grey poni and the lord of rohan on hi great white hors then he had talk to théoden tell him about hi home and the do of the shirefolk or listen in turn to tale of the mark and it mighti men of old but most of the time especi on thi last day merri had ridden by himself just behind the king say noth and tri to understand the slow sonor speech of rohan that he heard the men behind him use it wa a languag in which there seem to be mani word that he knew though spoken more richli and strongli than in the shire yet he could not piec the word togeth at time some rider would lift up hi clear voic in stir song and merri felt hi heart leap though he did not know what it wa about all the same he had been lone and never more so than now at the day end he wonder where in all thi strang world pippin had got to and what would becom of aragorn and legola and gimli then suddenli like a cold touch on hi heart he thought of frodo and sam i am forget them he said to himself reproach and yet they are more import than all the rest of us and i came to help them but now they must be hundr of mile away if they are still aliv he shiver harrowdal at last said éomer our journey is almost at an end they halt the path out of the narrow gorg fell steepli onli a glimps as through a tall window could be seen of the great valley in the gloam below a singl small light could be seen twinkl by the river thi journey is over mayb said théoden but i have far yet to go last night the moon wa full and in the morn i shall ride to edora to the gather of the mark but if you would take my counsel said éomer in a low voic you would then return hither until the war is over lost or won théoden smile nay my son for so i will call you speak not the soft word of wormtongu in my old ear he drew himself up and look back at the long line of hi men fade into the dusk behind long year in the space of day it seem sinc i rode west but never will i lean on a staff again if the war is lost what good will be my hide in the hill and if it is won what grief will it be even if i fall spend my last strength but we will leav thi now tonight i will lie in the hold of dunharrow one even of peac at least is left us let us ride on in the deepen dusk they came down into the valley here the snowbourn flow near to the western wall of the dale and soon the path led them to a ford where the shallow water murmur loudli on the stone the ford wa guard as the king approach mani men sprang up out of the shadow of the rock and when they saw the king they cri with glad voic théoden king théoden king the king of the mark return then one blew a long call on a horn it echo in the valley other horn answer it and light shone out across the river and suddenli there rose a great choru of trumpet from high abov sound from some hollow place as it seem that gather their note into one voic and sent it roll and beat on the wall of stone so the king of the mark came back victori out of the west to dunharrow beneath the feet of the white mountain there he found the remain strength of hi peopl alreadi assembl for as soon as hi come wa known captain rode to meet him at the ford bear messag from gandalf dúnhere chieftain of the folk of harrowdal wa at their head at dawn three day ago lord he said shadowfax came like a wind out of the west to edora and gandalf brought tide of your victori to gladden our heart but he brought also word from you to hasten the gather of the rider and then came the wing shadow the wing shadow said théoden we saw it also but that wa in the dead of night befor gandalf left us mayb lord said dúnhere yet the same or anoth like to it a fli dark in the shape of a monstrou bird pass over edora that morn and all men were shaken with fear for it stoop upon meduseld and as it came low almost to the gabl there came a cri that stop our heart then it wa that gandalf counsel us not to assembl in the field but to meet you here in the valley under the mountain and he bade us to kindl no more light or fire than barest need ask so it ha been done gandalf spoke with great author we trust that it is as you would wish naught ha been seen in harrowdal of these evil thing it is well said théoden i will ride now to the hold and there befor i go to rest i will meet the marshal and captain let them come to me as soon as may be the road now led eastward straight across the valley which wa at that point littl more than half a mile in width flat and mead of rough grass grey now in the fall night lay all about but in front on the far side of the dale merri saw a frown wall a last outlier of the great root of the starkhorn cloven by the river in age past on all the level space there wa great concours of men some throng to the roadsid hail the king and the rider from the west with glad cri but stretch away into the distanc behind there were order row of tent and booth and line of picket hors and great store of arm and pile spear bristl like thicket of newplant tree now all the great assembl wa fall into shadow and yet though the nightchil blew cold from the height no lantern glow no fire were lit watchmen heavili cloak pace to and fro merri wonder how mani rider there were he could not guess their number in the gather gloom but it look to him like a great armi mani thousand strong while he wa peer from side to side the king parti came up under the loom cliff on the eastern side of the valley and there suddenli the path began to climb and merri look up in amaz he wa on a road the like of which he had never seen befor a great work of men hand in year beyond the reach of song upward it wound coil like a snake bore it way across the sheer slope of rock steep as a stair it loop backward and forward as it climb up it hors could walk and wain could be slowli haul but no enemi could come that way except out of the air if it wa defend from abov at each turn of the road there were great stand stone that had been carv in the like of men huge and clumsylimb squat crossleg with their stumpi arm fold on fat belli some in the wear of the year had lost all featur save the dark hole of their eye that still stare sadli at the passersbi the rider hardli glanc at them the púkelmen they call them and heed them littl no power or terror wa left in them but merri gaze at them with wonder and a feel almost of piti as they loom up mourn in the dusk after a while he look back and found that he had alreadi climb some hundr of feet abov the valley but still far below he could dimli see a wind line of rider cross the ford and file along the road toward the camp prepar for them onli the king and hi guard were go up into the hold at last the king compani came to a sharp brink and the climb road pass into a cut between wall of rock and so went up a short slope and out on to a wide upland the firienfeld men call it a green mountainfield of grass and heath high abov the deepdelv cours of the snowbourn laid upon the lap of the great mountain behind the starkhorn southward and northward the sawtooth mass of irensaga between which there face the rider the grim black wall of the dwimorberg the haunt mountain rise out of steep slope of sombr pine divid the upland into two there march a doubl line of unshap stand stone that dwindl into the dusk and vanish in the tree those who dare to follow that road came soon to the black dimholt under dwimorberg and the menac of the pillar of stone and the yawn shadow of the forbidden door such wa the dark dunharrow the work of longforgotten men their name wa lost and no song or legend rememb it for what purpos they had made thi place as a town or secret templ or a tomb of king none could say here they labour in the dark year befor ever a ship came to the western shore or gondor of the dúnedain wa built and now they had vanish and onli the old púkelmen were left still sit at the turn of the road merri stare at the line of march stone they were worn and black some were lean some were fallen some crack or broken they look like row of old and hungri teeth he wonder what they could be and he hope that the king wa not go to follow them into the dark beyond then he saw that there were cluster of tent and booth on either side of the stoni way but these were not set near the tree and seem rather to huddl away from them toward the brink of the cliff the greater number were on the right where the firienfeld wa wider and on the left there wa a smaller camp in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion from thi side a rider now came out to meet them and they turn from the road as they drew near merri saw that the rider wa a woman with long braid hair gleam in the twilight yet she wore a helm and wa clad to the waist like a warrior and gird with a sword hail lord of the mark she cri my heart is glad at your return and you éowyn said théoden is all well with you all is well she answer yet it seem to merri that her voic beli her and he would have thought that she had been weep if that could be believ of one so stern of face all is well it wa a weari road for the peopl to take torn suddenli from their home there were hard word for it is long sinc war ha driven us from the green field but there have been no evil deed all is now order as you see and your lodg is prepar for you for i have had full tide of you and knew the hour of your come so aragorn ha come then said éomer is he still here no he is gone said éowyn turn away and look at the mountain dark against the east and south whither did he go ask éomer i do not know she answer he came at night and rode away yestermorn ere the sun had climb over the mountaintop he is gone you are griev daughter said théoden what ha happen tell me did he speak of that road he point away along the darken line of stone toward the dwimorberg of the path of the dead ye lord said éowyn and he ha pass into the shadow from which none have return i could not dissuad him he is gone then our path are sunder said éomer he is lost we must ride without him and our hope dwindl slowli they pass through the short heath and upland grass speak no more until they came to the king pavilion there merri found that everyth wa made readi and that he himself wa not forgotten a littl tent had been pitch for him besid the king lodg and there he sat alon while men pass to and fro go in to the king and take counsel with him night came on and the halfseen head of the mountain westward were crown with star but the east wa dark and blank the march stone fade slowli from sight but still beyond them blacker than the gloom brood the vast crouch shadow of the dwimorberg the path of the dead he mutter to himself the path of the dead what doe all thi mean they have all left me now they have all gone to some doom gandalf and pippin to war in the east and sam and frodo to mordor and strider and legola and gimli to the path of the dead but my turn will come soon enough i suppos i wonder what they are all talk about and what the king mean to do for i must go where he goe now in the midst of these gloomi thought he suddenli rememb that he wa veri hungri and he got up to go and see if anyon els in thi strang camp felt the same but at that veri moment a trumpet sound and a man came summon him the king esquir to wait at the king board in the inner part of the pavilion wa a small space curtain off with broider hang and strewn with skin and there at a small tabl sat théoden with éomer and éowyn and dúnhere lord of harrowdal merri stood besid the king stool and wait on him till present the old man come out of deep thought turn to him and smile come master meriadoc he said you shall not stand you shall sit besid me as long as i remain in my own land and lighten my heart with tale room wa made for the hobbit at the king left hand but no one call for ani tale there wa inde littl speech and they ate and drank for the most part in silenc until at last pluck up courag merri ask the question that wa torment him twice now lord i have heard of the path of the dead he said what are they and where ha strider i mean the lord aragorn where ha he gone the king sigh but no one answer until at last éomer spoke we do not know and our heart are heavi he said but as for the path of the dead you have yourself walk on their first step nay i speak no word of ill omen the road that we have climb is the approach to the door yonder in the dimholt but what lie beyond no man know no man know said théoden yet ancient legend now seldom spoken ha somewhat to report if these old tale speak true that have come down from father to son in the hous of eorl then the door under dwimorberg lead to a secret way that goe beneath the mountain to some forgotten end but none have ever ventur in to search it secret sinc baldor son of brego pass the door and wa never seen among men again a rash vow he spoke as he drain the horn at that feast which brego made to hallow newbuilt meduseld and he came never to the high seat of which he wa the heir folk say that dead men out of the dark year guard the way and will suffer no live man to come to their hidden hall but at while they may themselv be seen pass out of the door like shadow and down the stoni road then the peopl of harrowdal shut fast their door and shroud their window and are afraid but the dead come seldom forth and onli at time of great unquiet and come death yet it is said in harrowdal said éowyn in a low voic that in the moonless night but littl while ago a great host in strang array pass by whenc they came none knew but they went up the stoni road and vanish into the hill as if they went to keep a tryst then whi ha aragorn gone that way ask merri dont you know anyth that would explain it unless he ha spoken word to you as hi friend that we have not heard said éomer none now in the land of the live can tell hi purpos greatli chang he seem to me sinc i saw him first in the king hous said éowyn grimmer older fey i thought him and like one whom the dead call mayb he wa call said théoden and my heart tell me that i shall not see him again yet he is a kingli man of high destini and take comfort in thi daughter sinc comfort you seem to need in your grief for thi guest it is said that when the eorlinga came out of the north and pass at length up the snowbourn seek strong place of refug in time of need brego and hi son baldor climb the stair of the hold and so came befor the door on the threshold sat an old man age beyond guess of year tall and kingli he had been but now he wa wither as an old stone inde for stone they took him for he move not and he said no word until they sought to pass him by and enter and then a voic came out of him as it were out of the ground and to their amaz it spoke in the western tongu the way is shut then they halt and look at him and saw that he live still but he did not look at them the way is shut hi voic said again it wa made by those who are dead and the dead keep it until the time come the way is shut and when will that time besaid baldor but no answer did he ever get for the old man die in that hour and fell upon hi face and no other tide of the ancient dweller in the mountain have our folk ever learn yet mayb at last the time foretold ha come and aragorn may pass but how shall a man discov whether that time be come or no save by dare the door said éomer and that way i would not go though all the host of mordor stood befor me and i were alon and had no other refug ala that a fey mood should fall on a man so greatheart in thi hour of need are there not evil thing enough abroad without seek them under the earth war is at hand he paus for at that moment there wa a nois outsid a man voic cri the name of théoden and the challeng of the guard present the captain of the guard thrust asid the curtain a man is here lord he said an errandrid of gondor he wish to come befor you at onc let him come said théoden a tall man enter and merri choke back a cri for a moment it seem to him that boromir wa aliv again and had return then he saw that it wa not so the man wa a stranger though as like to boromir as if he were one of hi kin tall and greyey and proud he wa clad as a rider with a cloak of dark green over a coat of fine mail on the front of hi helm wa wrought a small silver star in hi hand he bore a singl arrow blackfeath and barb with steel but the point wa paint red he sank on one knee and present the arrow to théoden hail lord of the rohirrim friend of gondor he said hirgon i am errandrid of denethor who bring you thi token of war gondor is in great need often the rohirrim have aid us but now the lord denethor ask for all your strength and all your speed lest gondor fall at last the red arrow said théoden hold it as one who receiv a summon long expect and yet dread when it come hi hand trembl the red arrow ha not been seen in the mark in all my year ha it inde come to that and what doe the lord denethor reckon that all my strength and all my speed may be that is best known to yourself lord said hirgon but ere long it may well come to pass that mina tirith is surround and unless you have the strength to break a sieg of mani power the lord denethor bid me say that he judg that the strong arm of the rohirrim would be better within hi wall than without but he know that we are a peopl who fight rather upon horseback and in the open and that we are also a scatter peopl and time is need for the gather of our rider is it not true hirgon that the lord of mina tirith know more than he set in hi messag for we are alreadi at war as you may have seen and you do not find us all unprepar gandalf the grey ha been among us and even now we are muster for battl in the east what the lord denethor may know or guess of all these thing i can not say answer hirgon but inde our case is desper my lord doe not issu ani command to you he beg you onli to rememb old friendship and oath long spoken and for your own good to do all that you may it is report to us that mani king have ridden in from the east to the servic of mordor from the north to the field of dagorlad there is skirmish and rumour of war in the south the haradrim are move and fear ha fallen on all our coastland so that littl help will come to us thenc make hast for it is befor the wall of mina tirith that the doom of our time will be decid and if the tide be not stem there then it will flow over all the fair field of rohan and even in thi hold among the hill there shall be no refug dark tide said théoden yet not all unguess but say to denethor that even if rohan itself felt no peril still we would come to hi aid but we have suffer much loss in our battl with saruman the traitor and we must still think of our frontier to the north and east as hi own tide make clear so great a power as the dark lord seem now to wield might well contain us in battl befor the citi and yet strike with great forc across the river away beyond the gate of king but we will speak no longer counsel of prudenc we will come the weapontak wa set for the morrow when all is order we will set out ten thousand spear i might have sent ride over the plain to the dismay of your foe it will be less now i fear for i will not leav my stronghold all unguard yet six thousand at the least shall ride behind me for say to denethor that in thi hour the king of the mark himself will come down to the land of gondor though mayb he will not ride back but it is a long road and man and beast must reach the end with strength to fight a week it may be from tomorrow morn ere you hear the cri of the son of eorl come from the north a week said hirgon if it must be so it must but you are like to find onli ruin wall in seven day from now unless other help unlookedfor come still you may at the least disturb the orc and swarthi men from their feast in the white tower at the least we will do that said théoden but i myself am newcom from battl and long journey and i will now go to rest tarri here thi night then you shall look on the muster of rohan and ride away the gladder for the sight and the swifter for the rest in the morn counsel are best and night chang mani thought with that the king stood up and they all rose go now each to your rest he said and sleep well and you master meriadoc i need no more tonight but be readi to my call as soon as the sun is risen i will be readi said merri even if you bid me ride with you on the path of the dead speak not word of omen said the king for there may be more road than one that could bear that name but i did not say that i would bid you ride with me on ani road good night i wont be left behind to be call for on return said merri i wont be left i wont and repeat thi over and over again to himself he fell asleep at last in hi tent he wa waken by a man shake him wake up wake up master holbytla he cri and at length merri came out of deep dream and sat up with a start it still seem veri dark he thought what is the matter he ask the king call for you but the sun ha not risen yet said merri no and will not rise today master holbytla nor ever again one would think under thi cloud but time doe not stand still though the sun be lost make hast fling on some cloth merri look outsid the world wa darkl the veri air seem brown and all thing about were black and grey and shadowless there wa a great still no shape of cloud could be seen unless it were far away westward where the furthest grope finger of the great gloom still crawl onward and a littl light leak through them overhead there hung a heavi roof sombr and featureless and light seem rather to be fail than grow merri saw mani folk stand look up and mutter all their face were grey and sad and some were afraid with a sink heart he made hi way to the king hirgon the rider of gondor wa there befor him and besid him stood now anoth man like him and dress alik but shorter and broader as merri enter he wa speak to the king it come from mordor lord he said it began last night at sunset from the hill in the eastfold of your realm i saw it rise and creep across the sky and all night as i rode it came behind eat up the star now the great cloud hang over all the land between here and the mountain of shadow and it is deepen war ha alreadi begun for a while the king sat silent at last he spoke so we come to it in the end he said the great battl of our time in which mani thing shall pass away but at least there is no longer need for hide we will ride the straight way and the open road and with all our speed the muster shall begin at onc and wait for none that tarri have you good store in mina tirith for if we must ride now in all hast then we must ride light with but meal and water enough to last us into battl we have veri great store long prepar answer hirgon ride now as light and as swift as you may then call the herald éomer said théoden let the rider be marshal éomer went out and present the trumpet rang in the hold and were answer by mani other from below but their voic no longer sound clear and brave as they had seem to merri the night befor dull they seem and harsh in the heavi air bray omin the king turn to merri i am go to war master meriadoc he said in a littl while i shall take the road i releas you from my servic but not from my friendship you shall abid here and if you will you shall serv the ladi éowyn who will govern the folk in my stead but but lord merri stammer i offer you my sword i do not want to be part from you like thi théoden king and as all my friend have gone to the battl i should be asham to stay behind but we ride on hors tall and swift said théoden and great though your heart be you can not ride on such beast then tie me on to the back of one or let me hang on a stirrup or someth said merri it is a long way to run but run i shall if i can not ride even if i wear my feet off and arriv week too late théoden smile rather than that i would bear you with me on snowman he said but at the least you shall ride with me to edora and look on meduseld for that way i shall go so far stybba can bear you the great race will not begin till we reach the plain then éowyn rose up come now meriadoc she said i will show you the gear that i have prepar fur you they went out togeth thi request onli did aragorn make to me said éowyn as they pass among the tent that you should be arm for battl i have grant it as i could for my heart tell me that you will need such gear ere the end now she led merri to a booth among the lodg of the king guard and there an armour brought out to her a small helm and a round shield and other gear no mail have we to fit you said éowyn nor ani time for the forg of such a hauberk but here is also a stout jerkin of leather a belt and a knife a sword you have merri bow and the ladi show him the shield which wa like the shield that had been given to gimli and it bore on it the devic of the white hors take all these thing she said and bear them to good fortun farewel now master meriadoc yet mayb we shall meet again you and i so it wa that amid a gather gloom the king of the mark made readi to lead all hi rider on the eastward road heart were heavi and mani quail in the shadow but they were a stern peopl loyal to their lord and littl weep or murmur wa heard even in the camp in the hold where the exil from edora were hous women and children and old men doom hung over them but they face it silent two swift hour pass and now the king sat upon hi white hors glimmer in the half light proud and tall he seem though the hair that flow beneath hi high helm wa like snow and mani marvel at him and took heart to see him unbent and unafraid there on the wide flat besid the noisi river were marshal in mani compani well nigh five and fifti hundr of rider fulli arm and mani hundr of other men with spare hors lightli burden a singl trumpet sound the king rais hi hand and then silent the host of the mark began to move foremost went twelv of the king householdmen rider of renown then the king follow with éomer on hi right he had said farewel to éowyn abov in the hold and the memori wa grievou but now he turn hi mind to the road that lay ahead behind him merri rode on stybba with the errand rider of gondor and behind them again twelv more of the king household they pass down the long rank of wait men with stern and unmov face but when they had come almost to the end of the line one look up glanc keenli at the hobbit a young man merri thought as he return the glanc less in height and girth than most he caught the glint of clear grey eye and then he shiver for it came suddenli to him that it wa the face of one without hope who goe in search of death on down the grey road they went besid the snowbourn rush on it stone through the hamlet of underharrow and upbourn where mani sad face of women look out from dark door and so without horn or harp or music of men voic the great ride into the east began with which the song of rohan were busi for mani long live of men thereaft from dark dunharrow in the dim morn with thane and captain rode thengel son to edora he came the ancient hall of the markwarden mistenshroud golden timber were in gloom mantl farewel he bade to hi free

weight than mani men though lith and wellknit in frame on into the shadow they rode in the willowthicket where snowbourn flow into entwash twelv leagu east of edora they camp that night and then on again through the fold and through the fenmarch where to their right great oakwood climb on the skirt of the hill under the shade of dark halifirien by the border of gondor but away to their left the mist lay on the marsh fed by the mouth of entwash and as they rode rumour came of war in the north lone men ride wild brought word of foe assail their eastbord of orchost march in the wold of rohan ride on ride on cri éomer too late now to turn asid the fen of entwash must guard our flank hast now we need ride on and so king théoden depart from hi own realm and mile by mile the long road wound away and the beacon hill march past calenhad minrimmon erela nardol but their fire were quench all the land were grey and still and ever the shadow deepen befor them and hope wane in everi heart chapter the sieg of gondor pippin wa rous by gandalf candl were lit in their chamber for onli a dim twilight came through the window the air wa heavi as with approach thunder what is the time said pippin yawn past the second hour said gandalf time to get up and make yourself present you are summon to the lord of the citi to learn your new duti and will he provid breakfast no i have provid it all that you will get till noon food is now dole out by order pippin look ruefulli at the small loaf and he thought veri inadequ pat of butter which wa set out for him besid a cup of thin milk whi did you bring me here he said you know quit well said gandalf to keep you out of mischief and if you do not like be here you can rememb that you brought it on yourself pippin said no more befor long he wa walk with gandalf onc more down the cold corridor to the door of the tower hall there denethor sat in a grey gloom like an old patient spider pippin thought he did not seem to have move sinc the day befor he beckon gandalf to a seat but pippin wa left for a while stand unheed present the old man turn to him well master peregrin i hope that you use yesterday to your profit and to your like though i fear that the board is barer in thi citi than you could wish pippin had an uncomfort feel that most of what he had said or done wa somehow known to the lord of the citi and much wa guess of what he thought as well he did not answer what would you do in my servic i thought sir that you would tell me my duti i will when i learn what you are fit for said denethor but that i shall learn soonest mayb if i keep you besid me the esquir of my chamber ha beg leav to go to the outgarrison so you shall take hi place for a while you shall wait on me bear errand and talk to me if war and council leav me ani leisur can you sing ye said pippin well ye well enough for my own peopl but we have no song fit for great hall and evil time lord we seldom sing of anyth more terribl than wind or rain and most of my song are about thing that make us laugh or about food and drink of cours and whi should such song be unfit for my hall or for such hour as these we who have live long under the shadow may sure listen to echo from a land untroubl by it then we may feel that our vigil wa not fruitless though it may have been thankless pippin heart sank he did not relish the idea of sing ani song of the shire to the lord of mina tirith certainli not the comic one that he knew best they were too well rustic for such an occas he wa howev spare the ordeal for the present he wa not command to sing denethor turn to gandalf ask question about the rohirrim and their polici and the posit of éomer the king nephew pippin marvel at the amount that the lord seem to know about a peopl that live far away though it must he thought be mani year sinc denethor himself had ridden abroad present denethor wave to pippin and dismiss him again for a while go to the armouri of the citadel he said and get you there the liveri and gear of the tower it will be readi it wa command yesterday return when you are clad it wa as he said and pippin soon found himself array in strang garment all of black and silver he had a small hauberk it ring forg of steel mayb yet black as jet and a highcrown helm with small ravenw on either side set with a silver star in the centr of the circlet abov the mail wa a short surcoat of black but broider on the breast in silver with the token of the tree hi old cloth were fold and put away but he wa permit to keep the grey cloak of lórien though not to wear it when on duti he look now had he known it verili ernil i pheriannath the princ of the halfl that folk had call him but he felt uncomfort and the gloom began to weigh on hi spirit it wa dark and dim all day from the sunless dawn until even the heavi shadow had deepen and all heart in the citi were oppress far abov a great cloud stream slowli westward from the black land devour light born upon a wind of war but below the air wa still and breathless as if all the vale of anduin wait for the onset of a ruinou storm about the eleventh hour releas at last for a while from servic pippin came out and went in search of food and drink to cheer hi heavi heart and make hi task of wait more support in the mess he met beregond again who had just come from an errand over the pelennor out to the guardtow upon the causeway togeth they stroll out to the wall for pippin felt imprison indoor and stifl even in the lofti citadel now they sat side by side again in the embrasur look eastward where they had eaten and talk the day befor it wa the sunsethour but the great pall had now stretch far into the west and onli as it sank at last into the sea did the sun escap to send out a brief farewel gleam befor the night even as frodo saw it at the crossroad touch the head of the fallen king but to the field of the pelennor under the shadow of mindolluin there came no gleam they were brown and drear alreadi it seem year to pippin sinc he had sat there befor in some halfforgotten time when he had still been a hobbit a lightheart wander touch littl by the peril he had pass through now he wa one small soldier in a citi prepar for a great assault clad in the proud but sombr manner of the tower of guard in some other time and place pippin might have been pleas with hi new array but he knew now that he wa take part in no play he wa in deadli earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril the hauberk wa burdensom and the helm weigh upon hi head hi cloak he had cast asid upon the seat he turn hi tire gaze away from the darkl field below and yawn and then he sigh you are weari of thi day said beregond ye said pippin veri tire out with idl and wait i have kick my heel at the door of my master chamber for mani slow hour while he ha debat with gandalf and the princ and other great person and im not use master beregond to wait hungri on other while they eat it is a sore trial for a hobbit that no doubt you will think i should feel the honour more deepli but what is the good of such honour inde what is the good even of food and drink under thi creep shadow what doe it mean the veri air seem thick and brown do you often have such gloom when the wind is in the east nay said beregond thi is no weather of the world thi is some devic of hi malic some broil of fume from the mountain of fire that he send to darken heart and counsel and so it doth inde i wish the lord faramir would return he would not be dismay but now who know if he will ever come back across the river out of the dark ye said pippin gandalf too is anxiou he wa disappoint i think not to find faramir here and where ha he got to himself he left the lord council befor the noonmeal and in no good mood either i thought perhap he ha some forebod of bad news suddenli as they talk they were stricken dumb frozen as it were to listen stone pippin cower down with hi hand press to hi ear but beregond who had been look out from the battlement as he spoke of faramir remain there stiffen stare out with start eye pippin knew the shudder cri that he had heard it wa the same that he had heard long ago in the marish of the shire but now it wa grown in power and hatr pierc the heart with a poison despair at last beregond spoke with an effort they have come he said take courag and look there are fell thing below reluctantli pippin climb on to the seat and look out over the wall the pelennor lay dim beneath him fade away to the scarc guess line of the great river but now wheel swiftli across it like shadow of untim night he saw in the middl air below him five birdlik form horribl as carrionfowl yet greater than eagl cruel as death now they swoop near ventur almost within bowshot of the wall now they circl away black rider mutter pippin black rider of the air but see beregond he cri they are look for someth sure see how they wheel and swoop alway down to that point over there and can you see someth move on the ground dark littl thing ye men on hors four or five ah i can not stand it gandalf gandalf save us anoth long screech rose and fell and he threw himself back again from the wall pant like a hunt anim faint and seemingli remot through that shudder cri he heard wind up from below the sound of a trumpet end on a long high note faramir the lord faramir it is hi call cri beregond brave heart but how can he win to the gate if these foul hellhawk have other weapon than fear but look they hold on they will make the gate no the hors are run mad look the men are thrown they are run on foot no one is still up but he ride back to the other that will be the captain he can master both beast and men ah there one of the foul thing is stoop on him help help will no one go out to him faramir with that beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom asham of hi terror while beregond of the guard thought first of the captain whom he love pippin got up and peer out at that moment he caught a flash of white and silver come from the north like a small star down on the duski field it move with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came converg swiftli with the flight of the four men toward the gate it seem to pippin that a pale light wa spread about it and the heavi shadow gave way befor it and then as it drew near he thought that he heard like an echo in the wall a great voic call gandalf he cri gandalf he alway turn up when thing are darkest go on go on white rider gandalf gandalf he shout wildli like an onlook at a great race urg on a runner who is far beyond encourag but now the dark swoop shadow were awar of the newcom one wheel toward him but it seem to pippin that he rais hi hand and from it a shaft of white light stab upward the nazgûl gave a long wail cri and swerv away and with that the four other waver and then rise in swift spiral they pass away eastward vanish into the lower cloud abov and down on the pelennor it seem for a while less dark pippin watch and he saw the horseman and the white rider meet and halt wait for those on foot men now hurri out to them from the citi and soon they all pass from sight under the outer wall and he knew that they were enter the gate guess that they would come at onc to the tower and the steward he hurri to the entranc of the citadel there he wa join by mani other who had watch the race and the rescu from the high wall it wa not long befor a clamour wa heard in the street lead up from the outer circl and there wa much cheer and cri of the name of faramir and mithrandir present pippin saw torch and follow by a press of peopl two horsemen ride slowli one wa in white but shine no longer pale in the twilight as if hi fire wa spent or veil the other wa dark and hi head wa bow they dismount and as groom took shadowfax and the other hors they walk forward to the sentinel at the gate gandalf steadili hi grey cloak flung back and a fire still smoulder in hi eye the other clad all in green slowli sway a littl as a weari or a wound man pippin press forward as they pass under the lamp beneath the gatearch and when he saw the pale face of faramir he caught hi breath it wa the face of one who ha been assail by a great fear or anguish but ha master it and now is quiet proud and grave he stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard and pippin gaze at him saw how close he resembl hi brother boromir – whom pippin had like from the first admir the great man lordli but kindli manner yet suddenli for faramir hi heart wa strang move with a feel that he had not known befor here wa one with an air of high nobil such as aragorn at time reveal less high perhap yet also less incalcul and remot one of the king of men born into a later time but touch with the wisdom and sad of the elder race he knew now whi beregond spoke hi name with love he wa a captain that men would follow that he would follow even under the shadow of the black wing faramir he cri aloud with the other faramir and faramir catch hi strang voic among the clamour of the men of the citi turn and look down at him and wa amaz whenc come you he said a halfl and in the liveri of the tower whenc but with that gandalf step to hi side and spoke he came with me from the land of the halfl he said he came with me but let us not tarri here there is much to say and to do and you are weari he shall come with us inde he must for if he doe not forget hi new duti more easili than i do he must attend on hi lord again within thi hour come pippin follow us so at length they came to the privat chamber of the lord of the citi there deep seat were set about a brazier of charcoal and wine wa brought and there pippin hardli notic stood behind the chair of denethor and felt hi weari littl so eagerli did he listen to all that wa said when faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine he sat upon a low chair at hi father left hand remov a littl upon the other side sat gandalf in a chair of carven wood and he seem at first to be asleep for at the begin faramir spoke onli of the errand upon which he had been sent out ten day befor and he brought tide of ithilien and of movement of the enemi and hi alli and he told of the fight on the road when the men of harad and their great beast were overthrown a captain report to hi master such matter as had often been heard befor small thing of borderwar that now seem useless and petti shorn of their renown then suddenli faramir look at pippin but now we come to strang matter he said for thi is not the first halfl that i have seen walk out of northern legend into the southland at that gandalf sat up and grip the arm of hi chair but he said noth and with a look stop the exclam on pippin lip denethor look at their face and nod hi head as though in sign that he had read much there befor it wa spoken slowli while the other sat silent and still faramir told hi tale with hi eye for the most part on gandalf though now and again hi glanc stray to pippin as if to refresh hi memori of other that he had seen as hi stori wa unfold of hi meet with frodo and hi servant and of the event at henneth annûn pippin becam awar that gandalf hand were trembl as they clutch the carven wood white they seem now and veri old and as he look at them suddenli with a thrill of fear pippin knew that gandalf gandalf himself wa troubl even afraid the air of the room wa close and still at last when faramir spoke of hi part with the travel and of their resolv to go to cirith ungol hi voic fell and he shook hi head and sigh then gandalf sprang up cirith ungol morgul vale he said the time faramir the time when did you part with them when would they reach that accurs valley i part with them in the morn two day ago said faramir it is fifteen leagu thenc to the vale of the morgulduin if they went straight south and then they would be still five leagu westward of the accurs tower at swiftest they could not come there befor today and mayb they have not come there yet inde i see what you fear but the dark is not due to their ventur it began yesterev and all ithilien wa under shadow last night it is clear to me that the enemi ha long plan an assault on us and it hour had alreadi been determin befor ever the travel left my keep gandalf pace the floor the morn of two day ago nigh on three day of journey how far is the place where you part some twentyf leagu as a bird fli answer faramir but i could not come more swiftli yesterev i lay at cair andro the long isl in the river northward which we hold in defenc and hors are kept on the hither bank as the dark drew on i knew that hast wa need so i rode thenc with three other that could also be hors the rest of my compani i sent south to strengthen the garrison at the ford of osgiliath i hope that i have not done ill he look at hi father ill cri denethor and hi eye flash suddenli whi do you ask the men were under your command or do you ask for my judgement on all your deed your bear is lowli in my presenc yet it is long now sinc you turn from your own way at my counsel see you have spoken skil as ever but i have i not seen your eye fix on mithrandir seek whether you said well or too much he ha long had your heart in hi keep my son your father is old but not yet dotard i can see and hear as wa my wont and littl of what you have half said or left unsaid is now hidden from me i know the answer to mani riddl ala ala for boromir if what i have done displeas you my father said faramir quietli i wish i had known your counsel befor the burden of so weighti a judgement wa thrust on me would that have avail to chang your judgement said denethor you would still have done just so i deem i know you well ever your desir is to appear lordli and gener as a king of old graciou gentl that may well befit one of high race if he sit in power and peac but in desper hour gentl may be repaid with death so be it said faramir so be it cri denethor but not with your death onli lord faramir with the death also of your father and of all your peopl whom it is your part to protect now that boromir is gone do you wish then said faramir that our place had been exchang ye i wish that inde said denethor for boromir wa loyal to me and no wizard pupil he would have rememb hi father need and would not have squander what fortun gave he would have brought me a mighti gift for a moment faramir restraint gave way i would ask you my father to rememb whi it wa that i not he wa in ithilien on one occas at least your counsel ha prevail not long ago it wa the lord of the citi that gave the errand to him stir not the bitter in the cup that i mix for myself said denethor have i not tast it now mani night upon my tongu forebod that wors yet lay in the dreg as now inde i find would it were not so would that thi thing had come to me comfort yourself said gandalf in no case would boromir have brought it to you he is dead and die well may he sleep in peac yet you deceiv yourself he would have stretch out hi hand to thi thing and take it he would have fallen he would have kept it for hi own and when he return you would not have known your son the face of denethor set hard and cold you found boromir less apt to your hand did you not he said softli but i who wa hi father say that he would have brought it to me you are wise mayb mithrandir yet with all your subtleti you have not all wisdom counsel may be found that are neither the web of wizard nor the hast of fool i have in thi matter more lore and wisdom than you deem what then is your wisdom said gandalf enough to perceiv that there are two folli to avoid to use thi thing is peril at thi hour to send it in the hand of a witless halfl into the land of the enemi himself as you have done and thi son of mine that is mad and the lord denethor what would he have done neither but most sure not for ani argument would he have set thi thing at a hazard beyond all but a fool hope risk our utter ruin if the enemi should recov what he lost nay it should have been kept hidden hidden dark and deep not use i say unless at the uttermost end of need but set beyond hi grasp save by a victori so final that what then befel would not troubl us be dead you think as is your wont my lord of gondor onli said gandalf yet there are other men and other live and time still to be and for me i piti even hi slave and where will other men look for help if gondor fall answer denethor if i had thi thing now in the deep vault of thi citadel we should not then shake with dread under thi gloom fear the worst and our counsel would be undisturb if you do not trust me to endur the test you do not know me yet nonetheless i do not trust you said gandalf had i done so i could have sent thi thing hither to your keep and spare myself and other much anguish and now hear you speak i trust you less no more than boromir nay stay your wrath i do not trust myself in thi and i refus thi thing even as a freeli given gift you are strong and can still in some matter govern yourself denethor yet if you had receiv thi thing it would have overthrown you were it buri beneath the root of mindolluin still it would burn your mind away as the dark grow and the yet wors thing follow that soon shall come upon us for a moment the eye of denethor glow again as he face gandalf and pippin felt onc more the strain between their will but now almost it seem as if their glanc were like blade from eye to eye flicker as they fenc pippin trembl fear some dread stroke but suddenli denethor relax and grew cold again he shrug hi shoulder if i had if you had he said such word and if are vain it ha gone into the shadow and onli time will show what doom await it and us the time will not be long in what is left let all who fight the enemi in their fashion be at one and keep hope while they may and after hope still the hardihood to die free he turn to faramir what think you of the garrison at osgiliath it is not strong said faramir i have sent the compani of ithilien to strengthen it as i have said not enough i deem said denethor it is there that the first blow will fall they will have need of some stout captain there there and elsewher in mani place said faramir and sigh ala for my brother whom i too love he rose may i have your leav father and then he sway and lean upon hi father chair you are weari i see said denethor you have ridden fast and far and under shadow of evil in the air i am told let us not speak of that said faramir then we will not said denethor go now and rest as you may tomorrow need will be sterner all now took leav of the lord of the citi and went to rest while they still could outsid there wa a starless black as gandalf with pippin besid him bear a small torch made hi way to their lodg they did not speak until they were behind close door then at last pippin took gandalf hand tell me he said is there ani hope for frodo i mean or at least mostli for frodo gandalf put hi hand on pippin head there never wa much hope he answer just a fool hope as i have been told and when i heard of cirith ungol––– he broke off and strode to the window as if hi eye could pierc the night in the east cirith ungol he mutter whi that way i wonder he turn just now pippin my heart almost fail me hear that name and yet in truth i believ that the news that faramir bring ha some hope in it for it seem clear that our enemi ha open hi war at last and made the first move while frodo wa still free so now for mani day he will have hi eye turn thi way and that away from hi own land and yet pippin i feel from afar hi hast and fear he ha begun sooner than he would someth ha happen to stir him gandalf stood for a moment in thought mayb he mutter mayb even your foolish help my lad let me see some five day ago now he would discov that we had thrown down saruman and had taken the stone still what of that we could not use it to much purpos or without hi know ah i wonder aragorn hi time draw near and he is strong and stern underneath pippin bold determin abl to take hi own counsel and dare great risk at need that may be it he may have use the stone and shown himself to the enemi challeng him for thi veri purpos i wonder well we shall not know the answer till the rider of rohan come if they do not come too late there are evil day ahead to sleep while we may but said pippin but what said gandalf onli one but will i allow tonight gollum said pippin how on earth could they be go about with him even follow him and i could see that faramir did not like the place he wa take them to ani more than you do what is wrong i can not answer that now said gandalf yet my heart guess that frodo and gollum would meet befor the end for good or for evil but of cirith ungol i will not speak tonight treacheri treacheri i fear treacheri of that miser creatur but so it must be let us rememb that a traitor may betray himself and do good that he doe not intend it can be so sometim good night the next day came with a morn like a brown dusk and the heart of men lift for a while by the return of faramir sank low again the wing shadow were not seen again that day yet ever and anon high abov the citi a faint cri would come and mani who heard it would stand stricken with a pass dread while the less stoutheart quail and wept and now faramir wa gone again they give him no rest some murmur the lord drive hi son too hard and now he must do the duti of two for himself and for the one that will not return and ever men look northward ask where are the rider of rohan in truth faramir did not go by hi own choos but the lord of the citi wa master of hi council and he wa in no mood that day to bow to other earli in the morn the council had been summon there all the captain judg that becaus of the threat in the south their forc wa too weak to make ani stroke of war on their own part unless perchanc the rider of rohan yet should come meanwhil they must man the wall and wait yet said denethor we should not lightli abandon the outer defenc the ramma made with so great a labour and the enemi must pay dearli for the cross of the river that he can not do in forc to assail the citi either north of cair andro becaus of the marsh or southward toward lebennin becaus of the breadth of the river that need mani boat it is at osgiliath that he will put hi weight as befor when boromir deni him the passag that wa but a trial said faramir today we may make the enemi pay ten time our loss at the passag and yet rue the exchang for he can afford to lose a host better than we to lose a compani and the retreat of those that we put out far afield will be peril if he win across in forc and what of cair andro said the princ that too must be held if osgiliath is defend let us not forget the danger on our left the rohirrim may come and they may not but faramir ha told us of great strength draw ever to the black gate more than one host may issu from it and strike for more than one passag much must be risk in war said denethor cair andro is man and no more can be sent so far but i will not yield the river and the pelennor unfought – not if there is a captain here who ha still the courag to do hi lord will then all were silent but at length faramir said i do not oppos your will sire sinc you are rob of boromir i will go and do what i can in hi stead – if you command it i do so said denethor then farewel said faramir but if i should return think better of me that depend on the manner of your return said denethor gandalf it wa that last spoke to faramir ere he rode east do not throw your live away rashli or in bitter he said you will be need here for other thing than war your father love you faramir and will rememb it ere the end farewel so now the lord faramir had gone forth again and had taken with him such strength of men as were will to go or could be spare on the wall some gaze through the gloom toward the ruin citi and they wonder what chanc there for noth could be seen and other as ever look north and count the leagu to théoden in rohan will he come will he rememb our old allianc they said ye he will come said gandalf even if he come too late but think at best the red arrow can not have reach him more than two day ago and the mile are long from edora it wa night again ere news came a man rode in hast from the ford say that a host had issu from mina morgul and wa alreadi draw nigh to osgiliath and it had been join by regiment from the south haradrim cruel and tall and we have learn said the messeng that the black captain lead them onc again and the fear of him ha pass befor him over the river with those illbod word the third day close sinc pippin came to mina tirith few went to rest for small hope had ani now that even faramir could hold the ford for long the next day though the dark had reach it full and grew no deeper it weigh heavier on men heart and a great dread wa on them ill news came soon again the passag of anduin wa won by the enemi faramir wa retreat to the wall of the pelennor ralli hi men to the causeway fort but he wa ten time outnumb if he win back at all across the pelennor hi enemi will be on hi heel said the messeng they have paid dear for the cross but less dearli than we hope the plan ha been well laid it is now seen that in secret they have long been build float and barg in great number in east osgiliath they swarm across like beetl but it is the black captain that defeat us few will stand and abid even the rumour of hi come hi own folk quail at him and they would slay themselv at hi bid then i am need there more than here said gandalf and rode off at onc and the glimmer of him fade soon from sight and all that night pippin alon and sleepless stood upon the wall and gaze eastward the bell of day had scarc rung out again a mockeri in the unlighten dark when far away he saw fire spring up across in the dim space where the wall of the pelennor stood the watchmen cri aloud and all men in the citi stood to arm now ever and anon there wa a red flash and slowli through the heavi air dull rumbl could be heard they have taken the wall men cri they are blast breach in it they are come where is faramir cri beregond in dismay say not that he ha fallen it wa gandalf that brought the first tide with a hand of horsemen he came in the middl morn ride as escort to a line of wain they were fill with wound men all that could be save from the wreck of the causeway fort at onc he went to denethor the lord of the citi sat now in a high chamber abov the hall of the white tower with pippin at hi side and through the dim window north and south and east he bent hi dark eye as if to pierc the shadow of doom that ring him round most to the north he look and would paus at while to listen as if by some ancient art hi ear might hear the thunder of hoof on the plain far away is faramir come he ask no said gandalf but he still live when i left him yet he is resolv to stay with the rearguard lest the retreat over the pelennor becom a rout he may perhap hold hi men togeth long enough but i doubt it he is pit against a foe too great for one ha come that i fear not – the dark lord cri pippin forget hi place in hi terror denethor laugh bitterli nay not yet master peregrin he will not come save onli to triumph over me when all is won he use other as hi weapon so do all great lord if they are wise master halfl or whi should i sit here in my tower and think and watch and wait spend even my son for i can still wield a brand he stood up and cast open hi long black cloak and behold he wa clad in mail beneath and girt with a long sword greathilt in a sheath of black and silver thu have i walk and thu now for mani year have i slept he said lest with age the bodi should grow soft and timid yet now under the lord of baraddûr the most fell of all hi captain is alreadi master of your outer wall said gandalf king of angmar long ago sorcer ringwraith lord of the nazgûl a spear of terror in the hand of sauron shadow of despair then mithrandir you had a foe to match you said denethor for myself i have long known who is the chief captain of the host of the dark tower is thi all that you have return to say or can it be that you have withdrawn becaus you are overmatch pippin trembl fear that gandalf would be stung to sudden wrath but hi fear wa needless it might be so gandalf answer softli but our trial of strength is not yet come and if word spoken of old be true not by the hand of man shall he fall and hidden from the wise is the doom that await him howev that may be the captain of despair doe not press forward yet he rule rather accord to the wisdom that you have just spoken from the rear drive hi slave in mad on befor nay i came rather to guard the hurt men that can yet be heal for the ramma is breach far and wide and soon the host of morgul will enter in at mani point and i came chiefli to say thi soon there will be battl on the field a sorti must be made readi let it be of mount men in them lie our brief hope for in one thing onli is the enemi still poorli provid he ha few horsemen and we also have few now would the come of rohan be in the nick of time said denethor we are like to see other newcom first said gandalf fugit from cair andro have alreadi reach us the isl ha fallen anoth armi is come from the black gate cross from the northeast some have accus you mithrandir of delight to bear ill news said denethor but to me thi is no longer news it wa known to me ere nightfal yesterday as for the sorti i had alreadi given thought to it let us go down time pass at length watcher on the wall could see the retreat of the outcompani small band of weari and often wound men came first with littl order some were run wildli as if pursu away to the eastward the distant fire flicker and now it seem that here and there they crept across the plain hous and barn were burn then from mani point littl river of red flame came hurri on wind through the gloom converg toward the line of the broad road that led from the cityg to osgiliath the enemi men murmur the dike is down here they come pour through the breach and they carri torch it seem where are our own folk it drew now to even by the hour and the light wa so dim that even farsight men upon the citadel could discern littl clearli out upon the field save onli the burn that ever multipli and the line of fire that grew in length and speed at last less than a mile from the citi a more order mass of men came into view march not run still hold togeth the watcher held their breath faramir must be there they said he can govern man and beast he will make it yet now the main retreat wa scarc two furlong distant out of the gloom behind a small compani of horsemen gallop all that wa left of the rearguard onc again they turn at bay face the oncom line of fire then suddenli there wa a tumult of fierc cri horsemen of the enemi swept up the line of fire becam flow torrent file upon file of orc bear flame and wild southron men with red banner shout with harsh tongu surg up overtak the retreat and with a pierc cri out of the dim sky fell the wing shadow the nazgûl stoop to the kill the retreat becam a rout alreadi men were break away fli wild and witless here and there fling away their weapon cri out in fear fall to the ground and then a trumpet rang from the citadel and denethor at last releas the sorti drawn up within the shadow of the gate and under the loom wall outsid they had wait for hi signal all the mount men that were left in the citi now they sprang forward form quicken to a gallop and charg with a great shout and from the wall an answer shout went up for foremost on the field rode the swanknight of dol amroth with their princ and hi blue banner at their head amroth for gondor they cri amroth to faramir like thunder they broke upon the enemi on either flank of the retreat but one rider outran them all swift as the wind in the grass shadowfax bore him shine unveil onc more a light start from hi uprais hand the nazgûl screech and swept away for their captain wa not yet come to challeng the white fire of hi foe the host of morgul intent on their prey taken at unawar in wild career broke scatter like spark in a gale the outcompani with a great cheer turn and smote their pursuer hunter becam the hunt the retreat becam an onslaught the field wa strewn with stricken orc and men and a reek aros of torch cast away sputter out in swirl smoke the cavalri rode on but denethor did not permit them to go far though the enemi wa check and for the moment driven back great forc were flow in from the east again the trumpet rang sound the retreat the cavalri of gondor halt behind their screen the outcompani reform now steadili they came march back they reach the gate of the citi and enter step proudli and proudli the peopl of the citi look on them and cri their prais and yet they were troubl in heart for the compani were grievous reduc faramir had lost a third of hi men and where wa he last of all he came hi men pass in the mount knight return and at their rear the banner of dol amroth and the princ and in hi arm befor him on hi hors he bore the bodi of hi kinsman faramir son of denethor found upon the stricken field faramir faramir men cri weep in the street but he did not answer and they bore him away up the wind road to the citadel and hi father even as the nazgûl had swerv asid from the onset of the white rider there came fli a deadli dart and faramir as he held at bay a mount champion of harad had fallen to the earth onli the charg of dol amroth had save him from the red southland sword that would have hew him as he lay the princ imrahil brought faramir to the white tower and he said your son ha return lord after great deed and he told all that he had seen but denethor rose and look on the face of hi son and wa silent then he bade them make a bed in the chamber and lay faramir upon it and depart but he himself went up alon into the secret room under the summit of the tower and mani who look up thither at that time saw a pale light that gleam and flicker from the narrow window for a while and then flash and went out and when denethor descend again he went to faramir and sat besid him without speak but the face of the lord wa grey more deathlik than hi son so now at last the citi wa besieg enclos in a ring of foe the ramma wa broken and all the pelennor abandon to the enemi the last word to come from outsid the wall wa brought by men fli down the northward road ere the gate wa shut they were the remnant of the guard that wa kept at that point where the way from anórien and rohan ran into the townland ingold led them the same who had admit gandalf and pippin less than five day befor while the sun still rose and there wa hope in the morn there is no news of the rohirrim he said rohan will not come now or if they come it will not avail us the new host that we had tide of ha come first from over the river by way of andro it is said they are strong battalion of orc of the eye and countless compani of men of a new sort that we have not met befor not tall but broad and grim beard like dwarv wield great axe out of some savag land in the wide east they come we deem they hold the northward road and mani have pass on into anórien the rohirrim can not come the gate wa shut all night watchmen on the wall heard the rumour of the enemi that roam outsid burn field and tree and hew ani man that they found abroad live or dead the number that had alreadi pass over the river could not be guess in the dark but when morn or it dim shadow stole over the plain it wa seen that even fear by night had scarc overcount them the plain wa dark with their march compani and as far as eye could strain in the mirk there sprout like a foul fungusgrowth all about the beleagu citi great camp of tent black or sombr red busi as ant hurri orc were dig dig line of deep trench in a huge ring just out of bowshot from the wall and as the trench were made each wa fill with fire though how it wa kindl or fed by art or devilri none could see all day the labour went forward while the men of mina tirith look on unabl to hinder it and as each length of trench wa complet they could see great wain approach and soon yet more compani of the enemi were swiftli set up each behind the cover of a trench great engin for the cast of missil there were none upon the citi wall larg enough to reach so far or to stay the work at first men laugh and did not greatli fear such devic for the main wall of the citi wa of great height and marvel thick built ere the power and craft of númenor wane in exil and it outward face wa like to the tower of orthanc hard and dark and smooth unconquer by steel or fire unbreak except by some convuls that would rend the veri earth on which it stood nay they said not if the nameless one himself should come not even he could enter here while we yet live but some answer while we yet live how long he ha a weapon that ha brought low mani strong place sinc the world began hunger the road are cut rohan will not come but the engin did not wast shot upon the indomit wall it wa no brigand or orcchieftain that order the assault upon the lord of mordor greatest foe a power and mind of malic guid it as soon as the great catapult were set with mani yell and the creak of rope and winch they began to throw missil marvel high so that they pass right abov the battlement and fell thud within the first circl of the citi and mani of them by some secret art burst into flame as they came toppl down soon there wa great peril of fire behind the wall and all who could be spare were busi quell the flame that sprang up in mani place then among the greater cast there fell anoth hail less ruinou but more horribl all about the street and lane behind the gate it tumbl down small round shot that did not burn but when men ran to learn what it might be they cri aloud or wept for the enemi wa fling into the citi all the head of those who had fallen fight at osgiliath or on the ramma or in the field they were grim to look on for though some were crush and shapeless and some had been cruelli hewn yet mani had featur that could be told and it seem that they had die in pain and all were brand with the foul token of the lidless eye but mar and dishonour as they were it often chanc that thu a man would see again the face of someon that he had known who had walk proudli onc in arm or till the field or ridden in upon a holiday from the green vale in the hill in vain men shook their fist at the pitiless foe that swarm befor the gate curs they heed not nor understood the tongu of western men cri with harsh voic like beast and carrionbird but soon there were few left in mina tirith who had the heart to stand up and defi the host of mordor for yet anoth weapon swifter than hunger the lord of the dark tower had dread and despair the nazgûl came again and as their dark lord now grew and put forth hi strength so their voic which utter onli hi will and hi malic were fill with evil and horror ever they circl abov the citi like vultur that expect their fill of doom men flesh out of sight and shot they flew and yet were ever present and their deadli voic rent the air more unbear they becam not less at each new cri at length even the stoutheart would fling themselv to the ground as the hidden menac pass over them or they would stand let their weapon fall from nerveless hand while into their mind a black came and they thought no more of war but onli of hide and of crawl and of death dure all thi black day faramir lay upon hi bed in the chamber of the white tower wander in a desper fever die someon said and soon die all men were say upon the wall and in the street and by him hi father sat and said noth but watch and gave no longer ani heed to the defenc no hour so dark had pippin known not even in the clutch of the urukhai it wa hi duti to wait upon the lord and wait he did forgotten it seem stand by the door of the unlit chamber master hi own fear as best he could and as he watch it seem to him that denethor grew old befor hi eye as if someth had snap in hi proud will and hi stern mind wa overthrown grief mayb had wrought it and remors he saw tear on that onc tearless face more unbear than wrath do not weep lord he stammer perhap he will get well have you ask gandalf comfort me not with wizard said denethor the fool hope ha fail the enemi ha found it and now hi power wax he see our veri thought and all we do is ruinou i sent my son forth unthank unbless out into needless peril and here he lie with poison in hi vein nay nay whatev may now betid in war my line too is end even the hous of the steward ha fail mean folk shall rule the last remnant of the king of men lurk in the hill until all are hound out men came to the door cri for the lord of the citi nay i will not come down he said i must stay besid my son he might still speak befor the end but that is near follow whom you will even the grey fool though hi hope ha fail here i stay so it wa that gandalf took command of the last defenc of the citi of gondor wherev he came men heart would lift again and the wing shadow pass from memori tirelessli he strode from citadel to gate from north to south about the wall and with him went the princ of dol amroth in hi shine mail for he and hi knight still held themselv like lord in whom the race of númenor ran true men that saw them whisper say belik the old tale speak well there is elvish blood in the vein of that folk for the peopl of nimrodel dwelt in that land onc long ago and then one would sing amid the gloom some stave of the lay of nimrodel or other song of the vale of anduin out of vanish year and yet – when they had gone the shadow close on men again and their heart went cold and the valour of gondor wither into ash and so slowli they pass out of a dim day of fear into the dark of a desper night fire now rage uncheck in the first circl of the citi and the garrison upon the outer wall wa alreadi in mani place cut off from retreat but the faith who remain there at their post were few most had fled beyond the second gate far behind the battl the river had been swiftli bridg and all day more forc and gear of war had pour across now at last in the middl night the assault wa loos the vanguard pass through the trench of fire by mani deviou path that had been left between them on they came reckless of their loss as they approach still bunch and herd within the rang of bowmen on the wall but inde there were too few now left there to do them great damag though the light of the fire show up mani a mark for archer of such skill as gondor onc had boast then perceiv that the valour of the citi wa alreadi beaten down the hidden captain put forth hi strength slowli the great siegetow built in osgiliath roll forward through the dark messeng came again to the chamber in the white tower and pippin let them enter for they were urgent denethor turn hi head slowli from faramir face and look at them silent the first circl of the citi is burn lord they said what are your command you are still the lord and steward not all will follow mithrandir men are fli from the wall and leav them unman whi whi do the fool fli said denethor better to burn sooner than late for burn we must go back to your bonfir and i i will go now to my pyre to my pyre no tomb for denethor and faramir no tomb no long slow sleep of death embalm we will burn like heathen king befor ever a ship sail hither from the west the west ha fail go back and burn the messeng without bow or answer turn and fled now denethor stood up and releas the fever hand of faramir that he had held he is burn alreadi burn he said sadli the hous of hi spirit crumbl then step softli toward pippin he look down at him farewel he said farewel peregrin son of paladin your servic ha been short and now it is draw to an end i releas you from the littl that remain go now and die in what way seem best to you and with whom you will even that friend whose folli brought you to thi death send for my servant and then go farewel i will not say farewel my lord said pippin kneel and then suddenli hobbitlik onc more he stood up and look the old man in the eye i will take your leav sir he said for i want to see gandalf veri much inde but he is no fool and i will not think of die until he despair of life but from my word and your servic i do not wish to be releas while you live and if they come at last to the citadel i hope to be here and stand besid you and earn perhap the arm that you have given me do as you will master halfl said denethor but my life is broken send for my servant he turn back to faramir pippin left him and call for the servant and they came six men of the household strong and fair yet they trembl at the summon but in a quiet voic denethor bade them lay warm coverlet on faramir bed and take it up and they did so and lift up the bed they bore it from the chamber slowli they pace to troubl the fever man as littl as might be and denethor now bend on a staff follow them and last came pippin out from the white tower they walk as if to a funer out into the dark where the overhang cloud wa lit beneath with flicker of dull red softli they pace the great courtyard and at a word from denethor halt besid the wither tree all wa silent save for the rumour of war in the citi down below and they heard the water drip sadli from the dead branch into the dark pool then they went on through the citadel gate where the sentinel stare at them in wonder and dismay as they pass by turn westward they came at length to a door in the rearward wall of the sixth circl fen hollen it wa call for it wa kept ever shut save at time of funer and onli the lord of the citi might use that way or those who bore the token of the tomb and tend the hous of the dead beyond it went a wind road that descend in mani curv down to the narrow land under the shadow of mindolluin precipic where stood the mansion of the dead king and of their steward a porter sat in a littl hous besid the way and with fear in hi eye he came forth bear a lantern in hi hand at the lord command he unlock the door and silent it swung back and they pass through take the lantern from hi hand it wa dark on the climb road between ancient wall and manypillar balust loom in the sway lanternbeam their slow feet echo as they walk down down until at last they came to the silent street rath dínen between pale dome and empti hall and imag of men long dead and they enter into the hous of the steward and set down their burden there pippin stare uneasili about him saw that he wa in a wide vault chamber drape as it were with the great shadow that the littl lantern threw upon it shroud wall and dimli to be seen were mani row of tabl carv of marbl and upon each tabl lay a sleep form hand fold head pillow upon stone but one tabl near at hand stood broad and bare upon it at a sign from denethor they laid faramir and hi father side by side and cover them with one cover and stood then with bow head as mourner besid a bed of death then denethor spoke in a low voic here we will wait he said but send not for the embalm bring us wood quick to burn and lay it all about us and beneath and pour oil upon it and when i bid you thrust in a torch do thi and speak no more to me farewel by your leav lord said pippin and turn and fled in terror from the deathli hous poor faramir he thought i must find gandalf poor faramir quit like he need medicin more than tear oh where can i find gandalf in the thick of thing i suppos and he will have no time to spare for die men or madmen at the door he turn to one of the servant who had remain on guard there your master is not himself he said go slow bring no fire to thi place while faramir live do noth until gandalf come who is the master of mina tirith the man answer the lord denethor or the grey wander the grey wander or no one it would seem said pippin and he sped back and up the wind way as swiftli as hi feet would carri him past the astonish porter out through the door and on till he came near the gate of the citadel the sentinel hail him as he went by and he recogn the voic of beregond whither do you run master peregrin he cri to find mithrandir pippin answer the lord errand are urgent and should not be hinder by me said beregond but tell me quickli if you may what goe forward whither ha my lord gone i have just come on duti but i heard that he pass toward the close door and men were bear faramir befor him ye said pippin to the silent street beregond bow hi head to hide hi tear they said that he wa die he sigh and now he is dead no said pippin not yet and even now hi death might be prevent i think but the lord of the citi beregond ha fallen befor hi citi is taken he is fey and danger quickli he told of denethor strang word and deed i must find gandalf at onc then you must go down to the battl i know the lord ha given me leav but beregond if you can do someth to stop ani dread thing happen the lord doe not permit those who wear the black and silver to leav their post for ani caus save at hi own command well you must choos between order and the life of faramir said pippin and as for order i think you have a madman to deal with not a lord i must run i will return if i can he ran on down down toward the outer citi men fli back from the burn pass him and some see hi liveri turn and shout but he paid no heed at last he wa through the second gate beyond which great fire leap up between the wall yet it seem strang silent no nois or shout of battl or din of arm could be heard then suddenli there wa a dread cri and a great shock and a deep echo boom forc himself on against a gust of fear and horror that shook him almost to hi knee pippin turn a corner open on the wide place behind the citi gate he stop dead he had found gandalf but he shrank back cower into a shadow ever sinc the middl night the great assault had gone on the drum roll to the north and to the south compani upon compani of the enemi press to the wall there came great beast like move hous in the red and fit light the mûmakil of the harad drag through the lane amid the fire huge tower and engin yet their captain care not greatli what they did or how mani might be slain their purpos wa onli to test the strength of the defenc and to keep the men of gondor busi in mani place it wa against the gate that he would throw hi heaviest weight veri strong it might be wrought of steel and iron and guard with tower and bastion of indomit stone yet it wa the key the weakest point in all that high and impenetr wall the drum roll louder fire leap up great engin crawl across the field and in the midst wa a huge ram great as a foresttre a hundr feet in length swing on mighti chain long had it been forg in the dark smithi of mordor and it hideou head found of black steel wa shape in the like of a raven wolf on it spell of ruin lay grond they name it in memori of the hammer of the underworld of old great beast drew it orc surround it and behind walk mountaintrol to wield it but about the gate resist still wa stout and there the knight of dol amroth and the hardiest of the garrison stood at bay shot and dart fell thick siegetow crash or blaze suddenli like torch all befor the wall on either side of the gate the ground wa choke with wreck and with bodi of the slain yet still driven as by a mad more and more came up grond crawl on upon it hous no fire would catch and though now and again some great beast that haul it would go mad and spread stamp ruin among the orc innumer that guard it their bodi were cast asid from it path and other took their place grond crawl on the drum roll wildli over the hill of slain a hideou shape appear a horseman tall hood cloak in black slowli trampl the fallen he rode forth heed no longer ani dart he halt and held up a long pale sword and as he did so a great fear fell on all defend and foe alik and the hand of men droop to their side and no bow sang for a moment all wa still the drum roll and rattl with a vast rush grond wa hurl forward by huge hand it reach the gate it swung a deep boom rumbl through the citi like thunder run in the cloud but the door of iron and post of steel withstood the stroke then the black captain rose in hi stirrup and cri aloud in a dread voic speak in some forgotten tongu word of power and terror to rend both heart and stone thrice he cri thrice the great ram boom and suddenli upon the last stroke the gate of gondor broke as if stricken by some blast spell it burst asund there wa a flash of sear lightn and the door tumbl in riven fragment to the ground in rode the lord of the nazgûl a great black shape against the fire beyond he loom up grown to a vast menac of despair in rode the lord of the nazgûl under the archway that no enemi ever yet had pass and all fled befor hi face all save one there wait silent and still in the space befor the gate sat gandalf upon shadowfax shadowfax who alon among the free hors of the earth endur the terror unmov steadfast as a graven imag in rath dínen you can not enter here said gandalf and the huge shadow halt go back to the abyss prepar for you go back fall into the nothing that await you and your master go the black rider flung back hi hood and behold he had a kingli crown and yet upon no head visibl wa it set the red fire shone between it and the mantl shoulder vast and dark from a mouth unseen there came a deadli laughter old fool he said old fool thi is my hour do you not know death when you see it die now and curs in vain and with that he lift high hi sword and flame ran down the blade gandalf did not move and in that veri moment away behind in some courtyard of the citi a cock crow shrill and clear he crow reck noth of wizardri or war welcom onli the morn that in the sky far abov the shadow of death wa come with the dawn and as if in answer there came from far away anoth note horn horn horn in dark mindolluin side they dimli echo great horn of the north wildli blow rohan had come at last chapter the ride of the rohirrim it wa dark and merri could see noth as he lay on the ground roll in a blanket yet though the night wa airless and windless all about him hidden tree were sigh softli he lift hi head then he heard it again a sound like faint drum in the wood hill and mountainstep the throb would ceas suddenli and then be taken up again at some other point now nearer now further off he wonder if the watchmen had heard it he could not see them but he knew that all round him were the compani of the rohirrim he could smell the hors in the dark and could hear their shift and their soft stamp on the needlecov ground the host wa bivouack in the pinewood that cluster about eilenach beacon a tall hill stand up from the long ridg of the drúadan forest that lay besid the great road in east anórien tire as he wa merri could not sleep he had ridden now for four day on end and the everdeepen gloom had slowli weigh down hi heart he began to wonder whi he had been so eager to come when he had been given everi excus even hi lord command to stay behind he wonder too if the old king knew that he had been disobey and wa angri perhap not there seem to be some understand between dernhelm and elfhelm the marshal who command the éore in which they were ride he and all hi men ignor merri and pretend not to hear if he spoke he might have been just anoth bag that dernhelm wa carri dernhelm wa no comfort he never spoke to anyon merri felt small unwant and lone now the time wa anxiou and the host wa in peril they were less than a day ride from the outwal of mina tirith that encircl the townland scout had been sent ahead some had not return other hasten back had report that the road wa held in forc against them a host of the enemi wa encamp upon it three mile west of amon dîn and some strength of men wa alreadi thrust along the road and wa no more than three leagu away orc were rove in the hill and wood along the roadsid the king and éomer held council in the watch of the night merri want somebodi to talk to and he thought of pippin but that onli increas hi restless poor pippin shut up in the great citi of stone lone and afraid merri wish he wa a tall rider like éomer and could blow a horn or someth and go gallop to hi rescu he sat up listen to the drum that were beat again now nearer at hand present he heard voic speak low and he saw dim halfshroud lantern pass through the tree men nearbi began to move uncertainli in the dark a tall figur loom up and stumbl over him curs the treeroot he recogn the voic of the marshal elfhelm i am not a treeroot sir he said nor a bag but a bruis hobbit the least you can do in amend is to tell me what is afoot anyth that can keep so in thi devil mirk answer elfhelm but my lord send word that we must set ourselv in readi order may come for a sudden move is the enemi come then ask merri anxious are those their drum i began to think i wa imagin them as no one els seem to take ani notic of them nay nay said elfhelm the enemi is on the road not in the hill you hear the wose the wild men of the wood thu they talk togeth from afar they still haunt drúadan forest it is said remnant of an older time they be live few and secretli wild and wari as the beast they go not to war with gondor or the mark but now they are troubl by the dark and the come of the orc they fear lest the dark year be return as seem like enough let us be thank that they are not hunt us for they use poison arrow it is said and they are woodcrafti beyond compar but they have offer their servic to théoden even now one of their headmen is be taken to the king yonder go the light so much i have heard but no more and now i must busi myself with my lord command pack yourself up master bag he vanish into the shadow merri did not like thi talk of wild men and poison dart but quit apart from that a great weight of dread wa on him wait wa unbear he long to know what wa go to happen he got up and soon wa walk warili in pursuit of the last lantern befor it disappear among the tree present he came to an open space where a small tent had been set up for the king under a great tree a larg lantern cover abov wa hang from a bough and cast a pale circl of light below there sat théoden and éomer and befor them on the ground sat a strang squat shape of a man gnarl as an old stone and the hair of hi scanti beard straggl on hi lumpi chin like dri moss he wa shortleg and fatarm thick and stumpi and clad onli with grass about hi waist merri felt that he had seen him befor somewher and suddenli he rememb the púkelmen of dunharrow here wa one of those old imag brought to life or mayb a creatur descend in true line through endless year from the model use by the forgotten craftsmen long ago there wa a silenc as merri crept nearer and then the wild man began to speak in answer to some question it seem hi voic wa deep and guttur yet to merri surpris he spoke the common speech though in a halt fashion and uncouth word were mingl with it no father of horsemen he said we fight not hunt onli kill gorgûn in wood hate orcfolk you hate gorgûn too we help as we can wild men have long ear and long eye know all path wild men live here befor stonehous befor tall men come up out of water but our need is for aid in battl said éomer how will you and your folk help us bring news said the wild man we look out from hill we climb big mountain and look down stonec is shut fire burn there outsid now insid too you wish to come there then you must be quick but gorgûn and men out of faraway he wave a short gnarl arm eastward sit on horseroad veri mani more than horsemen how do you know that said éomer the old man flat face and dark eye show noth but hi voic wa sullen with displeasur wild men are wild free but not children he answer i am great headman ghânburighân i count mani thing star in sky leav on tree men in the dark you have a score of score count ten time and five they have more big fight and who will win and mani more walk round wall of stonehous ala he speak all too shrewdli said théoden and our scout say that they have cast trench and stake across the road we can not sweep them away in sudden onset and yet we need great hast said éomer mundburg is on fire let ghânburighân finish said the wild man more than one road he know he will lead you by road where no pit are no gorgûn walk onli wild men and beast mani path were made when stonehousefolk were stronger they carv hill as hunter carv beastflesh wild men think they ate stone for food they went through drúadan to rimmon with great wain they go no longer road is forgotten but not by wild men over hill and behind hill it lie still under grass and tree there behind rimmon and down to dîn and back at the end to horsemen road wild men will show you that road then you will kill gorgûn and drive away bad dark with bright iron and wild men can go back to sleep in the wild wood éomer and the king spoke togeth in their own tongu at length théoden turn to the wild man we will receiv your offer he said for though we leav a host of foe behind what matter if the stonec fall then we shall have no return if it is save then the orchost itself will be cut off if you are faith ghânburighân then we will give you rich reward and you shall have the friendship of the mark for ever dead men are not friend to live men and give them no gift said the wild man but if you live after the dark then leav wild men alon in the wood and do not hunt them like beast ani more ghânburighân will not lead you into trap he will go himself with father of horsemen and if he lead you wrong you will kill him so be it said théoden how long will it take to pass by the enemi and come back to the road ask éomer we must go at footpac if you guid us and i doubt not the way is narrow wild men go quick on feet said ghân way is wide for four hors in stonewain valley yonder he wave hi hand southward but narrow at begin and at end wild man could walk from here to dîn between sunris and noon then we must allow at least seven hour for the leader said éomer but we must reckon rather on some ten hour for all thing unforeseen may hinder us and if our host is all strung out it will be long ere it can be set in order when we issu from the hill what is the hour now who know said théoden all is night now it is all dark but it is not all night said ghân when sun come we feel her even when she is hidden alreadi she climb over eastmountain it is the open of day in the skyfield then we must set out as soon as may be said éomer even so we can not hope to come to gondor aid today merri wait to hear no more but slip away to get readi for the summon to the march thi wa the last stage befor the battl it did not seem like to him that mani of them would surviv it but he thought of pippin and the flame in mina tirith and thrust down hi own dread all went well that day and no sight or sound had they of the enemi wait to waylay them the wild men had put out a screen of wari hunter so that no orc or rove spi should learn of the movement in the hill the light wa more dim than ever as they drew nearer to the beleagu citi and the rider pass in long file like dark shadow of men and hors each compani wa guid by a wild woodman but old ghân walk besid the king the start had been slower than wa hope for it had taken time for the rider walk and lead their hors to find path over the thickli wood ridg behind their camp and down into the hidden stonewain valley it wa late in the afternoon when the leader came to wide grey thicket stretch beyond the eastward side of amon dîn and mask a great gap in the line of hill that from nardol to dîn ran east and west through the gap the forgotten wainroad long ago had run down back into the main horseway from the citi through anórien but now for mani live of men tree had had their way with it and it had vanish broken and buri under the leav of uncount year but the thicket offer to the rider their last hope of cover befor they went into open battl for beyond them lay the road and the plain of anduin while east and southward the slope were bare and rocki as the writhen hill gather themselv togeth and climb up bastion upon bastion into the great mass and shoulder of mindolluin the lead compani wa halt and as those behind file up out of the trough of the stonewain valley they spread out and pass to campingplac under the grey tree the king summon the captain to council éomer sent out scout to spi upon the road but old ghân shook hi head no good to send horsemen he said wild men have alreadi seen all that can be seen in the bad air they will come soon and speak to me here the captain came and then out of the tree crept warili other púkelshap so like old ghân that merri could hardli tell them apart they spoke to ghân in a strang throati languag present ghân turn to the king wild men say mani thing he said first be wari still mani men in camp beyond dîn an hour walk yonder he wave hi arm west toward the black beacon but none to see between here and stonefolk new wall mani busi there wall stand up no longer gorgûn knock them down with earththund and with club of black iron they are unwari and do not look about them they think their friend watch all road at that old ghân made a curiou gurgl nois and it seem that he wa laugh good tide cri éomer even in thi gloom hope gleam again our enemi devic oft serv us in hi despit the accurs dark itself ha been a cloak to us and now lust to destroy gondor and throw it down stone from stone hi orc have taken away my greatest fear the outwal could have been held long against us now we can sweep through – if onc we win so far onc again i thank you ghânburighân of the wood said théoden good fortun go with you for tide and for guidanc kill gorgûn kill orcfolk no other word pleas wild men answer ghân drive away bad air and dark with bright iron to do these thing we have ridden far said the king and we shall attempt them but what we shall achiev onli tomorrow will show ghânburighân squat down and touch the earth with hi horni brow in token of farewel then he got up as if to depart but suddenli he stood look up like some startl woodland anim snuffl a strang air a light came in hi eye wind is chang he cri and with that in a twinkl as it seem he and hi fellow had vanish into the gloom never to be seen by ani rider of rohan again not long after far away eastward the faint drum throb again yet to no heart in all the host came ani fear that the wild men were unfaith strang and unlov though they might appear we need no further guidanc said elfhelm for there are rider in the host who have ridden down to mundburg in day of peac i for one when we come to the road it will veer south and there will lie befor us still seven leagu ere we reach the wall of the townland along most of that way there is much grass on either side of the road on that stretch the errandrid of gondor reckon to make their greatest speed we may ride it swiftli and without great rumour then sinc we must look for fell deed and the need of all our strength said éomer i counsel that we rest now and set out henc by night and so time our go that we come upon the field when tomorrow is as light as it will be or when our lord give the signal to thi the king assent and the captain depart but soon elfhelm return the scout have found naught to report beyond the grey wood lord he said save two men onli two dead men and two dead hors well said éomer what of it thi lord they were errandrid of gondor hirgon wa one mayb at least hi hand still clasp the red arrow but hi head wa hewn off and thi also it would seem by the sign that they were flee westward when they fell as i read it they found the enemi alreadi on the outwal or assail it when they return – and that would be two night ago if they use fresh hors from the post as is their wont they could not reach the citi and turn back ala said théoden then denethor ha heard no news of our ride and will despair of our come need brook no delay yet late is better than never said éomer and mayhap in thi time shall the old saw be prove truer than ever befor sinc men spoke with mouth it wa night on either side of the road the host of rohan wa move silent now the road pass about the skirt of mindolluin turn southward far away and almost straight ahead there wa a red glow under the black sky and the side of the great mountain loom dark against it they were draw near the ramma of the pelennor but the day wa not yet come the king rode in the midst of the lead compani hi householdmen about him elfhelm éore came next and now merri notic that dernhelm had left hi place and in the dark wa move steadili forward until at last he wa ride just in rear of the king guard there came a check merri heard voic in front speak softli outrid had come back who had ventur forward almost to the wall they came to the king there are great fire lord said one the citi is all set about with flame and the field is full of foe but all seem drawn off to the assault as well as we could guess there are few left upon the outwal and they are heedless busi in destruct do you rememb the wild man word lord said anoth i live upon the open wold in day of peac wídfara is my name and to me also the air bring messag alreadi the wind is turn there come a breath out of the south there is a seatang in it faint though it be the morn will bring new thing abov the reek it will be dawn when you pass the wall if you speak truli wídfara then may you live beyond thi day in year of blessed said théoden he turn to the men of hi household who were near and he spoke now in a clear voic so that mani also of the rider of the first éore heard him now is the hour come rider of the mark son of eorl foe and fire are befor you and your home far behind yet though you fight upon an alien field the glori that you reap there shall be your own for ever oath ye have taken now fulfil them all to lord and land and leagu of friendship men clash spear upon shield éomer my son you lead the first éore said théoden and it shall go behind the king banner in the centr elfhelm lead your compani to the right when we pass the wall and grimbold shall lead hi toward the left let the other compani behind follow these three that lead as they have chanc strike wherev the enemi gather other plan we can not make for we know not yet how thing stand upon the field forth now and fear no dark the lead compani rode off as swiftli as they could for it wa still deep dark whatev chang wídfara might forebod merri wa ride behind dernhelm clutch with the left hand while with the other he tri to loosen hi sword in it sheath he felt now bitterli the truth of the old king word in such a battl what would you do meriadoc just thi he thought encumb a rider and hope at best to stay in my seat and not be pound to death by gallop hoof it wa no more than a leagu to where the outwal had stood they soon reach them too soon for merri wild cri broke out and there wa some clash of arm but it wa brief the orc busi about the wall were few and amaz and they were quickli slain or driven off befor the ruin of the northgat in the ramma the king halt again the first éore drew up behind him and about him on either side dernhelm kept close to the king though elfhelm compani wa away on the right grimbold men turn asid and pass round to a great gap in the wall further eastward merri peer from behind dernhelm back far away mayb ten mile or more there wa a great burn but between it and the rider line of fire blaze in a vast crescent at the nearest point less than a leagu distant he could make out littl more on the dark plain and as yet he neither saw ani hope of morn nor felt ani wind chang or unchang now silent the host of rohan move forward into the field of gondor pour in slowli but steadili like the rise tide through breach in a dike that men have thought secur but the mind and will of the black captain were bent wholli on the fall citi and as yet no tide came to him warn that hi design held ani flaw after a while the king led hi men away somewhat eastward to come between the fire of the sieg and the outer field still they were unchalleng and still théoden gave no signal at last he halt onc again the citi wa now nearer a smell of burn wa in the air and a veri shadow of death the hors were uneasi but the king sat upon snowman motionless gaze upon the agoni of mina tirith as if stricken suddenli by anguish or by dread he seem to shrink down cow by age merri himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settl on him hi heart beat slowli time seem pois in uncertainti they were too late too late wa wors than never perhap théoden would quail bow hi old head turn slink away to hide in the hill then suddenli merri felt it at last beyond doubt a chang wind wa in hi face light wa glimmer far far away in the south the cloud could be dimli seen as remot grey shape roll up drift morn lay beyond them but at that same moment there wa a flash as if lightn had sprung from the earth beneath the citi for a sear second it stood dazzl far off in black and white it topmost tower like a glitter needl and then as the dark close again there came roll over the field a great boom at that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenli erect tall and proud he seem again and rise in hi stirrup he cri in a loud voic more clear than ani there had ever heard a mortal man achiev befor aris aris rider of théoden fell deed awak fire and slaughter spear shall be shaken shield be splinter a swordday a red day ere the sun rise ride now ride now ride to gondor with that he seiz a great horn from guthláf hi bannerbear and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asund and straightway all the horn in the host were lift up in music and the blow of the horn of rohan in that hour wa like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountain ride now ride now ride to gondor suddenli the king cri to snowman and the hors sprang away behind him hi banner blew in the wind white hors upon a field of green but he outpac it after him thunder the knight of hi hous but he wa ever befor them éomer rode there the white horsetail on hi helm float in hi speed and the front of the first éore roar like a breaker foam to the shore but théoden could not be overtaken fey he seem or the battlefuri of hi father ran like new tire in hi vein and he wa born up on snowman like a god of old even as oromë the great in the battl of the valar when the world wa young hi golden shield wa uncov and lo it shone like an imag of the sun and the grass flame into green about the white feet of hi steed for morn came morn and a wind from the sea and the dark wa remov and the host of mordor wail and terror took them and they fled and die and the hoof of wrath rode over them and then all the host of rohan burst into song and they sang as they slew for the joy of battl wa on them and the sound of their sing that wa fair and terribl came even to the citi chapter the battl of the pelennor field but it wa no orcchieftain or brigand that led the assault upon gondor the dark wa break too soon befor the date that hi master had set for it fortun had betray him for the moment and the world had turn against him victori wa slip from hi grasp even as he stretch out hi hand to seiz it but hi arm wa long he wa still in command wield great power king ringwraith lord of the nazgûl he had mani weapon he left the gate and vanish théoden king of the mark had reach the road from the gate to the river and he turn toward the citi that wa now less than a mile distant he slacken hi speed a littl seek new foe and hi knight came about him and dernhelm wa with them ahead nearer the wall elfhelm men were among the siegeengin hew slay drive their foe into the firepit well nigh all the northern half of the pelennor wa overrun and there camp were blaze orc were fli toward the river like herd befor the hunter and the rohirrim went hither and thither at their will but they had not yet overthrown the sieg nor won the gate mani foe stood befor it and on the further half of the plain were other host still unfought southward beyond the road lay the main forc of the haradrim and there their horsemen were gather about the standard of their chieftain and he look out and in the grow light he saw the banner of the king and that it wa far ahead of the battl with few men about it then he wa fill with a red wrath and shout aloud and display hi standard black serpent upon scarlet he came against the white hors and the green with great press of men and the draw of the scimitar of the southron wa like a glitter of star then théoden wa awar of him and would not wait for hi onset but cri to snowman he charg headlong to greet him great wa the clash of their meet but the white furi of the northmen burn the hotter and more skill wa their knighthood with long spear and bitter fewer were they but they clove through the southron like a firebolt in a forest right through the press drove théoden thengel son and hi spear wa shiver as he threw down their chieftain out swept hi sword and he spur to the standard hew staff and bearer and the black serpent founder then all that wa left unslain of their cavalri turn and fled far away but lo suddenli in the midst of the glori of the king hi golden shield wa dim the new morn wa blot from the sky dark fell about him hors rear and scream men cast from the saddl lay grovel on the ground to me to me cri théoden up eorlinga fear no dark but snowman wild with terror stood up on high fight with the air and then with a great scream he crash upon hi side a black dart had pierc him the king fell beneath him the great shadow descend like a fall cloud and behold it wa a wing creatur if bird then greater than all other bird and it wa nake and neither quill nor feather did it bear and it vast pinion were as web of hide between horn finger and it stank a creatur of an older world mayb it wa whose kind finger in forgotten mountain cold beneath the moon outstay their day and in hideou eyri bred thi last untim brood apt to evil and the dark lord took it and nurs it with fell meat until it grew beyond the measur of all other thing that fli and he gave it to hi servant to be hi steed down down it came and then fold it finger web it gave a croak cri and settl upon the bodi of snowman dig in it claw stoop it long nake neck upon it sat a shape blackmantl huge and threaten a crown of steel he bore but between rim and robe naught wa there to see save onli a deadli gleam of eye the lord of the nazgûl to the air he had return summon hi steed ere the dark fail and now he wa come again bring ruin turn hope to despair and victori to death a great black mace he wield but théoden wa not utterli forsaken the knight of hi hous lay slain about him or els master by the mad of their steed were born far away yet one stood there still dernhelm the young faith beyond fear and he wept for he had love hi lord as a father right through the charg merri had been born unharm behind him until the shadow came and then windfola had thrown them in hi terror and now ran wild upon the plain merri crawl on all four like a daze beast and such a horror wa on him that he wa blind and sick king man king man hi heart cri within him you must stay by him as a father you shall be to me you said but hi will made no answer and hi bodi shook he dare not open hi eye or look up then out of the black in hi mind he thought that he heard dernhelm speak yet now the voic seem strang recal some other voic that he had known begon foul dwimmerlaik lord of carrion leav the dead in peac a cold voic answer come not between the nazgûl and hi prey or he will not slay thee in thi turn he will bear thee away to the hous of lament beyond all dark where thi flesh shall be devour and thi shrivel mind be left nake to the lidless eye a sword rang as it wa drawn do what you will but i will hinder it if i may hinder me thou fool no live man may hinder me then merri heard of all sound in that hour the strangest it seem that dernhelm laugh and the clear voic wa like the ring of steel but no live man am i you look upon a woman éowyn i am éomund daughter you stand between me and my lord and kin begon if you be not deathless for live or dark undead i will smite you if you touch him the wing creatur scream at her but the ringwraith made no answer and wa silent as if in sudden doubt veri amaz for a moment conquer merri fear he open hi eye and the black wa lift from them there some pace from him sat the great beast and all seem dark about it and abov it loom the nazgûl lord like a shadow of despair a littl to the left face them stood she whom he had call dernhelm but the helm of her secreci had fallen from her and her bright hair releas from it bond gleam with pale gold upon her shoulder her eye grey as the sea were hard and fell and yet tear were on her cheek a sword wa in her hand and she rais her shield against the horror of her enemi eye éowyn it wa and dernhelm also for into merri mind flash the memori of the face that he saw at the ride from dunharrow the face of one that goe seek death have no hope piti fill hi heart and great wonder and suddenli the slowkindl courag of hi race awok he clench hi hand she should not die so fair so desper at least she should not die alon unaid the face of their enemi wa not turn toward him but still he hardli dare to move dread lest the deadli eye should fall on him slowli slowli he began to crawl asid but the black captain in doubt and malic intent upon the woman befor him heed him no more than a worm in the mud suddenli the great beast beat it hideou wing and the wind of them wa foul again it leap into the air and then swiftli fell down upon éowyn shriek strike with beak and claw still she did not blench maiden of the rohirrim child of king slender but as a steelblad fair but terribl a swift stroke she dealt skill and deadli the outstretch neck she clove asund and the hewn head fell like a stone backward she sprang as the huge shape crash to ruin vast wing outspread crumpl on the earth and with it fall the shadow pass away a light fell about her and her hair shone in the sunris out of the wreck rose the black rider tall and threaten tower abov her with a cri of hatr that stung the veri ear like venom he let fall hi mace her shield wa shiver in mani piec and her arm wa broken she stumbl to her knee he bent over her like a cloud and hi eye glitter he rais hi mace to kill but suddenli he too stumbl forward with a cri of bitter pain and hi stroke went wide drive into the ground merri sword had stab him from behind shear through the black mantl and pass up beneath the hauberk had pierc the sinew behind hi mighti knee éowyn éowyn cri merri then totter struggl up with her last strength she drove her sword between crown and mantl as the great shoulder bow befor her the sword broke sparkl into mani shard the crown roll away with a clang éowyn fell forward upon her fallen foe but lo the mantl and hauberk were empti shapeless they lay now on the ground torn and tumbl and a cri went up into the shudder air and fade to a shrill wail pass with the wind a voic bodiless and thin that die and wa swallow up and wa never heard again in that age of thi world and there stood meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of the slain blink like an owl in the daylight for tear blind him and through a mist he look on éowyn fair head as she lay and did not move and he look on the face of the king fallen in the midst of hi glori for snowman in hi agoni had roll away from him again yet he wa the bane of hi master then merri stoop and lift hi hand to kiss it and lo théoden open hi eye and they were clear and he spoke in a quiet voic though labour farewel master holbytla he said my bodi is broken i go to my father and even in their mighti compani i shall not now be asham i fell the black serpent a grim morn and a glad day and a golden sunset merri could not speak but wept anew forgiv me lord he said at last if i broke your command and yet have done no more in your servic than to weep at our part the old king smile griev not it is forgiven great heart will not be deni live now in blessed and when you sit in peac with your pipe think of me for never now shall i sit with you in meduseld as i promis or listen to your herblor he close hi eye and merri bow besid him present he spoke again where is éomer for my eye darken and i would see him ere i go he must be king after me and i would send word to éowyn she she would not have me leav her and now i shall not see her again dearer than daughter lord lord began merri brokenli she is but at that moment there wa a great clamour and all about them horn and trumpet were blow merri look round he had forgotten the war and all the world besid and mani hour it seem sinc the king rode to hi fall though in truth it wa onli a littl while but now he saw that they were in danger of be caught in the veri midst of the great battl that would soon be join new forc of the enemi were hasten up the road from the river and from under the wall came the legion of morgul and from the southward field came footmen of harad with horsemen befor them and behind them rose the huge back of the mûmakil with wartow upon them but northward the white crest of éomer led the great front of the rohirrim which he had again gather and marshal and out of the citi came all the strength of men that wa in it and the silver swan of dol amroth wa born in the van drive the enemi from the gate for a moment the thought flit through merri mind where is gandalf is he not here could he not have save the king and éowyn but thereupon éomer rode up in hast and with him came the knight of the household that still live and had now master their hors they look in wonder at the carcas of the fell beast that lay there and their steed would not go near but éomer leap from the saddl and grief and dismay fell upon him as he came to the king side and stood there in silenc then one of the knight took the king banner from the hand of guthláf the bannerbear who lay dead and he lift it up slowli théoden open hi eye see the banner he made a sign that it should be given to éomer hail king of the mark he said ride now to victori bid éowyn farewel and so he die and knew not that éowyn lay near him and those who stood by wept cri théoden king théoden king but éomer said to them mourn not overmuch mighti wa the fallen meet wa hi end when hi mound is rais women then shall weep war now call us yet he himself wept as he spoke let hi knight remain here he said and bear hi bodi in honour from the field lest the battl ride over it yea and all these other of the king men that lie here and he look at the slain recal their name then suddenli he beheld hi sister éowyn as she lay and he knew her he stood a moment as a man who is pierc in the midst of a cri by an arrow through the heart and then hi face went deathli white and a cold furi rose in him so that all speech fail him for a while a fey mood took him éowyn éowyn he cri at last éowyn how come you here what mad or devilri is thi death death death death take us all then without take counsel or wait for the approach of the men of the citi he spur headlong back to the front of the great host and blew a horn and cri aloud for the onset over the field rang hi clear voic call death ride ride to ruin and the world end and with that the host began to move but the rohirrim sang no more death they cri with one voic loud and terribl and gather speed like a great tide their battl swept about their fallen king and pass roar away southward and still meriadoc the hobbit stood there blink through hi tear and no one spoke to him inde none seem to heed him he brush away the tear and stoop to pick up the green shield that éowyn had given him and he slung it at hi back then he look for hi sword that he had let fall for even as he struck hi blow hi arm wa numb and now he could onli use hi left hand and behold there lay hi weapon but the blade wa smoke like a dri branch that ha been thrust in a fire and as he watch it it writh and wither and wa consum so pass the sword of the barrowdown work of westerness but glad would he have been to know it fate who wrought it slowli long ago in the northkingdom when the dúnedain were young and chief among their foe wa the dread realm of angmar and it sorcer king no other blade not though mightier hand had wield it would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter cleav the undead flesh break the spell that knit hi unseen sinew to hi will men now rais the king and lay cloak upon speartruncheon they made shift to bear him away toward the citi and other lift éowyn gentli up and bore her after him but the men of the king household they could not yet bring from the field for seven of the king knight had fallen there and déorwin their chief wa among them so they laid them apart from their foe and the fell beast and set spear about them and afterward when all wa over men return and made a fire there and burn the carcas of the beast but for snowman they dug a grave and set up a stone upon which wa carv in the tongu of gondor and the mark faith servant yet master bane lightfoot foal swift snowman green and long grew the grass on snowman howe but ever black and bare wa the ground where the beast wa burn now slowli and sadli merri walk besid the bearer and he gave no more heed to the battl he wa weari and full of pain and hi limb trembl as with a chill a great rain came out of the sea and it seem that all thing wept for théoden and éowyn quench the fire in the citi with grey tear it wa through a mist that present he saw the van of the men of gondor approach imrahil princ of dol amroth rode up and drew rein befor them what burden do you bear men of rohan he cri théoden king they answer he is dead but éomer king now ride in the battl he with the white crest in the wind then the princ went from hi hors and knelt by the bier in honour of the king and hi great onset and he wept and rise he look then on éowyn and wa amaz sure here is a woman he said have even the women of the rohirrim come to war in our need nay one onli they answer the ladi éowyn is she sister of éomer and we knew naught of her ride until thi hour and greatli we rue it then the princ see her beauti though her face wa pale and cold touch her hand as he bent to look more close on her men of rohan he cri are there no leech among you she is hurt to the death mayb but i deem that she yet live and he held the brightburnish vambrac that wa upon hi arm befor her cold tip and behold a littl mist wa laid on it hardli to be seen hast now is need he said and he sent one ride back swiftli to the citi to bring aid but he bow low to the fallen bade them farewel and mount rode away into battl and now the fight wax furiou on the field of the pelennor and the din of arm rose upon high with the cri of men and the neigh of hors horn were blown and trumpet were bray and the mûmakil were bellow as they were goad to war under the south wall of the citi the footmen of gondor now drove against the legion of morgul that were still gather there in strength but the horsemen rode eastward to the succour of éomer húrin the tall warden of the key and the lord of lossarnach and hirluin of the green hill and princ imrahil the fair with hi knight all about him not too soon came their aid to the rohirrim for fortun had turn against éomer and hi furi had betray him the great wrath of hi onset had utterli overthrown the front of hi enemi and great wedg of hi rider had pass clear through the rank of the southron discomfit their horsemen and ride their footmen to ruin but wherev the mûmakil came there the hors would not go but blench and swerv away and the great monster were unfought and stood like tower of defenc and the haradrim ralli about them and if the rohirrim at their onset were thrice outnumb by the haradrim alon soon their case becam wors for new strength came now stream to the field out of osgiliath there they had been muster for the sack of the citi and the rape of gondor wait on the call of their captain he now wa destroy but gothmog the lieuten of morgul had flung them into the fray easterl with axe and variag of khand southron in scarlet and out of far harad black men like halftrol with white eye and red tongu some now hasten up behind the rohirrim other held westward to hold off the forc of gondor and prevent their join with rohan it wa even as the day thu began to turn against gondor and their hope waver that a new cri went up in the citi it be then midmorn and a great wind blow and the rain fli north and the sun shine in that clear air watchmen on the wall saw afar a new sight of fear and their last hope left them for anduin from the bend at the harlond so flow that from the citi men could look down it lengthwis for some leagu and the farsight could see ani ship that approach and look thither they cri in dismay for black against the glitter stream they beheld a fleet born up on the wind dromund and ship of great draught with mani oar and with black sail belli in the breez the corsair of umbar men shout the corsair of umbar look the corsair of umbar are come so belfala is taken and the ethir and lebennin is gone the corsair are upon us it is the last stroke of doom and some without order for none could he found to command them in the citi ran to the bell and toll the alarm and some blew the trumpet sound the retreat back to the wall they cri back to the wall come back to the citi befor all are overwhelm but the wind that sped the ship blew all their clamour away the rohirrim inde had no need of news or alarm all too well they could see for themselv the black sail for éomer wa now scarc a mile from the harlond and a great press of hi first foe wa between him and the haven there while new foe came swirl behind cut him off from the princ now he look to the river and hope die in hi heart and the wind that he had bless he now call accurs but the host of mordor were enhearten and fill with a new lust and furi they came yell to the onset stern now wa éomer mood and hi mind clear again he let blow the horn to ralli all men to hi banner that could come thither for he thought to make a great shieldwal at the last and stand and fight there on foot till all fell and do deed of song on the field of pelennor though no man should be left in the west to rememb the last king of the mark so he rode to a green hillock and there set hi banner and the white hors ran rippl in the wind out of doubt out of dark to the day rise i came sing in the sun sword unsheath to hope end i rode and to heart break now for wrath now for ruin and a red nightfal these stave he spoke yet he laugh as he said them for onc more lust of battl wa on him and he wa still unscath and he wa young and he wa king the lord of a fell peopl and lo even as he laugh at despair he look out again on the black ship and he lift up hi sword to defi them and then wonder took him and a great joy and he cast hi sword up in the sunlight and sang as he caught it and all eye follow hi gaze and behold upon the foremost ship a great standard broke and the wind display it as she turn toward the harlond there flower a white tree and that wa for gondor but seven star were about it and a high crown abov it the sign of elendil that no lord had born for year beyond count and the star flame in the sunlight for they were wrought of gem by arwen daughter of elrond and the crown wa bright in the morn for it wa wrought of mithril and gold thu came aragorn son of arathorn elessar isildur heir out of the path of the dead born upon a wind from the sea to the kingdom of gondor and the mirth of the rohirrim wa a torrent of laughter and a flash of sword and the joy and wonder of the citi wa a music of trumpet and a ring of bell but the host of mordor were seiz with bewilder and a great wizardri it seem to them that their own ship should be fill with their foe and a black dread fell on them know that the tide of fate had turn against them and their doom wa at hand east rode the knight of dol amroth drive the enemi befor them trollmen and variag and orc that hate the sunlight south strode éomer and men fled befor hi face and they were caught between the hammer and the anvil for now men leap from the ship to the quay of the harlond and swept north like a storm there came legola and gimli wield hi axe and halbarad with the standard and elladan and elrohir with star on their brow and the dourhand dúnedain ranger of the north lead a great valour of the folk of lebennin and lamedon and the fief of the south but befor all went aragorn with the flame of the west andúril like a new fire kindl narsil reforg as deadli as of old and upon hi brow wa the star of elendil and so at length éomer and aragorn met in the midst of the battl and they lean on their sword and look on one anoth and were glad thu we meet again though all the host of mordor lay between us said aragorn did i not say so at the hornburg so you spoke said éomer but hope oft deceiv and i knew not then that you were a man foresight yet twice bless is help unlook for and never wa a meet of friend more joy and they clasp hand in hand nor inde more time said éomer you come none too soon my friend much loss and sorrow ha befallen us then let us aveng it ere we speak of it said aragorn and they rode back to battl togeth hard fight and long labour they had still for the southron were bold men and grim and fierc in despair and the easterl were strong and warharden and ask for no quarter and so in thi place and that by burn homestead or barn upon hillock or mound under wall or on field still they gather and ralli and fought until the day wore away then the sun went at last behind mindolluin and fill all the sky with a great burn so that the hill and the mountain were dy as with blood fire glow in the river and the grass of the pelennor lay red in the nightfal and in that hour the great battl of the field of gondor wa over and not one live foe wa left within the circuit of the ramma all were slain save those who fled to die or to drown in the red foam of the river few ever came eastward to morgul or mordor and to the land of the haradrim came onli a tale from far off a rumour of the wrath and terror of gondor aragorn and éomer and imrahil rode back toward the gate of the citi and they were now weari beyond joy or sorrow these three were unscath for such wa their fortun and the skill and might of their arm and few inde had dare to abid them or look on their face in the hour of their wrath but mani other were hurt or maim or dead upon the field the axe hew forlong as he fought alon and unhors and both duilin of morthond and hi brother were trampl to death when they assail the mûmakil lead their bowmen close to shoot at the eye of the monster neither hirluin the fair would return to pinnath gelin nor grimbold to grimslad nor halbarad to the northland dourhand ranger no few had fallen renown or nameless captain or soldier for it wa a great battl and the full count of it no tale ha told so long afterward a maker in rohan said in hi song of the mound

now they sleep under grass in gondor by the great river grey now as tear gleam silver red then it roll roar water foam dy with blood flame at sunset as beacon mountain burn at even red fell the dew in ramma echor chapter the pyre of denethor when the dark shadow at the gate withdrew gandalf still sat motionless but pippin rose to hi feet as if a great weight had been lift from him and he stood listen to the horn and it seem to him that they would break hi heart with joy and never in after year could he hear a horn blown in the distanc without tear start in hi eye but now suddenli hi errand return to hi memori and he ran forward at that moment gandalf stir and spoke to shadowfax and wa about to ride through the gate gandalf gandalf cri pippin and shadowfax halt what are you do here said

but i have an errand to the lord denethor that will not wait take command in the lord absenc they pass on and as they climb and drew near to the citadel they felt the wind blow in their face and they caught the glimmer of morn far away a light grow in the southern sky but it brought littl hope to them not know what evil lay befor them fear to come too late dark is pass said gandalf but it still lie heavi on thi citi at the gate of the citadel they found no guard then beregond ha gone said pippin more hope they turn away and hasten along the road to the close door it stood wide open and the porter lay befor it he wa slain and hi key had been taken work of the enemi said gandalf such deed he love friend at war with friend loyalti divid in confus of heart now he dismount and bade shadowfax return to hi stabl for my friend he said you and i should have ridden to the field long ago but other matter delay me yet come swiftli if i call they pass the door and walk on down the steep wind road light wa grow and the tall column and carven figur besid the way went slowli by like grey ghost suddenli the silenc wa broken and they heard below them cri and the ring of sword such sound as had not been heard in the hallow place sinc the build of the citi at last they came to rath dínen and hasten toward the hous of the steward loom in the twilight under it great dome stay stay cri gandalf spring forward to the stone stair befor the door stay thi mad for there were the servant of denethor with sword and torch in their hand but alon in the porch upon the topmost step stood beregond clad in the black and silver of the guard and he held the door against them two of them had alreadi fallen to hi sword stain the hallow with their blood and the other curs him call him outlaw and traitor to hi master even as gandalf and pippin ran forward they heard from within the hous of the dead the voic of denethor cri hast hast do as i have bidden slay me thi renegad or must i do so myself thereupon the door which beregond held shut with hi left hand wa wrench open and there behind him stood the lord of the citi tall and fell a light like flame wa in hi eye and he held a drawn sword but gandalf sprang up the step and the men fell back from him and cover their eye for hi come wa like the incom of a white light into a dark place and he came with great anger he lift up hi hand and in the veri stroke the sword of denethor flew up and left hi grasp and fell behind him in the shadow of the hous and denethor step backward befor gandalf as one amaz what is thi my lord said the wizard the hous of the dead are no place for the live and whi do men fight here in the hallow when there is war enough befor the gate or ha our enemi come even to rath dínen sinc when ha the lord of gondor been answer to thee said denethor or may i not command my own servant you may said gandalf but other may contest your will when it is turn to mad and evil where is your son faramir he lie within said denethor burn alreadi burn they have set a fire in hi flesh but soon all shall be burn the west ha fail it shall all go up in a great fire and all shall be end ash ash and smoke blown away on the wind then gandalf see the mad that wa on him fear that he had alreadi done some evil deed and he thrust forward with beregond and pippin behind him while denethor gave back until he stood besid the tabl within but there they found faramir still dream in hi fever lie upon the tabl wood wa pile under it and high all about it and all wa drench with oil even the garment of faramir and the coverlet but as yet no fire had been set to the fuel then gandalf reveal the strength that lay hid in him even as the light of hi power wa hidden under hi grey mantl he leap up on to the faggot and rais the sick man lightli he sprang down again and bore him toward the door but as he did so faramir moan and call on hi father in hi dream denethor start as one wake from a tranc and the flame die in hi eye and he wept and he said do not take my son from me he call for me he call said gandalf but you can not come to him yet for he must seek heal on the threshold of death and mayb find it not wherea your part is to go out to the battl of your citi where mayb death await you thi you know in your heart he will not wake again said denethor battl is vain whi should we wish to live longer whi should we not go to death side by side author is not given to you steward of gondor to order the hour of your death answer gandalf and onli the heathen king under the domin of the dark power did thu slay themselv in pride and despair murder their kin to eas their own death then pass through the door he took faramir from the deadli hous and laid him on the bier on which he had been brought and which had now been set in the porch denethor follow him and stood trembl look with long on the face of hi son and for a moment while all were silent and still watch the lord in hi throe he waver come said gandalf we are need there is much that you can yet do then suddenli denethor laugh he stood up tall and proud again and step swiftli back to the tabl he lift from it the pillow on which hi head had lain then come to the doorway he drew asid the cover and lo he had between hi hand a palantír and as he held it up it seem to those that look on that the globe began to glow with an inner flame so that the lean face of the lord wa lit as with a red fire and it seem cut out of hard stone sharp with black shadow nobl proud and terribl hi eye glitter pride and despair he cri didst thou think that the eye of the white tower were blind nay i have seen more than thou knowest grey fool for thi hope is but ignor go then and labour in heal go forth and fight vaniti for a littl space you may triumph on the field for a day but against the power that now aris there is no victori to thi citi onli the first finger of it hand ha yet been stretch all the east is move and even now the wind of thi hope cheat thee and waft up anduin a fleet with black sail the west ha fail it is time for all to depart who would not be slave such counsel will make the enemi victori certain inde said gandalf hope on then laugh denethor do i not know thee mithrandir thi hope is to rule in my stead to stand behind everi throne north south or west i have read thi mind and it polici do i not know that you command thi halfl here to keep silenc that you brought him hither to be a spi within my veri chamber and yet in our speech togeth i have learn the name and purpos of all thi companion so with the left hand thou wouldst use me for a littl while as a shield against mordor and with the right bring up thi ranger of the north to supplant me but i say to thee gandalf mithrandir i will not be thi tool i am steward of the hous of anárion i will not step down to be the dotard chamberlain of an upstart even were hi claim prove to me still he come but of the line of isildur i will not bow to such a one last of a rag hous long bereft of lordship and digniti what then would you have said gandalf if your will could have it way i would have thing as they were in all the day of my life answer denethor and in the day of my longfath befor me to be the lord of thi citi in peac and leav my chair to a son after me who would be hi own master and no wizard pupil but if doom deni thi to me then i will have naught neither life diminish nor love halv nor honour abat to me it would not seem that a steward who faith surrend hi charg is diminish in love or in honour said gandalf and at the least you shall not rob your son of hi choic while hi death is still in doubt at those word denethor eye flame again and take the stone under hi arm he drew a knife and strode toward the bier but beregond sprang forward and set himself befor faramir so cri denethor thou hadst alreadi stolen half my son love now thou stealest the heart of my knight also so that they rob me wholli of my son at the last but in thi at least thou shalt not defi my will to rule my own end come hither he cri to hi servant come if you are not all recreant then two of them ran up the step to him swiftli he snatch a torch from the hand of one and sprang back into the hous befor gandalf could hinder him he thrust the brand amid the fuel and at onc it crackl and roar into flame then denethor leap upon the tabl and stand there wreath in fire and smoke he took up the staff of hi stewardship that lay at hi feet and broke it on hi knee cast the piec into the blaze he bow and laid himself on the tabl clasp the palantír with both hand upon hi breast and it wa said that ever after if ani man look in that stone unless he had a great strength of will to turn it to other purpos he saw onli two age hand wither in flame gandalf in grief and horror turn hi face away and close the door for a while he stood in thought silent upon the threshold while those outsid heard the greedi roar of the fire within and then denethor gave a great cri and afterward spoke no more nor wa ever again seen by mortal men so pass denethor son of ecthelion said gandalf then he turn to beregond and the lord servant that stood there aghast and so pass also the day of gondor that you have known for good or evil they are end ill deed have been done here but let now all enmiti that lie between you be put away for it wa contriv by the enemi and work hi will you have been caught in a net of war duti that you did not weav but think you servant of the lord blind in your obedi that but for the treason of beregond faramir captain of the white tower would now also be burn bear away from thi unhappi place your comrad who have fallen and we will bear faramir steward of gondor to a place where he can sleep in peac or die if that be hi doom then gandalf and beregond take up the bier bore it away toward the hous of heal while behind them walk pippin with downcast head but the servant of the lord stood gaze as stricken men at the hous of the dead and even as gandalf came to the end of rath dínen there wa a great nois look back they saw the dome of the hous crack and smoke issu forth and then with a rush and rumbl of stone it fell in a flurri of fire but still unab the flame danc and flicker among the ruin then in terror the servant fled and follow gandalf at length they came back to the steward door and beregond look with grief at the porter thi deed i shall ever rue he said but a mad of hast wa on me and he would not listen but drew sword against me then take the key that he had wrest from the slain man he close the door and lock it thi should now be given to the lord faramir he said the princ of dol amroth is in command in the absenc of the lord said gandalf but sinc he is not here i must take thi on myself i bid you keep the key and guard it until the citi is set in order again now at last they pass into the high circl of the citi and in the light of morn they went their way toward the hous of heal and these were fair hous set apart for the care of those who were grievous sick but now they were prepar for the tend of men hurt in battl or die they stood not far from the citadelg in the sixth circl nigh to it southward wall and about them wa a garden and a greensward with tree the onli such place in the citi there dwelt the few women that had been permit to remain in mina tirith sinc they were skill in heal or in the servic of the healer but even as gandalf and hi companion came carri the bier to the main door of the hous they heard a great cri that went up from the field befor the gate and rise shrill and pierc into the sky pass and die away on the wind so terribl wa the cri that for a moment all stood still and yet when it had pass suddenli their heart were lift up in such a hope as they had not known sinc the dark came out of the east and it seem to them that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the cloud but gandalf face wa grave and sad and bid beregond and pippin to take faramir into the hous of heal he went up on to the wall nearbi and there like a figur carven in white he stood in the new sun and look out and he beheld with the sight that wa given to him all that had befallen and when éomer rode out from the forefront of hi battl and stood besid those who lay upon the field he sigh and he cast hi cloak about him again and went from the wall and beregond and pippin found him stand in thought befor the door of the hous when they came out they look at him and for a while he wa silent at last he spoke my friend he said and all you peopl of thi citi and of the western land thing of great sorrow and renown have come to pass shall we weep or be glad beyond hope the captain of our foe ha been destroy and you have heard the echo of hi last despair but he ha not gone without woe and bitter loss and that i might have avert but for the mad of denethor so long ha the reach of our enemi becom ala but now i perceiv how hi will wa abl to enter into the veri heart of the citi though the steward deem that it wa a secret kept onli by themselv long ago i guess that here in the white tower one at least of the seven see stone wa preserv in the day of hi wisdom denethor did not presum to use it nor to challeng sauron know the limit of hi own strength but hi wisdom fail and i fear that as the peril of hi realm grew he look in the stone and wa deceiv far too often i guess sinc boromir depart he wa too great to be subdu to the will of the dark power he saw nonetheless onli those thing which that power permit him to see the knowledg which he obtain wa doubtless often of servic to him yet the vision of the great might of mordor that wa shown to him fed the despair of hi heart until it overthrew hi mind now i understand what seem so strang to me said pippin shudder at hi memori as he spoke the lord went away from the room where faramir lay and it wa onli when he return that i first thought he wa chang old and broken it wa in the veri hour that faramir wa brought to the tower that mani of us saw a strang light in the topmost chamber said beregond but we have seen that light befor and it ha long been rumour in the citi that the lord would at time wrestl in thought with hi enemi ala then i have guess rightli said gandalf thu the will of sauron enter into mina tirith and thu i have been delay here and here i shall still be forc to remain for i shall soon have other charg not faramir onli now i must go down to meet those who come i have seen a sight upon the field that is veri grievou to my heart and greater sorrow may yet come to pass come with me pippin but you beregond should return to the citadel and tell the chief of the guard there what ha befallen it will be hi duti i fear to withdraw you from the guard but say to him that if i may give him counsel you should be sent to the hous of heal to be the guard and servant of your captain and to be at hi side when he awak – if that shall ever be again for by you he wa save from the fire go now i shall return soon with that he turn away and went with pippin down toward the lower citi and even as they hasten on their way the wind brought a grey rain and all the fire sank and there aros a great smoke befor them chapter the hous of heal a mist wa in merri eye of tear and weari when they drew near the ruin gate of mina tirith he gave littl heed to the wreck and slaughter that lay about all fire and smoke and stench wa in the air for mani engin had been burn or cast into the firepit and mani of the slain also while here and there lay mani carcas of the great southron monster halfburn or broken by stonecast or shot through the eye by the valiant archer of morthond the fli rain had ceas for a time and the sun gleam up abov but all the lower citi wa still wrap in a smoulder reek alreadi men were labour to clear a way through the jetsam of battl and now out from the gate came some bear litter gentli they laid éowyn upon soft pillow but the king bodi they cover with a great cloth of gold and they bore torch about him and their flame pale in the sunlight were flutter by the wind so théoden and éowyn came to the citi of gondor and all who saw them bare their head and bow and they pass through the ash and fume of the burn circl and went on and up along the street of stone to merri the ascent seem agelong a meaningless journey in a hate dream go on and on to some dim end that memori can not seiz slowli the light of the torch in front of him flicker and went out and he wa walk in a dark and he thought thi is a tunnel lead to a tomb there we shall stay forev but suddenli into hi dream there fell a live voic well merri thank good i have found you he look up and the mist befor hi eye clear a littl there wa pippin they were face to face in a narrow lane and but for themselv it wa empti he rub hi eye where is the king he said and éowyn then he stumbl and sat down on a doorstep and began to weep again they have gone up into the citadel said pippin i think you must have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turn when we found that you were not with them gandalf sent me to look for you poor old merri how glad i am to see you again but you are worn out and i wont bother you with ani talk but tell me are you hurt or wound no said merri well no i dont think so but i cant use my right arm pippin not sinc i stab him and my sword burn all away like a piec of wood pippin face wa anxiou well you had better come with me as quick as you can he said i wish i could carri you you arent fit to walk ani further they shouldnt have let you walk at all but you must forgiv them so mani dread thing have happen in the citi merri that one poor hobbit come in from the battl is easili overlook it not alway a misfortun be overlook said merri i wa overlook just now by – no no i cant speak of it help me pippin it all go dark again and my arm is so cold lean on me merri lad said pippin come now foot by foot it not far are you go to buri me said merri no inde said pippin tri to sound cheer though hi heart wa wrung with fear and piti no we are go to the hous of heal they turn out of the lane that ran between tall hous and the outer wall of the fourth circl and they regain the main street climb up to the citadel step by step they went while merri sway and murmur as one in sleep ill never get him there thought pippin is there no one to help me i cant leav him here just then to hi surpris a boy came run up behind and as he pass he recogn bergil beregond son hullo bergil he call where are you go glad to see you again and still aliv i am run errand for the healer said bergil i can not stay dont said pippin but tell them up there that i have a sick hobbit a perian mind you come from the battlefield i dont think he can walk so far if mithrandir is there he will be glad of the messag bergil ran on id better wait here thought pippin so he let merri sink gentli down on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight and then he sat down besid him lay merri head in hi lap he felt hi bodi and limb gentli and took hi friend hand in hi own the right hand felt ici to the touch it wa not long befor gandalf himself came in search of them he stoop over merri and caress hi brow then he lift him care he should have been born in honour into thi citi he said he ha well repaid my trust for if elrond had not yield to me neither of you would have set out and then far more grievou would the evil of thi day have been he sigh and yet here is anoth charg on my hand while all the time the battl hang in the balanc so at last faramir and éowyn and meriadoc were laid in bed in the hous of heal and there they were tend well for though all lore wa in these latter day fallen from it full of old the leechcraft of gondor wa still wise and skill in the heal of wound and hurt and all such sick as east of the sea mortal men were subject to save old age onli for that they had found no cure and inde the span of their live had now wane to littl more than that of other men and those among them who pass the tale of five score year with vigour were grown few save in some hous of purer blood but now their art and knowledg were baffl for there were mani sick of a maladi that would not be heal and they call it the black shadow for it came from the nazgûl and those who were stricken with it fell slowli into an ever deeper dream and then pass to silenc and a deadli cold and so die and it seem to the tender of the sick that on the halfl and on the ladi of rohan thi maladi lay heavili still at while as the morn wore away they would speak murmur in their dream and the watcher listen to all that they said hope perhap to learn someth that would help them to understand their hurt but soon they began to fall down into the dark and as the sun turn west a grey shadow crept over their face but faramir burn with a fever that would not abat gandalf went from one to the other full of care and he wa told all that the watcher could hear and so the day pass while the great battl outsid went on with shift hope and strang tide and still gandalf wait and watch and did not go forth till at last the red sunset fill all the sky and the light through the window fell on the grey face of the sick then it seem to those who stood by that in the glow the face flush softli as with health return but it wa onli a mockeri of hope then an old wife ioreth the eldest of the women who serv in that hous look on the fair face of faramir wept for all the peopl love him and she said ala if he should die would that there were king in gondor as there were onc upon a time they say for it is said in old lore the hand of the king are the hand of a healer and so the right king could ever be known and gandalf who stood by said men may long rememb your word ioreth for there is hope in them mayb a king ha inde return to gondor or have you not heard the strang tide that have come to the citi i have been too busi with thi and that to heed all the cri and shout she answer all i hope is that those murder devil do not come to thi hous and troubl the sick then gandalf went out in hast and alreadi the fire in the sky wa burn out and the smoulder hill were fade while ashgrey even crept over the field now as the sun went down aragorn and éomer and imrahil drew near the citi with their captain and knight and when they came befor the gate aragorn said behold the sun set in a great fire it is a sign of the end and fall of mani thing and a chang in the tide of the world but thi citi and realm ha rest in the charg of the steward for mani long year and i fear that if i enter it unbidden then doubt and debat may aris which should not be while thi war is fought i will not enter in nor make ani claim until it be seen whether we or mordor shall prevail men shall pitch my tent upon the field and here i will await the welcom of the lord of the citi but éomer said alreadi you have rais the banner of the king and display the token of elendil hous will you suffer these to be challeng no said aragorn but i deem the time unrip and i have no mind for strife except with our enemi and hi servant and the princ imrahil said your word lord are wise if one who is a kinsman of the lord denethor may counsel you in thi matter he is strongwil and proud but old and hi mood ha been strang sinc hi son wa stricken down yet i would not have you remain like a beggar at the door not a beggar said aragorn say a captain of the ranger who are unus to citi and hous of stone and he command that hi banner should be furl and he did off the star of the north kingdom and gave it to the keep of the son of elrond then the princ imrahil and éomer of rohan left him and pass through the citi and the tumult of the peopl and mount to the citadel and they came to the hall of the tower seek the steward but they found hi chair empti and befor the dai lay théoden king of the mark upon a bed of state and twelv torch stood about it and twelv guard knight both of rohan and gondor and the hang of the bed were of green and white but upon the king wa laid the great cloth of gold up to hi breast and upon that hi unsheath sword and at hi feet hi shield the light of the torch shimmer in hi white hair like sun in the spray of a fountain but hi face wa fair and young save that a peac lay on it beyond the reach of youth and it seem that he slept when they had stood silent for a time besid the king imrahil said where is the steward and where also is mithrandir and one of the guard answer the steward of gondor is in the hous of heal but éomer said where is the ladi éowyn my sister for sure she should be lie besid the king and in no less honour where have they bestow her and imrahil said but the ladi éowyn wa yet live when they bore her hither did you not know then hope unlookedfor came so suddenli to éomer heart and with it the bite of care and fear renew that he said no more but turn and went swiftli from the hall and the princ follow him and when they came forth even had fallen and mani star were in the sky and there came gandalf on foot and with him one cloak in grey and they met befor the door of the hous of heal and they greet gandalf and said we seek the steward and men say that he is in thi hous ha ani hurt befallen him and the ladi éowyn where is she and gandalf answer she lie within and is not dead but is near death but the lord faramir wa wound by an evil dart as you have heard and he is now the steward for denethor ha depart and hi hous is in ash and they were fill with grief and wonder at the tale that he told but imrahil said so victori is shorn of glad and it is bitter bought if both gondor and rohan are in one day bereft of their lord éomer rule the rohirrim who shall rule the citi meanwhil shall we not send now for the lord aragorn and the cloak man spoke and said he is come and they saw as he step into the light of the lantern by the door that it wa aragorn wrap in the grey cloak of lórien abov hi mail and bear no other token than the green stone of galadriel i have come becaus gandalf beg me to do so he said but for the present i am but the captain of the dúnedain of arnor and the lord of dol amroth shall rule the citi until faramir awak but it is my counsel that gandalf should rule us all in the day that follow and in our deal with the enemi and they agre upon that then gandalf said let us not stay at the door for the time is urgent let us enter for it is onli in the come of aragorn that ani hope remain for the sick that lie in the hous thu spake ioreth wisewoman of gondor the hand of the king are the hand of a healer and so shall the right king be known then aragorn enter first and the other follow and there at the door were two guard in the liveri of the citadel one tall but the other scarc the height of a boy and when he saw them he cri aloud in surpris and joy strider how splendid do you know i guess it wa you in the black ship but they were all shout corsair and wouldnt listen to me how did you do it aragorn laugh and took the hobbit by the hand well met inde he said but there is not time yet for travel tale but imrahil said to éomer is it thu that we speak to our king yet mayb he will wear hi crown in some other name and aragorn hear him turn and said verili for in the high tongu of old i am elessar the elfston and envinyatar the renew and he lift from hi breast the green stone that lay there but strider shall be the name of my hous if that be ever establish in the high tongu it will not sound so ill and telcontar i will be and all the heir of my bodi and with that they pass into the hous and as they went toward the room where the sick were tend gandalf told of the deed of éowyn and meriadoc for he said long have i stood by them and at first they spoke much in their dream befor they sank into the deadli dark also it is given to me to see mani thing far off aragorn went first to faramir and then to the ladi éowyn and last to merri when he had look on the face of the sick and seen their hurt he sigh here i must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me he said would that elrond were here for he is the eldest of all our race and ha the greater power and éomer see that he wa sorrow and weari said first you must rest sure and at the least eat a littl but aragorn answer nay for these three and most soon for faramir time is run out all speed is need then he call to ioreth and he said you have store in thi hous of the herb of heal ye lord she answer but not enough i reckon for all that will need them but i am sure i do not know where we shall find more for all thing are amiss in these dread day what with fire and burn and the lad that run errand so few and all the road block whi it is day out of count sinc ever a carrier came in from lossarnach to the market but we do our best in thi hous with what we have as i am sure your lordship will know i will judg that when i see said aragorn one thing also is short time for speech have you athela i do not know i am sure lord she answer at least not by that name i will go and ask of the herbmast he know all the old name it is also call kingsfoil said aragorn and mayb you know it by that name for so the countryfolk call it in these latter day oh that said ioreth well if your lordship had name it at first i could have told you no we have none of it i am sure whi i have never heard that it had ani great virtu and inde i have often said to my sister when we came upon it grow in the wood kingsfoil i said ti a strang name and i wonder whi ti call so for if i were a king i would have plant more bright in my garden still it smell sweet when bruis doe it not if sweet is the right word wholesom mayb is nearer wholesom verili said aragorn and now dame if you love the lord faramir run as quick as your tongu and get me kingsfoil if there is a leaf in the citi and if not said gandalf i will ride to lossarnach with ioreth behind me and she shall take me to the wood but not to her sister and shadowfax shall show her the mean of hast when ioreth wa gone aragorn bade the other women to make water hot then he took faramir hand in hi and laid the other hand upon the sick man brow it wa drench with sweat but faramir did not move or make ani sign and seem hardli to breath he is nearli spent said aragorn turn to gandalf but thi come not from the wound see that is heal had he been smitten by some dart of the nazgûl as you thought he would have die that night thi hurt wa given by some southron arrow i would guess who drew it forth wa it kept i drew it forth said imrahil and staunch the wound but i did not keep the arrow for we had much to do it wa as i rememb just such a dart as the southron use yet i believ that it came from the shadow abov for els hi fever and sick were not to be understood sinc the wound wa not deep or vital how then do you read the matter weari grief for hi father mood a wound and over all the black breath said aragorn he is a man of staunch will for alreadi he had come close under the shadow befor ever he rode to battl on the outwal slowli the dark must have crept on him even as he fought and strove to hold hi outpost would that i could have been here sooner thereupon the herbmast enter your lordship ask for kingsfoil as the rustic name it he said or athela in the nobl tongu or to those who know somewhat of the valinorean i do so said aragorn and i care not whether you say now asëa aranion or kingsfoil so long as you have some your pardon lord said the man i see you are a loremast not mere a captain of war but ala sir we do not keep thi thing in the hous of heal where onli the grave hurt or sick are tend for it ha no virtu that we know of save perhap to sweeten a foul air or to drive away some pass heavi unless of cours you give heed to rhyme of old day which women such as our good ioreth still repeat without understand when the black breath blow and death shadow grow and all light pass come athela come athela life to the die in the king hand lie it is but a doggrel i fear garbl in the memori of old wive it mean i leav to your judgement if inde it ha ani but old folk still use an infus of the herb for headach then in the name of the king go and find some old man of less lore and more wisdom who keep some in hi hous cri gandalf now aragorn knelt besid faramir and held a hand upon hi brow and those that watch felt that some great struggl wa go on for aragorn face grew grey with weari and ever and anon he call the name of faramir but each time more faintli to their hear as if aragorn himself wa remov from them and walk afar in some dark vale call for one that wa lost and at last bergil came run in and he bore six leav in a cloth it is kingsfoil sir he said but not fresh i fear it must have been cull two week ago at the least i hope it will serv sir then look at faramir he burst into tear but aragorn smile it will serv he said the worst is now over stay and be comfort then take two leav he laid them on hi hand and breath on them and then he crush them and straightway a live fresh fill the room as if the air itself awok and tingl sparkl with joy and then he cast the leav into the bowl of steam water that were brought to him and at onc all heart were lighten for the fragranc that came to each wa like a memori of dewi morn of unshadow sun in some land of which the fair world in spring is itself but a fleet memori but aragorn stood up as one refresh and hi eye smile as he held a bowl befor faramir dream face well now who would have believ it said ioreth to a woman that stood besid her the weed is better than i thought it remind me of the rose of imloth melui when i wa a lass and no king could ask for better suddenli faramir stir and he open hi eye and he look on aragorn who bent over him and a light of knowledg and love wa kindl in hi eye and he spoke softli my lord you call me i come what doe the king command walk no more in the shadow but awak said aragorn you are weari rest a while and take food and be readi when i return i will lord said faramir for who would lie idl when the king ha return farewel then for a while said aragorn i must go to other who need me and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil but beregond and hi son remain behind unabl to contain their joy as he follow gandalf and shut the door pippin heard ioreth exclaim king did you hear that what did i say the hand of a healer i said and soon the word had gone out from the hous that the king wa inde come among them and after war he brought heal and the news ran through the citi but aragorn came to éowyn and he said here there is a grievou hurt and a heavi blow the arm that wa broken ha been tend with due skill and it will mend in time if she ha the strength to live it is the shieldarm that is maim but the chief evil come through the swordarm in that there now seem no life although it is unbroken ala for she wa pit against a foe beyond the strength of her mind or bodi and those who will take a weapon to such an enemi must be sterner than steel if the veri shock shall not destroy them it wa an evil doom that set her in hi path for she is a fair maiden fairest ladi of a hous of queen and yet i know not how i should speak of her when i first look on her and perceiv her unhappi it seem to me that i saw a white flower stand straight and proud shape as a lili and yet knew that it wa hard as if wrought by elfwright out of steel or wa it mayb a frost that had turn it sap to ice and so it stood bittersweet still fair to see but stricken soon to fall and die her maladi begin far back befor thi day doe it not éomer i marvel that you should ask me lord he answer for i hold you blameless in thi matter as in all els yet i knew not that éowyn my sister wa touch by ani frost until she first look on you care and dread she had and share with me in the day of wormtongu and the king bewitch and she tend the king in grow fear but that did not bring her to thi pass my friend said gandalf you had hors and deed of arm and the free field but she born in the bodi of a maid had a spirit and courag at least the match of your yet she wa doom to wait upon an old man whom she love as a father and watch him fall into a mean dishonour dotag and her part seem to her more ignobl than that of the staff he lean on think you that wormtongu had poison onli for théoden ear dotard what is the hous of eorl but a thatch barn where brigand drink in the reek and their brat roll on the floor among their dogshav you not heard those word befor saruman spoke them the teacher of wormtongu though i do not doubt that wormtongu at home wrap their mean in term more cun my lord if your sister love for you and her will still bent to her duti had not restrain her lip you might have heard even such thing as these escap them but who know what she spoke to the dark alon in the bitter watch of the night when all her life seem shrink and the wall of her bower close in about her a hutch to trammel some wild thing in then éomer wa silent and look on hi sister as if ponder anew all the day of their past life togeth but aragorn said i saw also what you saw éomer few other grief amid the ill chanc of thi world have more bitter and shame for a man heart than to behold the love of a ladi so fair and brave that can not be return sorrow and piti have follow me ever sinc i left her desper in dunharrow and rode to the path of the dead and no fear upon that way wa so present as the fear for what might befal her and yet éomer i say to you that she love you more truli than me for you she love and know but in me she love onli a shadow and a thought a hope of glori and great deed and land far from the field of rohan i have mayb the power to heal her bodi and to recal her from the dark valley but to what she will awak hope or forget or despair i do not know and if to despair then she will die unless other heal come which i can not bring ala for her deed have set her among the queen of great renown then aragorn stoop and look in her face and it wa inde white as a lili cold as frost and hard as graven stone but he bent and kiss her on the brow and call her softli say éowyn éomund daughter awak for your enemi ha pass away she did not stir but now she began again to breath deepli so that her breast rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet onc more aragorn bruis two leav of athela and cast them into steam water and he lave her brow with it and her right arm lie cold and nerveless on the coverlet then whether aragorn had inde some forgotten power of westerness or whether it wa but hi word of the ladi éowyn that wrought on them as the sweet influenc of the herb stole about the chamber it seem to those who stood by that a keen wind blew through the window and it bore no scent but wa an air wholli fresh and clean and young as if it had not befor been breath by ani live thing and came newmad from snowi mountain high beneath a dome of star or from shore of silver far away wash by sea of foam awak éowyn ladi of rohan said aragorn again and he took her right hand in hi and felt it warm with life return awak the shadow is gone and all dark is wash clean then he laid her hand in éomer and step away call her he said and he pass silent from the chamber éowyn éowyn cri éomer amid hi tear but she open her eye and said éomer what joy is thi for they said that you were slain nay but that wa onli the dark voic in my dream how long have i been dream not long my sister said éomer but think no more on it i am strang weari she said i must rest a littl but tell me what of the lord of the mark ala do not tell me that that wa a dream for i know that it wa not he is dead as he foresaw he is dead said éomer but he bade me say farewel to éowyn dearer than daughter he lie now in great honour in the citadel of gondor that is grievou she said and yet it is good beyond all that i dare hope in the dark day when it seem that the hous of eorl wa sunk in honour less than ani shepherd cot and what of the king esquir the halfl éomer you shall make him a knight of the riddermark for he is valiant he lie nearbi in thi hous and i will go to him said gandalf éomer shall stay here for a while but do not speak yet of war or woe until you are made whole again great glad it is to see you wake again to health and hope so valiant a ladi to health said éowyn it may be so at least while there is an empti saddl of some fallen rider that i can fill and there are deed to do but to hope i do not know gandalf and pippin came to merri room and there they found aragorn stand by the bed poor old merri cri pippin and he ran to the bedsid for it seem to him that hi friend look wors and a grey wa in hi face as if a weight of year of sorrow lay on him and suddenli a fear seiz pippin that merri would die do not be afraid said aragorn i came in time and i have call him back he is weari now and griev and he ha taken a hurt like the ladi éowyn dare to smite that deadli thing but these evil can be amend so strong and gay a spirit is in him hi grief he will not forget but it will not darken hi heart it will teach him wisdom then aragorn laid hi hand on merri head and pass hi hand gentli through the brown curl he touch the eyelid and call him by name and when the fragranc of athela stole through the room like the scent of orchard and of heather in the sunshin full of bee suddenli merri awok and he said i am hungri what is the time past suppertim now said pippin though i daresay i could bring you someth if they will let me they will inde said gandalf and anyth els that thi rider of rohan may desir if it can be found in mina tirith where hi name is in honour good said merri then i would like supper first and after that a pipe at that hi face cloud no not a pipe i dont think ill smoke again whi not said pippin well answer merri slowli he is dead it ha brought it all back to me he said he wa sorri he had never had a chanc of talk herblor with me almost the last thing he ever said i shant ever be abl to smoke again without think of him and that day pippin when he rode up to isengard and wa so polit smoke then and think of him said aragorn for he wa a gentl heart and a great king and kept hi oath and he rose out of the shadow to a last fair morn though your servic to him wa brief it should be a memori glad and honour to the end of your day merri smile well then he said if strider will provid what is need i will smoke and think i had some of saruman best in my pack but what becam of it in the battl i am sure i dont know master meriadoc said aragorn if you think that i have pass through the mountain and the realm of gondor with fire and sword to bring herb to a careless soldier who throw away hi gear you are mistaken if your pack ha not been found then you must send for the herbmast of thi hous and he will tell you that he did not know that the herb you desir had ani virtu but that it is call westmanswe by the vulgar and galena by the nobl and other name in other tongu more learn and after ad a few halfforgotten rhyme that he doe not understand he will regret inform you that there is none in the hous and he will leav you to reflect on the histori of tongu and so now must i for i have not slept in such a bed as thi sinc i rode from dunharrow nor eaten sinc the dark befor dawn merri seiz hi hand and kiss it i am fright sorri he said go at onc ever sinc that night at bree we have been a nuisanc to you but it is the way of my peopl to use light word at such time and say less than they mean we fear to say too much it rob us of the right word when a jest is out of place i know that well or i would not deal with you in the same way said aragorn may the shire live for ever unwith and kiss merri he went out and gandalf went with him pippin remain behind wa there ever ani one like him he said except gandalf of cours i think they must be relat my dear ass your pack is lie by your bed and you had it on your back when i met you he saw it all the time of cours and anyway i have some stuff of my own come on now longbottom leaf it is fill up while i run and see about some food and then let be easi for a bit dear me we took and brandybuck we cant live long on the height no said merri i cant not yet at ani rate but at least pippin we can now see them and honour them it is best to love first what you are fit to love i suppos you must start somewher and have some root and the soil of the shire is deep still there are thing deeper and higher and not a gaffer could tend hi garden in what he call peac but for them whether he know about them or not i am glad that i know about them a littl but i dont know whi i am talk like thi where is that leaf and get my pipe out of my pack if it isnt broken aragorn and gandalf went now to the warden of the hous of heal and they counsel him that faramir and éowyn should remain there and still be tend with care for mani day the ladi éowyn said aragorn will wish soon to rise and depart but she should not be permit to do so if you can in ani way restrain her until at least ten day be pass as for faramir said gandalf he must soon learn that hi father is dead but the full tale of the mad of denethor should not be told to him until he is quit heal and ha duti to do see that beregond and the perian who were present do not speak to him of these thing yet and the other perian meriadoc who is under my care what of him said the warden it is like that he will be fit to aris tomorrow for a short while said aragorn let him do so if he wish he may walk a littl in the care of hi friend they are a remark race said the warden nod hi head veri tough in the fibr i deem at the door of the hous mani were alreadi gather to see aragorn and they follow after him and when at last he had sup men came and pray that he would heal their kinsmen or their friend whose live were in peril through hurt or wound or who lay under the black shadow and aragorn aros and went out and he sent for the son of elrond and togeth they labour far into the night and word went through the citi the king is come again inde and they name him elfston becaus of the green stone that he wore and so the name which it wa foretold at hi birth that he should bear wa chosen for him by hi own peopl and when he could labour no more he cast hi cloak about him and slip out of the citi and went to hi tent just ere dawn and slept for a littl and in the morn the banner of dol amroth a white ship like a swan upon blue water float from the tower and men look up and wonder if the come of the king had been but a dream chapter the last debat the morn came after the day of battl and it wa fair with light cloud and the wind turn westward legola and gimli were earli abroad and they beg leav to go up into the citi for they were eager to see merri and pippin it is good to learn that they are still aliv said gimli for they cost us great pain in our march over rohan and i would not have such pain all wast togeth the elf and the dwarf enter mina tirith and folk that saw them pass marvel to see such companion for legola wa fair of face beyond the measur of men and he sang an elvensong in a clear voic as he walk in the morn but gimli stalk besid him stroke hi beard and stare about him there is some good stonework here he said as he look at the wall but also some that is less good and the street could be better contriv when aragorn come into hi own i shall offer him the servic of stonewright of the mountain and we will make thi a town to be proud of they need more garden said legola the hous are dead and there is too littl here that grow and is glad if aragorn come into hi own the peopl of the wood shall bring him bird that sing and tree that do not die at length they came to the princ imrahil and legola look at him and bow low for he saw that here inde wa one who had elvenblood in hi vein hail lord he said it is long sinc the peopl of nimrodel left the woodland of lórien and yet still one may see that not all sail from amroth haven west over water so it is said in the lore of my land said the princ yet never ha one of the fair folk been seen there for year beyond count and i marvel to see one here now in the midst of sorrow and war what do you seek i am one of the nine companion who set out with mithrandir from imladri said legola and with thi dwarf my friend i came with the lord aragorn but now we wish to see our friend meriadoc and peregrin who are in your keep we are told you will find them in the hous of heal and i will lead you thither said imrahil it will be enough if you send one to guid us lord said legola for aragorn send thi messag to you he doe not wish to enter the citi again at thi time yet there is need for the captain to hold council at onc and he pray that you and éomer of rohan will come down to hi tent as soon as may be mithrandir is alreadi there we will come said imrahil and they part with courteou word that is a fair lord and a great captain of men said legola if gondor ha such men still in these day of fade great must have been it glori in the day of it rise and doubtless the good stonework is the older and wa wrought in the first build said gimli it is ever so with the thing that men begin there is a frost in spring or a blight in summer and they fail of their promis yet seldom do they fail of their seed said legola and that will lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in time and place unlookedfor the deed of men will outlast us gimli and yet come to naught in the end but mighthavebeen i guess said the dwarf to that the elv know not the answer said legola with that the servant of the princ came and led them to the hous of heal and there they found their friend in the garden and their meet wa a merri one for a while they walk and talk rejoic for a brief space in peac and rest under the morn high up in the windi circl of the citi then when merri becam weari they went and sat upon the wall with the greensward of the hous of heal behind them and away southward befor them wa the anduin glitter in the sun as it flow away out of the sight even of legola into the wide flat and green haze of lebennin and south ithilien and now legola fell silent while the other talk and he look out against the sun and as he gaze he saw white seabird beat up the river look he cri gull they are fli far inland a wonder they are to me and a troubl to my heart never in all my life had i met them until we came to pelargir and there i heard them cri in the air as we rode to the battl of the ship then i stood still forget war in middleearth for their wail voic spoke to me of the sea the sea ala i have not yet beheld it but deep in the heart of all my kindr lie the sealong which it is peril to stir ala for the gull no peac shall i have again under beech or under elm say not so said gimli there are countless thing still to see in middleearth and great work to do but if all the fair folk take to the haven it will be a duller world for those who are doom to stay dull and dreari inde said merri you must not go to the haven legola there will alway be some folk big or littl and even a few wise dwarv like gimli who need you at least i hope so though i feel somehow that the worst of thi war is still to come how i wish it wa all over and well over dont be so gloomi cri pippin the sun is shine and here we are togeth for a day or two at least i want to hear more about you all come gimli you and legola have mention your strang journey with strider about a dozen time alreadi thi morn but you havent told me anyth about it the sun may shine here said gimli but there are memori of that road that i do not wish to recal out of the dark had i known what wa befor me i think that not for ani friendship would i have taken the path of the dead the path of the dead said pippin i heard aragorn say that and i wonder what he could mean wont you tell us some more not willingli said gimli for upon that road i wa put to shame gimli glóin son who had deem himself more tough than men and hardier under earth than ani elf but neither did i prove and i wa held to the road onli by the will of aragorn and by the love of him also said legola for all those who come to know him come to love him after hi own fashion even the cold maiden of the rohirrim it wa at earli morn of the day ere you came there merri that we left dunharrow and such a fear wa on all the folk that none would look on our go save the ladi éowyn who lie now hurt in the hous below there wa grief at that part and i wa griev to behold it ala i had heart onli for myself said gimli nay i will not speak of that journey he fell silent but pippin and merri were so eager for news that at last legola said i will tell you enough for your peac for i felt not the horror and i fear not the shadow of men powerless and frail as i deem them swiftli then he told of the haunt road under the mountain and the dark tryst at erech and the great ride thenc nineti leagu and three to pelargir on anduin four day and night and on into a fifth we rode from the black stone he said and lo in the dark of mordor my hope rose for in that gloom the shadow host seem to grow stronger and more terribl to look upon some i saw ride some stride yet all move with the same great speed silent they were but there wa a gleam in their eye in the upland of lamedon they overtook our hors and swept round us and would have pass us by if aragorn had not forbidden them at hi command they fell back even the shade of men are obedi to hi will i thought they may serv hi need yet one day of light we rode and then came the day without dawn and still we rode on and ciril and ringló we cross and on the third day we came to linhir abov the mouth of gilrain and there men of lamedon contest the ford with fell folk of umbar and harad who had sail up the river but defend and foe alik gave up the battl and fled when we came cri out that the king of the dead wa upon them onli angbor lord of lamedon had the heart to abid us and aragorn bade him gather hi folk and come behind if they dare when the grey host had pass at pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of you he said thu we cross over gilrain drive the alli of mordor in rout befor us and then we rest a while but soon aragorn aros say lo alreadi mina tirith is assail i fear that it will fall ere we come to it aid so we mount again befor night had pass and went on with all the speed that our hors could endur over the plain of lebennin legola paus and sigh and turn hi eye southward softli he sang silver flow the stream from celo to erui in the green field of lebennin tall grow the grass there in the wind from the sea the white lili sway and the golden bell are shaken of mallo and alfirin in the green field of lebennin in the wind from the sea green are those field in the song of my peopl but they were dark then grey wast in the black befor us and over the wide land trampl unheed the grass and the flower we hunt our foe through a day and a night until we came at the bitter end to the great river at last then i thought in my heart that we drew near to the sea for wide wa the water in the dark and seabird innumer cri on it shore ala for the wail of the gull did not the ladi tell me to bewar of them and now i can not forget them for my part i heed them not said gimli for we came then at last upon battl in earnest there at pelargir lay the main fleet of umbar fifti great ship and smaller vessel beyond count mani of those that we pursu had reach the haven befor us and brought their fear with them and some of the ship had put off seek to escap down the river or to reach the far shore and mani of the smaller craft were ablaz but the haradrim be now driven to the brink turn at bay and they were fierc in despair and they laugh when they look on us for they were a great armi still but aragorn halt and cri with a great voic now come by the black stone i call you and suddenli the shadow host that had hung back at the last came up like a grey tide sweep all away befor it faint cri i heard and dim horn blow and a murmur as of countless far voic it wa like the echo of some forgotten battl in the dark year long ago pale sword were drawn but i know not whether their blade would still bite for the dead need no longer ani weapon but fear none would withstand them to everi ship they came that wa drawn up and then they pass over the water to those that were anchor and all the marin were fill with a mad of terror and leap overboard save the slave chain to the oar reckless we rode among our flee foe drive them like leav until we came to the shore and then to each of the great ship that remain aragorn sent one of the dúnedain and they comfort the captiv that were aboard and bade them put asid fear and be free ere that dark day end none of the enemi were left to resist us all were drown or were fli south in the hope to find their own land upon foot strang and wonder i thought it that the design of mordor should be overthrown by such wraith of fear and dark with it own weapon wa it worst strang inde said legola in that hour i look on aragorn and thought how great and terribl a lord he might have becom in the strength of hi will had he taken the ring to himself not for naught doe mordor fear him but nobler is hi spirit than the understand of sauron for is he not of the children of lúthien never shall that line fail though the year may lengthen beyond count beyond the eye of the dwarv are such foretel said gimli but mighti inde wa aragorn that day lo all the black fleet wa in hi hand and he chose the greatest ship to be hi own and he went up into it then he let sound a great concours of trumpet taken from the enemi and the shadow host withdrew to the shore there they stood silent hardli to be seen save for a red gleam in their eye that caught the glare of the ship that were burn and aragorn spoke in a loud voic to the dead men cri hear now the word of the heir of isildur your oath is fulfil go back and troubl not the valley ever again depart and be at rest and thereupon the king of the dead stood out befor the host and broke hi spear and cast it down then he bow low and turn away and swiftli the whole grey host drew off and vanish like a mist that is driven back by a sudden wind and it seem to me that i awok from a dream that night we rest while other labour for there were mani captiv set free and mani slave releas who had been folk of gondor taken in raid and soon also there wa a great gather of men out of lebennin and the ethir and angbor of lamedon came up with all the horsemen that he could muster now that the fear of the dead wa remov they came to aid us and to look on the heir of isildur for the rumour of that name had run like fire in the dark and that is near the end of our tale for dure that even and night mani ship were made readi and man and in the morn the fleet set forth long past it now seem yet it wa but the morn of the day ere yesterday the sixth sinc we rode from dunharrow but still aragorn wa driven by fear that time wa too short it is forti leagu and two from pelargir to the land at the harlond he said yet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail utterli the oar were now wield by free men and man they labour yet slowli we pass up the great river for we strove against it stream and though that is not swift down in the south we had no help of wind heavi would my heart have been for all our victori at the haven if legola had not laugh suddenli up with your beard durin son he said for thu is it spoken oft hope is born when all is forlorn but what hope he saw from afar he would not tell when night came it did but deepen the dark and our heart were hot for away in the north we saw a red glow under the cloud and aragorn said mina tirith is burn but at midnight hope wa inde born anew seacrafti men of the ethir gaze southward spoke of a chang come with a fresh wind from the sea long ere day the mast ship hoist sail and our speed grew until dawn whiten the foam at our prow and so it wa as you know that we came in the third hour of the morn with a fair wind and the sun unveil and we unfurl the great standard in battl it wa a great day and a great hour whatev may come after follow what may great deed are not lessen in worth said legola great deed wa the ride of the path of the dead and great it shall remain though none be left in gondor to sing of it in the day that are to come and that may well befal said gimli for the face of aragorn and gandalf are grave much i wonder what counsel they are take in the tent there below for my part like merri i wish that with our victori the war wa now over yet whatev is still to do i hope to have a part in it for the honour of the folk of the lone mountain and i for the folk of the great wood said legola and for the love of the lord of the white tree then the companion fell silent but a while they sat there in the high place each busi with hi own thought while the captain debat when the princ imrahil had part from legola and gimli at onc he sent for éomer and he went down with him from the citi and they came to the tent of aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where king théoden had fallen and there they took counsel togeth with gandalf and aragorn and the son of elrond my lord said gandalf listen to the word of the steward of gondor befor he die you may triumph on the field of the pelennor for a day but against the power that ha now arisen there is no victori i do not bid you despair as he did but to ponder the truth in these word the stone of see do not lie and not even the lord of baraddûr can make them do so he can mayb by hi will choos what thing shall be seen by weaker mind or caus them to mistak the mean of what they see nonetheless it can not be doubt that when denethor saw great forc array against him in mordor and more still be gather he saw that which truli is hardli ha our strength suffic to beat off the first great assault the next will be greater thi war then is without final hope as denethor perceiv victori can not be achiev by arm whether you sit here to endur sieg after sieg or march out to be overwhelm beyond the river you have onli a choic of evil and prudenc would counsel you to strengthen such strong place as you have and there await the onset for so shall the time befor your end be made a littl longer then you would have us retreat to mina tirith or dol amroth or to dunharrow and there sit like children on sandcastl when the tide is flow said imrahil that would be no new counsel said gandalf have you not done thi and littl more in all the day of denethor but no i said thi would be prudent i do not counsel prudenc i said victori could not be achiev by arm i still hope for victori but not by arm for into the midst of all these polici come the ring of power the foundat of baraddûr and the hope of sauron concern thi thing my lord you now all know enough for the understand of our plight and of sauron if he regain it your valour is vain and hi victori will be swift and complet so complet that none can forese the end of it while thi world last if it is destroy then he will fall and hi fall will be so low that none can forese hi aris ever again for he will lose the best part of the strength that wa nativ to him in hi begin and all that wa made or begun with that power will crumbl and he will be maim for ever becom a mere spirit of malic that gnaw itself in the shadow but can not again grow or take shape and so a great evil of thi world will be remov other evil there are that may come for sauron is himself but a servant or emissari yet it is not our part to master all the tide of the world but to do what is in us for the succour of those year wherein we are set uproot the evil in the field that we know so that those who live after may have clean earth to till what weather they shall have is not our to rule now sauron know all thi and he know that thi preciou thing which he lost ha been found again but he doe not yet know where it is or so we hope and therefor he is now in great doubt for if we have found thi thing there are some among us with strength enough to wield it that too he know for do i not guess rightli aragorn that you have shown yourself to him in the stone of orthanc i did so ere i rode from the hornburg answer aragorn i deem that the time wa ripe and that the stone had come to me for just such a purpos it wa then ten day sinc the ringbear went east from rauro and the eye of sauron i thought should be drawn out from hi own land too seldom ha he been challeng sinc he return to hi tower though if i had foreseen how swift would be hi onset in answer mayb i should not have dare to show myself bare time wa given me to come to your aid but how is thi ask éomer all is vain you say if he ha the ring whi should he think it not vain to assail us if we have it he is not yet sure said gandalf and he ha not built up hi power by wait until hi enemi are secur as we have done also we could not learn how to wield the full power all in a day inde it can be use onli by one master alon not by mani and he will look for a time of strife ere one of the great among us make himself master and put down the other in that time the ring might aid him if he were sudden he is watch he see much and hear much hi nazgûl are still abroad they pass over thi field ere the sunris though few of the weari and sleep were awar of them he studi the sign the sword that rob him of hi treasur remad the wind of fortun turn in our favour and the defeat unlookedfor of hi first assault the fall of hi great captain hi doubt will be grow even as we speak here hi eye is now strain toward us blind almost to all els that is move so we must keep it therein lie all our hope thi then is my counsel we have not the ring in wisdom or great folli it ha been sent away to be destroy lest it destroy us without it we can not by forc defeat hi forc but we must at all cost keep hi eye from hi true peril we can not achiev victori by arm but by arm we can give the ringbear hi onli chanc frail though it be as aragorn ha begun so we must go on we must push sauron to hi last throw we must call out hi hidden strength so that he shall empti hi land we must march out to meet him at onc we must make ourselv the bait though hi jaw should close on us he will take that bait in hope and in greed for he will think that in such rash he see the pride of the new ringlord and he will say so he push out hi neck too soon and too far let him come on and behold i will have him in a trap from which he can not escap there i will crush him and what he ha taken in hi insol shall be mine again for ever we must walk openey into that trap with courag but small hope for ourselv for my lord it may well prove that we ourselv shall perish utterli in a black battl far from the live land so that even if baraddûr be thrown down we shall not live to see a new age but thi i deem is our duti and better so than to perish nonetheless – as we sure shall if we sit here – and know as we die that no new age shall be they were silent for a while at length aragorn spoke as i have begun so i will go on we come now to the veri brink where hope and despair are akin to waver is to fall let none now reject the counsel of gandalf whose long labour against sauron come at last to their test but for him all would long ago have been lost nonetheless i do not yet claim to command ani man let other choos as they will then said elrohir from the north we came with thi purpos and from elrond our father we brought thi veri counsel we will not turn back as for myself said éomer i have littl knowledg of these deep matter but i need it not thi i know and it is enough that as my friend aragorn succour me and my peopl so i will aid him when he call i will go as for me said imrahil the lord aragorn i hold to be my liegelord whether he claim it or no hi wish is to me a command i will go also yet for a while i stand in the place of the steward of gondor and it is mine to think first of it peopl to prudenc some heed must still be given for we must prepar against all chanc good as well as evil now it may be that we shall triumph and while there is ani hope of thi gondor must be protect i would not have us return with victori to a citi in ruin and a land ravag behind us and yet we learn from the rohirrim that there is an armi still unfought upon our northern flank that is true said gandalf i do not counsel you to leav the citi all unman inde the forc that we lead east need not be great enough for ani assault in earnest upon mordor so long as it be great enough to challeng battl and it must move soon therefor i ask the captain what forc could we muster and lead out in two day time at the latest and they must be hardi men that go willingli know their peril all are weari and veri mani have wound light or grievou said éomer and we have suffer much loss of our hors and that is ill to bear if we must ride soon then i can not hope to lead even two thousand and yet leav as mani for the defenc of the citi we have not onli to reckon with those who fought on thi field said aragorn new strength is on the way from the southern fief now that the coast have been rid four thousand i sent march from pelargir through lossarnach two day ago and angbor the fearless ride befor them if we set out in two day more they will draw nigh ere we depart moreov mani were bidden to follow me up the river in ani craft they could gather and with thi wind they will soon be at hand inde sever ship have alreadi come to the harlond i judg that we could lead out seven thousand of hors and foot and yet leav the citi in better defenc than it wa when the assault began the gate is destroy said imrahil and where now is the skill to rebuild it and set it up anew in erebor in the kingdom of dáin there is such skill said aragorn and if all our hope do not perish then in time i will send gimli glóin son to ask for wright of the mountain but men are better than gate and no gate will endur against our enemi if men desert it thi then wa the end of the debat of the lord that they should set forth on the second morn from that day with seven thousand if these might be found and the great part of thi forc should be on foot becaus of the evil land into which they would go aragorn should find some two thousand of those that he had gather to him in the south but imrahil should find three and a half thousand and éomer five hundr of the rohirrim who were unhors but themselv warworthi and he himself should lead five hundr of hi best rider on hors and anoth compani of five hundr hors there should be among which should ride the son of elrond with the dúnedain and the knight of dol amroth all told six thousand foot and a thousand hors but the main strength of the rohirrim that remain hors and abl to fight some three thousand under the command of elfhelm should waylay the west road against the enemi that wa in anórien and at onc swift rider were sent out to gather what news they could northward and eastward from osgiliath and the road to mina morgul and when they had reckon up all their strength and taken thought for the journey they should make and the road they should choos imrahil suddenli laugh aloud sure he cri thi is the greatest jest in all the histori of gondor that we should ride with seven thousand scarc as mani as the vanguard of it armi in the day of it power to assail the mountain and the impenetr gate of the black land so might a child threaten a mailclad knight with a bow of string and green willow if the dark lord know so much as you say mithrandir will he not rather smile than fear and with hi littl finger crush us like a fli that tri to sting him no he will tri to trap the fli and take the sting said gandalf and there are name among us that are worth more than a thousand mailclad knight apiec no he will not smile neither shall we said aragorn if thi be jest then it is too bitter for laughter nay it is the last move in a great jeopardi and for one side or the other it will bring the end of the game then he drew andúril and held it up glitter in the sun you shall not be sheath again until the last battl is fought he said chapter the black gate open two day later the armi of the west wa all assembl on the pelennor the host of orc and easterl had turn back out of anórien but harri and scatter by the rohirrim they had broken and fled with littl fight toward cair andro and with that threat destroy and new strength arriv out of the south the citi wa as well man as might be scout report that no enemi remain upon the road east as far as the crossroad of the fallen king all now wa readi for the last throw legola and gimli were to ride again togeth in the compani of aragorn and gandalf who went in the van with the dúnedain and the son of elrond but merri to hi shame wa not to go with them you are not fit for such a journey said aragorn but do not be asham if you do no more in thi war you have alreadi earn great honour peregrin shall go and repres the shirefolk and do not grudg him hi chanc of peril for though he ha done as well as hi fortun allow him he ha yet to match your deed but in truth all now are in like danger though it may be our part to find bitter end befor the gate of mordor if we do so then you will come also to a last stand either here or wherev the black tide overtak you farewel and so despond merri now stood and watch the muster of the armi bergil wa with him and he also wa downcast for hi father wa to march lead a compani of the men of the citi he could not rejoin the guard until hi case wa judg in that same compani pippin wa also to go as a soldier of gondor merri could see him not far off a small but upright figur among the tall men of mina tirith at last the trumpet rang and the armi began to move troop by troop and compani by compani they wheel and went off eastward and long after they had pass away out of sight down the great road to the causeway merri stood there the last glint of the morn sun on spear and helm twinkl and wa lost and still he remain with bow head and heavi heart feel friendless and alon everyon that he care for had gone away into the gloom that hung over the distant eastern sky and littl hope at all wa left in hi heart that he would ever see ani of them again as if recal by hi mood of despair the pain in hi arm return and he felt weak and old and the sunlight seem thin he wa rous by the touch of bergil hand come master perian said the lad you are still in pain i see i will help you back to the healer but do not fear they will come back the men of mina tirith will never be overcom and now they have the lord elfston and beregond of the guard too ere noon the armi came to osgiliath there all the worker and craftsmen that could be spare were busi some were strengthen the ferri and boatbridg that the enemi had made and in part destroy when they fled some gather store and booti and other on the eastern side across the river were throw up hasti work of defenc the vanguard pass on through the ruin of old gondor and over the wide river and on up the long straight road that in the high day had been made to run from the fair tower of the sun to the tall tower of the moon which now wa mina morgul in it accurs vale five mile beyond osgiliath they halt end their first day march but the horsemen press on and ere even they came to the crossroad and the great ring of tree and all wa silent no sign of ani enemi had they seen no cri or call had been heard no shaft had sped from rock or thicket by the way yet ever as they went forward they felt the watch of the land increas tree and stone blade and leaf were listen the dark had been dispel and far away westward sunset wa on the vale of anduin and the white peak of the mountain blush in the blue air but a shadow and a gloom brood upon the ephel dúath then aragorn set trumpet at each of the four road that ran into the ring of tree and they blew a great fanfar and the herald cri aloud the lord of gondor have return and all thi land that is their they take back the hideou orchead that wa set upon the carven figur wa cast down and broken in piec and the old king head wa rais and set in it place onc more still crown with white and golden flower and men labour to wash and pare away all the foul scrawl that orc had put upon the stone now in their debat some had counsel that mina morgul should first be assail and if they might take it it should be utterli destroy and mayb said imrahil the road that lead thenc to the pass abov will prove an easier way of assault upon the dark lord than hi northern gate but against thi gandalf had spoken urgent becaus of the evil that dwelt in the valley where the mind of live men would turn to mad and horror and becaus also of the news that faramir had brought for if the ringbear had inde attempt that way then abov all they should not draw the eye of mordor thither so the next day when the main host came up they set a strong guard upon the crossroad to make some defenc if mordor should send a forc over the morgul pass or should bring more men up from the south for that guard they chose mostli archer who knew the way of ithilien and would lie hid in the wood and slope about the meet of the way but gandalf and aragorn rode with the vanguard to the entranc of morgul vale and look on the evil citi it wa dark and lifeless for the orc and lesser creatur of mordor that had dwelt there had been destroy in battl and the nazgûl were abroad yet the air of the valley wa heavi with fear and enmiti then they broke the evil bridg and set red flame in the noisom field and depart the day after be the third day sinc they set out from mina tirith the armi began it northward march along the road it wa some hundr mile by that way from the crossroad to the morannon and what might befal them befor they came so far none knew they went openli but heed with mount scout befor them on the road and other on foot upon either side especi on the eastward flank for there lay dark thicket and a tumbl land of rocki ghyll and crag behind which the long grim slope of the ephel dúath clamber up the weather of the world remain fair and the wind held in the west but noth could waft away the gloom and the sad mist that clung about the mountain of shadow and behind them at while great smoke would aris and hover in the upper wind ever and anon gandalf let blow the trumpet and the herald would cri the lord of gondor are come let all leav thi land or yield them up but imrahil said say not the lord of gondor say the king elessar for that is true even though he ha not yet sat upon the throne and it will give the enemi more thought if the herald use that name and thereaft thrice a day the herald proclaim the come of the king elessar but none answer the challeng nonetheless though they march in seem peac the heart of all the armi from the highest to the lowest were downcast and with everi mile that they went north forebod of evil grew heavier on them it wa near the end of the second day of their march from the crossroad that they first met ani offer of battl for a strong forc of orc and easterl attempt to take their lead compani in an ambush and that wa in the veri place where faramir had waylaid the men of harad and the road went in a deep cut through an outthrust of the eastward hill but the captain of the west were well warn by their scout skill men from henneth annûn led by mablung and so the ambush wa itself trap for horsemen went wide about westward and came up on the flank of the enemi and from behind and they were destroy or driven east into the hill but the victori did littl to enhearten the captain it is but a feint said aragorn and it chief purpos i deem wa rather to draw us on by a fals guess of our enemi weak than to do us much hurt yet and from that even onward the nazgûl came and follow everi move of the armi they still flew high and out of sight of all save legola and yet their presenc could be felt as a deepen of shadow and a dim of the sun and though the ringwraith did not yet stoop low upon their foe and were silent utter no cri the dread of them could not be shaken off so time and the hopeless journey wore away upon the fourth day from the crossroad and the sixth from mina tirith they came at last to the end of the live land and began to pass into the desol that lay befor the gate of the pass of cirith gorgor and they could descri the marsh and the desert that stretch north and west to the emyn muil so desol were those place and so deep the horror that lay on them that some of the host were unman and they could neither walk nor ride further north aragorn look at them and there wa piti in hi eye rather than wrath for these were young men from rohan from westfold far away or husbandmen from lossarnach and to them mordor had been from childhood a name of evil and yet unreal a legend that had no part in their simpl life and now they walk like men in a hideou dream made true and they understood not thi war nor whi fate should lead them to such a pass go said aragorn but keep what honour you may and do not run and there is a task which you may attempt and so be not wholli shame take your way southwest till you come to cair andro and if that is still held by enemi as i think then retak it if you can and hold it to the last in defenc of gondor and rohan then some be shame by hi merci overcam their fear and went on and the other took new hope hear of a man deed within their measur that they could turn to and they depart and so sinc mani men had alreadi been left at the crossroad it wa with less than six thousand that the captain of the west came at last to challeng the black gate and the might of mordor they advanc now slowli expect at everi hour some answer to their challeng and they drew togeth sinc it wa but wast of men to send out scout or small parti from the main host at nightfal of the fifth day of the march from morgul vale they made their last camp and set fire about it of such dead wood and heath as they could find they pass the hour of night in wake and they were awar of mani thing halfseen that walk and prowl all about them and they heard the howl of wolv the wind had die and all the air seem still they could see littl for though it wa cloudless and the wax moon wa four night old there were smoke and fume that rose out of the earth and the white crescent wa shroud in the mist of mordor it grew cold as morn came the wind began to stir again but now it came from the north and soon it freshen to a rise breez all the nightwalk were gone and the land seem empti north amid their noisom pit lay the first of the great heap and hill of slag and broken rock and blast earth the vomit of the maggotfolk of mordor but south and now near loom the great rampart of cirith gorgor and the black gate amidmost and the two tower of the teeth tall and dark upon either side for in their last march the captain had turn away from the old road as it bent east and avoid the peril of the lurk hill and so now they were approach the morannon from the northwest even as frodo had done the two vast iron door of the black gate under it frown arch were fast close upon the battlement noth could be seen all wa silent but watch they were come to the last end of their folli and stood forlorn and chill in the grey light of earli day befor tower and wall which their armi could not assault with hope not even if it had brought thither engin of great power and the enemi had no more forc than would suffic for the man of the gate and wall alon yet they knew that all the hill and rock about the morannon were fill with hidden foe and the shadowi defil beyond wa bore and tunnel by teem brood of evil thing and as they stood they saw all the nazgûl gather togeth hover abov the tower of the teeth like vultur and they knew that they were watch but still the enemi made no sign no choic wa left them but to play their part to it end therefor aragorn now set the host in such array as could best be contriv and they were drawn up on two great hill of blast stone and earth that orc had pile in year of labour befor them toward mordor lay like a moat a great mire of reek mud and foulsmel pool when all wa order the captain rode forth toward the black gate with a great guard of horsemen and the banner and herald and trumpet there wa gandalf as chief herald and aragorn with the son of elrond and éomer of rohan and imrahil and legola and gimli and peregrin were bidden to go also so that all the enemi of mordor should have a wit they came within cri of the morannon and unfurl the banner and blew upon their trumpet and the herald stood out and sent their voic up over the battlement of mordor come forth they cri let the lord of the black land come forth justic shall be done upon him for wrong he ha made war upon gondor and wrest it land therefor the king of gondor demand that he should aton for hi evil and depart then for ever come forth there wa a long silenc and from wall and gate no cri or sound wa heard in answer but sauron had alreadi laid hi plan and he had a mind first to play these mice cruelli befor he struck to kill so it wa that even as the captain were about to turn away the silenc wa broken suddenli there came a long roll of great drum like thunder in the mountain and then a bray of horn that shook the veri stone and stun men ear and thereupon the middl door of the black gate wa thrown open with a great clang and out of it there came an embassi from the dark tower at it head there rode a tall and evil shape mount upon a black hors if hors it wa for it wa huge and hideou and it face wa a fright mask more like a skull than a live head and in the socket of it eye and in it nostril there burn a flame the rider wa robe all in black and black wa hi lofti helm yet thi wa no ringwraith but a live man the lieuten of the tower of baraddûr he wa and hi name is rememb in no tale for he himself had forgotten it and he said i am the mouth of sauron but it is told that he wa a renegad who came of the race of those that are name the black númenórean for they establish their dwell in middleearth dure the year of sauron domin and they worship him be enamour of evil knowledg and he enter the servic of the dark tower when it first rose again and becaus of hi cun he grew ever higher in the lord favour and he learn great sorceri and knew much of the mind of sauron and he wa more cruel than ani orc he it wa that now rode out and with him came onli a small compani of blackhar soldieri and a singl banner black but bear on it in red the evil eye now halt a few pace befor the captain of the west he look them up and down and laugh is there anyon in thi rout with author to treat with me he ask or inde with wit to understand me not thou at least he mock turn to aragorn with scorn it need more to make a king than a piec of elvish glass or a rabbl such as thi whi ani brigand of the hill can show as good a follow aragorn said naught in answer but he took the other eye and held it and for a moment they strove thu but soon though aragorn did not stir nor move hand to weapon the other quail and gave back as if menac with a blow i am a herald and ambassador and may not be assail he cri where such law hold said gandalf it is also the custom for ambassador to use less insol but no one ha threaten you you have naught to fear from us until your errand is done but unless your master ha come to new wisdom then with all hi servant you will be in great peril so said the messeng then thou art the spokesman old greybeard have we not heard of thee at while and of thi wander ever hatch plot and mischief at a safe distanc but thi time thou hast stuck out thi nose too far master gandalf and thou shalt see what come to him who set hi foolish web befor the feet of sauron the great i have token that i wa bidden to show to thee – to thee in especi if thou shouldst dare to come he sign to one of hi guard and he came forward bear a bundl swath in black cloth the messeng put these asid and there to the wonder and dismay of all the captain he held up first the short sword that sam had carri and next a grey cloak with an elvenbrooch and last the coat of mithrilmail that frodo had worn wrap in hi tatter garment a black came befor their eye and it seem to them in a moment of silenc that the world stood still but their heart were dead and their last hope gone pippin who stood behind princ imrahil sprang forward with a cri of grief silenc said gandalf sternli thrust him back but the messeng laugh aloud so you have yet anoth of these imp with you he cri what use you find in them i can not guess but to send them as spi into mordor is beyond even your accustom folli still i thank him for it is plain that thi brat at least ha seen these token befor and it would be vain for you to deni them now i do not wish to deni them said gandalf inde i know them all and all their histori and despit your scorn foul mouth of sauron you can not say as much but whi do you bring them here dwarfcoat elfcloak blade of the downfallen west and spi from the littl ratland of the shirenay do not start we know it well – here are the mark of a conspiraci now mayb he that bore these thing wa a creatur that you would not griev to lose and mayb otherwis one dear to you perhap if so take swift counsel with what littl wit is left to you for sauron doe not love spi and what hi fate shall be depend now on your choic no one answer him but he saw their face grey with fear and the horror in their eye and he laugh again for it seem to him that hi sport went well good good he said he wa dear to you i see or els hi errand wa one that you did not wish to fail it ha and now he shall endur the slow torment of year as long and slow as our art in the great tower can contriv and never be releas unless mayb when he is chang and broken so that he may come to you and you shall see what you have done thi shall sure beunless you accept my lord term name the term said gandalf steadili but those nearbi saw the anguish in hi face and now he seem an old and wizen man crush defeat at last they did not doubt that he would accept these are the term said the messeng and smile as he eye them one by one the rabbl of gondor and it delud alli shall withdraw at onc beyond the anduin first take oath never again to assail sauron the great in arm open or secret all land east of anduin shall be sauron for ever sole west of the anduin as far as the misti mountain and the gap of rohan shall be tributari to mordor and men there shall bear no weapon but shall have leav to govern their own affair but they shall help to rebuild isengard which they have wantonli destroy and that shall be sauron and there hi lieuten shall dwell not saruman but one more worthi of trust look in the messeng eye they read hi thought he wa to be that lieuten and gather all that remain of the west under hi sway he would be their tyrant and they hi slave but gandalf said thi is much to demand for the deliveri of one servant that your master should receiv in exchang what he must els fight mani a war to gain or ha the field of gondor destroy hi hope in war so that he fall to haggl and if inde we rate thi prison so high what sureti have we that sauron the base master of treacheri will keep hi part where is thi prison let him be brought forth and yield to us and then we will consid these demand it seem then to gandalf intent watch him as a man engag in fenc with a deadli foe that for the take of a breath the messeng wa at a loss yet swiftli he laugh again do not bandi word in your insol with the mouth of sauron he cri sureti you crave sauron give none if you sue for hi clemenc you must first do hi bid these are hi term take them or leav them these we will take said gandalf suddenli he cast asid hi cloak and a white light shone forth like a sword in that black place befor hi uprais hand the foul messeng recoil and gandalf come seiz and took from him the token coat cloak and sword these we will take in memori of our friend he cri but as for your term we reject them utterli get you gone for your embassi is over and death is near to you we did not come here to wast word in treat with sauron faithless and accurs still less with one of hi slave begon then the messeng of mordor laugh no more hi face wa twist with amaz and anger to the like of some wild beast that as it crouch on it prey is smitten on the muzzl with a sting rod rage fill him and hi mouth slaver and shapeless sound of furi came strangl from hi throat but he look at the fell face of the captain and their deadli eye and fear overcam hi wrath he gave a great cri and turn leap upon hi steed and with hi compani gallop madli back to cirith gorgor but as they went hi soldier blew their horn in signal long arrang and even befor they came to the gate sauron sprang hi trap drum roll and fire leap up the great door of the black gate swung back wide out of it stream a great host as swiftli as swirl water when a sluic is lift the captain mount again and rode back and from the host of mordor there went up a jeer yell dust rose smother the air as from nearbi there march up an armi of easterl that had wait for the signal in the shadow of ere lithui beyond the further tower down from the hill on either side of the morannon pour orc innumer the men of the west were trap and soon all about the grey mound where they stood forc ten time and more than ten time their match would ring them in a sea of enemi sauron had taken the proffer bait in jaw of steel littl time wa left to aragorn for the order of hi battl upon the one hill he stood with gandalf and there fair and desper wa rais the banner of the tree and star upon the other hill hard by stood the banner of rohan and dol amroth white hors and silver swan and about each hill a ring wa made face all way bristl with spear and sword but in the front toward mordor where the first bitter assault would come there stood the son of elrond on the left with the dúnedain about them and on the right the princ imrahil with the men of dol amroth tall and fair and pick men of the tower of guard the wind blew and the trumpet sang and arrow whine but the sun now climb toward the south wa veil in the reek of mordor and through a threaten haze it gleam remot a sullen red as if it were the end of the day or the end mayb of all the world of light and out of the gather mirk the nazgûl came with their cold voic cri word of death and then all hope wa quench pippin had bow crush with horror when he heard gandalf reject the term and doom frodo to the torment of the tower but he had master himself and now he stood besid beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil men for it seem best to him to die soon and leav the bitter stori of hi life sinc all wa in ruin i wish merri wa here he heard himself say and quick thought race through hi mind even as he watch the enemi come charg to the assault well well now at ani rate i understand poor denethor a littl better we might die togeth merri and i and sinc die we must whi not well as he is not here i hope hell find an easier end but now i must do my best he drew hi sword and look at it and the intertwin shape of red and gold and the flow charact of númenor glint like fire upon the blade thi wa made for just such an hour he thought if onli i could smite that foul messeng with it then almost i should draw level with old merri well ill smite some of thi beastli brood befor the end i wish i could see cool sunlight and green grass again then even as he thought these thing the first assault crash into them the orc hinder by the mire that lay befor the hill halt and pour their arrow into the defend rank but through them there came stride up roar like beast a great compani of hilltrol out of gorgoroth taller and broader than men they were and they were clad onli in closefit mesh of horni scale or mayb that wa their hideou hide but they bore round buckler huge and black and wield heavi hammer in their knot hand reckless they sprang into the pool and wade across bellow as they came like a storm they broke upon the line of the men of gondor and beat upon helm and head and arm and shield as smith hew the hot bend iron at pippin side beregond wa stun and overborn and he fell and the great trollchief that smote him down bent over him reach out a clutch claw for these fell creatur would bite the throat of those that they threw down then pippin stab upward and the written blade of westerness pierc through the hide and went deep into the vital of the troll and hi black blood came gush out he toppl forward and came crash down like a fall rock buri those beneath him black and stench and crush pain came upon pippin and hi mind fell away into a great dark so it end as i guess it would hi thought said even as it flutter away and it laugh a littl within him ere it fled almost gay it seem to be cast off at last all doubt and care and fear and then even as it wing away into forget it heard voic and they seem to be cri in some forgotten world far abov the eagl are come the eagl are come for one moment more pippin thought hover bilbo it said but no that came in hi tale long long ago thi is my tale and it is end now goodby and hi thought fled far away and hi eye saw no more chapter the tower of cirith ungol sam rous himself pain from the ground for a moment he wonder where he wa and then all the miseri and despair return to him he wa in the deep dark outsid the underg of the orc stronghold it brazen door were shut he must have fallen stun when he hurl himself against them but how long he had lain there he did not know then he had been on fire desper and furiou now he wa shiver and cold he crept to the door and press hi ear against them far within he could hear faintli the voic of ore clamour but soon they stop or pass out of hear and all wa still hi head ach and hi eye saw phantom light in the dark but he struggl to steadi himself and think it wa clear at ani rate that he had no hope of get into the orchold by that gate he might wait there for day befor it wa open and he could not wait time wa desper preciou he no longer had ani doubt about hi duti he must rescu hi master or perish in the attempt the perish is more like and will be a lot easier anyway he said grimli to himself as he sheath sting and turn from the brazen door slowli he grope hi way back in the dark along the tunnel not dare to use the elvenlight and as he went he tri to fit togeth the event sinc frodo and he had left the crossroad he wonder what the time wa somewher between one day and the next he suppos but even of the day he had quit lost count he wa in a land of dark where the day of the world seem forgotten and where all who enter were forgotten too i wonder if they think of us at all he said and what is happen to them all away there he wave hi hand vagu in the air befor him but he wa in fact now face southward as he came back to shelob tunnel not west out westward in the world it wa draw to noon upon the fourteenth day of march in the shirereckon and even now aragorn wa lead the black fleet from pelargir and merri wa ride with the rohirrim down the stonewain valley while in mina tirith flame were rise and pippin watch the mad grow in the eye of denethor yet amid all their care and fear the thought of their friend turn constantli to frodo and sam they were not forgotten but they were far beyond aid and no thought could yet bring ani help to samwis hamfast son he wa utterli alon he came back at last to the stone door of the orcpassag and still unabl to discov the catch or bolt that held it he scrambl over as befor and drop softli to the ground then he made hi way stealthili to the outlet of shelob tunnel where the rag of her great web were still blow and sway in the cold air for cold they seem to sam after the noisom dark behind but the breath of them reviv him he crept cautious out all wa omin quiet the light wa no more than that of dusk at a dark day end the vast vapour that aros in mordor and went stream westward pass low overhead a great welter of cloud and smoke now lit again beneath with a sullen glow of red sam look up toward the orctow and suddenli from it narrow window light stare out like small red eye he wonder if they were some signal hi fear of the orc forgotten for a while in hi wrath and desper now return as far as he could see there wa onli one possibl cours for him to take he must go on and tri to find the main entranc to the dread tower but hi knee felt weak and he found that he wa trembl draw hi eye down from the tower and the horn of the cleft befor him he forc hi unwil feet to obey him and slowli listen with all hi ear peer into the dens shadow of the rock besid the way he retrac hi step past the place where frodo fell and still the stench of shelob linger and then on and up until he stood again in the veri cleft where he had put on the ring and seen shagrat compani go by there he halt and sat down for the moment he could drive himself no further he felt that if onc he went beyond the crown of the pass and took one step verit down into the land of mordor that step would be irrevoc he could never come back without ani clear purpos he drew out the ring and put it on again immedi he felt the great burden of it weight and felt afresh but now more strong and urgent than ever the malic of the eye of mordor search tri to pierc the shadow that it had made for it own defenc but which now hinder it in it unquiet and doubt as befor sam found that hi hear wa sharpen but that to hi sight the thing of thi world seem thin and vagu the rocki wall of the path were pale as if seen through a mist but still at a distanc he heard the bubbl of shelob in her miseri and harsh and clear and veri close it seem he heard cri and the clash of metal he sprang to hi feet and press himself against the wall besid the road he wa glad of the ring for here wa yet anoth compani of orc on the march or so at first he thought then suddenli he realiz that it wa not so hi hear had deceiv him the orccri came from the tower whose topmost horn wa now right abov him on the left hand of the cleft sam shudder and tri to forc himself to move there wa plainli some devilri go on perhap in spite of all order the cruelti of the orc had master them and they were torment frodo or even savag hack him to piec he listen and as he did a gleam of hope came to him there could not be much doubt there wa fight in the tower the orc must be at war among themselv shagrat and gorbag had come to blow faint as wa the hope that hi guess brought him it wa enough to rous him there might be just a chanc hi love for frodo rose abov all other thought and forget hi peril he cri aloud im come mr frodo he ran forward to the climb path and over it at onc the road turn left and plung steepli down sam had cross into mordor he took off the ring move it may be by some deep premonit of danger though to himself he thought onli that he wish to see more clearli better have a look at the worst he mutter no good blunder about in a fog hard and cruel and bitter wa the land that met hi gaze befor hi feet the highest ridg of the ephel dúath fell steepli in great cliff down into a dark trough on the further side of which there rose anoth ridg much lower it edg notch and jag with crag like fang that stood out black against the red light behind them it wa the grim morgai the inner ring of the fenc of the land far beyond it but almost straight ahead across a wide lake of dark dot with tini fire there wa a great burn glow and from it rose in huge column a swirl smoke dusti red at the root black abov where it merg into the billow canopi that roof in all the accurs land sam wa look at orodruin the mountain of fire ever and anon the furnac far below it ashen cone would grow hot and with a great surg and throb pour forth river of molten rock from chasm in it side some would flow blaze toward baraddûr down great channel some would wind their way into the stoni plain until they cool and lay like twist dragonshap vomit from the torment earth in such an hour of labour sam beheld mount doom and the light of it cut off by the high screen of the ephel dúath from those who climb up the path from the west now glare against the stark rock face so that they seem to be drench with blood in that dread light sam stood aghast for now look to hi left he could see the tower of cirith ungol in all it strength the horn that he had seen from the other side wa onli it topmost turret it eastern face stood up in three great tier from a shelf in the mountainwal far below it back wa to a great cliff behind from which it jut out in point bastion one abov the other diminish as they rose with sheer side of cun masonri that look northeast and southeast about the lowest tier two hundr feet below where sam now stood there wa a battlement wall enclos a narrow court it gate upon the near southeastern side open on a broad road the outer parapet of which ran upon the brink of a precipic until it turn southward and went wind down into the dark to join the road that came over the morgul pass then on it went through a jag rift in the morgai out into the valley of gorgoroth and away to baraddûr the narrow upper way on which sam stood leapt swiftli down by stair and steep path to meet the main road under the frown wall close to the towerg as he gaze at it suddenli sam understood almost with a shock that thi stronghold had been built not to keep enemi out of mordor but to keep them in it wa inde one of the work of gondor long ago an eastern outpost of the defenc of ithilien made when after the last allianc men of westerness kept watch on the evil land of sauron where hi creatur still lurk but as with narchost and carchost the tower of the teeth so here too the vigil had fail and treacheri had yield up the tower to the lord of the ringwraith and now for long year it had been held by evil thing sinc hi return to mordor sauron had found it use for he had few servant but mani slave of fear and still it chief purpos as of old wa to prevent escap from mordor though if an enemi were so rash as to tri to enter that land secretli then it wa also a last unsleep guard against ani that might pass the vigil of morgul and of shelob onli too clearli sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down under those manyey wall and pass the watch gate and even if he did so he could not go far on the guard road beyond not even the black shadow lie deep where the red glow could not reach would shield him long from the nightey orc but desper as that road might be hi task wa now far wors not to avoid the gate and escap but to enter it alon hi thought turn to the ring but there wa no comfort there onli dread and danger no sooner had he come in sight of mount doom burn far away than he wa awar of a chang in hi burden as it drew near the great furnac where in the deep of time it had been shape and forg the ring power grew and it becam more fell untam save by some mighti will as sam stood there even though the ring wa not on him but hang by it chain about hi neck he felt himself enlarg as if he were robe in a huge distort shadow of himself a vast and omin threat halt upon the wall of mordor he felt that he had from now on onli two choic to forbear the ring though it would torment him or to claim it and challeng the power that sat in it dark hold beyond the valley of shadow alreadi the ring tempt him gnaw at hi will and reason wild fantasi aros in hi mind and he saw samwis the strong hero of the age stride with a flame sword across the darken land and armi flock to hi call as he march to the overthrow of baraddûr and then all the cloud roll away and the white sun shone and at hi command the vale of gorgoroth becam a garden of flower and tree and brought forth fruit he had onli to put on the ring and claim it for hi own and all thi could be in that hour of trial it wa the love of hi master that help most to hold him firm but also deep down in him live still unconqu hi plain hobbitsens he knew in the core of hi heart that he wa not larg enough to bear such a burden even if such vision were not a mere cheat to betray him the one small garden of a free garden wa all hi need and due not a garden swollen to a realm hi own hand to use not the hand of other to command and anyway all these notion are onli a trick he said to himself hed spot me and cow me befor i could so much as shout out hed spot me pretti quick if i put the ring on now in mordor well all i can say is thing look as hopeless as a frost in spring just when be invis would be realli use i cant use the ring and if ever i get ani further it go to be noth but a drag and a burden everi step so what to be done he wa not realli in ani doubt he knew that he must go down to the gate and not linger ani more with a shrug of hi shoulder as if to shake off the shadow and dismiss the phantom he began slowli to descend with each step he seem to diminish he had not gone far befor he had shrunk again to a veri small and frighten hobbit he wa now pass under the veri wall of the tower and the cri and sound of fight could be heard with hi unaid ear at the moment the nois seem to be come from the court behind the outer wall sam wa about half way down the path when out of the dark gateway into the red glow there came two orc run they did not turn toward him they were make for the main road but even as they ran they stumbl and fell to the ground and lay still sam had seen no arrow but he guess that the orc had been shot down by other on the battlement or hidden in the shadow of the gate he went on hug the wall on hi left one look upward had shown him that there wa no hope of climb it the stonework rose thirti feet without a crack or ledg to overhang cours like invert step the gate wa the onli way he crept on and as he went he wonder how mani orc live in the tower with shagrat and how mani gorbag had and what they were quarrel about if that wa what wa happen shagrat compani had seem to be about forti and gorbag more than twice as larg but of cours shagrat patrol had onli been a part of hi garrison almost certainli they were quarrel about frodo and the spoil for a second sam halt for suddenli thing seem clear to him almost as if he had seen them with hi eye the mithril coat of cours frodo wa wear it and they would find it and from what sam had heard gorbag would covet it but the order of the dark tower were at present frodo onli protect and if they were set asid frodo might be kill out of hand at ani moment come on you miser sluggard sam cri to himself now for it he drew sting and ran toward the open gate but just as he wa about to pass under it great arch he felt a shock as if he had run into some web like shelob onli invis he could see no obstacl but someth too strong for hi will to overcom bar the way he look about and then within the shadow of the gate he saw the two watcher they were like great figur seat upon throne each had three join bodi and three head face outward and inward and across the gateway the head had vulturefac and on their great knee were laid clawlik hand they seem to be carv out of huge block of stone immov and yet they were awar some dread spirit of evil vigil abod in them they knew an enemi visibl or invis none could pass unheed they would forbid hi entri or hi escap harden hi will sam thrust forward onc again and halt with a jerk stagger as if from a blow upon hi breast and head then greatli dare becaus he could think of noth els to do answer a sudden thought that came to him he drew slowli out the phial of galadriel and held it up it white light quicken swiftli and the shadow under the dark arch fled the monstrou watcher sat there cold and still reveal in all their hideou shape for a moment sam caught a glitter in the black stone of their eye the veri malic of which made him quail but slowli he felt their will waver and crumbl into fear he sprang past them but even as he did so thrust the phial back into hi bosom he wa awar as plainli as if a bar of steel had snap to behind him that their vigil wa renew and from those evil head there came a high shrill cri that echo in the tower wall befor him far up abov like an answer signal a harsh bell clang a singl stroke that done it said sam now ive rung the frontdoor bell well come on somebodi he cri tell captain shagrat that the great elfwarrior ha call with hi elfsword too there wa no answer sam strode forward sting glitter blue in hi hand the courtyard lay in deep shadow but he could see that the pavement wa strewn with bodi right at hi feet were two orcarch with knive stick in their back beyond lay mani more shape some singli as they had been hewn down or shot other in pair still grappl one anoth dead in the veri throe of stab throttl bite the stone were slipperi with dark blood two liveri sam notic one mark by the red eye the other by a moon disfigur with a ghastli face of death but he did not stop to look more close across the court a great door at the foot of the tower stood half open and a red light came through a larg orc lay dead upon the threshold sam sprang over the bodi and went in and then he peer about at a loss a wide and echo passag led back from the door toward the mountainsid it wa dimli lit with torch flare in bracket on the wall but it distant end wa lost in gloom mani door and open could be seen on thi side and that but it wa empti save for two or three more bodi sprawl on the floor from what he had heard of the captain talk sam knew that dead or aliv frodo would most like be found in a chamber high up in the turret far abov but he might search for a day befor he found the way itll be near the back i guess sam mutter the whole tower climb backwardslik and anyway id better follow these light he advanc down the passag but slowli now each step more reluct terror wa begin to grip him again there wa no sound save the rap of hi feet which seem to grow to an echo nois like the slap of great hand upon the stone the dead bodi the empti the dank black wall that in the torchlight seem to drip with blood the fear of sudden death lurk in doorway or shadow and behind all hi mind the wait watch malic at the gate it wa almost more than he could screw himself to face he would have welcom a fightwith not too mani enemi at a time – rather than thi hideou brood uncertainti he forc himself to think of frodo lie bound or in pain or dead somewher in thi dread place he went on he had pass beyond the torchlight almost to a great arch door at the end of the passag the inner side of the under gate as he rightli guess when there came from high abov a dread choke shriek he stop short then he heard feet come someon wa run in great hast down an echo stairway overhead hi will wa too weak and slow to restrain hi hand it drag at the chain and clutch the ring but sam did not put it on for even as he clasp it to hi breast an orc came clatter down leap out of a dark open at the right it ran toward him it wa no more than six pace from him when lift it head it saw him and sam could hear it gasp breath and see the glare in it bloodshot eye it stop short aghast for what it saw wa not a small frighten hobbit tri to hold a steadi sword it saw a great silent shape cloak in a grey shadow loom against the waver light behind in one hand it held a sword the veri light of which wa a bitter pain the other wa clutch at it breast but held conceal some nameless menac of power and doom for a moment the orc crouch and then with a hideou yelp of fear it turn and fled back as it had come never wa ani dog more hearten when it enemi turn tail than sam at thi unexpect flight with a shout he gave chase ye the elfwarrior is loos he cri im come just you show me the way up or ill skin you but the orc wa in it own haunt nimbl and wellf sam wa a stranger hungri and weari the stair were high and steep and wind sam breath began to come in gasp the orc had soon pass out of sight and now onli faintli could be heard the slap of it feet as it went on and up everi now and again it gave a yell and the echo ran along the wall but slowli all sound of it die away sam plod on he felt that he wa on the right road and hi spirit had risen a good deal he thrust the ring away and tighten hi belt well well he said if onli they all take such a dislik to me and my sting thi may turn out better than i hope and anyway it look as if shagrat gorbag and compani have done nearli all my job for me except for that littl frighten rat i do believ there nobodi left aliv in the place and with that he stop brought up hard as if he had hit hi head against the stone wall the full mean of what he had said struck him like a blow nobodi left aliv whose had been that horribl die shriek frodo frodo master he cri half sob if theyv kill you what shall i do well im come at last right to the top to see what i must up up he went it wa dark save for an occasion torch flare at a turn or besid some open that led into the higher level of the tower sam tri to count the step but after two hundr he lost hi reckon he wa move quietli now for he thought that he could hear the sound of voic talk still some way abov more than one rat remain aliv it seem all at onc when he felt that he could pump out no more breath nor forc hi knee to bend again the stair end he stood still the voic were now loud and near sam peer about he had climb right to the flat roof of the third and highest tier of the tower an open space about twenti yard across with a low parapet there the stair wa cover by a small dome chamber in the midst of the roof with low door face east and west eastward sam could see the plain of mordor vast and dark below and the burn mountain far away a fresh turmoil wa surg in it deep well and the river of fire blaze so fierc that even at thi distanc of mani mile the light of them lit the towertop with a red glare westward the view wa block by the base of the great turret that stood at the back of thi upper court and rear it horn high abov the crest of the encircl hill light gleam in a windowslit it door wa not ten yard from where sam stood it wa open but dark and from just within it shadow the voic came at first sam did not listen he took a pace out of the eastward door and look about at onc he saw that up here the fight had been fiercest all the court wa choke with dead orc or their sever and scatter head and limb the place stank of death a snarl follow by a blow and a cri sent him dart back into hide an orcvoic rose in anger and he knew it again at onc harsh brutal cold it wa shagrat speak captain of the tower you wont go again you say curs you snaga you littl maggot if you think im so damag that it

youll bolt and leav me no you wont ill put red maggothol in your belli first out of the turretdoor the smaller orc came fli behind him came shagrat a larg orc with long arm that as he ran crouch reach to the ground but one arm hung limp and seem to be bleed the other hug a larg black bundl in the red glare sam cower behind the stairdoor caught a glimps of hi evil face as it pass it wa score as if by rend claw and smear with blood slaver drip from it protrud fang the mouth snarl like an anim as far as sam could see shagrat hunt snaga round the roof until duck and elud him the smaller orc with a yelp dart back into the turret and disappear then shagrat halt out of the eastward door sam could see him now by the parapet pant hi left claw clench and unclench feebli he put the bundl on the floor and with hi right claw drew out a long red knife and spat on it go to the parapet he lean over look down into the outer court far below twice he shout but no answer came suddenli as shagrat wa stoop over the battlement hi back to the rooftop sam to hi amaz saw that one of the sprawl bodi wa move it wa crawl it put out a claw and clutch the bundl it stagger up in it other hand it held a broadhead spear with a short broken haft it wa pois for a stab thrust but at that veri moment a hiss escap it teeth a gasp of pain or hate quick as a snake shagrat slip asid twist round and drove hi knife into hi enemi throat got you gorbag he cri not quit dead eh well ill finish my job now he sprang on to the fallen bodi and stamp and trampl it in hi furi stoop now and again to stab and slash it with hi knife satisfi at last he threw back hi head and let out a horribl gurgl yell of triumph then he lick hi knife and put it between hi teeth and catch up the bundl he came lope toward the near door of the stair sam had no time to think he might have slip out of the other door but hardli without be seen and he could not have play hideandseek with thi hideou orc for long he did what wa probabl the best thing he could have done he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout he wa no longer hold the ring but it wa there a hidden power a cow menac to the slave of mordor and in hi hand wa sting and it light smote the eye of the orc like the glitter of cruel star in the terribl elfcountri the dream of which wa a cold fear to all hi kind and shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of hi treasur he stop growl bare hi fang then onc more orcfashion he leapt asid and as sam sprang at him use the heavi bundl as both shield and weapon he thrust it hard into hi enemi face sam stagger and befor he could recov shagrat dart past and down the stair sam ran after him curs but he did not go far soon the thought of frodo return to him and he rememb that the other orc had gone back into the turret here wa anoth dread choic and he had no time to ponder it if shagrat got away he would soon get help and come back but if sam pursu him the other orc might do some horribl deed up there and anyway sam might miss shagrat or be kill by him he turn quickli and ran back up the stair wrong again i expect he sigh but it my job to go right up to the top first whatev happen afterward away below shagrat went leap down the stair and out over the court and through the gate bear hi preciou burden if sam could have seen him and known the grief that hi escap would bring he might have quail but now hi mind wa set on the last stage of hi search he came cautious to the turretdoor and step insid it open into dark but soon hi stare eye were awar of a dim light at hi right hand it came from an open that led to anoth stairway dark and narrow it appear to go wind up the turret along the insid of it round outer wall a torch wa glimmer from somewher up abov softli sam began to climb he came to the gutter torch fix abov a door on hi left that face a windowslit look out westward one of the red eye that he and frodo had seen from down below by the tunnel mouth quickli sam pass the door and hurri on to the second storey dread at ani moment to he attack and to feel throttl finger seiz hi throat from behind he came next to a window look east and anoth torch abov the door to a passag through the middl of the turret the door wa open the passag dark save for the glimmer of the torch and the red glare from outsid filter through the windowslit but here the stair stop and climb no further sam crept into the passag on either side there wa a low door both were close and lock there wa no sound at all a dead end mutter sam and after all my climb thi cant be the top of the tower but what can i do now he ran back to the lower storey and tri the door it would not move he ran up again and sweat began to trickl down hi face he felt that even minut were preciou but one by one they escap and he could do noth he care no longer for shagrat or snaga or ani other orc that wa ever spawn he long onli for hi master for one sight of hi face or one touch of hi hand at last weari and feel final defeat he sat on a step below the level of the passagefloor and bow hi head into hi hand it wa quiet horribl quiet the torch that wa alreadi burn low when he arriv sputter and went out and he felt the dark cover him like a tide and then softli to hi own surpris there at the vain end of hi long journey and hi grief move by what thought in hi heart he could not tell sam began to sing hi voic sound thin and quaver in the cold dark tower the voic of a forlorn and weari hobbit that no listen orc could possibl mistak for the clear song of an elvenlord he murmur old childish tune out of the shire and snatch of mr bilbo rhyme that came into hi mind like fleet glimps of the countri of hi home and then suddenli new strength rose in him and hi voic rang out while word of hi own came unbidden to fit the simpl

were long hairi breech of some unclean beastfel and a tunic of dirti leather he drew them on over the tunic went a coat of stout ringmail short for a fullsiz orc too long for frodo and heavi about it he clasp a belt at which there hung a short sheath hold a broadblad stabbingsword sam had brought sever orchelmet one of them fit frodo well enough a black cap with iron rim and iron hoop cover with

shoulder there he said now we match near enough and now we must be off i cant go all the way at a run sam said frodo with a wri smile i hope youv made inquiri about inn along the road or have you forgotten about food and drink save me but so i had said sam he whistl in dismay bless me mr frodo but youv gone and made me that hungri and thirsti i dont know when drop or morsel last pass my lip id forgotten it tri to find you but let me think last time i look id got about enough of that waybread and of what captain faramir gave us to keep me on my leg for a coupl of week at a pinch but if there a drop left in my bottl there no more that not go to be enough for two nohow dont ore eat and dont they drink or do they just live on foul air and poison no they eat and drink sam the shadow that bred them can onli mock it can not make not real new thing of it own i dont think it gave life to the ore it onli ruin them and twist them and if they are to live at all they have to live like other live creatur foul water and foul meat theyll take if they can get no better but not poison theyv fed me and so im better off than you there must be food and water somewher in thi place but there no time to look for them said sam well thing are a bit better than you think said frodo i have had a bit of luck while you were away inde they did not take everyth ive found my foodbag among some rag on the floor theyv rummag it of cours but i guess they dislik the veri look and smell of the lemba wors than gollum did it scatter about and some of it is trampl and broken but ive gather it togeth it not far short of what youv got but theyv taken faramir food and theyv slash up my waterbottl well there no more to be said said sam weve got enough to start on but the water go to be a bad busi but come mr frodo off we go or a whole lake of it wont do us ani good not till youv had a mouth sam said frodo i wont budg here take thi elvencak and drink that last drop in your bottl the whole thing is quit hopeless so it no good worri about tomorrow it probabl wont come at last they start down the ladder they climb and then sam took it and laid it in the passag besid the huddl bodi of the fallen orc the stair wa dark but on the rooftop the glare of the mountain could still be seen though it wa die down now to a sullen red they pick up two shield to complet their disguis and then went on down the great stairway they plod the high chamber of the turret behind where they had met again seem almost home they were out in the open again now and terror ran along the wall all might be dead in the tower of cirith ungol but it wa steep in fear and evil still at length they came to the door upon the outer court and they halt even from where they stood they felt the malic of the watcher beat on them black silent shape on either side of the gate through which the glare of mordor dimli show as they thread their way among the hideou bodi of the ore each step becam more difficult befor they even reach the archway they were brought to a stand to move an inch further wa a pain and weari to will and limb frodo had no strength for such a battl he sank to the ground i cant go on sam he murmur im go to faint i dont know what come over me i do mr frodo hold up now it the gate there some devilri there but i got through and im go to get out it cant be more danger than befor now for it sam drew out the elvenglass of galadriel again as if to do honour to hi hardihood and to grace with splendour hi faith brown hobbithand that had done such deed the phial blaze forth suddenli so that all the shadowi court wa lit with a dazzl radianc like lightn but it remain steadi and did not pass gilthoniel a elbereth sam cri for whi he did not know hi thought sprang back suddenli to the elv in the shire and the song that drove away the black rider in the tree aiya elenion ancalima cri frodo onc again behind him the will of the watcher wa broken with a sudden like the snap of a cord and frodo and sam stumbl forward then they ran through the gate and past the great seat figur with their glitter eye there wa a crack the keyston of the arch crash almost on their heel and the wall abov crumbl and fell in ruin onli by a hair did they escap a bell clang and from the watcher there went up a high and dread wail far up abov in the dark it wa answer out of the black sky there came drop like a bolt a wing shape rend the cloud with a ghastli shriek chapter the land of shadow sam had just wit enough left to thrust the phial back into hi breast run mr frodo he cri no not that way there a sheer drop over the wall follow me down the road from the gate they fled in fifti pace with a swift bend round a jut bastion of the cliff it took them out of sight from the tower they had escap for the moment cower back against the rock they drew breath and then they clutch at their heart perch now on the wall besid the ruin gate the nazgûl sent out it deadli cri all the cliff echo in terror they stumbl on soon the road bent sharpli eastward again and expos them for a dread moment to view from the tower as they flit across they glanc back and saw the great black shape upon the battlement then they plung down between high rockwal in a cut that fell steepli to join the morgulroad they came to the waymeet there wa still no sign of orc nor of an answer to the cri of the nazgûl but they knew that the silenc would not last long at ani moment now the hunt would begin thi wont do sam said frodo if we were real orc we ought to be dash back to the tower not run away the first enemi we meet will know us we must get off thi road somehow but we cant said sam not without wing the eastern face of the ephel dúath were sheer fall in cliff and precipic to the black trough that lay between them and the inner ridg a short way beyond the waymeet after anoth steep inclin a fli bridg of stone leapt over the chasm and bore the road across into the tumbl slope and glen of the morgai with a desper spurt frodo and sam dash along the bridg but they had hardli reach it further end when they heard the hue and cri begin away behind them now high abov on the mountainsid loom the tower of cirith ungol it stone glow dulli suddenli it harsh bell clang again and then broke into a shatter peal horn sound and now from beyond the bridgeend came answer cri down in the dark trough cut off from the die glare of orodruin frodo and sam could not see ahead but alreadi they heard the tramp of ironshod feet and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoof quick sam over we go cri frodo they scrambl on to the low parapet of the bridg fortun there wa no longer ani dread drop into the gulf for the slope of the morgai had alreadi risen almost to the level of the road but it wa too dark for them to guess the depth of the fall well here goe mr frodo said sam goodby he let go frodo follow and even as they fell they heard the rush of horsemen sweep over the bridg and the rattl of orcfeet run up behind but sam would have laugh if he had dare half fear a break plung down on to unseen rock the hobbit land in a drop of no more than a dozen feet with a thud and a crunch into the last thing that they had expect a tangl of thorni bush there sam lay still softli suck a scratch hand when the sound of hoof and foot had pass he ventur a whisper bless me mr frodo but i didnt know as anyth grew in mordor but if i had aknown thi is just what id have look for these thorn must be a foot long by the feel of them theyv stuck through everyth ive got on wish id aput that mailshirt on orcmail doesnt keep these thorn out said frodo not even a leather jerkin is ani good they had a struggl to get out of the thicket the thorn and briar were as tough as wire and as cling as claw their cloak were rent and tatter befor they broke free at last now down we go sam frodo whisper down into the valley quick and then turn northward as soon as ever we can day wa come again in the world outsid and far beyond the gloom of mordor the sun wa climb over the eastern rim of middleearth but here all wa still dark as night the mountain smoulder and it fire went out the glare fade from the cliff the easterli wind that had been blow ever sinc they left ithilien now seem dead slowli and pain they clamber down grope stumbl scrambl among rock and briar and dead wood in the blind shadow down and down until they could go no further at length they stop and sat side by side their back against a boulder both were sweat if shagrat himself wa to offer me a glass of water id shake hi hand said sam dont say such thing said frodo it onli make it wors then he stretch himself out dizzi and weari and he spoke no more for a while at last with a struggl he got up again to hi amaz he found that sam wa asleep wake up sam he said come on it time we made anoth effort sam scrambl to hi feet well i never he said i must have drop off it a long time mr frodo sinc i had a proper sleep and my eye just close down on their own frodo now led the way northward as near as he could guess among the stone and boulder lie thick at the bottom of the great ravin but present he stop again it no good sam he said i cant manag it thi mailshirt i mean not in my present state even my mithrilcoat seem heavi when i wa tire thi is far heavier and what the use of it we shant win through by fight but we may have some to do said sam and there knive and stray arrow that gollum isnt dead for one thing i dont like to think of you with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark look here sam dear lad said frodo i am tire weari i havent a hope left but i have to go on tri to get to the mountain as long as i can move the ring is enough thi extra weight is kill me it must go but dont think im ungrat i hate to think of the foul work you must have had among the bodi to find it for me dont talk about it mr frodo bless you id carri you on my back if i could let it go then frodo laid asid hi cloak and took off the orcmail and flung it away he shiver a littl what i realli need is someth warm he said it gone cold or els ive caught a chill you can have my cloak mr frodo said sam he unslung hi pack and took out the elvencloak how thi mr frodo he said you wrap that orcrag close round you and put the belt outsid it then thi can go over all it dont look quit orcfashion but itll keep you warmer and i daresay itll keep you from harm better than ani other gear it wa made by the ladi frodo took the cloak and fasten the brooch that better he said i feel much lighter i can go on now but thi blind dark seem to be get into my heart as i lay in prison sam i tri to rememb the brandywin and woodi end and the water run through the mill at hobbiton but i cant see them now there now mr frodo it you that talk of water thi time said sam if onli the ladi could see us or hear us id say to her your ladyship all we want is light and water just clean water and plain daylight better than ani jewel beg your pardon but it a long way to lórien sam sigh and wave hi hand toward the height of the ephel dúath now onli to be guess as a deeper black against the black sky they start off again they had not gone far when frodo paus there a black rider over us he said i can feel it we had better keep still for a while crouch under a great boulder they sat face back westward and did not speak for some time then frodo breath a sigh of relief it pass he said they stood up and then they both stare in wonder away to their left southward against a sky that wa turn grey the peak and high ridg of the great rang began to appear dark and black visibl shape light wa grow behind them slowli it crept toward the north there wa battl far abov in the high space of the air the billow cloud of mordor were be driven back their edg tatter as a wind out of the live world came up and swept the fume and smoke toward the dark land of their home under the lift skirt of the dreari canopi dim light leak into mordor like pale morn through the grime window of a prison look at it mr frodo said sam look at it the wind chang someth happen he not have it all hi own way hi dark is break up out in the world there i wish i could see what is go on it wa the morn of the fifteenth of march and over the vale of anduin the sun wa rise abov the eastern shadow and the southwest wind wa blow théoden lay die on the pelennor field as frodo and sam stood and gaze the rim of light spread all along the line of the ephel dúath and then they saw a shape move at a great speed out of the west at first onli a black speck against the glimmer strip abov the mountaintop but grow until it plung like a bolt into the dark canopi and pass high abov them as it went it sent out a long shrill cri the voic of a nazgûl but thi cri no longer held ani terror for them it wa a cri of woe and dismay ill tide for the dark tower the lord of the ringwraith had met hi doom what did i tell you someth happen cri sam the war go well said shagrat but gorbag he wasnt so sure and he wa right there too thing are look up mr frodo havent you got some hope now well no not much sam frodo sigh that away beyond the mountain were go east not west and im so tire and the ring is so heavi sam and i begin to see it in my mind all the time like a great wheel of fire sam quick spirit sank again at onc he look at hi master anxious and he took hi hand come mr frodo he said ive got one thing i want a bit of light enough to help us and yet i guess it danger too tri a bit further and then well lie close and have a rest but take a morsel to eat now a bit of the elv food it may hearten you share a wafer of lemba and munch it as best they could with their parch mouth frodo and sam plod on the light though no more than a grey dusk wa now enough for them to see that they were deep in the valley between the mountain it slope up gentli northward and at it bottom went the bed of a now dri and wither stream beyond it stoni cours they saw a beaten path that wound it way under the feet of the westward cliff had they known they could have reach it quicker for it wa a track that left the main morgulroad at the western bridgeend and went down by a long stair cut in the rock to the valley bottom it wa use by patrol or by messeng go swiftli to lesser post and stronghold northaway between cirith ungol and the narrow of isenmouth the iron jaw of carach angren it wa peril for the hobbit to use such a path but they need speed and frodo felt that he could not face the toil of scrambl among the boulder or in the trackless glen of the morgai and he judg that northward wa mayb the way that their hunter would least expect them to take the road east to the plain or the pass back westward those they would first search most thoroughli onli when he wa well north of the tower did he mean to turn and seek for some way to take him east east on the last desper stage of hi journey so now they cross the stoni bed and took to the orcpath and for some time they march along it the cliff at their left were overhung and they could not be seen from abov but the path made mani bend and at each bend they grip their swordhilt and went forward cautious the light grew no stronger for orodruin wa still belch forth a great fume that beaten upward by the oppos air mount higher and higher until it reach a region abov the wind and spread in an immeasur roof whose central pillar rose out of the shadow beyond their view they had trudg for more than an hour when they heard a sound that brought them to a halt unbeliev but unmistak water trickl out of a gulli on the left so sharp and narrow that it look as if the black cliff had been cloven by some huge axe water came drip down the last remain mayb of some sweet rain gather from sunlit sea but illfat to fall at last upon the wall of the black land and wander fruitless down into the dust here it came out of the rock in a littl fall streamlet and flow across the path and turn south ran away swiftli to be lost among the dead stone sam sprang toward it if ever i see the ladi again i will tell her he cri light and now water then he stop let me drink first mr frodo he said all right but there room enough for two i didnt mean that said sam i mean if it poison or someth that will show it bad quick well better me than you master if you understand me i do but i think well trust our luck togeth sam or our bless still be care now if it veri cold the water wa cool but not ici and it had an unpleas tast at onc bitter and oili or so they would have said at home here it seem beyond all prais and beyond fear or prudenc they drank their fill and sam replenish hi waterbottl after that frodo felt easier and they went on for sever mile until the broaden of the road and the begin of a rough wall along it edg warn them that they were draw near to anoth orchold thi is where we turn asid sam said frodo and we must turn east he sigh as he look at the gloomi ridg across the valley i have just about enough strength left to find some hole away up there and then i must rest a littl the riverb wa now some way below the path they scrambl down to it and began to cross it to their surpris they came upon dark pool fed by thread of water trickl down from some sourc higher up the valley upon it outer marg under the westward mountain mordor wa a die land but it wa not yet dead and here thing still grew harsh twist bitter struggl for life in the glen of the morgai on the other side of the valley low scrubbi tree lurk and clung coars grey grasstussock fought with the stone and wither moss crawl on them and everywher great writh tangl brambl sprawl some had long stab thorn some hook barb that rent like knive the sullen shrivel leav of a past year hung on them grate and rattl in the sad air but their maggotridden bud were onli just open fli dun or grey or black mark like ore with a red eyeshap blotch buzz and stung and abov the briarthicket cloud of hungri midg danc and reel orcgear no good said sam wave hi arm i wish id got an orc hide at last frodo could go no further they had climb up a narrow shelv ravin but they still had a long way to go befor they could even come in sight of the last craggi ridg i must rest now sam and sleep if i can said frodo he look about but there seem nowher even for an anim to crawl into in thi dismal countri at length tire out they slunk under a curtain of brambl that hung down like a mat over a low rockfac there they sat and made such a meal as they could keep back the preciou lemba for the evil day ahead they ate the half of what remain in sam bag of faramir provis some dri fruit and a small slip of cure meat and they sip some water they had drunk again from the pool in the valley but they were veri thirsti again there wa a bitter tang in the air of mordor that dri the mouth when sam thought of water even hi hope spirit quail beyond the morgai there wa the dread plain of gorgoroth to cross now you go to sleep first mr frodo he said it get dark again i reckon thi day is nearli over frodo sigh and wa asleep almost befor the word were spoken sam struggl with hi own weari and he took frodo hand and there he sat silent till deep night fell then at last to keep himself awak he crawl from the hidingplac and look out the land seem full of creak and crack and sli nois but there wa no sound of voic or of foot far abov the ephel dúath in the west the nightski wa still dim and pale there peep among the cloudwrack abov a dark tor high up in the mountain sam saw a white star twinkl for a while the beauti of it smote hi heart as he look up out of the forsaken land and hope return to him for like a shaft clear and cold the thought pierc him that in the end the shadow wa onli a small and pass thing there wa light and high beauti for ever beyond it reach hi song in the tower had been defianc rather than hope for then he wa think of himself now for a moment hi own fate and even hi master ceas to troubl him he crawl back into the brambl and laid himself by frodo side and put away all fear he cast himself into a deep untroubl sleep they woke togeth hand in hand sam wa almost fresh readi for anoth day but frodo sigh hi sleep had been uneasi full of dream of fire and wake brought him no comfort still hi sleep had not been without all heal virtu he wa stronger more abl to bear hi burden one stage further they did not know the time nor how long they had slept but after a morsel of food and a sip of water they went on up the ravin until it end in a sharp slope of scree and slide stone there the last live thing gave up their struggl the top of the morgai were grassless bare jag barren as a slate after much wander and search they found a way that they could climb and with a last hundr feet of claw scrambl they were up they came to a cleft between two dark crag and pass through found themselv on the veri edg of the last fenc of mordor below them at the bottom of a fall of some fifteen hundr feet lay the inner plain stretch away into a formless gloom beyond their sight the wind of the world blew now from the west and the great cloud were lift high float away eastward but still onli a grey light came to the dreari field of gorgoroth there smoke trail on the ground and lurk in hollow and fume leak from fissur in the earth still far away forti mile at least they saw mount doom it feet found in ashen ruin it huge cone rise to a great height where it reek head wa swath in cloud it fire were now dim and it stood in smoulder slumber as threaten and danger as a sleep beast behind it there hung a vast shadow omin as a thundercloud the veil of baraddûr that wa rear far way upon a long spur of the ashen mountain thrust down from the north the dark power wa deep in thought and the eye turn inward ponder tide of doubt and danger a bright sword and a stern and kingli face it saw and for a while it gave littl thought to other thing and all it great stronghold gate on gate and tower on tower wa wrap in a brood gloom frodo and sam gaze out in mingl loath and wonder on thi hate land between them and the smoke mountain and about it north and south all seem ruinou and dead a desert burn and choke they wonder how the lord of thi realm maintain and fed hi slave and hi armi yet armi he had as far as their eye could reach along the skirt of the morgai and away southward there were camp some of tent some order like small town one of the largest of these wa right below them bare a mile out into the plain it cluster like some huge nest of insect with straight dreari street of hut and long low drab build about it the ground wa busi with folk go to and fro a wide road ran from it southeast to join the morgulway and along it mani line of small black shape were hurri i dont like the look of thing at all said sam pretti hopeless i call it – save that where there such a lot of folk there must be well or water not to mention food and these are men not orc or my eye are all wrong neither he nor frodo knew anyth of the great slavework field away south in thi wide realm beyond the fume of the mountain by the dark sad water of lake núrnen nor of the great road that ran away east and south to tributari land from which the soldier of the tower brought long waggontrain of good and booti and fresh slave here in the northward region were the mine and forg and the muster of longplan war and here the dark power move it armi like piec on the board wa gather them togeth it first move the first feeler of it strength had been check upon it western line southward and northward for the moment it withdrew them and brought up new forc mass them about cirith gorgor for an aveng stroke and if it had also been it purpos to defend the mountain against all approach it could scarc have done more well sam went on whatev they have to eat and drink we cant get it there no way down that i can see and we couldnt cross all that open countri crawl with enemi even if we did get down still we shall have to tri said frodo it no wors than i expect i never hope to get across i cant see ani hope of it now but ive still got to do the best i can at present that is to avoid be captur as long as possibl so we must still go northward i think and see what it is like where the open plain is narrow i guess what itll be like said sam where it narrow the orc and men will just be pack closer youll see mr frodo i dare say i shall if we ever get so far said frodo and turn away they soon found that it wa imposs to make their way along the crest of the morgai or anywher along it higher level pathless as they were and score with deep ghyll in the end they were forc to go back down the ravin that they had climb and seek for a way along the valley it wa rough go for they dare not cross over to the path on the westward side after a mile or more they saw huddl in a hollow at the cliff foot the orchold that they had guess wa near at hand a wall and a cluster of stone hut set about the dark mouth of a cave there wa no movement to be seen but the hobbit crept by cautious keep as much as they could to the thornbrak that grew thickli at thi point along both side of the old watercours they went two or three mile further and the orchold wa hidden from sight behind them but they had hardli begun to breath more freeli again when harsh and loud they heard orcvoic quickli they slunk out of sight behind a brown and stunt bush the voic drew nearer present two orc came into view one wa clad in rag brown and wa arm with a bow of horn it wa of a small breed blackskin with wide and snuffl nostril evid a tracker of some kind the other wa a big fightingorc like those of shagrat compani bear the token of the eye he also had a bow at hi back and carri a short broadhead spear as usual they were quarrel and be of differ breed they use the common speech after their fashion hardli twenti pace from where the hobbit lurk the small orc stop nar it snarl im go home it point across the valley to the orchold no good wear my nose out on stone ani more there not a trace left i say ive lost the scent through give way to you it went up into the hill not along the valley i tell you not much use are you you littl snuffler said the big orc i reckon eye are better than your snotti nose then what have you seen with them snarl the other garn you dont even know what your look for whose blame that said the soldier not mine that come from higher up first they say it a great elf in bright armour then it a sort of small dwarfman then it must be a pack of rebel urukhai or mayb it all the lot togeth ar said the tracker theyv lost their head that what it is and some of the boss are go to lose their skin too i guess if what i hear is true tower raid and all and hundr of your lad done in and prison got away if that the way you fighter go on small wonder there bad news from the battl who say there bad news shout the soldier ar who say there isnt that curs rebeltalk and ill stick you if you dont shut it down see all right all right said the tracker ill say no more and go on think but what the black sneak got to do with it all that gobbler with the flap hand i dont know noth mayb but he up to no good nose around ill wager curs him no sooner had he slip us and run off than word came he want aliv want quick well i hope they get him and put him through it growl the tracker he mess up the scent back there pinch that castoff mailshirt that he found and paddl all round the place befor i could get there it save hi life anyhow said the soldier whi befor i knew he wa want i shot him as neat as neat at fifti pace right in the back but he ran on garn you miss him said the tracker first you shoot wild then you run too slow and then you send for the poor tracker ive had enough of you he lope off you come back shout the soldier or ill report you who to not to your preciou shagrat he wont be captain ani more ill give your name and number to the nazgûl said the soldier lower hi voic to a hiss one of them in charg at the tower now the other halt and hi voic wa full of fear and rage you curs peach sneakthief he yell you cant do your job and you cant even stick by your own folk go to your filthi shrieker and may they freez the flesh off you if the enemi doesnt get them first theyv done in number one ive heard and i hope it true the big orc spear in hand leapt after him but the tracker spring behind a stone put an arrow in hi eye as he ran up and he fell with a crash the other ran off across the valley and disappear for a while the hobbit sat in silenc at length sam stir well i call that neat as neat he said if thi nice friendli would spread about in mordor half our troubl would be over quietli sam frodo whisper there may be other about we have evid had a veri narrow escap and the hunt wa hotter on our track than we guess but that is the spirit of mordor sam and it ha spread to everi corner of it orc have alway behav like that or so all tale say when they are on their own but you cant get much hope out of it they hate us far more altogeth and all the time if those two had seen us they would have drop all their quarrel until we were dead there wa anoth long silenc sam broke it again but with a whisper thi time did you hear what they said about that gobbler mr frodo i told you gollum wasnt dead yet didnt i ye i rememb and i wonder how you knew said frodo well come now i think we had better not move out from here again until it ha gone quit dark so you shall tell me how you know and all about what happen if you can do it quietli ill tri said sam but when i think of that stinker i get so hot i could shout there the hobbit sat under the cover of the thorni bush while the drear light of mordor fade slowli into a deep and starless night and sam spoke into frodo ear all that he could find word for of gollum treacher attack the horror of shelob and hi own adventur with the orc when he had finish frodo said noth but took sam hand and press it at length he stir well i suppos we must be go on again he said i wonder how long it will be befor we realli are caught and all the toil and the slink will be over and in vain he stood up it dark and we can not use the ladi glass keep it safe for me sam i have nowher to keep it now except in my hand and i shall need both hand in the blind night but sting i give to you i have got an orcblad but i do not think it will be my part to strike ani blow again it wa difficult and danger move in the night in the pathless land but slowli and with much stumbl the two hobbit toil on hour by hour northward along the eastern edg of the stoni valley when a grey light crept back over the western height long after day had open in the land beyond they went into hide again and slept a littl turn by turn in hi time of wake sam wa busi with thought of food at last when frodo rous himself and spoke of eat and make readi for yet anoth effort he ask the question that wa troubl him most beg your pardon mr frodo he said but have you ani notion how far there is still to go no not ani clear notion sam frodo answer in rivendel befor i set out i wa shown a map of mordor that wa made befor the enemi came back here but i onli rememb it vagu i rememb clearest that there wa a place in the north where the western rang and the northern rang send out spur that nearli meet that must be twenti leagu at least from the bridg back by the tower it might be a good point at which to cross but of cours if we get there we shall be further than we were from the mountain sixti mile from it i should think i guess that we have gone about twelv leagu north from the bridg now even if all goe well i could hardli reach the mountain in a week i am afraid sam that the burden will get veri heavi and i shall go still slower as we get nearer sam sigh that just as i fear he said well to say noth of water weve got to eat less mr frodo or els move a bit quicker at ani rate while were still in thi valley one more bite and all the food end save the elv waybread ill tri and be a bit quicker sam said frodo draw a deep breath come on then let start anoth march it wa not yet quit dark again they plod along on into the night the hour pass in a weari stumbl trudg with a few brief halt at the first hint of grey light under the skirt of the canopi of shadow they hid themselv again in a dark hollow under an overhang stone slowli the light grew until it wa clearer than it yet had been a strong wind from the west wa now drive the fume of mordor from the upper air befor long the hobbit could make out the shape of the land for some mile about them the trough between the mountain and the morgai had steadili dwindl as it climb upward and the inner ridg wa now no more than a shelf in the steep face of the ephel dúath but to the east it fell as sheerli as ever down into gorgoroth ahead the watercours came to an end in broken step of rock for out from the main rang there sprang a high barren spur thrust eastward like a wall to meet it there stretch out from the grey and misti northern rang of ere lithui a long jut arm and between the end there wa a narrow gap carach angren the isenmouth beyond which lay the deep dale of udûn in that dale behind the morannon were the tunnel and deep armouri that the servant of mordor had made for the defenc of the black gate of their land and there now their lord wa gather in hast great forc to meet the onslaught of the captain of the west upon the outthrust spur fort and tower were built and watchfir burn and all across the gap an earthwal had been rais and a deep trench delv that could be cross onli by a singl bridg a few mile north high up in the angl where the western spur branch away from the main rang stood the old castl of durthang now one of the mani orchold that cluster about the dale of udûn a road alreadi visibl in the grow light came wind down from it until onli a mile or two from where the hobbit lay it turn east and ran along a shelf cut in the side of the spur and so went down into the plain and on to the isenmouth to the hobbit as they look out it seem that all their journey north had been useless the plain to their right wa dim and smoki and they could see there neither camp nor troop move but all that region wa under the vigil of the fort of carach angren we have come to a dead end sam said frodo if we go on we shall onli come up to that orctow but the onli road to take is that road that come down from it – unless we go back we cant climb up westward or climb down eastward then we must take the road mr frodo said sam we must take it and chanc our luck if there is ani luck in mordor we might as well give ourselv up as wander about ani more or tri to go back our food wont last weve got to make a dash for it all right sam said frodo lead me as long as youv got ani hope left mine is gone but i cant dash sam ill just plod along after you befor you start ani more plod you need sleep and food mr frodo come and take what you can get of them he gave frodo water and an addit wafer of the waybread and he made a pillow of hi cloak for hi master head frodo wa too weari to debat the matter and sam did not tell him that he had drunk the last drop of their water and eaten sam share of the food as well as hi own when frodo wa asleep sam bent over him and listen to hi breath and scan hi face it wa line and thin and yet in sleep it look content and unafraid well here goe master sam mutter to himself ill have to leav you for a bit and trust to luck water we must have or well get no further sam crept out and flit from stone to stone with more than hobbitcar he went down to the watercours and then follow it for some way as it climb north until he came to the rockstep where long ago no doubt it spring had come gush down in a littl waterfal all now seem dri and silent but refus to despair sam stoop and listen and to hi delight he caught the sound of trickl clamber a few step up he found a tini stream of dark water that came out from the hillsid and fill a littl bare pool from which again it spill and vanish then under the barren stone sam tast the water and it seem good enough then he drank deepli refil the bottl and turn to go back at that moment he caught a glimps of a black form or shadow flit among the rock away near frodo hidingplac bite back a cri he leapt down from the spring and ran jump from stone to stone it wa a wari creatur difficult to see but sam had littl doubt about it he long to get hi hand on it neck but it heard him come and slip quickli away sam thought he saw a last fleet glimps of it peer back over the edg of the eastward precipic befor it duck and disappear well luck did not let me down mutter sam but that wa a near thing isnt it enough to have orc by the thousand without that stink villain come nose round i wish he had been shot he sat down by frodo and did not rous him but he did not dare to go to sleep himself at last when he felt hi eye close and knew that hi struggl to keep awak could not go on much longer he waken frodo gentli that gollum about again im afraid mr frodo he said leastway if it wasnt him then there two of him i went away to find some water and spi him nose round just as i turn back i reckon it isnt safe for us both to sleep togeth and beg your pardon but i cant hold up my lid much longer bless you sam said frodo lie down and take your proper turn but id rather have gollum than orc at ani rate he wont give us away to them – not unless he caught himself but he might do a bit of robberi and murder on hi own growl sam keep your eye open mr frodo there a bottl full of water drink up we can fill it again when we go on with that sam plung into sleep light wa fade when he woke frodo sat prop against the rock behind but he had fallen asleep the waterbottl wa empti there wa no sign of gollum mordordark had return and the watchfir on the height burn fierc and red when the hobbit set out again on the most danger stage of all their journey they went first to the littl spring and then climb warili up they came to the road at the point where it swung east toward the isenmouth twenti mile away it wa not a broad road and it had no wall or parapet along the edg and as it ran on the sheer drop from it brink becam deeper and deeper the hobbit could hear no movement and after listen for a while they set off eastward at a steadi pace after do some twelv mile they halt a short way back the road had bent a littl northward and the stretch that they had pass over wa now screen from sight thi prove disastr they rest for some minut and then went on but they had not taken mani step when suddenli in the still of the night they heard the sound that all along they had secretli dread the nois of march feet it wa still some way behind them but look back they could see the twinkl of torch come round the bend less than a mile away and they were move fast too fast for frodo to escap by flight along the road ahead i fear it sam said frodo weve trust to luck and it ha fail us were trap he look wildli up at the frown wall where the roadbuild of old had cut the rock sheer for mani fathom abov their head he ran to the other side and look over the brink into a dark pit of gloom were trap at last he said he sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and bow hi head seem so said sam well we can but wait and see and with that he sat down besid frodo under the shadow of the cliff they did not have to wait long the orc were go at a great pace those in the foremost file bore torch on they came red flame in the dark swiftli grow now sam too bow hi head hope that it would hide hi face when the torch reach them and he set their shield befor their knee to hide their feet if onli they are in a hurri and will let a coupl of tire soldier alon and pass on he thought and so it seem that they would the lead orc came lope along pant hold their head down they were a gang of the smaller breed be driven unwil to their dark lord war all they care for wa to get the march over and escap the whip besid them run up and down the line went two of the larg fierc uruk crack lash and shout file after file pass and the telltal torchlight wa alreadi some way ahead sam held hi breath now more than half the line had gone by then suddenli one of the slavedriv spi the two figur by the roadsid he flick a whip at them and yell hi you get up they did not answer and with a shout he halt the whole compani come on you slug he cri thi is no time for slouch he took a step toward them and even in the gloom he recogn the devic on their shield desert eh he snarl or think of it all your folk should have been insid udûn befor yesterday even you know that up you get and fall in or ill have your number and report you they struggl to their feet and keep bent limp like footsor soldier they shuffl back toward the rear of the line no not at the rear the slavedriv shout three file up and stay there or youll know it when i come down the line he sent hi long whiplash crack over their head then with anoth crack and a yell he start the compani off again at a brisk trot it wa hard enough for poor sam tire as he wa but for frodo it wa a torment and soon a nightmar he set hi teeth and tri to stop hi mind from think and he struggl on the stench of the sweat orc about him wa stifl and he began to gasp with thirst on on they went and he bent all hi will to draw hi breath and to make hi leg keep go and yet to what evil end he toil and endur he did not dare to think there wa no hope of fall out unseen now and again the orcdriv fell back and jeer at them there now he laugh flick at their leg where there a whip there a will my slug hold up id give you a nice freshen now onli youll get as much lash as your skin will carri when you come in late to your camp do you good dont you know were at war they had gone some mile and the road wa at last run down a long slope into the plain when frodo strength began to give out and hi will waver he lurch and stumbl desper sam tri to help him and hold him up though he felt that he could himself hardli stay the pace much longer at ani moment now he knew that the end would come hi master would faint or fall and all would be discov and their bitter effort be in vain ill have that big slavedriv devil anyway he thought then just as he wa put hi hand to the hilt of hi sword there came an unexpect relief they were out on the plain now and draw near the entranc to udûn some way in front of it befor the gate at the bridgeend the road from the west converg with other come from the south and from baraddûr along all the road troop were move for the captain of the west were advanc and the dark lord wa speed hi forc north so it chanc that sever compani came togeth at the roadmeet in the dark beyond the light of the watchfir on the wall at onc there wa great jostl and curs as each troop tri to get first to the gate and the end of their march though the driver yell and pli their whip scuffl broke out and some blade were drawn a troop of heavyarm uruk from baraddûr charg into the durthang line and threw them into confus daze as he wa with pain and weari sam woke up grasp quickli at hi chanc and threw himself to the ground drag frodo down with him orc fell over them snarl and curs slowli on hand and knee the hobbit crawl away out of the turmoil until at last unnot they drop over the further edg of the road it had a high kerb by which trooplead could guid themselv in black night or fog and it wa bank up some feet abov the level of the open land they lay still for a while it wa too dark to seek for cover if inde there wa ani to find but sam felt that they ought at least to get further away from the highway and out of the rang of torchlight come on mr frodo he whisper one more crawl and then you can lie still with a last despair effort frodo rais himself on hi hand and struggl on for mayb twenti yard then he pitch down into a shallow pit that open unexpectedli befor them and there he lay like a dead thing chapter mount doom sam put hi rag orccloak under hi master head and cover them both with the grey robe of lórien and as he did so hi thought went out to that fair land and to the elv and he hope that the cloth woven by their hand might have some virtu to keep them hidden beyond all hope in thi wilder of fear he heard the scuffl and cri die down as the troop pass on through the isenmouth it seem that in the confus and the mingl of mani compani of variou kind they had not been miss not yet at ani rate sam took a sip of water but press frodo to drink and when hi master had recov a littl he gave him a whole wafer of their preciou waybread and made him eat it then too worn out even to feel much fear they stretch themselv out they slept a littl in uneasi fit for their sweat grew chill on them and the hard stone bit them and they shiver out of the north from the black gate through cirith gorgor there flow whisper along the ground a thin cold air in the morn a grey light came again for in the high region the west wind still blew but down on the stone behind the fenc of the black land the air seem almost dead chill and yet stifl sam look up out of the hollow the land all about wa dreari flat and drabhu on the road nearbi noth wa move now but sam fear the watch eye on the wall of the isenmouth no more than a furlong away northward southeastward far off like a dark stand shadow loom the mountain smoke were pour from it and while those that rose into the upper air trail away eastward great roll cloud float down it side and spread over the land a few mile to the northeast the foothil of the ashen mountain stood like sombr grey ghost behind which the misti northern height rose like a line of distant cloud hardli darker than the lower sky sam tri to guess the distanc and to decid what way they ought to take it look everi step of fifti mile he mutter gloomili stare at the threaten mountain and thatll take a week if it take a day with mr frodo as he is he shook hi head and as he work thing out slowli a new dark thought grew in hi mind never for long had hope die in hi staunch heart and alway until now he had taken some thought for their return but the bitter truth came home to him at last at best their provis would take them to their goal and when the task wa done there they would come to an end alon houseless foodless in the midst of a terribl desert there could be no return so that wa the job i felt i had to do when i start thought sam to help mr frodo to the last step and then die with him well if that is the job then i must do it but i would dearli like to see bywat again and rosi cotton and her brother and the gaffer and marigold and all i cant think somehow that gandalf would have sent mr frodo on thi errand if there hadnt a been ani hope of hi ever come back at all thing all went wrong when he went down in moria i wish he hadnt he would have done someth but even as hope die in sam or seem to die it wa turn to a new strength sam plain hobbitfac grew stern almost grim as the will harden in him and he felt through all hi limb a thrill as if he wa turn into some creatur of stone and steel that neither despair nor weari nor endless barren mile could subdu with a new sens of respons he brought hi eye back to the ground near at hand studi the next move as the light grew a littl he saw to hi surpris that what from a distanc had seem wide and featureless flat were in fact all broken and tumbl inde the whole surfac of the plain of gorgoroth wa pock with great hole as if while it wa still a wast of soft mud it had been smitten with a shower of bolt and huge slingston the largest of these hole were rim with ridg of broken rock and broad fissur ran out from them in all direct it wa a land in which it would be possibl to creep from hide to hide unseen by all but the most watch eye possibl at least for one who wa strong and had no need for speed for the hungri and worn who had far to go befor life fail it had an evil look think of all these thing sam went back to hi master he had no need to rous him frodo wa lie on hi back with eye open stare at the cloudi sky well mr frodo said sam ive been have a look round and think a bit there noth on the road and wed best be get away while there a chanc can you manag it i can manag it said frodo i must onc more they start crawl from hollow to hollow flit behind such cover as they could find but move alway in a slant toward the foothil of the northern rang but as they went the most easterli of the road follow them until it ran off hug the skirt of the mountain away into a wall of black shadow far ahead neither man nor orc now move along it flat grey stretch for the dark lord had almost complet the movement of hi forc and even in the fast of hi own realm he sought the secreci of night fear the wind of the world that had turn against him tear asid hi veil and troubl with tide of bold spi that had pass through hi fenc the hobbit had gone a few weari mile when they halt frodo seem nearli spent sam saw that he could not go much further in thi fashion crawl stoop now pick a doubt way veri slowli now hurri at a stumbl run im go back on to the road while the light last mr frodo he said trust to luck again it nearli fail us last time but it didnt quit a steadi pace for a few more mile and then a rest he wa take a far greater risk than he knew but frodo wa too much occupi with hi burden and with the struggl in hi mind to debat and almost too hopeless to care they climb on to the causeway and trudg along down the hard cruel road that led to the dark tower itself but their luck held and for the rest of that day they met no live or move thing and when night fell they vanish into the dark of mordor all the land now brood as at the come of a great storm for the captain of the west had pass the crossroad and set flame in the deadli field of imlad morgul so the desper journey went on as the ring went south and the banner of the king rode north for the hobbit each day each mile wa more bitter than the one befor as their strength lessen and the land becam more evil they met no enemi by day at time by night as they cower or drows uneasili in some hide besid the road they heard cri and the nois of mani feet or the swift pass of some cruelli ridden steed but far wors than all such peril wa the everapproach threat that beat upon them as they went the dread menac of the power that wait brood in deep thought and sleepless malic behind the dark veil about it throne nearer and nearer it drew loom blacker like the oncom of a wall of night at the last end of the world there came at last a dread nightfal and even as the captain of the west drew near to the end of the live land the two wander came to an hour of blank despair four day had pass sinc they had escap from the orc but the time lay behind them like an everdarken dream all thi last day frodo had not spoken but had walk halfbow often stumbl as if hi eye no longer saw the way befor hi feet sam guess that among all their pain he bore the worst the grow weight of the ring a burden on the bodi and a torment to hi mind anxious sam had note how hi master left hand would often be rais as if to ward on a blow or to screen hi shrink eye from a dread eye that sought to look in them and sometim hi right hand would creep to hi breast clutch and then slowli as the will recov masteri it would be withdrawn now as the black of night return frodo sat hi head between hi knee hi arm hang wearili to the ground where hi hand lay feebli twitch sam watch him till night cover them both and hid them from one anoth he could no longer find ani word to say and he turn to hi own dark thought as for himself though weari and under a shadow of fear he still had some strength left the lemba had a virtu without which they would long ago have lain down to die it did not satisfi desir and at time sam mind wa fill with the memori of food and the long for simpl bread and meat and yet thi waybread of the elv had a potenc that increas as travel reli on it alon and did not mingl it with other food it fed the will and it gave strength to endur and to master sinew and limb beyond the measur of mortal kind but now a new decis must be made they could not follow thi road ani longer for it went on eastward into the great shadow but the mountain now loom upon their right almost due south and they must turn toward it yet still befor it there stretch a wide region of fume barren ashridden land water water mutter sam he had stint himself and in hi parch mouth hi tongu seem thick and swollen but for all hi care they now had veri littl left perhap half hi bottl and mayb there were still day to go all would long ago have been spent if they had not dare to follow the orcroad for at long interv on that highway cistern had been built for the use of troop sent in hast through the waterless region in one sam had found some water left stale muddi by the orc but still suffici for their desper case yet that wa now a day ago there wa no hope of ani more at last weari with hi care sam drows leav the morrow till it came he could do no more dream and wake mingl uneasili he saw light like gloat ye and dark creep shape and he heard nois as of wild beast or the dread cri of tortur thing and he would start up to find the world all dark and onli empti black all about him onc onli as he stood and stare wildli round did it seem that though now awak he could still see pale light like eye but soon they flicker and vanish the hate night pass slowli and reluctantli such daylight as follow wa dim for here as the mountain drew near the air wa ever mirki while out from the dark tower there crept the veil of shadow that sauron wove about himself frodo wa lie on hi back not move sam stood besid him reluct to speak and yet know that the word now lay with him he must set hi master will to work for anoth effort at length stoop and caress frodo brow he spoke in hi ear wake up master he said time for anoth start as if rous by a sudden bell frodo rose quickli and stood up and look away southward but when hi eye beheld the mountain and the desert he quail again i cant manag it sam he said it is such a weight to carri such a weight sam knew befor he spoke that it wa vain and that such word might do more harm than good but in hi piti he could not keep silent then let me carri it a bit for you master he said you know i would and gladli as long as i have ani strength a wild light came into frodo eye stand away dont touch me he cri it is mine i say be off hi hand stray to hi swordhilt but then quickli hi voic chang no no sam he said sadli but you must understand it is my burden and no one els can bear it it is too late now sam dear you cant help me in that way again i am almost in it power

that land of vigil could have espi them save from close at hand of all the slave of the dark lord onli the nazgûl could have warn him of the peril that crept small but indomit into the veri heart of hi guard realm but the nazgûl and their black wing were abroad on anoth errand they were gather far away shadow the march of the captain of the west and thither the thought of the dark tower wa turn that day it seem to sam that hi master had found some new strength more than could be explain by the small lighten of the load that he had to carri in the first march they went further and faster than he had hope the land wa rough and hostil and yet they made much progress and ever the mountain drew nearer but as the day wore on and all too soon the dim light began to fail frodo stoop again and began to stagger as if the renew effort had squander hi remain strength at their last halt he sank down and said im thirsti sam and did not speak again sam gave him a mouth of water onli one more mouth remain he went without himself and now as onc more the night of mordor close over them through all hi thought there came the memori of water and everi brook or stream or fount that he had ever seen under green willowshad or twinkl in the sun danc and rippl for hi torment behind the blind of hi eye he felt the cool mud about hi toe as he paddl in the pool at bywat with jolli cotton and tom and nib and their sister rosi but that wa year ago he sigh and far away the way back if there is one goe past the mountain he could not sleep and he held a debat with himself well come now weve done better than you hope he said sturdili began well anyway i reckon we cross half the distanc befor we stop one more day will do it and then he paus dont be a fool sam gamge came an answer in hi own voic he wont go anoth day like that if he move at all and you cant go on much longer give him all the water and most of the food i can go on a good way though and i will where to to the mountain of cours but what then sam gamge what then when you get there what are you go to do he wont be abl to do anyth for himself to hi dismay sam realiz that he had not got an answer to thi he had no clear idea at all frodo had not spoken much to him of hi errand and sam onli knew vagu that the ring had somehow to be put into the fire the crack of doom he mutter the old name rise to hi mind well if master know how to find them i dont there you are came the answer it all quit useless he said so himself you are the fool go on hope and toil you could have lain down and gone to sleep togeth day ago if you hadnt been so dog but youll die just the same or wors you might just as well lie down now and give it up youll never get to the top anyway ill get there if i leav everyth but my bone behind said sam and ill carri mr frodo up myself if it break my back and heart so stop argu at that moment sam felt a tremor in the ground beneath him and he heard or sens a deep remot rumbl as of thunder imprison under the earth there wa a brief red flame that flicker under the cloud and die away the mountain too slept uneasili the last stage of their journey to orodruin came and it wa a torment greater than sam had ever thought that he could bear he wa in pain and so parch that he could no longer swallow even a mouth of food it remain dark not onli becaus of the smoke of the mountain there seem to be a storm come up and away to the southeast there wa a shimmer of lightn under the black sky worst of all the air wa full of fume breath wa pain and difficult and a dizzi came on them so that they stagger and often fell and yet their will did not yield and they struggl on the mountain crept up ever nearer until if they lift their heavi head it fill all their sight loom vast befor them a huge mass of ash and slag and burn stone out of which a sheersid cone wa rais into the cloud befor the daylong dusk end and true night came again they had crawl and stumbl to it veri feet with a gasp frodo cast himself on the ground sam sat by him to hi surpris he felt tire but lighter and hi head seem clear again no more debat disturb hi mind he knew all the argument of despair and would not listen to them hi will wa set and onli death would break it he felt no longer either desir or need of sleep but rather of watch he knew that all the hazard and peril were now draw togeth to a point the next day would be a day of doom the day of final effort or disast the last gasp but when would it come the night seem endless and timeless minut after minut fall dead and ad up to no pass hour bring no chang sam began to wonder if a second dark had begun and no day would ever reappear at last he grope for frodo hand it wa cold and trembl hi master wa shiver i didnt ought to have left my blanket behind mutter sam and lie down he tri to comfort frodo with hi arm and bodi then sleep took him and the dim light of the last day of their quest found them side by side the wind had fallen the day befor as it shift from the west and now it came from the north and began to rise and slowli the light of the unseen sun filter down into the shadow where the hobbit lay now for it now for the last gasp said sam as he struggl to hi feet he bent over frodo rous him gentli frodo groan but with a great effort of will he stagger up and then he fell upon hi knee again he rais hi eye with difficulti to the dark slope of mount doom tower abov him and then piti he began to crawl forward on hi hand sam look at him and wept in hi heart but no tear came to hi dri and sting eye i said id carri him if it broke my back he mutter and i will come mr frodo he cri i cant carri it for you but i can carri you and it as well so up you get come on mr frodo dear sam will give you a ride just tell him where to go and hell go as frodo clung upon hi back arm loos about hi neck leg clasp firmli under hi arm sam stagger to hi feet and then to hi amaz he felt the burden light he had fear that he would have bare strength to lift hi master alon and beyond that he had expect to share in the dread drag weight of the accurs ring but it wa not so whether becaus frodo wa so worn by hi long pain wound of knife and venom sting and sorrow fear and homeless wander or becaus some gift of final strength wa given to him sam lift frodo with no more difficulti than if he were carri a hobbitchild pigaback in some romp on the lawn or hayfield of the shire he took a deep breath and start off they had reach the mountain foot on it northern side and a littl to the westward there it long grey slope though broken were not sheer frodo did not speak and so sam struggl on as best he could have no guidanc but the will to climb as high as might be befor hi strength gave out and hi will broke on he toil up and up turn thi way and that to lessen the slope often stumbl forward and at the last crawl like a snail with a heavi burden on it back when hi will could drive him no further and hi limb gave way he stop and laid hi master gentli down frodo open hi eye and drew a breath it wa easier to breath up here abov the reek that coil and drift down below thank you sam he said in a crack whisper how far is there to go i dont know said sam becaus i dont know where were go he look back and then he look up and he wa amaz to see how far hi last effort had brought him the mountain stand omin and alon had look taller than it wa sam saw now that it wa less lofti than the high pass of the ephel dúath which he and frodo had scale the confus and tumbl shoulder of it great base rose for mayb three thousand feet abov the plain and abov them wa rear half as high again it tall central cone like a vast oast or chimney cap with a jag crater but alreadi sam wa more than half way up the base and the plain of gorgoroth wa dim below him wrap in fume and shadow as he look up he would have given a shout if hi parch throat had allow him for amid the rug hump and shoulder abov him he saw plainli a path or road it climb like a rise girdl from the west and wound snakelik about the mountain until befor it went round out of view it reach the foot of the cone upon it eastern side sam could not see the cours immedi abov him where it wa lowest for a steep slope went up from where he stood but he guess that if he could onli struggl on just a littl way further up they would strike thi path a gleam of hope return to him they might conquer the mountain yet whi it might have been put there apurpos he said to himself if it wasnt there id have to say i wa beaten in the end the path wa not put there for the purpos of sam he did not know it but he wa look at sauron road from baraddûr to the sammath naur the chamber of fire out from the dark tower huge western gate it came over a deep abyss by a vast bridg of iron and then pass into the plain it ran for a leagu between two smoke chasm and so reach a long slope causeway that led up on to the mountain eastern side thenc turn and encircl all it wide girth from south to north it climb at last high in the upper cone but still far from the reek summit to a dark entranc that gaze back east straight to the window of the eye in sauron shadowmantl fortress often block or destroy by the tumult of the mountain furnac alway that road wa repair and clean again by the labour of countless orc sam drew a deep breath there wa a path but how he wa to get up the slope to it he did not know first he must eas hi ach back he lay flat besid frodo for a while neither spoke slowli the light grew suddenli a sens of urgenc which he did not understand came to sam it wa almost as if he had been call now now or it will be too late he brace himself and got up frodo also seem to have felt the call he struggl to hi knee ill crawl sam he gasp so foot by foot like small grey insect they crept up the slope they came to the path and found that it wa broad pave with broken rubbl and beaten ash frodo clamber on to it and then move as if by some compuls he turn slowli to face the east far off the shadow of sauron hung but torn by some gust of wind out of the world or els move by some great disquiet within the mantl cloud swirl and for a moment drew asid and then he saw rise black blacker and darker than the vast shade amid which it stood the cruel pinnacl and iron crown of the topmost tower of baraddûr one moment onli it stare out but as from some great window immeasur high there stab northward a flame of red the flicker of a pierc eye and then the shadow were furl again and the terribl vision wa remov the eye wa not turn to them it wa gaze north to where the captain of the west stood at bay and thither all it malic wa now bent as the power move to strike it deadli blow but frodo at that dread glimps fell as one stricken mortal hi hand sought the chain about hi neck sam knelt by him faint almost inaud he heard frodo whisper help me sam help me sam hold my hand i cant stop it sam took hi master hand and laid them togeth palm to palm and kiss them and then he held them gentli between hi own the thought came suddenli to him he spot us it all up or it soon will be now sam gamge thi is the end of end again he lift frodo and drew hi hand down to hi own breast let hi master leg dangl then he bow hi head and struggl off along the climb road it wa not as easi a way to take as it had look at first by fortun the fire that had pour forth in the great turmoil when sam stood upon cirith ungol had flow down mainli on the southern and western slope and the road on thi side wa not block yet in mani place it had crumbl away or wa cross by gape rent after climb eastward for some time it bent back upon itself at a sharp angl and went westward fox a space there at the bend it wa cut deep through a crag of old weather stone onc long ago vomit from the mountain furnac pant under hi load sam turn the bend and even as he did so out of the corner of hi eye he had a glimps of someth fall from the crag like a small piec of black stone that had toppl off as he pass a sudden weight smote him and he crash forward tear the back of hi hand that still clasp hi master then he knew what had happen for abov him as he lay he heard a hate voic wick masster it hiss wick masster cheat us cheat sméagol gollum he musstnt go that way he musstnt hurt preciouss give it to sméagol yess give it to us give it to uss with a violent heav sam rose up at onc he drew hi sword but he could do noth gollum and frodo were lock togeth gollum wa tear at hi master tri to get at the chain and the ring thi wa probabl the onli thing that could have rous the die ember of frodo heart and will an attack an attempt to wrest hi treasur from him by forc he fought back with a sudden furi that amaz sam and gollum also even so thing might have gone far otherwis if gollum himself had remain unchang but whatev dread path lone and hungri and waterless he had trodden driven by a devour desir and a terribl fear they had left grievou mark on him he wa a lean starv haggard thing all bone and tightdrawn sallow skin a wild light flame in hi eye but hi malic wa no longer match by hi old gripe strength frodo flung him off and rose up quiver down down he gasp clutch hi hand to hi breast so that beneath the cover of hi leather shirt he clasp the ring down you creep thing and out of my path your time is at an end you can not betray me or slay me now then suddenli as befor under the eav of the emyn muil sam saw these two rival with other vision a crouch shape scarc more than the shadow of a live thing a creatur now wholli ruin and defeat yet fill with a hideou lust and rage and befor it stood stern untouch now by piti a figur robe in white but at it breast it held a wheel of fire out of the fire there spoke a command voic begon and troubl me no more if you touch me ever again you shall be cast yourself into the fire of doom the crouch shape back away terror in it blink eye and yet at the same time insati desir then the vision pass and sam saw frodo stand hand on breast hi breath come in great gasp and gollum at hi feet rest on hi knee with hi widesplay hand upon the ground look out cri sam hell spring he step forward brandish hi sword quick master he gasp go on go on no time to lose ill deal with him go on frodo look at him as if at one now far away ye i must go on he said farewel sam thi is the end at last on mount doom doom shall fall farewel he turn and went on walk slowli but erect up the climb path now said sam at last i can deal with you he leap forward with drawn blade readi for battl but gollum did not spring he fell flat upon the ground and whimper dont kill us he wept dont hurt us with nassti cruel steel let us live ye live just a littl longer lost lost were lost and when preciou goe well die ye die into the dust he claw up the ash of the path with hi long fleshless finger dusst he hiss sam hand waver hi mind wa hot with wrath and the memori of evil it would be just to slay thi treacher murder creatur just and mani time deserv and also it seem the onli safe thing to do but deep in hi heart there wa someth that restrain him he could not strike thi thing lie in the dust forlorn ruinou utterli wretch he himself though onli for a littl while had born the ring and now dimli he guess the agoni of gollum shrivel mind and bodi enslav to that ring unabl to find peac or relief ever in life again but sam had no word to express what he felt oh curs you you stink thing he said go away be off i dont trust you not as far as i could kick you but be off or i shall hurt you ye with nasti cruel steel gollum got up on all four and back away for sever pace and then he turn and as sam aim a kick at him he fled away down the path sam gave no more heed to him he suddenli rememb hi master he look up the path and could not see him as fast as he could he trudg up the road if he had look back he might have seen not far below gollum turn again and then with a wild light of mad glare in hi eye come swiftli but warili creep on behind a slink shadow among the stone the path climb on soon it bent again and with a last eastward cours pass in a cut along the face of the cone and came to the dark door in the mountain side the door of the sammath naur far away now rise toward the south the sun pierc the smoke and haze burn omin a dull blear disc of red but all mordor lay about the mountain like a dead land silent shadowfold wait for some dread stroke sam came to the gape mouth and peer in it wa dark and hot and a deep rumbl shook the air frodo master he call there wa no answer for a moment he stood hi heart beat with wild fear and then he plung in a shadow follow him at first he could see noth in hi great need he drew out onc more the phial of galadriel but it wa pale and cold in hi trembl hand and threw no light into that stifl dark he wa come to the heart of the realm of sauron and the forg of hi ancient might greatest in middleearth all other power were here subdu fear he took a few uncertain step in the dark and then all at onc there came a flash of red that leap upward and smote the high black roof then sam saw that he wa in a long cave or tunnel that bore into the mountain smoke cone but onli a short way ahead it floor and the wall on either side were cloven by a great fissur out of which the red glare came now leap up now die down into dark and all the while far below there wa a rumour and a troubl as of great engin throb and labour the light sprang up again and there on the brink of the chasm at the veri crack of doom stood frodo black against the glare tens erect but still as if he had been turn to stone master cri sam then frodo stir and spoke with a clear voic inde with a voic clearer and more power than sam had ever heard him use and it rose abov the throb and turmoil of mount doom ring in the roof and wall i have come he said but i do not choos now to do what i came to do i will not do thi deed the ring is mine and suddenli as he set it on hi finger he vanish from sam sight sam gasp but he had no chanc to cri out for at that moment mani thing happen someth struck sam violent in the back hi leg were knock from under him and he wa flung asid strike hi head against the stoni floor as a dark shape sprang over him he lay still and for a moment all went black and far away as frodo put on the ring and claim it for hi own even in sammath naur the veri heart of hi realm the power in baraddûr wa shaken and the tower trembl from it foundat to it proud and bitter crown the dark lord wa suddenli awar of him and hi eye pierc all shadow look across the plain to the door that he had made and the magnitud of hi own folli wa reveal to him in a blind flash and all the devic of hi enemi were at last laid bare then hi wrath blaze in consum flame but hi fear rose like a vast black smoke to choke him for he knew hi deadli peril and the thread upon which hi doom now hung from all hi polici and web of fear and treacheri from all hi stratagem and war hi mind shook free and throughout hi realm a tremor ran hi slave quail and hi armi halt and hi captain suddenli steerless bereft of will waver and despair for they were forgotten the whole mind and purpos of the power that wield them wa now bent with overwhelm forc upon the mountain at hi summon wheel with a rend cri in a last desper race there flew faster than the wind the nazgûl the ringwraith and with a storm of wing they hurtl southward to mount doom sam got up he wa daze and blood stream from hi head drip in hi eye he grope forward and then he saw a strang and terribl thing gollum on the edg of the abyss wa fight like a mad thing with an unseen foe to and fro he sway now so near the brink that almost he tumbl in now drag back fall to the ground rise and fall again and all the while he hiss but spoke no word the fire below awok in anger the red light blaze and all the cavern wa fill with a great glare and heat suddenli sam saw gollum long hand draw upward to hi mouth hi white fang gleam and then snap as they bit frodo gave a cri and there he wa fallen upon hi knee at the chasm edg but gollum danc like a mad thing held aloft the ring a finger still thrust within it circl it shone now as if verili it wa wrought of live fire preciou preciou preciou gollum cri my preciou o my preciou and with that even as hi eye were lift up to gloat on hi prize he step too far toppl waver for a moment on the brink and then with a shriek he fell out of the depth came hi last wail preciou and he wa gone there wa a roar and a great confus of nois fire leap up and lick the roof the throb grew to a great tumult and the mountain shook sam ran to frodo and pick him up and carri him out to the door and there upon the dark threshold of the sammath naur high abov the plain of mordor such wonder and terror came on him that he stood still forget all els and gaze as one turn to stone a brief vision he had of swirl cloud and in the midst of it tower and battlement tall as hill found upon a mighti mountainthron abov immeasur pit great court and dungeon eyeless prison sheer as cliff and gape gate of steel and adam and then all pass tower fell and mountain slid wall crumbl and melt crash down vast spire of smoke and spout steam went billow up up until they toppl like an overwhelm wave and it wild crest curl and came foam down upon the land and then at last over the mile between there came a rumbl rise to a deafen crash and roar the earth shook the plain heav and crack and orodruin reel fire belch from it riven summit the sky burst into thunder sear with lightn down like lash whip fell a torrent of black rain and into the heart of the storm with a cri that pierc all other sound tear the cloud asund the nazgûl came shoot like flame bolt as caught in the fieri ruin of hill and sky they crackl wither and went out well thi is the end sam gamge said a voic by hi side and there wa frodo pale and worn and yet himself again and in hi eye there wa peac now neither strain of will nor mad nor ani fear hi burden wa taken away there wa the dear master of the sweet day in the shire master cri sam and fell upon hi knee in all that ruin of the world for the moment he felt onli joy great joy the burden wa gone hi master had been save he wa himself again he wa free and then sam caught sight of the maim and bleed hand your poor hand he said and i have noth to bind it with or comfort it i would have spare him a whole hand of mine rather but he gone now beyond recal gone for ever ye said frodo but do you rememb gandalf word even gollum may have someth yet to do but for him sam i could not have destroy the ring the quest would have been in vain even at the bitter end so let us forgiv him for the quest is achiev and now all is over i am glad you are here with me here at the end of all thing sam chapter the field of cormallen all about the hill the host of mordor rage the captain of the west were founder in a gather sea the sun gleam red and under the wing of the nazgûl the shadow of death fell dark upon the earth aragorn stood beneath hi banner silent and stern as one lost in thought of thing long past or far away but hi eye gleam like star that shine the brighter as the night deepen upon the hilltop stood gandalf and he wa white and cold and no shadow fell on him the onslaught of mordor broke like a wave on the beleagu hill voic roar like a tide amid the wreck and crash of arm as if to hi eye some sudden vision had been given gandalf stir and he turn look back north where the sky were pale and clear then he lift up hi hand and cri in a loud voic ring abov the din the eagl are come and mani voic answer cri the eagl are come the eagl are come the host of mordor look up and wonder what thi sign might mean there came gwaihir the windlord and landrov hi brother greatest of all the eagl of the north mightiest of the descend of old thorondor who built hi eyri in the inaccess peak of the encircl mountain when middleearth wa young behind them in long swift line came all their vassal from the northern mountain speed on a gather wind straight down upon the nazgûl they bore stoop suddenli out of the high air and the rush of their wide wing as they pass over wa like a gale but the nazgûl turn and fled and vanish into mordor shadow hear a sudden terribl call out of the dark tower and even at that moment all the host of mordor trembl doubt clutch their heart their laughter fail their hand shook and their limb were loos the power that drove them on and fill them with hate and furi wa waver it will wa remov from them and now look in the eye of their enemi they saw a deadli light and were afraid then all the captain of the west cri aloud for their heart were fill with a new hope in the midst of dark out from the beleagu hill knight of gondor rider of rohan dúnedain of the north closeserri compani drove against their waver foe pierc the press with the thrust of bitter spear but gandalf lift up hi arm and call onc more in a clear voic stand men of the west stand and wait thi is the hour of doom and even as he spoke the earth rock beneath their feet then rise swiftli up far abov the tower of the black gate high abov the mountain a vast soar dark sprang into the sky flicker with fire the earth groan and quak the tower of the teeth sway totter and fell down the mighti rampart crumbl the black gate wa hurl in ruin and from far away now dim now grow now mount to the cloud there came a drum rumbl a roar a long echo roll of ruinou nois the realm of sauron is end said gandalf the ringbear ha fulfil hi quest and as the captain gaze south to the land of mordor it seem to them that black against the pall of cloud there rose a huge shape of shadow impenetr lightningcrown fill all the sky enorm it rear abov the world and stretch out toward them a vast threaten hand terribl but impot for even as it lean over them a great wind took it and it wa all blown away and pass and then a hush fell the captain bow their head and when they look up again behold their enemi were fli and the power of mordor wa scatter like dust in the wind as when death smite the swollen brood thing that inhabit their crawl hill and hold them all in sway ant will wander witless and purposeless and then feebli die so the creatur of sauron orc or troll or beast spellenslav ran hither and thither mindless and some slew themselv or cast themselv in pit or fled wail back to hide in hole and dark lightless place far from hope but the men of rhûn and of harad easterl and southron saw the ruin of their war and the great majesti and glori of the captain of the west and those that were deepest and longest in evil servitud hate the west and yet were men proud and bold in their turn now gather themselv for a last stand of desper battl but the most part fled eastward as they could and some cast their weapon down and su for merci then gandalf leav all such matter of battl and command to aragorn and the other lord stood upon the hilltop and call and down to him came the great eagl gwaihir the windlord and stood befor him twice you have born me gwaihir my friend said gandalf thrice shall pay for all if you are will you will not find me a burden much greater than when you bore me from zirakzigil where my old life burn away i would bear you answer gwaihir whither you will even were you made of stone then come and let your brother go with us and some other of your folk who is most swift for we have need of speed greater than ani wind outmatch the wing of the nazgûl the north wind blow but we shall outfli it said gwaihir and he lift up gandalf and sped away south and with him went landrov and meneldor young and swift and they pass over udûn and gorgoroth and saw all the land in ruin and tumult beneath them and befor them mount doom blaze pour out it fire i am glad that you are here with me said frodo here at the end of all thing sam ye i am with you master said sam lay frodo wound hand gentli to hi breast and your with me and the journey finish but after come all that way i dont want to give up yet it not like me somehow if you understand mayb not sam said frodo but it like thing are in the world hope fail an end come we have onli a littl time to wait now we are lost in ruin and downfal and there is no escap well master we could at least go further from thi danger place here from thi crack of doom if that it name now couldnt we come mr frodo let go down the path at ani rate veri well sam if you wish to go ill come said frodo and they rose and went slowli down the wind road and even as they pass toward the mountain quak feet a great smoke and steam belch from the sammath naur and the side of the cone wa riven open and a huge fieri vomit roll in slow thunder cascad down the eastern mountainsid frodo and sam could go no further their last strength of mind and bodi wa swiftli eb they had reach a low ashen hill pile at the mountain foot but from it there wa no more escap it wa an island now not long to endur amid the torment of orodruin all about it the earth gape and from deep rift and pit smoke and fume leap up behind them the mountain wa convuls great rent open in it side slow river of fire came down the long slope toward them soon they would be engulf a rain of hot ash wa fall they stood now and sam still hold hi master hand caress it he sigh what a tale we have been in mr frodo havent we he said i wish i could hear it told do you think theyll say now come the stori of ninefing frodo and the ring of doomand then everyon will hush like we did when in rivendel they told us the tale of beren onehand and the great jewel i wish i could hear it and i wonder how it will go on after our part but even while he spoke so to keep fear away until the veri last hi eye still stray north north into the eye of the wind to where the sky far off wa clear as the cold blast rise to a gale drove back the dark and the ruin of the cloud and so it wa that gwaihir saw them with hi keen farse eye as down the wild wind he came and dare the great peril of the sky he circl in the air two small dark figur forlorn hand in hand upon a littl hill while the world shook under them and gasp and river of fire drew near and even as he espi them and came swoop down he saw them fall worn out or choke with fume and heat or stricken down by despair at last hide their eye from death side by side they lay and down swept gwaihir and down came landrov and meneldor the swift and in a dream not know what fate had befallen them the wander were lift up and born far away out of the dark and the fire when sam awok he found that he wa lie on some soft bed but over him gentli sway wide beechen bough and through their young leav sunlight glimmer green and gold all the air wa full of a sweet mingl scent he rememb

will be glad to have these safe again when they were wash and clad and had eaten a light meal the hobbit follow gandalf they step out of the beechgrov in which they had lain and pass on to a long green lawn glow in sunshin border by state darkleav tree laden with scarlet blossom behind them they could hear the sound of fall water and a stream ran down befor them between flower bank until it came to a greenwood at the lawn foot and pass then on under an archway of tree through which they saw the shimmer of water far away as they came to the open in the wood they were surpris to see knight in bright mail and tall guard in silver and black stand there who greet them with honour and bow befor them and then one blew a long trumpet and they went on through the aisl of tree besid the sing stream so they came to a wide green land and beyond it wa a broad river in a silver haze out of which rose a long wood isl and mani ship lay by it shore but on the field where they now stood a great host wa drawn up in rank and compani glitter in the sun and as the hobbit approach sword were unsheath and spear were shaken and horn and trumpet sang and men cri with mani voic and in mani tongu long live the halfl prais them with great prais cuio i pheriain anann aglarni pheriannath prais them with great prais frodo and samwis daur a berhael conin en annûn eglerio prais them eglerio a laita te laita te andav laituvalmet prais them cormacolindor a laita tárienna prais them the ringbear prais them with great prais and so the red blood blush in their face and their eye shine with wonder frodo and sam went forward and saw that amidst the clamor host were set three highseat built of green turv behind the seat upon the right float white on green a great hors run free upon the left wa a banner silver upon blue a ship swanprow fare on the sea but behind the highest throne in the midst of all a great standard wa spread in the breez and there a white tree flower upon a sabl field beneath a shine crown and seven glitter star on the throne sat a mailclad man a great sword wa laid across hi knee but he wore no helm as they drew near he rose and then they knew him chang as he wa so high and glad of face kingli lord of men darkhair with eye of grey frodo ran to meet him and sam follow close behind well if that isnt the crown of all he said strider or im still asleep ye sam strider said aragorn it is a long way is it not from bree where you did not like the look of me a long way for us all but your ha been the darkest road and then to sam surpris and utter confus he bow hi knee befor them and take them by the hand frodo upon hi right and sam upon hi left he led them to the throne and set them upon it he turn to the men and captain who stood by and spoke so that hi voic rang over all the host cri prais them with great prais and when the glad shout had swell up and die away again to sam final and complet satisfact and pure joy a minstrel of gondor stood forth and knelt and beg leav to sing and behold he said lo lord and knight and men of valour unasham king and princ and fair peopl of gondor and rider of rohan and ye son of elrond and dúnedain of the north and elf and dwarf and greatheart of the shire and all free folk of the west now listen to my lay for i will sing to you of frodo of the nine finger and the ring of doom and when sam heard that he laugh aloud for sheer delight and he stood up and cri o great glori and splendour and all my wish have come true and then he wept and all the host laugh and wept and in the midst of their merriment and tear the clear voic of the minstrel rose like silver and gold and all men were hush and he sang to them now in the elventongu now in the speech of the west until their heart wound with sweet word overflow and their joy wa like sword and they pass in thought out to region where pain and delight flow togeth and tear are the veri wine of blessed and at the last as the sun fell from the noon and the shadow of the tree lengthen he end prais them with great prais he said and knelt and then aragorn stood up and all the host aros and they pass to pavilion made readi to eat and drink and make merri while the day last frodo and sam were led apart and brought to a tent and there their old raiment wa taken off but fold and set asid with honour and clean linen wa given to them then gandalf came and in hi arm to the wonder of frodo he bore the sword and the elvencloak and the mithrilcoat that had been taken from him in mordor for sam he brought a coat of gild mail and hi elvencloak all heal of the soil and hurt that it had suffer and then he laid befor them two sword i do not wish for ani sword said frodo tonight at least you should wear one said gandalf then frodo took the small sword that had belong to sam and had been laid at hi side in cirith ungol sting i gave to you sam he said no master mr bilbo gave it to you and it goe with hi silver coat he would not wish anyon els to wear it now frodo gave way and gandalf as if he were their esquir knelt and girt the swordbelt about them and then rise he set circlet of silver upon their head and when they were array they went to the great feast and they sat at the king tabl with gandalf and king éomer of rohan and the princ imrahil and all the chief captain and there also were gimli and legola but when after the stand silenc wine wa brought there came in two esquir to serv the king or so they seem to be one wa clad in the silver and sabl of the guard of mina tirith and the other in white and green but sam wonder what such young boy were do in an armi of mighti men then suddenli as they drew near and he could see them plainli he exclaim whi look mr frodo look here well if it isnt pippin mr peregrin took i should say and mr merri how they have grown bless me but i can see there more tale to tell than our there are inde said pippin turn toward him and well begin tell them as soon as thi feast is end in the meantim you can tri gandalf he not so close as he use to be though he laugh now more than he talk for the present merri and i are busi we are knight of the citi and of the mark as i hope you observ at last the glad day end and when the sun wa gone and the round moon rode slowli abov the mist of anduin and flicker through the flutter leav frodo and sam sat under the whisper tree amid the fragranc of fair ithilien and they talk deep into the night with merri and pippin and gandalf and after a while legola and gimli join them there frodo and sam learn much of all that had happen to the compani after their fellowship wa broken on the evil day at parth galen by rauro fall and still there wa alway more to ask and more to tell orc and talk tree and leagu of grass and gallop rider and glitter cave and white tower and golden hall and battl and tall ship sail all these pass befor sam mind until he felt bewild but amidst all these wonder he return alway to hi astonish at the size of merri and pippin and he made them stand back to back with frodo and himself he scratch hi head cant understand it at your age he said but there it is your three inch taller than you ought to he or im a dwarf that you certainli are not said gimli but what did i say mortal can not go drink entdraught and expect no more to come of them than of a pot of beer entdraught said sam there you go about ent again but what they are beat me whi it will take week befor we get all these thing size up week inde said pippin and then frodo will have to be lock up in a tower in mina tirith and write it all down otherwis he will forget half of it and poor old bilbo will be dread disappoint at length gandalf rose the hand of the king are hand of heal dear friend he said but you went to the veri brink of death ere he recal you put forth all hi power and sent you into the sweet forget of sleep and though you have inde slept long and blessedli still it is now time to sleep again and not onli sam and frodo here said gimli but you too pippin i love you if onli becaus of the pain you have cost me which i shall never forget nor shall i forget find you on the hill of the last battl but for gimli the dwarf you would have been lost then but at least i know now the look of a hobbit foot though it be all that can be seen under a heap of bodi and when i heav that great carcas off you i made sure you were dead i could have torn out my beard and it is onli a day yet sinc you were first up and abroad again to bed now you go and so shall i and i said legola shall walk in the wood of thi fair land which is rest enough in day to come if my elvenlord allow some of our folk shall remov hither and when we come it shall be bless for a while for a while a month a life a hundr year of men but anduin is near and anduin lead down to the sea to the sea to the sea to the sea the white gull are cri the wind is blow and the white foam is fli west west away the round sun is fall grey ship grey ship do you hear them call the voic of my peopl that have gone befor me i will leav i will leav the wood that bore me for our day are end and our year fail i will pass the wide water lone sail long are the wave on the last shore fall sweet are the voic in the lost isl call in eressëa in elvenhom that no man can discov where the leav fall not land of my peopl for ever and so sing legola went away down the hill then the other also depart and frodo and sam went to their bed and slept and in the morn they rose again in hope and peac and they spent mani day in ithilien for the field of cormallen where the host wa now encamp wa near to henneth annûn and the stream that flow from it fall could be heard in the night as it rush down through it rocki gate and pass through the floweri mead into the tide of anduin by the isl of cair andro the hobbit wander here and there visit again the place that they had pass befor and sam hope alway in some shadow of the wood or secret glade to catch mayb a glimps of the great oliphaunt and when he learn that at the sieg of gondor there had been a great number of these beast but that they were all destroy he thought it a sad loss well one cant be everywher at onc i suppos he said but i miss a lot seemingli in the meanwhil the host made readi for the return to mina tirith the weari rest and the hurt were heal for some had labour and fought much with the remnant of the easterl and southron until all were subdu and latest of all those return who had pass into mordor and destroy the fortress in the north of the land but at the last when the month of may wa draw near the captain of the west set out again and they went aboard ship with all their men and they sail from cair andro down anduin to osgiliath and there they remain for one day and the day after they came to the green field of the pelennor and saw again the white tower under tall mindolluin the citi of the men of gondor last memori of westerness that had pass through the dark and fire to a new day and there in the midst of the field they set up their pavilion and await the morn for it wa the eve of may and the king would enter hi gate with the rise of the sun chapter the steward and the king over the citi of gondor doubt and great dread had hung fair weather and clear sun had seem but a mockeri to men whose day held littl hope and who look each morn for news of doom their lord wa dead and burn dead lay the king of rohan in their citadel and the new king that had come to them in the night wa gone again to a war with power too dark and terribl for ani might or valour to conquer and no news came after the host left morgul vale and took the northward road beneath the shadow of the mountain no messeng had return nor ani rumour of what wa pass in the brood east when the captain were but two day gone the ladi éowyn bade the women who tend her to bring her raiment and she would not be gainsaid but rose and when they had cloth her and set her arm in a sling of linen she went to the warden of the hous of heal sir she said i am in great unrest and i can not lie longer in sloth ladi he answer you are not yet heal and i wa command to tend you with especi care you should not have risen from your bed for seven day yet or so i wa bidden i beg you to go back i am heal she said heal at least in bodi save my left arm onli and that is at eas but i shall sicken anew if there is naught that i can do are there no tide of war the women can tell me noth there are no tide said the warden save that the lord have ridden to morgul vale and men say that the new captain out of the north is their chief a great lord is that and a healer and it is a thing pass strang to me that the heal hand should also wield the sword it is not thu in gondor now though onc it wa so if old tale be true but for long year we healer have onli sought to patch the rent made by the men of sword though we should still have enough to do without them the world is full enough of hurt and mischanc without war to multipli them it need but one foe to breed a war not two master warden answer éowyn and those who have not sword can still die upon them would you have the folk of gondor gather you herb onli when the dark lord gather armi and it is not alway good to be heal in bodi nor is it alway evil to die in battl even in bitter pain were i permit in thi dark hour i would choos the latter the warden look at her tall she stood there her eye bright in her white face her hand clench as she turn and gaze out of hi window that open to the east he sigh and shook hi head after a paus she turn to him again is there no deed to do she said who command in thi citi i do not rightli know he answer such thing are not my care there is a marshal over the rider of rohan and the lord húrin i am told command the men of gondor but the lord faramir is by right the steward of the citi where can i find him in thi hous ladi he wa sore hurt but is now set again on the way to health but i do not know will you not bring me to him then you will know the lord faramir wa walk alon in the garden of the hous of heal and the sunlight warm him and he felt life run new in hi vein but hi heart wa heavi and he look out over the wall eastward and come the warden spoke hi name and he turn and saw the ladi éowyn of rohan and he wa move with piti for he saw that she wa hurt and hi clear sight perceiv her sorrow and unrest my lord said the warden here is the ladi éowyn of rohan she rode with the king and wa sore hurt and dwell now in my keep but she is not content and she wish to speak to the steward of the citi do not misunderstand him lord said éowyn it is not lack of care that griev me no hous could be fairer for those who desir to be heal but i can not lie in sloth idl cage i look for death in battl but i have not die and battl still goe on at a sign from faramir the warden bow and depart what would you have me do ladi said faramir i also am a prison of the healer he look at her and be a man whom piti deepli stir it seem to him that her loveli amid her grief would pierc hi heart and she look at him and saw the grave tender in hi eye and yet knew for she wa bred among men of war that here wa one whom no rider of the mark would outmatch in battl what do you wish he said again if it lie in my power i will do it i would have you command thi warden and bid him let me go she said but though her word were still proud her heart falter and for the first time she doubt herself she guess that thi tall man both stern and gentl might think her mere wayward like a child that ha not the firm of mind to go on with a dull task to the end i myself am in the warden keep answer faramir nor have i yet taken up my author in the citi but had i done so i should still listen to hi counsel and should not cross hi will in matter of hi craft unless in some great need but i do not desir heal she said i wish to ride to war like my brother éomer or better like théoden the king for he die and ha both honour and peac it is too late ladi to follow the captain even if you had the strength said faramir but death in battl may come to us all yet will or unwil you will be better prepar to face it in your own manner if while there is still time you do as the healer command you and i we must endur with patienc the hour of wait she did not answer but as he look at her it seem to him that someth in her soften as though a bitter frost were yield at the first faint presag of spring a tear sprang in her eye and fell down her cheek like a glisten raindrop her proud head droop a littl then quietli more as if speak to herself than to him but the healer would have me lie abe seven day yet she said and my window doe not look eastward her voic wa now that of a maiden young and sad faramir smile though hi heart wa fill with piti your window doe not look eastward he said that can be amend in thi i will command the warden if you will stay in thi hous in our care ladi and take your rest then you shall walk in thi garden in the sun as you will and you shall look east whither all our hope have gone and here you will find me walk and wait and also look east it would eas my care if you would speak to me or walk at while with me then she rais her head and look him in the eye again and a colour came in her pale face how should i eas your care my lord she said and i do not desir the speech of live men would you have my plain answer he said i would then éowyn of rohan i say to you that you are beauti in the valley of our hill there are flower fair and bright and maiden fairer still but neither flower nor ladi have i seen till now in gondor so love and so sorrow it may be that onli a few day are left ere dark fall upon our world and when it come i hope to face it steadili but it would eas my heart if while the sun yet shine i could see you still for you and i have both pass under the wing of the shadow and the same hand drew us back ala not me lord she said shadow lie on me still look not to me for heal i am a shieldmaiden and my hand is ungentl but i thank you for thi at least that i need not keep to my chamber i will walk abroad by the grace of the steward of the citi and she did him a courtesi and walk back to the hous but faramir for a long while walk alon in the garden and hi glanc now stray rather to the hous than to the eastward wall when he return to hi chamber he call for the warden and heard all that he could tell of the ladi of rohan but i doubt not lord said the warden that you would learn more from the halfl that is with us for he wa in the ride of the king and with the ladi at the end they say and so merri wa sent to faramir and while that day last they talk long togeth and faramir learn much more even than merri put into word and he thought that he understood now someth of the grief and unrest of éowyn of rohan and in the fair even faramir and merri walk in the garden but she did not come but in the morn as faramir came from the hous he saw her as she stood upon the wall and she wa clad all in white and gleam in the sun and he call to her and she came down and they walk on the grass or sat under a green tree togeth now in silenc now in speech and each day after they did likewis and the warden look from hi window wa glad in heart for he wa a healer and hi care wa lighten and certain it wa that heavi as wa the dread and forebod of those day upon the heart of men still these two of hi charg prosper and grew daili in strength and so the fifth day came sinc the ladi éowyn went first to faramir and they stood now togeth onc more upon the wall of the citi and look out no tide had yet come and all heart were darken the weather too wa bright no longer it wa cold a wind that had sprung up in the night wa blow now keenli from the north and it wa rise but the land about look grey and drear they were clad in warm raiment and heavi cloak and over all the ladi éowyn wore a great blue mantl of the colour of deep summernight and it wa set with silver star about hem and throat faramir had sent for thi robe and had wrap it about her and he thought that she look fair and queenli inde as she stood there at hi side the mantl wa wrought for hi mother finduila of amroth who die untim and wa to him but a memori of loveli in far day and of hi first grief and her robe seem to him raiment fit for the beauti and sad of éowyn but she now shiver beneath the starri mantl and she look northward abov the grey hither land into the eye of the cold wind where far away the sky wa hard and clear what do you look for éowyn said faramir doe not the black gate lie yonder said she and must he not now be come thither it is seven day sinc he rode away seven day said faramir but think not ill of me if i say to you they have brought me both a joy and a pain that i never thought to know joy to see you but pain becaus now the fear and doubt of thi evil time are grown dark inde éowyn i would not have thi world end now or lose so soon what i have found lose what you have found lord she answer but she look at him grave and her eye were kind i know not what in these day you have found that you could lose but come my friend let us not speak of it let us not speak at all i stand upon some dread brink and it is utterli dark in the abyss befor my feet but whether there is ani light behind me i can not tell for i can not turn yet i wait for some stroke of doom ye we wait for the stroke of doom said faramir and they said no more and it seem to them as they stood upon the wall that the wind die and the light fail and the sun wa blear and all sound in the citi or in the land about were hush neither wind nor voic nor birdcal nor rustl of leaf nor their own breath could be heard the veri beat of their heart wa still time halt and as they stood so their hand met and clasp though they did not know it and still they wait for they knew not what then present it seem to them that abov the ridg of the distant mountain anoth vast mountain of dark rose tower up like a wave that should engulf the world and about it lightn flicker and then a tremor ran through the earth and they felt the wall of the citi quiver a sound like a sigh went up from all the land about them and their heart beat suddenli again it remind me of númenor said faramir and wonder to hear himself speak of númenor said éowyn ye said faramir of the land of westerness that founder and of the great dark wave climb over the green land and abov the hill and come on dark unescap i often dream of it then you think that the dark is come said éowyn dark unescap and suddenli she drew close to him no said faramir look into her face it wa but a pictur in the mind i do not know what is happen the reason of my wake mind tell me that great evil ha befallen and we stand at the end of day but my heart say nay and all my limb are light and a hope and joy are come to me that no reason can deni éowyn éowyn white ladi of rohan in thi hour i do not believ that ani dark will endur and he stoop and kiss her brow and so they stood on the wall of the citi of gondor and a great wind rose and blew and their hair raven and golden stream out mingl in the air and the shadow depart and the sun wa unveil and light leap forth and the water of anduin shone like silver and in all the hous of the citi men sang for the joy that well up in their heart from what sourc they could not tell and befor the sun had fallen far from the noon out of the east there came a great eagl fli and he bore tide beyond hope from the lord of the west cri sing now ye peopl of the tower of anor for the realm of sauron is end for ever and the dark tower is thrown down sing and rejoic ye peopl of the tower of guard for your watch hath not been in vain and the black gate is broken and your king hath pass through and he is victori sing and be glad all ye children of the west for your king shall come again and he shall dwell among you all the day of your life and the tree that wa wither shall be renew and he shall plant it in the high place and the citi shall be bless sing all ye peopl and the peopl sang in all the way of the citi the day that follow were golden and spring and summer join and made revel togeth in the field of gondor and tide now came by swift rider from cair andro of all that wa done and the citi made readi for the come of the king merri wa summon and rode away with the wain that took store of good to osgiliath and thenc by ship to cair andro but faramir did not go for now be heal he took upon him hi author and the stewardship although it wa onli for a littl while and hi duti wa to prepar for one who should replac him and éowyn did not go though her brother sent word beg her to come to the field of cormallen and faramir wonder at thi but he saw her seldom be busi with mani matter and she dwelt still in the hous of heal and walk alon in the garden and her face grew pale again and it seem that in all the citi she onli wa ail and sorrow and the warden of the hous wa troubl and he spoke to faramir then faramir came and sought her and onc more they stood on the wall togeth and he said to her éowyn whi do you tarri here and do not go to the rejoic in cormallen beyond cair andro where your brother await you and she said do you not know but he answer two reason there may be but which is true i do not know and she said i do not wish to play at riddl speak plainer then if you will have it so ladi he said you do not go becaus onli your brother call for you and to look on the lord aragorn elendil heir in hi triumph would now bring you no joy or becaus i do not go and you

she understood it and suddenli her winter pass and the sun shone on her i stand in mina anor the tower of the sun she said and behold the shadow ha depart i will be a shieldmaiden no longer nor vie with the great rider nor take joy onli in the song of slay i will be a healer and love all thing that grow and are not barren and again she look at faramir no longer do i desir to be a queen she said then faramir laugh merrili that is well he said for i am not a king yet i will wed with the white ladi of rohan if it be her will and if she will then let us cross the river and in happier day let us dwell in fair ithilien and there make a garden all thing will grow with joy there if the white ladi come then must i leav my own peopl man of gondor she said and would you have your proud folk say of you there goe a lord who tame a wild shieldmaiden of the north wa there no woman of the race of númenor to choos i would said faramir and he took her in hi arm and kiss her under the sunlit sky and he care not that they stood high upon the wall in the sight of mani and mani inde saw them and the light that shone about them as they came down from the wall and went hand in hand to the hous of heal and to the warden of the hous faramir said here is the ladi éowyn of rohan and now she is heal and the warden said then i releas her from my charg and bid her farewel and may she suffer never hurt nor sick again i commend her to the care of the steward of the citi until her brother return but éowyn said yet now that i have leav to depart i would remain for thi hous ha becom to me of all dwell the most bless and she remain there until king éomer came all thing were now made readi in the citi and there wa great concours of peopl for the tide had gone out into all part of gondor from minrimmon even to pinnath gelin and the far coast of the sea and all that could come to the citi made hast to come and the citi wa fill again with women and fair children that return to their home laden with flower and from dol amroth came the harper that harp most skil in all the land and there were player upon viol and upon flute and upon horn of silver and clearvoic singer from the vale of lebennin at last an even came when from the wall the pavilion could be seen upon the field and all night light were burn as men watch for the dawn and when the sun rose in the clear morn abov the mountain in the east upon which shadow lay no more then all the bell rang and all the banner broke and flow in the wind and upon the white tower of the citadel the standard of the steward bright argent like snow in the sun bear no charg nor devic wa rais over gondor for the last time now the captain of the west led their host toward the citi and folk saw them advanc in line upon line flash and glint in the sunris and rippl like silver and so they came befor the gateway and halt a furlong from the wall as yet no gate had been set up again but a barrier wa laid across the entranc to the citi and there stood men at arm in silver and black with long sword drawn befor the barrier stood faramir the steward and húrin warden of the key and other captain of gondor and the ladi éowyn of rohan with elfhelm the marshal and mani knight of the mark and upon either side of the gate wa a great press of fair peopl in raiment of mani colour and garland of flower so now there wa a wide space befor the wall of mina tirith and it wa hem in upon all side by the knight and the soldier of gondor and of rohan and by the peopl of the citi and of all part of the land a hush fell upon all as out from the host step

wa how it wa all discov and mithrandir he said to me ioreth men will long rememb your word and but ioreth wa not permit to continu the instruct of her kinswoman from the countri for a singl trumpet rang and a dead silenc follow then forth from the gate went faramir with húrin of the key and no other save that behind them walk four men in the high helm and armour of the citadel and they bore a great casket of black lebethron bound with silver faramir met aragorn in the midst of those there assembl and he knelt and said the last steward of gondor beg leav to surrend hi offic and he held out a white rod but aragorn took the rod and gave it back say that offic is not end and it shall be thine and thi heir as long as my line shall last do now thi offic then faramir stood up and spoke in a clear voic men of gondor hear now the steward of thi realm behold one ha come to claim the kingship again at last here is aragorn son of arathorn chieftain of the dúnedain of arnor captain of the host

he ha alreadi enter as i wa tell you and he said to me and then again she wa oblig to silenc for faramir spoke again men of gondor the loremast tell that it wa the custom of old that the king should receiv the crown from hi father ere he die or if that might not be that he should go alon and take it from the hand of hi father in the tomb where he wa laid but sinc thing must now be done otherwis use the author of the steward i have today brought hither from rath dínen the crown of eärnur the last king whose day pass in the time of our longfath of old then the guard step forward and faramir open the casket and he held up an ancient crown it wa shape like the helm of the guard of the citadel save that it wa loftier and it wa all white and the wing at either side were wrought of pearl and silver in the like of the wing of a seabird for it wa the emblem of king who came over the sea and seven gem of adam were set in the circlet and upon it summit wa set a singl jewel the light of which went up like a flame then aragorn took the crown and held it up and said et eärello endorenna utúlien sinom maruvan ar hildinyar tenn ambarmetta and those were the word that elendil spoke when he came up out of the sea on the wing of the wind out of the great sea to middleearth i am come in thi place will i abid and my heir unto the end of the world then to the wonder of mani aragorn did not put the crown upon hi head but gave it back to faramir and said by the labour and valour of mani i have come into my inherit in token of thi i would have the ringbear bring the crown to me and let mithrandir set it upon my head if he will for he ha been the mover of all that ha been accomplish and thi is hi victori then frodo came forward and took the crown from faramir and bore it to gandalf and aragorn knelt and gandalf set the white crown upon hi head and said now come the day of the king and may they be bless while the throne of the valar endur but when aragorn aros all that beheld him gaze in silenc for it seem to them that he wa reveal to them now for the first time tall as the seak of old he stood abov all that were near ancient of day he seem and yet in the flower of manhood and wisdom sat upon hi brow and strength and heal were in hi hand and a light wa about him and then faramir cri behold the king and in that moment all the trumpet were blown and the king elessar went forth and came to the barrier and húrin of the key thrust it back and amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and the sing of clear voic the king pass through the flowerladen street and came to the citadel and enter in and the banner of the tree and the star wa unfurl upon the topmost tower and the reign of king elessar began of which mani song have told in hi time the citi wa made more fair than it had ever been even in the day of it first glori and it wa fill with tree and with fountain and it gate were wrought of mithril and steel and it street were pave with white marbl and the folk of the mountain labour in it and the folk of the wood rejoic to come there and all wa heal and made good and the hous were fill with men and women and the laughter of children and no window wa blind nor ani courtyard empti and after the end of the third age of the world into the new age it preserv the memori and the glori of the year that were gone in the day that follow hi crown the king sat on hi throne in the hall of the king and pronounc hi judgement and embassi came from mani land and peopl from the east and the south and from the border of mirkwood and from dunland in the west and the king pardon the easterl that had given themselv up and sent them away free and he made peac with the peopl of harad and the slave of mordor he releas and gave to them all the land about lake núrnen to be their own and there were brought befor him mani to receiv hi prais and reward for their valour and last the captain of the guard brought to him beregond to be judg and the king said to beregond beregond by your sword blood wa spill in the hallow where that is forbidden also you left your post without leav of lord or of captain for these thing of old death wa the penalti now therefor i must pronounc your doom all penalti is remit for your valour in battl and still more becaus all that you did wa for the love of the lord faramir nonetheless you must leav the guard of the citadel and you must go forth from the citi of mina tirith then the blood left beregond face and he wa stricken to the heart and bow hi head but the king said so it must be for you are appoint to the white compani the guard of faramir princ of ithilien and you shall be it captain and dwell in emyn arnen in honour and peac and in the servic of him for whom you risk all to save him from death and then beregond perceiv the merci and justic of the king wa glad and kneel kiss hi hand and depart in joy and content and aragorn gave to faramir ithilien to be hi princedom and bade him dwell in the hill of emyn arnen within sight of the citi for said he mina ithil in morgul vale shall be utterli destroy and though it may in time to come be made clean no man may dwell there for mani long year and last of all aragorn greet éomer of rohan and they embrac and aragorn said between us there can be no word of give or take nor of reward for we are brethren in happi hour did eorl ride from the north and never ha ani leagu of peopl been more bless so that neither ha ever fail the other nor shall fail now as you know we have laid théoden the renown in a tomb in the hallow and there he shall lie for ever among the king of gondor if you will or if you desir it we will come to rohan and bring him back to rest with hi own peopl and éomer answer sinc the day when you rose befor me out of the green grass of the down i have love you and that love shall not fail but now i must depart for a while to my own realm where there is much to heal and set in order but as for the fallen when all is made readi we will return for him but here let him sleep a while and éowyn said to faramir now i must go back to my own land and look on it onc again and help my brother in hi labour but when one whom i long love as father is laid at last to rest i will return so the glad day pass and on the eighth day of may the rider of rohan made readi and rode off by the northway and with them went the son of elrond all the road wa line with peopl to do them honour and prais them from the gate of the citi to the wall of the pelennor then all other that dwelt afar went back to their home rejoic but in the citi there wa labour of mani will hand to rebuild and renew and to remov all the scar of war and the memori of the dark the hobbit still remain in mina tirith with legola and gimli for aragorn wa loth for the fellowship to be dissolv at last all such thing must end he said but i would have you wait a littl while longer for the end of the deed that you have share in ha not yet come a day draw near that i have look for in all the year of my manhood and when it come i would have my friend besid me but of that day he would say no more in those day the companion of the ring dwelt togeth in a fair hous with gandalf and they went to and fro as they wish and frodo said to gandalf do you know what thi day is that aragorn speak of for we are happi here and i dont wish to go but the day are run away and bilbo is wait and the shire is my home as for bilbo said gandalf he is wait for the same day and he know what keep you and as for the pass of the day it is now onli may and high summer is not yet in and though all thing may seem chang as if an age of the world had gone by yet to the tree and the grass it is less than a year sinc you set out pippin said frodo didnt you say that gandalf wa less close than of old he wa weari of hi labour then i think now he is recov and gandalf said mani folk like to know beforehand what is to be set on the tabl but those who have labour to prepar the feast like to keep their secret for wonder make the word of prais louder and aragorn himself wait for a sign there came a day when gandalf could not be found and the companion wonder what wa go forward but gandalf took aragorn out from the citi by night and he brought him to the southern feet of mount mindolluin and there they found a path made in age past that few now dare to tread for it led up on to the mountain to a high hallow where onli the king had been wont to go and they went up by steep way until they came to a high field below the snow that clad the lofti peak and it look down over the precipic that stood behind the citi and stand there they survey the land for the morn wa come and they saw the tower of the citi far below them like white pencil touch by the sunlight and all the vale of anduin wa like a garden and the mountain of shadow were veil in a golden mist upon the one side their sight reach to the grey emyn muil and the glint of rauro wa like a star twinkl far off and upon the other side they saw the river like a ribbon laid down to pelargir and beyond that wa a light on the hem of the sky that spoke of the sea and gandalf said thi is your realm and the heart of the greater realm that shall be the third age of the world is end and the new age is begun and it is your task to order it begin and to preserv what may be preserv for though much ha been save much must now pass away and the power of the three ring also is end and all the land that you see and those that lie round about them shall be dwell of men for the time come of the dominion of men and the elder kindr shall fade or depart i know it well dear friend said aragorn but i would still have your counsel not for long now said gandalf the third age wa my age i wa the enemi of sauron and my work is finish i shall go soon the burden must lie now upon you and your kindr but i shall die said aragorn for i am a mortal man and though be what i am and of the race of the west unmingl i shall have life far longer than other men yet that is but a littl while and when those who are now in the womb of women are born and have grown old i too shall grow old and who then shall govern gondor and those who look to thi citi as to their queen if my desir be not grant the tree in the court of the fountain is still wither and barren when shall i see a sign that it will ever be otherwis turn your face from the green world and look where all seem barren and cold said gandalf then aragorn turn and there wa a stoni slope behind him run down from the skirt of the snow and as he look he wa awar that alon there in the wast a grow thing stood and he climb to it and saw that out of the veri edg of the snow there sprang a sapl tree no more than three foot high alreadi it had put forth young leav long and shape dark abov and silver beneath and upon it slender crown it bore one small cluster of flower whose white petal shone like the sunlit snow then aragorn cri yé utúvieny i have found it lo here is a scion of the eldest of tree but how come it here for it is not itself yet seven year old and gandalf come look at it and said verili thi is a sapl of the line of nimloth the fair and that wa a seedl of galathilion and that a fruit of telperion of mani name eldest of tree who shall say how it come here in the appoint hour but thi is an ancient hallow and ere the king fail or the tree wither in the court a fruit must have been set here for it is said that though the fruit of the tree come seldom to ripe yet the life within may then lie sleep through mani long year and none can foretel the time in which it will awak rememb thi for if ever a fruit ripen it should be plant lest the line die out of the world here it ha lain hidden on the mountain even as the race of elendil lay hidden in the wast of the north yet the line of nimloth is older far than your line king elessar then aragorn laid hi hand gentli to the sapl and lo it seem to hold onli lightli to the earth and it wa remov without hurt and aragorn bore it back to the citadel then the wither tree wa uproot but with rever and they did not burn it but laid it to rest in the silenc of rath dínen and aragorn plant the new tree in the court by the fountain and swiftli and gladli it began to grow and when the month of june enter in it wa laden with blossom the sign ha been given said aragorn and the day is not far off and he set watchmen upon the wall it wa the day befor midsumm when messeng came from amon dn to the citi and they said that there wa a ride of fair folk out of the north and they drew near now to the wall of the pelennor and the king said at last they have come let all the citi be made readi upon the veri eve of midsumm when the sky wa blue as sapphir and white star open in the east but the west wa still golden and the air wa cool and fragrant the rider came down the northway to the gate of mina tirith first rode elrohir and elladan with a banner of silver and then came glorfindel and erestor and all the household of rivendel and after them came the ladi galadriel and celeborn lord of lothlórien ride upon white steed and with them mani fair folk of their land greycloak with white gem in their hair and last came master elrond mighti among elv and men bear the sceptr of annúmina and besid him upon a grey palfrey rode arwen hi daughter evenstar of her peopl and frodo when he saw her come glimmer in the even with star on her brow and a sweet fragranc about her wa move with great wonder and he said to gandalf at last i understand whi we have wait thi is the end now not day onli shall be belov but night too shall be beauti and bless and all it fear pass away then the king welcom hi guest and they alight and elrond surrend the sceptr and laid the hand of hi daughter in the hand of the king and togeth they went up into the high citi and all the star flower in the sky and aragorn the king elessar wed arwen undómiel in the citi of the king upon the day of midsumm and the tale of their long wait and labour wa come to fulfil chapter mani part when the day of rejoic were over at last the companion thought of return to their own home and frodo went to the king as he wa sit with the queen arwen by the fountain and she sang a song of valinor while the tree grew and blossom they welcom frodo and rose to greet him and aragorn said i know what you have come to say frodo you wish to return to your own home well dearest friend the tree grow best in the land of it sire but for you in all the land of the west there will ever be a welcom and though your peopl have had littl fame in the legend of the great they will now have more renown than ani wide realm that are no more it is true that i wish to go back to the shire said frodo but first i must go to rivendel for if there could be anyth want in a time so bless i miss bilbo and i wa griev when among all the household of elrond i saw that he wa not come do you wonder at that ringbear said arwen for you know the power of that thing which is now destroy and all that wa done by that power is now pass away but your kinsman possess thi thing longer than you he is ancient in year now accord to hi kind and he await you for he will not again make ani long journey save one then i beg leav to depart soon said frodo in seven day we will go said aragorn for we shall ride with you far on the road even as far as the countri of rohan in three day now éomer will return hither to bear théoden back to rest in the mark and we shall ride with him to honour the fallen but now befor you go i will confirm the word that faramir spoke to you and you are made free for ever of the realm of gondor and all your companion likewis and if there were ani gift that i could give to match with your deed you should have them but whatev you desir you shall take with you and you shall ride in honour and array as princ of the land but the queen arwen said a gift i will give you for i am the daughter of elrond i shall not go with him now when he depart to the haven for mine is the choic of lúthien and as she so have i chosen both the sweet and the bitter but in my stead you shall go ringbear when the time come and if you then desir it if your hurt griev you still and the memori of your burden is heavi then you may pass into the west until all your wound and weari are heal but wear thi now in memori of elfston and evenstar with whom your life ha been woven and she took a white gem like a star that lay upon her breast hang upon a silver chain and she set the chain about frodo neck when the memori of the fear and the dark troubl you she said thi will bring you aid in three day as the king had said éomer of rohan came ride to the citi and with him came an éore of the fairest knight of the mark he wa welcom and when they sat all at tabl in merethrond the great hall of feast he beheld the beauti of the ladi that he saw and wa fill with great wonder and befor he went to hi rest he sent for gimli the dwarf and he said to him gimli glóin son have you your axe readi nay lord said gimli but i can speedili fetch it if there be need you shall judg said éomer for there are certain rash word concern the ladi in the golden wood that lie still between us and now i have seen her with my eye well lord said gimli and what say you now ala said éomer i will not say that she is the fairest ladi that live then i must go for my axe said gimli but first i will plead thi excus said éomer had i seen her in other compani i would have said all that you could wish but now i will put queen arwen evenstar first and i am readi to do battl on my own part with ani who deni me shall i call for my sword then gimli bow low nay you are excus for my part lord he said you have chosen the even but my love is given to the morn and my heart forebod that soon it will past away for ever at last the day of departur came and a great and fair compani made readi to ride north from the citi then the king of gondor and rohan went to the hallow and they came to the tomb in rath dínen and they bore away king théoden upon a golden bier and pass through the citi in silenc then they laid the bier upon a great wain with rider of rohan all about it and hi banner born befor and merri be théoden esquir rode upon the wain and kept the arm of the king for the other companion steed were furnish accord to their statur and frodo and samwis rode at

to the land of hi home without hast and at peac they pass into anórien and they came to the grey wood under amon dn and there they heard a sound as of drum beat in the hill though no live thing could be seen then aragorn let the trumpet be blown and herald cri behold the king elessar is come the forest of drúadan he give to ghânburighân and to hi folk to be their own for ever and hereaft let no man enter it without their leav then the drum roll loudli and were silent at length after fifteen day of journey the wain of king théoden pass through the green field of rohan and came to edora and there they all rest the golden hall wa array with fair hang and it wa fill with light and there wa held the highest feast that it had known sinc the day of it build for after three day the men of the mark prepar the funer of théoden and he wa laid in a hous of stone with hi arm and mani other fair thing that he had possess and over him wa rais a great mound cover with green turv of grass and of white evermind and now there were eight mound on the eastsid of the barrowfield then the rider of the king hous upon white hors rode round about the barrow and sang togeth a song of théoden thengel son that gléowin hi minstrel made and he made no other song after the slow voic of the rider stir the heart even of those who did not know the speech of that peopl but the word of the song brought a light to the eye of the folk of the mark as they heard again afar the thunder of the hoov of the north and the voic of eorl cri abov the battl upon the field of celebr and the tale of the king roll on and the horn of helm wa loud in the mountain until the dark came and king théoden aros and rode through the shadow to the fire and die in splendour even as the sun return beyond hope gleam upon mindolluin in the morn out of doubt out of dark to the day rise he rode sing in the sun sword unsheath hope he rekindl and in hope end over death over dread over doom lift out of loss out of life unto

for inde i have no gift that is worthi but my sister beg you to receiv thi small thing as a memori of dernhelm and of the horn of the mark at the come of the morn then éowyn gave to merri an ancient

befor ha a dwarf claim a victori over an elf in a contest of word said he now therefor let us go to fangorn and set the score right from deepingcoomb they rode to isengard and saw how the ent had busi themselv all the stonecircl had been thrown down and remov and the land within wa made into a garden fill with orchard and tree and a stream ran through it but in the midst of all there wa a lake of clear water and out of it the tower of orthanc rose still tall and impregn and it black rock wa mirror in the pool for a while the travel sat where onc the old gate of isengard had stood and there were now two tall tree like sentinel at the begin of a greenbord path that ran toward orthanc and they look in wonder at the work that had been done but no live thing could they see far or near but present they heard a voic call hoomhom hoomhom and there came treebeard stride down the path to greet them with quickbeam at hi side welcom to the treegarth of orthanc he said i knew that you were come but i wa at work up the valley there is much still to be done but you have not been idl either away in the south and the east i hear and all that i hear is good veri good then treebeard prais all their deed of which he seem to have full knowledg and at last he stop and look long at gandalf well come now he said you have prove mightiest and all your labour have gone well where now would you be go and whi do you come here to see how your work goe my friend said gandalf and to thank you for your aid in all that ha been achiev hoom well that is fair enough said treebeard for to be sure ent have play their part and not onli in deal with that hoom that accurs treeslay that dwelt here for there wa a great inrush of those burárum those eviley – blackhand – bowleg – flintheart – clawfing – foulbelli – bloodthirsti morimait – sincahonda hoom well sinc you are hasti folk and their full name is as long as year of torment those vermin of orc and they came over the river and down from the north and all round the wood of laurelindórenan which they could not get into thank to the great one who are here he bow to the lord and ladi of lórien and these same foul creatur were more than surpris to meet us out on the wold for they had not heard of us befor though that might be said also of better folk and not mani will rememb us for not mani escap us aliv and the river had most of those but it wa well for you for if they had not met us then the king of the grassland would not have ridden far and if he had there would have been no home to return to we know it well said aragorn and never shall it be forgotten in mina tirith or in edora never is too long a word even for me said treebeard not while your kingdom last you mean but they will have to last long inde to seem long to ent the new age begin said gandalf and in thi age it may well prove that the kingdom of men shall outlast you fangorn my friend but now come tell me what of the task that i set you how is saruman is he not weari of orthanc yet for i do not suppos that he will think you have improv the view from hi window treebeard gave gandalf a long look a most cun look merri thought ah he said i thought you would come to that weari of orthanc veri weari at last but not so weari of hi tower as he wa weari of my voic hoom i gave him some long tale or at least what might be thought long in your speech then whi did he stay to listen did you go into orthanc ask gandalf hoom no not into orthanc said treebeard but he came to hi window and listen becaus he could not get news in ani other way and though he hate the news he wa greedi to have it and i saw that he heard it all but i ad a great mani thing to the news that it wa good for him to think of he grew veri weari he alway wa hasti that wa hi ruin i observ my good fangorn said gandalf that with great care you say dwelt wa grew what about is is he dead no not dead so far as i know said treebeard but he is gone ye he is gone seven day i let him go there wa littl left of him when he crawl out and as for that wormcreatur of hi he wa like a pale shadow now do not tell me gandalf that i promis to keep him safe for i know it but thing have chang sinc then and i kept him until he wa safe safe from do ani more harm you should know that abov all i hate the cage of live thing and i will not keep even such creatur as these cage beyond great need a snake without fang may crawl where he will you may be right said gandalf but thi snake had still one tooth left i think he had the poison of hi voic and i guess that he persuad you even you treebeard

last close to that veri place where pippin had look into the stone of orthanc the hobbit were griev at thi part for aragorn had never fail them and he had been their guid through mani peril i wish we could have a stone that we could see all our friend in said pippin and that we could speak to them from far away onli one now remain that you could use answer aragorn for you would not wish to see what the stone of mina tirith would show you but the palantír of orthanc the king will keep to see what is pass in hi realm and what hi servant are do for do not forget peregrin took that you are a knight of gondor and i do not releas you from your servic you are go now on leav but i may recal you and rememb dear friend of the shire that my realm lie also in the north and i shall come there one

farewel may your doom be other than mine and your treasur remain with you to the end with that they part and it wa then the time of sunset and when after a while they turn and look back they saw the king of the west sit upon hi hors with hi knight about him and the fall sun shone upon them and made all their har to gleam like red gold and the white mantl of aragorn wa turn to a flame then aragorn took the green stone and held it up and there came a green fire from hi hand soon the dwindl compani follow the isen turn west and rode through the gap into the wast land beyond and then they turn northward and pass over the border of dunland the dunlend fled and hid themselv for they were afraid of elvish folk though few inde ever came to their countri but the travel did not heed them for they were still a great compani and were well provid with all that they need and they went on their way at their leisur set up their tent when they would on the sixth day sinc their part from the king they journey through a wood climb down from the hill at the feet of the misti mountain that now march on their right hand as they came out again into the open countri at sundown they overtook an old man lean on a staff and he wa cloth in rag of grey or dirti white and at hi heel went anoth beggar slouch and whine well saruman said gandalf where are you go what is that to you he answer will you still order my go and are you not content with my ruin you know the answer said gandalf no and no but in ani case the time of my labour now draw to an end the king ha taken on the burden if you had wait at orthanc you would have seen him and he would have shown you wisdom and merci then all the more reason to have left sooner said saruman for i desir neither of him inde if you wish for an answer to your first question i am seek a way out of hi realm then onc more you are go the wrong way said gandalf and i see no hope in your journey but will you scorn our help for we offer it to you to me said saruman nay pray do not smile at me i prefer your frown and as for the ladi here i do not trust her she alway hate me and scheme for your part i do not doubt that she ha brought you thi way to have

leav him said gandalf but wormtongu onli shot a glanc of hi blear eye full of terror at gandalf and then shuffl quickli past behind saruman as the wretch pair pass by the compani they came to the hobbit and saruman stop and stare at them but they look at him with piti so you have come to gloat too have you my urchin he said you dont care what a beggar lack do you for you have all you want food and fine cloth and the best weed for your pipe oh ye i know i know where it come from you would not give a pipe to a beggar would you i would if i had ani said frodo you can have what i have got left

have my pouch back which is not your and ha journey far with me wrap the weed in a rag of your own one thief deserv anoth said saruman and turn hi back on merri and kick wormtongu and went away toward the wood well i like that said pippin thief inde what of our claim for waylay wound and orcdrag us through rohan ah said sam and bought he said how i wonder and i didnt like the sound of what he said about the southfarth it time we got back im sure it is said frodo but we cant go ani quicker if we are to see bilbo i am go to rivendel first whatev happen ye i think you had better do that said gandalf but ala for saruman i fear noth more can be made of him he ha wither altogeth all the same i am not sure that treebeard is right i fanci he could do some mischief still in a small mean way next day they went on into northern dunland where no men now dwelt though it wa a green and pleasant countri septemb came in with golden day and silver night and they rode at eas until they reach the swanfleet river and found the old ford east of the fall where it went down suddenli into the lowland far to the west in a haze lay the mere and eyot through which it wound it way to the greyflood there countless swan hous in a land of reed so they pass into eregion and at last a fair morn dawn shimmer abov gleam mist and look from their camp on a low hill the travel saw away in the east the sun catch three peak that thrust up into the sky through float cloud caradhra celebdil and fanuidhol they were near to the gate of moria here now for seven day they tarri for the time wa at hand for anoth part which they were loth to make soon celeborn and galadriel and their folk would turn eastward and so pass by the redhorn gate and down the dimril stair to the silverlod and to their own countri they had journey thu far by the westway for they had much to speak of with elrond and with gandalf and here they linger still in convers with their friend often long after the hobbit were wrap in sleep they would sit togeth under the star recal the age that were gone and all their joy and labour in the world or hold council concern the day to come if ani wander had chanc to pass littl would he have seen or heard and it would have seem to him onli that he saw grey figur carv in stone memori of forgotten thing now lost in unpeopl land for they did not move or speak with mouth look from mind to mind and onli their shine eye stir and kindl as their thought went to and fro but at length all wa said and they part again for a while until it wa time for the three ring to pass away quickli fade into the stone and the shadow the greycloak peopl of lórien rode toward the mountain and those who were go to rivendel sat on the hill and watch until there came out of the gather mist a flash and then they saw no more frodo knew that galadriel had held aloft her ring in token of farewel sam turn away and sigh i wish i wa go back to lórien at last one even they came over the high moor suddenli as to travel it alway seem to the brink of the deep valley of rivendel and saw far below the lamp shine in elrond hous and they went down and cross the bridg and came to the door and all the hous wa fill with light and song for joy at elrond homecom first of all befor they had eaten or wash or even shed their cloak the hobbit went in search of bilbo they found him all alon in hi littl room it wa litter with paper and pen and pencil but bilbo wa sit in a chair befor a small bright fire he look veri old but peac and sleepi he open hi eye and look up as they came in hullo hullo he said so youv come back and tomorrow my birthday too how clever of you do you know i shall be one hundr and twentynin and in one year more if i am spare i shall equal the old took i should like to beat him but we shall see after the celebr of bilbo birthday the four hobbit stay in rivendel for some day and they sat much with their old friend who spent most of hi time now in hi room except at meal for these he wa still veri punctual as a rule and he seldom fail to wake up in time for them sit round the fire they told him in turn all that they could rememb of their journey and adventur at first he pretend to take some note but he often fell asleep and when he woke he would say how splendid how wonder but where were we then they went on with the stori from the point where he had begun to nod the onli part that seem realli to rous him and hold hi attent wa the account of the crown and marriag of aragorn i wa invit to the wed of cours he said and i have wait for it long enough but somehow when it came to it i found i had so much to do here and pack is such a bother when nearli a fortnight had pass frodo look out of hi window and saw that there had been a frost in the night and the cobweb were like white net then suddenli he knew that he must go and say goodby to bilbo the weather wa still calm and fair after one of the most love summer that peopl could rememb but octob had come and it must break soon and begin to rain and blow again and there wa still a veri long way to go yet it wa not realli the thought of the weather that stir him he had a feel that it wa time he went back to the shire sam share it onli the night befor he had said well mr frodo weve been far and seen a deal and yet i dont think weve found a better place than thi there someth of everyth here if you understand me the shire and the golden wood and gondor and king hous and inn and meadow and mountain all mix and yet somehow i feel we ought to be go soon im worri about my gaffer to tell you the truth ye someth of everyth sam except the sea frodo had answer and he repeat it now to himself except the sea that day frodo spoke to elrond and it wa agre that they should leav the next morn to their delight gandalf said i think i shall come too at least as far as bree i want to see butterbur in the even they went to say goodby to bilbo well if you must go you must he said i am sorri i shall miss you it is nice just to know that you are about the place but i am get veri sleepi then he gave frodo hi mithrilcoat and sting forget that he had alreadi done so and he gave him also three book of lore that he had made at variou time written in hi spideri hand and label on their red back translat from the elvish by bb to sam he gave a littl bag of gold almost the last drop of the smaug vintag he said may come in use if you think of get marri sam sam blush i have noth much to give to you young fellow he said to merri and pippin except good advic and when he had given them a fair sampl of thi he ad a last item in shirefashion dont let your head get too big for your hat but if you dont finish grow up soon you are go to find hat and cloth expens but if you want to beat the old took said pippin i dont see whi we shouldnt tri and beat the bullroar bilbo laugh and he produc out of a pocket two beauti pipe with pearl mouthpiec and bound with finewrought silver think of me when you smoke them he said the elv made them for me but i dont smoke now and then suddenli he nod and went to sleep for a littl and when he woke up again he said now where were we ye of cours give present which remind me what becom of my ring frodo that you took away i have lost it bilbo dear said frodo i got rid of it you know what a piti said bilbo i should have like to see it again but no how silli of me that what you went for wasnt it to get rid of it but it is all so confus for such a lot of other thing seem to have got mix up with it aragorn affair and the white council and gondor and the horsemen and southron and oliphaunt – did you realli see one sam – and cave and tower and golden tree and good know what besid i evid came back by much too straight a road from my trip i think gandalf might have shown me round a bit but then the auction would have been over befor i got back and i should have had even more troubl than i did anyway it too late now and realli i think it much more comfort to sit here and hear about it all the fire veri cosi here and the food veri good and there are elv when you want them what more could one want the road goe ever on and on out from the door where it began now far ahead the road ha gone let other follow it who can let them a journey new begin but i at last with weari feet will turn toward the light inn my eveningrest and sleep to meet and as bilbo murmur the last word hi head drop on hi chest and he slept soundli the even deepen in the room and the firelight burn brighter and they look at bilbo as he slept and saw that hi face wa smile for some time they sat in silenc and then sam look round at the room and the shadow flicker on the wall said softli i dont think mr frodo that he done much write while weve been away he wont ever write our stori now at that bilbo open an eye almost as if he had heard then he rous himself you see i am get so sleepi he said and when i have time to write i onli realli like write poetri i wonder frodo my dear fellow if you would veri much mind tidi thing up a bit befor you go collect all my note and paper and my diari too and take them with you if you will you see i havent much time for the select and the arrang and all that get sam to help and when youv knock thing into shape come back and ill run over it i wont be too critic of cours ill do it said frodo and of cours ill come back soon it wont be danger ani more there is a real king now and he will soon put the road in order thank you my dear fellow said bilbo that realli is a veri great relief to my mind and with that he fell fast asleep again the next day gandalf and the hobbit took leav of bilbo in hi room for it wa cold out of door and then they said farewel to elrond and all hi household as frodo stood upon the threshold elrond wish him a fair journey and bless him and he said i think frodo that mayb you will not need to come back unless you come veri soon for about thi time of the year when the leav are gold befor they fall look for bilbo in the wood of the shire i shall be with him these word no one els heard and frodo kept them to himself chapter homeward bound at last the hobbit had their face turn toward home they were eager now to see the shire again but at first they rode onli slowli for frodo had been ill at eas when they came to the ford of bruinen he had halt and seem loth to ride into the stream and they note that for a while hi eye appear not to see them or thing about him all that day he wa silent it wa the sixth of octob are you in pain frodo said gandalf quietli as he rode by frodo side well ye i am said frodo it is my shoulder the wound ach and the memori of dark is heavi on me it wa a year ago today ala there are some wound that can not be wholli cure said gandalf i fear it may be so with mine said frodo there is no real go back though i may come to the shire it will not seem the same for i shall not be the same i am wound with knife sting and tooth and a long burden where shall i find rest gandalf did not answer by the end of the next day the pain and uneas had pass and frodo wa merri again as merri as if he did not rememb the black of the day befor after that the journey went well and the day went quickli by for they rode at leisur and often they linger in the fair woodland where the leav were red and yellow in the autumn sun at length they came to weathertop and it wa then draw toward even and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road then frodo beg them to hasten and he would not look toward the hill but rode through it shadow with head bow and cloak drawn close about him that night the weather chang and a wind came from the west laden with rain and it blew loud and chill and the yellow leav whirl like bird in the air when they came to the chetwood alreadi the bough were almost bare and a great curtain of rain veil bree hill from their sight so it wa that near the end of a wild and wet even in the last day of octob the five travel rode up the climb road and came to the southgat of bree it wa lock fast and the rain blew in their face and in the darken sky low cloud went hurri by and their heart sank a littl for they had expect more welcom when they had call mani time at last the gatekeep came out and they saw that he carri a great cudgel he look at them with fear and suspicion but when he saw that gandalf wa there and that hi companion were hobbit in spite of their strang gear then he brighten and wish them welcom come in he said unlock the gate we wont stay for news out here in the cold and the wet a ruffianli even but old barley will no doubt give you a welcom at the poni and there youll hear all there is to hear and there youll hear later all that we say and more laugh gandalf how is harri the gatekeep scowl gone he said but youd best ask barliman good even good even to you they said and pass through and then they notic that behind the hedg at the roadsid a long low hut had been built and a number of men had come out and were stare at them over the fenc when they came to bill ferni hous they saw that the hedg there wa tatter and unkempt and the window were all board up do you think you kill him with that appl sam said pippin im not so hope mr pippin said sam but id like to know what becam of that poor poni he been on my mind mani a time and the wolv howl and all at last they came to the pranc poni and that at least look outwardli unchang and there were light behind the red curtain in the lower window they rang the bell and nob came to the door and open it a crack and peep through and when he saw them stand under the lamp he gave a cri of surpris mr butterbur master he shout theyv come back oh have they ill learn them came butterbur voic and out he came with a rush and he had a club in hi hand but when he saw who they were he stop short and the black scowl on hi face chang to wonder and delight nob you woollyp ninni he cri cant you give old friend their name you shouldnt go scare me like that with time as they are well well and where have you come from i never expect to see ani of you folk again and that a fact go off into the wild with that strider and all those black men about but im right glad to

not chang hi manner of talk and still seem to live in hi old breathless bustl and yet there wa hardli anybodi about and all wa quiet from the common room there came a low murmur of no more than two or three voic and seen closer in the light of two candl that he lit and carri befor them the landlord face look rather wrinkl and careworn he led them down the passag to the parlour that they had use on that strang night more than a year ago and they follow him a littl disquiet for it seem plain to them that old barliman wa put a brave face on some troubl thing were not what they had been but they said noth and wait as they expect mr butterbur came to the parlour after supper to see if all had been to their like as inde it had no chang for the wors had yet come upon the beer or the victual at the poni at ani rate now i wont make so bold as to suggest you should come to the common room tonight said butterbur youll be tire and there isnt mani folk there thi even anyway but if you could spare me half an hour befor you go to your bed i would dearli like to have some talk with you quietlik by ourselv that is just what we should like too said gandalf we are not tire we have been take thing

thing that were short of see how weve onli got what we grow ourselv and that not enough there none to be had from the shire these day but ill do what i can when he came back he brought them enough to last them for a day or two a wad of uncut leaf southlinch he said and the best we have but not the match of southfarth as ive alway said though im all for bree in most matter beg your pardon they put him in a larg chair by the woodfir and gandalf sat on the other side of the hearth and the hobbit in low chair between them and then they talk for mani time half an hour and exchang all such news as mr butterbur wish to hear or give most of the thing which they had to tell were a mere wonder and bewilder to their host and far beyond hi vision and they brought forth few comment other than you dont say often repeat in defianc of the evid of mr butterbur own ear you dont say mr baggin or is it mr underhil im get so mix up you dont say master gandalf well i never whod have thought it in our time but he did say much on hi own account thing were far from well he would say busi wa not even fair it wa downright bad no one come nigh bree now from outsid he said and the insid folk they stay at home mostli and keep their door bar it all come of those newcom and gangrel that began come up the greenway last year as you may rememb but more came later some were just poor bodi run away from troubl but most were bad men full o thieveri and mischief and there wa troubl right here in bree bad troubl whi we had a real setto and there were some folk kill kill dead if youll believ me i will inde said gandalf how mani three and two said butterbur refer to the big folk and the littl there wa poor mat heatherto and rowli appledor and littl tom pickthorn from over the hill and willi bank from upaway and one of the underhil from staddl all good fellow and theyr miss and harri goatleaf that use to be on the westgat and that bill ferni they came in on the stranger side and theyv gone off with them and it my belief they let them in on the night of the fight i mean and that wa after we show them the gate and push them out befor the year end that wa and the fight wa earli in the new year after the heavi snow we had and now theyr gone for robber and live outsid hide in the wood beyond archet and out in the wild northaway it like a bit of the bad old time tale tell of i say it isnt safe on the road and nobodi goe far and folk lock up earli we have to keep watcher all round the fenc and put a lot of men on the gate at night well no one troubl us said pippin and we came along slowli and kept no watch we thought wed left all troubl behind us ah that you havent master more the piti said butterbur but it no wonder they left you alon they wouldnt go for arm folk with sword and helmet and shield and all make them think twice that would and i must say it put me aback a bit when i saw you then the hobbit suddenli realiz that peopl had look at them with amaz not out of surpris at their return so much as in wonder at their gear they themselv had becom so use to warfar and to ride in wellarray compani that they had quit forgotten that the bright mail peep from under their cloak and the helm of gondor and the mark and the fair devic on their shield would seem outlandish in their own countri and gandalf too wa now ride on hi tall grey hors all clad in white with a great mantl of blue and silver over all and the long sword glamdr at hi side gandalf laugh well well he said if they are afraid of just five of us then we have met wors enemi on our travel but at ani rate they will

respect folk on the road that wont do no harm he said but we dont want no more rabbl and ruffian and we dont want no outsid at bree nor near bree at all we want to be let alon i dont want a whole crowd o stranger camp here and settl there and tear up the wild countri you will be let alon barliman said gandalf there is room enough for realm between isen and greyflood or along the shore land

wa serv on a long bare tabl that had not been scrub for week the food deserv no better set the travel were glad to leav the place it wa about eighteen mile to bywat and they set off at ten oclock in the morn they would have start earlier onli the delay so plainli annoy the shirrifflead the west wind had shift northward and it wa turn colder but the rain wa gone it wa rather a comic cavalcad that left the villag though the few folk that came out to stare at the getup of the travel did not seem quit sure whether laugh wa allow a dozen shirriff had been told off as escort to the prison but merri made them march in front while frodo and hi friend rode behind merri pippin and sam sat at their eas laugh and talk and sing while the shirriff stump along tri to look stern and import frodo howev wa silent and look rather sad and thought the last person they pass wa a sturdi old gaffer clip a hedg hullo hullo he jeer now who arrest who two of the shirriff immedi left the parti and went toward him leader said merri order your fellow back to their place at onc if you dont want me to deal with them the two hobbit at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkili now get on said merri and after that the travel saw to it that their poni pace wa quick enough to push the shirriff along as fast as they could go the sun came out and in spite of the chilli wind they were soon puf and sweat at the threefarth stone they gave it up they had done nearli fourteen mile with onli one rest at noon it wa now three oclock they were hungri and veri footsor and they could not stand the pace well come along in your own time said merri we are go on goodby cockrobin said sam ill wait for you outsid the green dragon if you havent forgotten where that is dont dawdl on the way your break arrest that

toward the white down far away on the western horizon they came to bywat by it wide pool and there they had their first realli pain shock thi wa frodo and sam own countri and they found out now that they care about it more than ani other place in the world mani of the hous that they had known were miss some seem to have been burn down the pleasant row of old hobbithol in the bank on the north side of the pool were desert and their littl garden that use to run down bright to the water edg were rank with weed wors there wa a whole line of the ugli new hous all along pool side where the hobbiton road ran close to the bank an avenu of tree had stood there they were all gone and look with dismay up the road toward bag end they saw a tall chimney of brick in the distanc it wa pour out black smoke into the even air sam wa besid himself im go right on mr frodo he cri im go to see what up i want to find my gaffer we ought to find out first what were in for sam said merri i guess that the chief will have a gang of ruffian handi we had better find someon who will tell us how thing are round here but in the villag of bywat all the hous and hole were shut and no one greet them they wonder at thi but they soon discov the reason of it when they reach the green dragon the last hous on the hobbiton side now lifeless and with broken window they were disturb to see half a dozen larg illfavour men loung against the innwal they were squintey and sallowfac like that friend of bill ferni at bree said sam like mani that i saw at isengard mutter merri the ruffian had club in their hand

rebellion ruthlessli at it centr in bywat but howev grim they might be they seem to have no leader among them who understood warfar they came on without ani precaut merri laid hi plan quickli the ruffian came tramp along the east road and without halt turn up the bywat road which ran for some way slope up between high bank with low hedg on top round a bend about a furlong from the main road they met a stout barrier of old farmcart upturn that halt them at the same moment they becam awar that the hedg on both side just abov their head were all line with hobbit behind them other hobbit now push out some more waggon that had been hidden in a field and so block the way back a voic spoke to them from abov well you have walk into a trap said merri your fellow from hobbiton did the same and one is dead and the rest are prison lay down your weapon then go back twenti pace and sit down ani who tri to break out will be shot but the ruffian could not now be cow so easili a few of them obey but were immedi set on by their fellow a score or more broke back and charg the waggon six were shot but the remaind burst out kill two hobbit and then scatter across countri in the direct of the woodi end two more fell as they ran merri blew a loud horncal and there were answer call from a distanc they wont get far said pippin all that countri is aliv with our hunter now behind the trap men

west side and attack their enemi fierc be now more bent on kill than escap sever hobbit fell and the rest were waver when merri and pippin who were on the east side came across and charg the ruffian merri himself slew the leader a great squintey brute like a huge orc then he drew hi forc off encircl the last remnant of the men in a wide ring of archer at last all wa over nearli seventi of the

the name of captain meriadoc and peregrin frodo had been in the battl but he had not drawn sword and hi chief part had been to prevent the hobbit in their wrath at their loss from slay those of their enemi who threw down their weapon when the fight wa over and the later labour were order merri pippin and sam join him and they rode back with the cotton they ate a late midday meal and then frodo said with a sigh well i suppos it is time now that we dealt with the chief ye inde the sooner the better said merri and dont be too gentl he respons for bring in these ruffian and for all the evil they have done farmer cotton collect an escort of some two dozen sturdi hobbit for it onli a guess that there is no ruffian left at bag end he said we dont know then they set out on foot frodo sam merri and pippin led the way it wa one of the saddest hour in their live the great chimney rose up befor them and as they drew near the old villag across the water through row of new mean hous along each side of the road they saw the new mill in all it frown and dirti ugli a great brick build straddl the stream which it foul with a steam and stink overflow all along the bywat road everi tree had been fell as they cross the bridg and look up the hill they gasp even sam vision in the mirror had not prepar him for what they saw the old grang on the west side had been knock down and it place

still i have alreadi done much that you will find it hard to mend or undo in your live and it will be pleasant to think of that and set it against my injuri well if that is what you find pleasur in said frodo i piti you it will be a pleasur of memori onli i fear go at onc and never return the hobbit of the villag had seen saruman come out of one of the hut and at onc they came crowd up to the door of bag end when they heard frodo command they murmur angrili dont let him go kill him he a villain and a murder kill him saruman look round at their hostil face and smile kill him he mock kill him if you think there are enough of you my brave hobbit he drew himself up and stare at them darkli with hi black eye but do not think that when i lost all my good i lost all my power whoever strike me shall be accurs and if my blood stain the shire it shall wither and never again be heal the hobbit recoil but frodo said do not believ him he ha lost all power save hi voic that can still daunt you

came wormtongu crawl almost like a dog to the road again worm said saruman these fine fellow and lordl are turn us adrift again come along saruman turn to go and wormtongu shuffl after him but even as saruman pass close to frodo a knife flash in hi hand and he stab swiftli the blade turn on the hidden mailcoat and snap a dozen hobbit led by sam leap forward with a cri and flung the villain to the ground sam drew hi sword no sam said frodo do not kill him even now for he ha not hurt me and in ani case i do not wish him to be slain in thi evil mood he wa great onc of a nobl kind that we should not dare to rais our hand against he is fallen and hi cure is beyond us but i would still spare him in the hope that he may find it saruman rose to hi feet and stare at frodo there wa a strang look in hi eye of mingl wonder and respect and hatr you have grown halfl he said ye you have grown veri much you are wise and cruel you have rob my reveng of sweet and now i must go henc in bitter in debt to

the hobbit made a lane for him to pass but their knuckl whiten as they grip on their weapon wormtongu hesit and then follow hi master wormtongu call frodo you need not follow him i know of no evil you have done to me you can have rest and food here for a while until you are stronger and can go your own way wormtongu halt and look back at him half prepar to stay saruman turn no evil he cackl oh no even when he sneak out at night it is onli to look at the star but did i hear someon ask where poor lotho is hide you know dont you worm will you tell them wormtongu cower down and whimper no no then

follow he kick wormtongu in the face as he grovel and turn and made off but at that someth snap suddenli wormtongu rose up draw a hidden knife and then with a snarl like a dog he sprang on saruman back jerk hi head back cut hi throat and with a yell ran off down the lane befor frodo could recov or speak a word three hobbitbow twang and wormtongu fell dead to the dismay of those that stood by about the bodi of saruman a grey mist gather and rise slowli to a great height like smoke from a fire as a pale shroud figur it loom over the hill for a moment it waver look to the west but out of the west came a cold wind and it bent away and with a sigh dissolv into noth frodo look down at the bodi with piti and horror for as he look it seem that long year of death were suddenli reveal in it and it shrank and the shrivel face becam rag of skin upon a hideou skull lift up the skirt of the dirti cloak that sprawl besid it he cover it over and turn away and that the end of that said sam a nasti end and i wish i neednt have seen it but it a good riddanc and the veri last end of the war i hope said merri i hope so said frodo and sigh the veri last stroke but to think that it should fall here at the veri door of bag end among all my hope and fear at least i never expect that i shant call it the end till weve clear up the mess said sam gloomili and thatll take a lot of time and work chapter the grey haven the clear up certainli need a lot of work but it took less time than sam had fear the day after the battl frodo rode to michel delv and releas the prison from the lockhol one of the first that they found wa poor fredegar bolger fatti no longer he had been taken when the ruffian smoke out a band of rebel that he led from their hide up in the brockenbor by the hill of scari you would have done better to come with us after all poor old fredegar said pippin as they carri him out too weak to walk he open an eye and tri gallantli to smile who thi young giant with the loud voic he whisper not littl pippin what your size in hat now then there wa lobelia poor thing she look veri old and thin when they rescu her from a dark and narrow cell she insist on hobbl out on her own feet and she had such a welcom and there wa such clap and cheer when she appear lean on frodo arm but still clutch her umbrella that she wa quit touch and drove away in tear she had never in her life been popular befor but she wa crush by the news of lotho murder and she would not return to bag end she gave it back to frodo and went to her own peopl the bracegirdl of hardbottl when the poor creatur die next springsh wa after all more than a hundr year old – frodo wa surpris and much move she had left all that remain of her money and of lotho for him to use in help hobbit made homeless by the troubl so that feud wa end old will whitfoot had been in the lockhol longer than ani and though he had perhap been treat less harshli than some he need a lot of feed up befor he could look the part of mayor so frodo agre to act as hi deputi until mr whitfoot wa in shape again the onli thing that he did as deputi mayor wa to reduc the shirriff to their proper function and number the task of hunt out the last remnant of the ruffian wa left to merri and pippin and it wa soon done the southern gang after hear the news of the battl of bywat fled out of the land and offer littl resist to the thain befor the year end the few survivor were round up in the wood and those that surrend were shown to the border meanwhil the labour of repair went on apac and sam wa kept veri busi hobbit can work like bee when the mood and the need come on them now there were thousand of will hand of all age from the small but nimbl one of the hobbit lad and lass to the wellworn and horni one of the gaffer and gammer befor yule not a brick wa left stand of the new shirriffhous or of anyth that had been built by sharkey men but the brick were use to repair mani an old hole to make it snugger and drier great store of good and food and beer were found that had been hidden away by the ruffian in shed and barn and desert hole and especi in the tunnel at michel delv and in the old quarri at scari so that there wa a great deal better cheer that yule than anyon had hope for one of the first thing done in hobbiton befor even the remov of the new mill wa the clear of the hill and bag end and the restor of bagshot row the front of the new sandpit wa all level and made into a larg shelter garden and new hole were dug in the southward face back into the hill and they were line with brick the gaffer wa restor to number three and he said often and did not care who heard it it an ill wind as blow nobodi no good as i alway say and all well as end better there wa some discuss of the name that the new row should be given battl garden wa thought of or better smial but after a while in sensibl hobbitfashion it wa just call new row it wa a pure bywat joke to refer to it as sharkey end the tree were the worst loss and damag for at sharkey bid they had been cut down recklessli far and wide over the shire and sam griev over thi more than anyth els for one thing thi hurt would take long to heal and onli hi greatgrandchildren he thought would see the shire as it ought to be then suddenli one day for he had been too busi for week to give a thought to hi adventur he rememb the gift of galadriel he brought the box out and show it to the other travel for so they were now call by everyon and ask their advic i wonder when you would think of it said frodo open it insid it wa fill with a grey dust soft and fine in the middl of which wa a seed like a small nut with a silver shale what can i do with thi said sam throw it in the air on a breezi day and let it do it work said pippin on what said sam choos one spot as a nurseri and see what happen to the plant there said merri but im sure the ladi would not like me to keep it all for my own garden now so mani folk have suffer said sam use all the wit and knowledg you have of your own sam said frodo and then use the gift to help your work and better it and use it sparingli there is not much here and i expect everi grain ha a valu so sam plant sapl in all the place where special beauti or belov tree had been destroy and he put a grain of the preciou dust in the soil at the root of each he went up and down the shire in thi labour but if he paid special attent to hobbiton and bywat no one blame him and at the end he found that he still had a littl of the dust left so he went to the threefarth stone which is as near the centr of the shire as no matter and cast it in the air with hi bless the littl silver nut he plant in the parti field where the tree had onc been and he wonder what would come of it all through the winter he remain as patient as he could and tri to restrain himself from go round constantli to see if anyth wa happen spring surpass hi wildest hope hi tree began to sprout and grow as if time wa in a hurri and wish to make one year do for twenti in the parti field a beauti young sapl leap up it had silver bark and long leav and burst into golden flower in april it wa inde a mallorn and it wa the wonder of the neighbourhood in after year as it grew in grace and beauti it wa known far and wide and peopl would come long journey to see it the onli mallorn west of the mountain and east of the sea and one of the finest in the world altogeth in the shire wa a marvel year not onli wa there wonder sunshin and delici rain in due time and perfect measur but there seem someth more an air of rich and growth and a gleam of a beauti beyond that of mortal summer that flicker and pass upon thi middleearth all the children born or begotten in that year and there were mani were fair to see and strong and most of them had a rich golden hair that had befor been rare among hobbit the fruit wa so plenti that young hobbit veri nearli bath in strawberri and cream and later they sat on the lawn under the plumtre and ate until they had made pile of stone like small pyramid or the heap skull of a conqueror and then they move on and no one wa ill and everyon wa pleas except those who had to mow the grass in the southfarth the vine were laden and the yield of leaf wa astonish and everywher there wa so much corn that at harvest everi barn wa stuf the northfarth barley wa so fine that the beer of malt wa long rememb and becam a byword inde a gener later one might hear an old gaffer in an inn after a good pint of wellearn ale put down hi mug with a sigh ah that wa proper fourteentwenti that wa sam stay at first at the cotton with frodo but when the new row wa readi he went with the gaffer in addit to all hi other labour he wa busi direct the clean up and restor of bag end but he wa often away in the shire on hi forestri work so he wa not at home in earli march and did not know that frodo had been ill on the thirteenth of that month farmer cotton found frodo lie on hi bed he wa clutch a white gem that hung on a chain about hi neck and he seem half in a dream it is gone for ever he said and now all is dark and empti but the fit pass and when sam got back on the twentyfifth frodo had recov and he said noth about himself in the meanwhil bag end had been set in order and merri and pippin came over from crickhollow bring back all the old furnitur and gear so that the old hole soon look veri much as it alway had done when all wa at last readi frodo said when are you go to move in and join me sam sam look a bit awkward there is no need to come yet if you dont want to said frodo but you know the gaffer is close at hand and he will be veri well look after by widow rumbl it not that mr frodo said sam and he went veri red well what is it it rosi rose cotton said sam it seem she didnt like my go abroad at all poor lass but as i hadnt spoken she couldnt say so and i didnt speak becaus i had a job to do first but now i have spoken and she say well youv wast a year so whi wait longer wast i say i wouldnt call it that still i see what she mean i feel torn in two as you might say i see said frodo you want to get marri and yet you want to live with me in bag end too but my dear sam how easi get marri as soon as you can and then move in with rosi there room enough in bag end for as big a famili as you could wish for and so it wa settl sam gamge marri rose cotton in the spring of which wa also famou for it wed and they came and live at bag end and if sam thought himself lucki frodo knew that he wa more lucki himself for there wa not a hobbit in the shire that wa look after with such care when the labour of repair had all been plan and set go he took to a quiet life write a great deal and go through all hi note he resign the offic of deputi mayor at the free fair that

even and all the night none saw them pass save the wild creatur or here and there some wander in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the tree or a light and shadow flow through the grass as the moon went westward and when they had pass from the shire go about the south skirt of the white down they came to the far down and to the tower and look on the distant sea and so they rode down at last to mithlond to the grey haven in the long firth of lune as they came to the gate círdan the shipwright came forth to greet them veri tall he wa and hi beard wa long and he wa grey and old save that hi eye were keen as star and he look at them and bow and said all is now readi then círdan led them to the haven and there wa a white ship lie and upon the quay besid a great grey hors stood a figur robe
