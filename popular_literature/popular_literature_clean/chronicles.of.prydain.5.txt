my conscienc he gave the bard a glanc that wa shrewd but fill with kind and good humor taran at first had seen taliesin as a man of mani year now he could not guess the chief bard age taliesin featur though heavili line seem fill with a strang mix of ancient wisdom and youth he wore noth to betoken hi rank and taran realiz there wa no need for such adorn like adaon hi son and taran companion of long ago hi eye were gray deepset seem to look beyond what they saw and there wa in the chief bard face and voic a sens of author far greater than a war leader and more command than a king i knew the natur of the harp when i gave it to you the chief bard continu and know your own natur suspect that you would alway have some small troubl with the string troubl cri fflewddur whi not a bit of it never for a moment two string broke with such a twang that gurgi start in alarm fflewddur face turn bright red to the tip of hi nose the fact of the matter is as i stop and think on it the old pot forc me to tell the truth ah shall we say a littl more than i normal would but it doe occur to me tell the truth ha harm no one least of all myself taliesin smile then you have learn no small lesson nonetheless my gift wa in jest yet not entir in jest say perhap the laughter of one heart to anoth but you have born it willingli now i offer you ani of your choos he said taliesin point to a shelf where stood a number of harp some newer some older and a few even more grace curv than the instrument fflewddur carri with a joy cri fflewddur hasten to them lovingli touch the string of each admir the workmanship turn from one to the next and back again he hesit some while look dole at the newli broken string of hi own instrument at the scratch and chip scar the frame ah ye well you honor me he murmur in some confus but thi old pot is quit good enough for me there are time i swear when it seem to play of itself none ha a better tone when the string are fix that is it sit well against my shoulder not to belittl these but what i mean is that somehow were use to each other ye im most grate but i would not chang it so be it then repli taliesin and you other the chief bard ad to the companion you have seen mani of the treasur of caer dathyl but have you seen it true pride and priceless treasur it is here he said quietli gestur around the chamber store in thi hall of lore is much of prydain ancient learn though arawn deathlord rob men of their craft secret he could not gain the song and say of our bard here they have been care gather of your song my gallant friend he said to fflewddur there are not a few memori live longer than what it rememb taliesin said and all men share the memori and wisdom of all other below thi chamber lie even richer trove he smile like poetri itself the greater part is the more deepli hidden there too is the hall of bard ala fflewddur fflam he said regret none but a true bard may enter it though one day perhap you shall join our compani oh wisdom of nobl bard cri gurgi hi eye pop in wonder it make humbl gurgi poor tender head spin with whirl and twirl ala ala for he ha no wisdom but he would go without crunch and munch to gain it taliesin put a hand on the creatur shoulder do you believ you have none he ask that is not true of wisdom there are as mani pattern as a loom can weav your is the wisdom of a good and kindli heart scarc it is and it worth all the greater such is that of coll son of collfrewr said the chief bard and ad thereto the wisdom of the earth the gift of wake barren ground and caus the soil to flourish in a rich harvest my garden doe that labor not i said coll hi bald crown turn pink from both pleasur and modesti and as i recal the state i left it in i shall wait long for anoth harvest whatev i wa

your vein princess flow the blood of the enchantress of llyr your wisdom may be the most secret of all for you know without know even as the heart itself know how to beat ala for my own wisdom said taran i ha with your son when he met hi death he gave me a brooch of great power and while i wore it there wa much i understood and much that wa hidden grew dear to me the brooch is no longer mine if inde it ever truli wa what i knew then i rememb onli as a dream linger beyond my power to grasp it a shade of sorrow pass over taliesin face there are those he said gentli who must first learn loss despair and grief of all path to wisdom thi is the cruelest and longest are you one who must follow such a way thi even i can not know if you are take heart nonetheless those who reach the end do more than gain wisdom as rough wool becom cloth and crude clay a vessel so do they chang and fashion wisdom for other and what they give back is greater than what they won taran wa about to speak but the

memori ha arawn sent hi deathless warrior abroad in such strength he ha taken the greatest risk for the greatest gain and he ha triumph but hi triumph ha becom hi moment of greatest weak without the cauldronborn to guard it annuvin lie open to attack so must we attack it do you believ then that annuvin is unguard taran ask quickli are there none other who serv arawn mortal warrior sure repli

it must be done quickli for now they will seek to return quickli to their master but can we overtak them onc they are on the march can we hinder them and at the same time mount our own attack against annuvin not if we journey as one armi gwydion said instead we must separ into two band the first and smaller shall be given as mani hors as can be spare and hasten to pursu the cauldronborn the second shall make their way to the valley of kynvael and follow it river northwest to the coast the valley land is gentl and with forc march the sea can be reach in no more than two day the sea must aid our

will and all who follow you must do so willingli then it is my will to do so taran answer the companion murmur their assent the vessel of the son of don are swift gwydion said i ask you to delay the cauldronborn but a littl while yet all hang on that littl if i fail taran said how shall i send word to you should the cauldron warrior reach annuvin ahead of you your plan can not succeed and you must turn back gwydion shook hi head there can be no turn back for there is no further hope should either of us fail all our live are forfeit llassar hevydd and all the other commot folk chose to follow taran with them were join the surviv warrior of fflewddur fflam and togeth they made the greater portion of taran band to the surpris of the companion glew chose to ride with them the former giant had recov from hi fright at least enough to regain much of hi customari peevish he had howev regain all of hi appetit and demand food in great quantiti from gurgi wallet of provis ive had my

not so wet and salti but i assur you i would have agre to neither when i wa a giant fflewddur glower at the former giant and spoke apart with taran it seem were doom on top of all our other woe to put up with that whine weasel at everi step and i cant help feel that in the back of that puni littl mind he hope somehow to feather hi own nest the bard shook hi head and gave taran a sorrow look but are ani nest left to feather there not a safe place even for glew to hide hi head gurgi had tie the banner of the white pig to a new staff but he sigh mourn at the tatter emblem poor piggi he cri none can see her now for she is torn into thread and shred i promis to sew anoth eilonwi said as soon as she stop abruptli and said no more as she climb astrid lluagor taran saw her troubl glanc the princess of llyr would wait long he fear befor her hand work with an embroideri needl and unspoken but in hi heart wa the dread that none of them might see caer dallben again at the end of their grim race death might be the onli prize arm with spear and sword the warrior were mount and readi with a last farewel to gwydion the companion rode westward from the hill it wa coll judgment that the cauldronborn would march directli to annuvin follow the straightest and shortest path at the head of the column wind it way from the snowswept height llassar rode besid taran the skill of the young shepherd eas their passag and he guid them swiftli toward the lowland unseen by pryderi armi which had begun to withdraw from the valley around caer dathyl for some day they journey and taran began to fear the retreat cauldronborn had outdistanc them nevertheless they could do no more than press on as quickli as possibl southward now pass through long stretch of spars woodland it wa gurgi who first sight the deathless warrior the creatur face went gray with fright as he point to an expans of rockstrewn plain glew blink choke and could bare swallow the food he wa munch eilonwi watch silent and the bard gave a low whistl of dismay taran heart sank at the sight of the column move like a long serpent over the flatland he turn questioningli to coll can we hold them off at all a pebbl can turn asid an avalanch said coll or a twig stem a flood i daresay mutter fflewddur what happen to the twig or pebbl afterward i should rather not think about taran wa about to signal the warrior to form for an attack but coll took hi arm not yet my boy he said first i would be sure of the path these creatur of arawn mean to follow to annuvin if the twig is to do it work it must be well place for the rest of that day and the morn of the next the companion match their own progress with the march of the cauldronborn sometim ahead sometim along their flank but never lose sight of the deathless warrior it seem to taran that the cauldronborn had slow their pace the dark column move without falter but heavili as though burden he spoke of thi to coll who nod in satisfact their strength ebb a littl coll said time work for us but i think we must soon work for ourselv they had reach a broad wind belt of wasteland where grassless earth stretch away on either side as far as the eye could see the dead ground wa broken rut as though illplow slash with deep ditch and gulli no tree no shrub rose from the dull red earth and nowher did taran see the faintest sign that ani grow thing had ever flourish there he look at it uneasili chill not onli by the bitter wind but by the silenc that hover like frozen mist about the lifeless land he ask in a low voic what place is thi coll grimac the red fallow it is call now at the moment he ad wryli i fear it is much the way my garden look i have heard it spoken of taran said though i believ to be it no more than a travel tale coll shook hi head no travel tale whatev men have long shun it yet onc it wa the fairest realm in prydain the land wa such that all manner of thing would grow as if overnight grain veget fruit whi in size and savor the appl from the orchard here would have made mine look like shrivel windfal besid them a prize it wa to be won and held and mani lord fought for it possess but in the fight over it year after year the hoov of steed trampl the ground the blood of warrior stain it in time the land die as did those who strove to claim it from their fellow and soon it blight crept far beyond the battl ground coll sigh i know thi land my boy and it doe not pleas me to see it again in my younger day i too march with the battl host and left not a littl of my own blood in the fallow will they never flourish taran ask look with dismay at the wast expans prydain could be a rich land with the abund they might bear it would be a shame wors than bloodsh to leav these field thu would the soil not yield again if it were labor well who can say answer coll perhap no man ha till it for year long past but for us now that is all bythebi he gestur toward the height rise sharpli at the distant edg of the field the red fallow stretch along the hill of brangaledd southwestward almost to annuvin from here it is the longest but easiest path to arawn realm and if i judg aright the cauldronborn will follow it swiftli to their master we must not let them pass taran repli here we must make our first stand and hinder them as best we can he glanc toward the height we must forc them into the hill among rock and broken ground we might set snare or lure them into ambush it is all we can hope to do perhap said coll though befor you choos know thi the hill of brangaledd also give a path to annuvin and a shorter one they rise sharper as they go westward and turn soon to steep crag there stand mount dragon the highest peak guard the iron portal of the land of death it is a harsh passag cruel and danger more so for us than for the deathless cauldronborn we can lose our live they can not taran frown anxious then said with a bitter laugh inde there is no happi choic old friend the path of the red fallow is easier but longer the mountain way harder and shorter he shook hi head i have not the wisdom to decid have you no counsel for me the choic must be your war leader answer coll yet as a grower of turnip and cabbag i might say if you trust your strength the mountain may be friend as much as foe taran smile at him sorrow littl trust do i put in the strength of an assist pigkeep alon he said after a long moment but much in the strength and wisdom of hi companion so be it we must drive the cauldron warrior into the hill know thi too said coll if such is your choic it must be done at thi place and at all cost farther southward the fallow widen the plain grow broad and flat and there is danger the cauldronborn may escap our reach if we fail here taran grin now that is simpl enough for an assist pigkeep to understand taran rode back through the column of warrior to tell them of the plan they were to follow though he caution eilonwi and gurgi to hold themselv as far as possibl from the fray he could judg with littl difficulti that the princess of llyr had no intent of heed hi warn as for taran himself the decis he had taken lay heavili on him hi doubt and fear onli sharpen as the horsemen ralli at the fring of woodland and as the moment for their advanc across the fallow drew closer he felt cold the wind mutter across the rut field seep through hi cloak like an ici flood he caught sight of coll who wink at him and nod hi bald crown in a quick gestur taran rais the horn to hi lip and signal the warrior forward at coll counsel the companion and each horseman had cut stout branch from the tree now like ant burden with straw the column enter the wasteland struggl across the rut and gulli to their right rose the ruin of a wall some ancient boundari useless now whose broken slab stretch over much of the fallow width and end near the steep ascent of the brangaledd hill it wa there that taran with all hast led the toil band of warrior the cauldronborn it seem to him had alreadi glimps them for

besid them rode mount huntsmen garb in heavi jacket of wolfskin the troop captain whose harsh command reach taran ear like the snap of a lash their order rang in a languag unknown to him but taran

the old warrior wa hasten farther along the wall taran cri out to him then in dismay realiz what coll had seen a band of cauldronborn had broken from the main forc and now strove to clamber through an

me onc were closer well turn asid and find a passag through the lower slope do you think im such a fool as to do otherwis achren smile contemptu in so do dwarf you would inde be a fool of all the peak surround annuvin mount dragon alon can be breach heed me she ad as taran murmur in disbelief the crag are lure and trap other have been deceiv and their bone lie in the pitfal the lower mountain
