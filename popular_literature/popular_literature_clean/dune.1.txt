and now we control it to a certain degre but the import thing is to consid all the hous that depend on choam profit and think of the enorm proport of those profit depend upon a singl product the spice imagin what would happen if someth should reduc spice product whoever had stockpil melang could make a kill paul said other would be out in the cold the duke permit himself a moment of grim satisfact look at hi son and think how penetr how truli educ that observ had been he nod the harkonnen have been stockpil for more than twenti year they mean spice product to fail and you to be blame they wish the atreid name to becom unpopular the duke said think of the landsraad hous that look to me for a certain amount of leadership their unoffici spokesman think how theyd react if i were respons for a

head start too much of a lead to overcom the emperor paul said that mean the sardaukar disguis in harkonnen liveri no doubt the duke said but the soldier fanat nonetheless how can fremen help us against sardaukar did hawat talk to you about salusa secundu the emperor prison planet no what if it were more than a prison planet paul there a question you never hear ask about the imperi corp of sardaukar where do they come from from the prison planet they come from somewher but the support levi the emperor demand from that what were led to believ theyr just the emperor levi train young and superbl you hear an occasion mutter about the emperor train cadr but the balanc of our civil remain the same the militari forc of the landsraad great hous on one side the sardaukar and their support levi on the other and their support levi paul the sardaukar remain the sardaukar but everi report on salusa secundu say ss is a hell world undoubtedli but if you were go to rais tough strong feroci

logic univers that make sens but the real univers is alway one step beyond logic from the say of muaddib by the princess irulan ive sat across from mani ruler of great hous but never seen a more gross and danger pig than thi one thufir hawat told himself you may speak plainli with me hawat the baron rumbl he lean back in hi suspensor chair the eye in their fold of fat bore into hawat the old mentat look down at the tabl between him and the baron vladimir harkonnen note the opul of it grain even thi wa a factor to consid in assess the baron as were the red wall of thi privat confer room and the faint sweet herb scent that hung on the air mask a deeper musk you didnt have me send that warn to rabban as an idl whim the baron said hawat leatheri old face remain impass betray none of the loath he felt i suspect mani thing my lord he said ye well i wish to know how arraki figur in your suspicion about salusa secundu it is not enough that you say to me the emperor is in a ferment about some associ between arraki and hi mysteri prison planet now i rush the warn out to rabban onli becaus the courier had to leav on that heighlin you said there could be no delay well and good but now i will have an explan he babbl too much hawat thought he not like leto who could tell me a thing with the lift of an eyebrow or the wave of a hand nor like the old duke who could express an entir sentenc in the way he accent a singl word thi is a clod destroy him will be a servic to mankind you will not leav here until ive had a full and complet explan the baron said you speak too casual of salusa secundu hawat said it a penal coloni the baron said the worst riffraff in the galaxi are sent to salusa secundu what els do we need to know that condit on the prison planet are more oppress than anywher els hawat said you hear that the mortal rate among new prison is higher than sixti per cent you hear that the emperor practic everi form of oppress there you hear all thi and do not ask question the emperor doesnt permit the great hous to inspect hi prison the baron growl but he hasnt seen into my dungeon either and curios about salusa secundu is ah hawat put a boni finger to hi lip discourag so he not proud of some of the thing he must do there hawat allow the faintest of smile to touch hi dark lip hi eye glint in the glowtub light as he stare at the baron and youv never wonder where the emperor get hi sardaukar the baron purs hi fat lip thi gave hi featur the look of a pout babi and hi voic carri a tone of petul as he said whi he recruit that is to say there are the levi and he enlist from faaa hawat snap the stori you hear about the exploit of the sardaukar theyr not rumor are they those are firsthand account from the limit number of survivor whove fought against the sardaukar eh the sardaukar are excel fight men no doubt of it the baron said but i think my own legion a pack of holiday excursionist by comparison hawat snarl you think i dont know whi the emperor turn against hous atreid thi is not a realm open to your specul the baron warn is it possibl that even he doesnt know what motiv the emperor in thi hawat ask himself ani area is open to my specul if it doe what youv hire me to do hawat said i am a mentat you do not withhold inform or comput line from a mentat for a long minut the baron stare at him then say what you must say mentat the padishah emperor turn against hous atreid becaus the duke warmast gurney halleck and duncan idaho had train a fight forc a small fight forc to within a hair as good as the sardaukar some of them were even better and the duke wa in a posit to enlarg hi forc to make it everi bit as strong as the emperor the baron weigh thi disclosur then what ha arraki to do with thi it provid a pool of recruit alreadi condit to the bitterest surviv train the baron shook hi head you can not mean the fremen i mean the fremen hah then whi warn rabban there can not be more than a hand of fremen left after the sardaukar pogrom and rabban oppress hawat continu to stare at him silent not more than a hand the baron repeat rabban kill six thousand of them last year alon still hawat stare at him and the year befor it wa nine thousand the baron said and befor they left the sardaukar mustv account for at least twenti thousand what are rabban troop loss for the past two year hawat ask the baron rub hi jowl well he ha been recruit rather heavili to be sure hi agent make rather extravag promis and shall we say thirti thousand in round number hawat ask that would seem a littl high the baron said quit the contrari hawat said i can read between the line of rabban report as well as you can and you certainli mustv understood my report from our agent arraki is a fierc planet the baron said storm loss can we both know the figur for storm accret hawat said what if he ha lost thirti thousand the baron demand and blood darken hi face by your own count hawat said he kill fifteen thousand over two year while lose twice that number you say the sardaukar account for anoth twenti thousand possibl a few more and ive seen the transport manifest for their return from arraki if they kill twenti thousand they lost almost five for one whi wont you face these figur baron and understand what they mean the baron spoke in a coldli measur cadenc thi is your job mentat what do they mean i gave you duncan idaho head count on the sietch he visit hawat said it all fit if they had just two hundr and fifti such sietch commun their popul would be about five million my best estim is that they had at least twice that mani commun you scatter your popul on such a planet ten million the baron jowl quiver with amaz at least the baron purs hi fat lip the beadi eye stare without waver at hawat is thi true mentat comput he wonder how could thi be and no one suspect we havent even cut heavili into their birthrategrowth figur hawat said weve just weed out some of their less success specimen leav the strong to grow stronger just like on salusa secundu salusa secundu the baron bark what ha thi to do with the emperor prison planet a man who surviv salusa secundu start out be tougher than most other hawat said when you add the veri best of militari train nonsens by your argument i could recruit from among the fremen after the way theyv been oppress by my nephew hawat spoke in a mild voic dont you oppress ani of your troop well i but oppress is a rel thing hawat said your fight men are much better off than those around them heh they see unpleas altern to be soldier of the baron heh the baron fell silent eye unfocus the possibl had rabban unwittingli given hous harkonnen it ultim weapon present he said how could you be sure of the loyalti of such recruit i would take them in small group not larger than platoon strength hawat said id remov them from their oppress situat and isol them with a train cadr of peopl who understood their background prefer peopl who had preced them from the same oppress situat then id fill them with the mystiqu that their planet had realli been a secret train ground to produc just such superior be as themselv and all the while id show them what such superior be could earn rich live beauti women fine mansion whatev they desir the baron began to nod the way the sardaukar live at home the recruit come to believ in time that such a place as salusa secundu is justifi becaus it produc them the elit the commonest sardaukar trooper live a life in mani respect as exalt as that of ani member of a great hous such an idea the baron whisper you begin to share my suspicion hawat said where did such a thing start the baron ask ah ye where did hous corrino origin were there peopl on salusa secundu befor the emperor sent hi first conting of prison there even the duke leto a cousin on the distaff side never knew for sure such question are not encourag the baron eye glaze with thought ye a veri care kept secret theyd use everi devic of besid what there to conceal hawat

solut to the arrakeen problem and i said the emperor prison planet inspir me to emul him witch blood hawat snap what did fenr say that when he began question me about you hawat sat back close hi eye in thought so that whi they start look into arraki he said well the thing done he open hi eye they must have spi all over arraki by now two year but certainli my innoc suggest that noth is innoc in an emperor eye what were your instruct to rabban mere that he should teach arraki to fear us hawat shook hi head you now have two altern baron you can kill off the nativ wipe them out entir or wast an entir work forc would you prefer to have the emperor and those great hous he can still swing behind him come in here and perform a curett scrape out giedi prime like a hollow gourd the baron studi hi mentat then he wouldnt dare wouldnt he the baron lip quiver what is your altern abandon your dear nephew rabban aband the baron broke off stare at hawat send him no more troop no aid of ani kind dont

that my weasel nephew isnt we still have our spi on arraki tell rabban he either meet the spice quota you set him or hell be replac i know my nephew the baron said thi would onli make him oppress the popul even more of cours he will hawat snap you dont want that stop now you mere want your own hand clean let rabban make your salusa secundu for you there no need even to send him ani prison he ha all the popul requir if rabban is drive hi peopl to meet your spice quota then the emperor need suspect no other motiv that reason enough for put the planet on the rack and you baron will not show by word or action that there ani other reason for thi the baron could not keep the sli tone of admir out of hi voic ah hawat you are a deviou one now how do we move into arraki and make use of what rabban prepar that the simplest thing of all baron if you set each year quota a bit higher than the one befor matter will soon reach a head there product will drop off you can remov rabban and take over yourself to correct the mess it fit the baron said but i can feel myself tire of all thi im prepar anoth to take over arraki for me hawat studi the fat round face across from him slowli the old soldierspi began to nod hi head feydrautha he said so that the reason for the oppress now your veri deviou yourself baron perhap we can incorpor these two scheme ye your feydrautha can go to arraki as their savior he can win the populac ye the baron smile and behind hi smile he ask himself now how doe thi fit in with hawat person scheme and hawat see that he wa dismiss aros and left the redwal room as he walk he could not put down the disturb unknown that crop into everi comput about arraki thi new religi leader that gurney halleck hint at from hi hide place among the smuggler thi muaddib perhap

deep into the windward face where the sand wa compact and would give maximum transmiss to the drum then he hesit review the lesson review the lifeanddeath necess that face him when he threw the latch the thumper would begin it summon across the sand a giant worm a maker would hear and come to the drum with the whiplik hookstaff paul knew he could mount the maker high curv back for as long as a forward edg of a worm ring segment wa held open by a hook open to admit abras sand into the more sensit interior the creatur would not retreat beneath the desert it would in fact roll it gigant bodi to bring the open segment as far away from the desert surfac as possibl i am a sandrid paul told himself he glanc down at the hook in hi left hand think that he had onli to shift those hook down the curv of a maker immens side to make the creatur roll and turn guid it where he will he had seen it done he had been help up the side of a worm for a short ride in train the captiv worm could be ridden until it lay exhaust and quiescent upon the desert surfac and a new maker must be summon onc he wa past thi test paul knew he wa qualifi to make the twentythump journey into the southland to rest and restor himself into the south where the women and the famili had been hidden from the pogrom among the new palmari and sietch warren he lift hi head and look to the south remind himself that the maker

hide beneath your cloak and becom a littl dune in your veri essenc slowli he scan the horizon listen watch for the sign he had been taught it came from the southeast a distant hiss a sandwhisp present he saw the faraway outlin of the creatur track against the dawnlight and realiz he had never befor seen a maker thi larg never heard of one thi size it appear to be more than half a leagu long and the rise of the sandwav at it crest head wa like the approach of a mountain thi is noth i have seen by vision or in life paul caution himself he hurri across the path of the thing to take hi stand caught up entir by the rush need of thi moment control the coinag and the court let the rabbl have the rest thu the padishah emperor advis you and he tell you if you want profit you must rule there is truth in these word but i ask myself who are the rabbl and who are the rule muaddib secret messag to the landsraad from arraki awaken by the princess irulan a thought came unbidden to jessica mind paul will

watch as hi command wa obey put it on the floor there he indic a place with hi foot clear the imperi rabbl back against the wall and let the harkonnen stand clear a flurri of robe scrape of feet lowvoic command and protest accompani obedi to paul command the guildsmen remain stand near the commun equip they frown at paul in obviou indecis theyr accustom to see the futur paul thought in thi place and time theyr blind even as i am and he sampl the timewind sens the turmoil the storm nexu that now focus on thi moment place even the faint gap were close now here wa the unborn jihad he knew here wa the race conscious that he had known onc as hi own terribl purpos here wa reason enough for a kwisatz haderach or a lisan algaib or even the halt scheme of the bene gesserit the race of human had felt it own dormanc sens itself grown stale and knew now onli the need to experi turmoil in which the gene would mingl and the strong new mixtur surviv all human were aliv as an unconsci singl organ in thi moment experienc a kind of sexual heat that could overrid ani barrier and paul saw how futil were ani effort of hi to chang ani smallest bit of thi he had thought to oppos the jihad within himself but the jihad would be hi legion would rage out from arraki even without him they need onli the legend he alreadi had becom he had shown them the way given them masteri even over the guild which must have the spice to exist a sens of failur pervad him and he saw through it that feydrautha harkonnen had slip out of the torn uniform strip down to a fight girdl with a mail core thi is the climax paul thought from here the futur will open the cloud part onto a kind of glori and if i die here theyll say i sacrif myself that my spirit might lead them and if i live theyll say noth can oppos muaddib is the atreid readi feydrautha call use the word of the ancient kanli ritual paul chose to answer him in the fremen way may thi knife chip and shatter he point to the emperor blade on the floor indic that feydrautha should advanc and take it keep hi attent on paul feydrautha pick up the knife balanc it a moment in hi hand to get the feel of it excit kindl in him thi wa a fight he had dream about man against man skill against skill with no shield interven he could see a way to power open befor him becaus the emperor sure would reward whoever kill thi troublesom duke the reward might even be that haughti daughter and a share of the throne and thi yokel duke thi backworld adventur could not possibl be a match for a harkonnen train in everi devic and everi treacheri by a thousand arena combat and the yokel had no way of know he face more weapon than a knife here let us see if your proof against poison feydrautha thought he salut paul with the emperor blade said meet your death fool shall we fight cousin paul ask and he catfoot forward eye on the wait blade hi bodi crouch low with hi own milkwhit crysknif point out as though an extens of hi arm they circl each other bare feet grate on the floor watch with eye intent for the slightest open how beauti you danc feydrautha said he a talker paul thought there anoth weak he grow uneasi in the face of silenc have you been shriven feydrautha ask still paul circl in silenc and the old reverend mother watch the fight from the press of the emperor suit felt herself trembl the atreid youth had call the harkonnen

woman and the splendor of love riot and comedi are but symptom of the time profoundli reveal they betray the psycholog tone the deep uncertainti and the strive for someth better plu the fear that noth would come of it all the major dam against anarchi in these time were the embryo guild the bene gesserit and the landsraad which continu it year record of meet in spite of the severest obstacl the guild part appear clear they gave free transport for all landsraad and cet busi the bene gesserit role is more obscur certainli thi is the time in which they consolid their hold upon the sorceress explor the subtl narcot develop pranabindu train and conceiv the missionaria protectiva that black arm of superstit but it is also the period that saw the compos of the litani against fear and the assembl of the azhar book that bibliograph marvel that preserv the great secret of the most ancient faith ingsley comment is perhap the onli one possibl those were time of deep paradox for almost seven year then cet labor and as their seventh anniversari approach they prepar the human univers for a moment announc on that seventh anniversari they unveil the orang cathol bibl here is a work with digniti and mean they said here is a way to make human awar of itself as a total creation of god the men of cet were liken to archeologist of idea inspir by god in the grandeur of rediscoveri it wa said they had brought to light the vital of great ideal overlaid by the deposit of centuri that they had sharpen the moral imper that come out of a religi conscienc with the oc bibl cet present the liturg manual and the commentari in mani respect a more remark work not onli becaus of it breviti less than half the size of the oc bibl but also becaus of it candor and blend of selfpiti and selfright the begin is an obviou appeal to the agnost ruler men find no answer to the sunnan the ten thousand religi question from the shariah now appli their own reason all men seek to be enlighten religion is but the most ancient and honor way in which men have striven to make sens out of god univers scientist seek the law of event it is the task of religion to fit man into thi law in their conclus though the commentari set a harsh tone that veri like foretold their fate much that wa call religion ha carri an unconsci attitud of hostil toward life true religion must teach that life is fill with joy pleas to the eye of god that knowledg without action is empti all men must see that the teach of religion by rule and rote is larg a hoax the proper teach is recogn with eas you can know it without fail becaus it awaken within you that sensat which tell you thi is someth youv alway known there wa an odd sens of calm as the press and shigawir imprint roll and the oc bibl spread out through the world some interpret thi as a sign from god an omen of uniti but even the cet deleg betray the fiction of that calm as they return to their respect congreg eighteen of them were lynch within two month fiftythre recant within the year the oc bibl wa denounc as a work produc by the hubri of reason it wa said that it page were fill with a seduct interest in logic revis that cater to popular bigotri began appear these revis lean on accept symbol cross crescent feather rattl the twelv saint the thin buddha and the like and it soon becam appar that the ancient superstit and belief had not been absorb by the new ecumen halloway label for cet sevenyear effort galactophas determin wa snap up by eager billion who interpret the initi gd as goddamn cet chairman tour bomoko an ulema of the zensunni and one of the fourteen deleg who never recant the fourteen sage of popular histori appear to admit final the cet had er we shouldnt have tri to creat new symbol he said we shouldv realiz we werent suppos to introduc uncertainti into accept belief that we werent suppos to stir up curios about god we are daili confront by the terrifi instabl of all thing human yet we permit our religion to grow more rigid and control more conform and oppress what is thi shadow across the highway of divin command it is a warn that institut endur that symbol endur when their mean is lost that there is no summa of all attain knowledg the bitter doubl edg in thi admiss did not escap bomoko critic and he wa forc soon afterward to flee into exil hi life depend upon the guild pledg of secreci he reportedli die on tupil honor and belov hi last word religion must remain an outlet for peopl who say to themselv i am not the kind of person i want to be it must never sink into an assemblag of the selfsatisfi it is pleasant to think that bomoko understood the propheci in hi word institut endur nineti gener later the oc bibl and the commentari permeat the religi univers when paulmuaddib stood with hi right hand on the rock shrine enclos hi father skull the right hand of the bless not the left hand of the damn he quot word for word from bomoko legaci you who have defeat us say to yourselv that babylon is fallen and it work have been overturn i say to you still that man remain on trial each man in hi own dock each man is a littl war the fremen said of muaddib that he wa like abu zide whose frigat defi the guild and rode one day there and back there use in thi way translat directli from the fremen mytholog as the land of the ruhspirit the alam almith where all limit are remov the parallel between thi and the kwisatz haderach is readili seen the kwisatz haderach that the sisterhood sought through it breed program wa interpret as the shorten of the way or the one who can be two place simultan but both of these interpret can be shown to stem directli from the commentari when law and religi duti are one your selfdom enclos the univers of himself muaddib said i am a net in the sea of time free to sweep futur and past i am a move membran from whom no possibl can escap these thought are all one and the same and they harken to kalima in the oc bibl where it say whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and ha power of realiti it is when we get into muaddib own commentari in the pillar of the univers as interpret by hi holi men the qizara tafwid that we see hi real debt to cet and fremenzensunni muaddib law and duti are one so be it but rememb these limit thu are you never fulli selfconsci thu do you remain immers in the commun tau thu are you alway less than an individu oc bibl ident word revel muaddib religion often partak of the myth of progress that shield us from the terror of an uncertain futur cet commentari ident word the azhar

for not predict and prevent that troubl oc bibl ani sin can be ascrib at least in part to a natur bad tendenc that is an extenu circumst accept to god the azhar book trace thi to the ancient semit

muaddib arriv is call religi time by koneywel but time had littl to do with it as muaddib himself said i am here so it is howev vital to an understand of muaddib religi impact that you never lose sight of one fact the fremen were a desert peopl whose entir ancestri wa accustom to hostil landscap mystic isnt difficult when you surviv each second by surmount open hostil you are there so with such a tradit suffer is accept perhap as unconsci punish but accept and it well to note that fremen ritual give almost complet freedom from guilt feel thi isnt necessarili becaus their law and religion were ident make disobedi a sin it like closer to the mark to say they cleans themselv of guilt easili becaus their everyday exist requir brutal judgment often deadli which in a softer land would burden men with unbear guilt thi is like one of the root of fremen emphasi on superstit disregard the missionaria protectiva ministr what matter that whistl sand are an omen what matter that you must make the sign of the fist when first you see first moon a man flesh is hi own and hi water belong to the tribe and the mysteri of life isnt a problem to solv but a realiti to experi omen help you rememb thi and becaus you are here becaus you have the religion victori can not evad you in the end as the bene gesserit taught for centuri long befor they ran afoul of the fremen when religion and polit ride the same cart when that cart is driven by a live holi man baraka noth can stand in their path appendix iii report on bene gesserit motiv and purpos here follow an excerpt from the summa prepar by her own agent at the request of the ladi jessica immedi after the arraki affair the candor of thi report amplifi it valu far beyond the ordinari becaus the bene gesserit oper for centuri behind the blind of a semimyst school while carri on their select breed program among human we tend to award them with more statu than they appear to deserv analysi of their trial of fact on the arraki affair betray the school profound ignor of it own role it may be argu that the bene gesserit could examin onli such fact as were avail to them and had no direct access to the person of the prophet muaddib but the school had surmount greater obstacl and it error here goe deeper the bene gesserit program had as it target the breed of a person they label kwisatz haderach a term signifi one who can be mani place at onc in simpler term what they sought wa a human with mental power permit him to understand and use higher order dimens they were breed for a supermentat a human comput with some of the prescient abil found in guild navig now attend these fact care muaddib born paul atreid wa the son of the duke leto a man whose bloodlin had been watch care for more than a thousand year the prophet mother ladi jessica wa a natur daughter of the baron vladimir harkonnen and carri genemark whose suprem import to the breed program wa known for almost two thousand year she wa a bene gesserit bred and train and should have been a will tool of the project the ladi jessica wa order to produc an atreid daughter the plan wa to inbre thi daughter with feydrautha harkonnen a nephew of the baron vladimir with the high probabl of a kwisatz haderach from that union instead for reason she confess have never been complet clear to her the concubin ladi jessica defi her order and bore a son thi alon should have alert the bene gesserit to the possibl that a wild variabl had enter their scheme but there were other far more import indic that they virtual ignor as a youth paul atreid show abil to predict the futur he wa known to have had prescient vision that were accur penetr and defi fourdimension explan the reverend mother gaiu helen mohiam bene gesserit proctor who test paul human when he wa fifteen depos that he surmount more agoni in the test than ani other human of record yet she fail to make special note of thi in her report when famili atreid move to the planet arraki the fremen popul there hail the young paul as a prophet the voic from the outer world the bene gesserit were well awar that the rigor of such a planet as arraki with it total of desert landscap it absolut lack of open water it emphasi on the most primit necess for surviv inevit produc a high proport of sensit yet thi fremen reaction and the obviou element of the arrakeen diet high in spice were gloss over by bene gesserit observ when the harkonnen and the soldierfanat of the padishah emperor reoccupi arraki kill paul father and most of the atreid troop paul and hi mother disappear but almost immedi there were report of a new religi leader among the fremen a man call muaddib who again wa hail as the voic from the outer world the report state clearli that he wa accompani by a new reverend mother of the sayyadina rite who is the woman who bore him record avail to the bene gesserit state in plain term that the fremen legend of the prophet contain these word he shall be born of a bene gesserit witch it may be argu here that the bene gesserit sent their missionaria protectiva onto arraki centuri earlier to implant someth like thi legend as safeguard should ani member of the school be trap there and requir sanctuari and that thi legend of the voic from the outer world wa properli to be ignor becaus it appear to be the standard bene gesserit ruse but thi would be true onli if you grant that the bene gesserit were correct in ignor the other clue about paulmuaddib when the arraki affair boil up the space guild made overtur to the bene gesserit the guild hint that it navig who use the spice drug of arraki to produc the limit prescienc necessari for guid spaceship through the void were bother about the futur or saw problem on the horizon thi could onli mean they saw a nexu a meet place of countless delic decis beyond which the path wa hidden from the prescient eye thi wa a clear indic that some agenc wa interf with higher order dimens a few of the bene gesserit had long been awar that the guild could not interfer directli with the vital spice sourc becaus guild navig alreadi were deal in their own inept way with higher order dimens at least to the point where they recogn that the slightest misstep they made on arraki could be catastroph it wa a known fact that guild navig could predict no way to take control of the spice without produc just such a nexu the obviou conclus wa that someon of higher order power wa take control of the spice sourc yet the bene gesserit miss thi point entir in the face of these fact one is led to the inescap conclus that the ineffici bene gesserit behavior in thi affair wa a product of an even higher plan of which they were complet unawar appendix iv the almanak enashraf select excerpt of the nobl hous shaddam iv the
